**RAY PEAT:** I still tend to think that there are slight differences from the structure of language. There's a linguist at Stanford who is the contemporary Orphean apologist. I think that can be seen in the difference between English and German, for example, and between, say, Chinese and Hindi. It has reduced the superstructure of grammatical form and depends greatly on context. I think that there's a noticeable difference between English and the older European languages with more context dependence in English grammar.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie was asking about what made certain parts of the world amenable to contradictory ideas, suggesting it might be how people saw reality or the structure of language.

**RAY PEAT:** The thing I liked about him was that he numbered his paragraphs instead of trying to make a grand argument that progressed logically. He simply made statements and numbered them because he believed that every statement implies a metaphysical surrounding. I had been studying Bertrand Russell and the linguistic philosophers who I saw as being a way not Russell, but the people who followed him and called themselves the language philosophers like John Wisdom I saw them as trying to sneak in the old Platonism entities logical atomism for example, which was Russell's word for it. Wittgenstein blew that up and showed somewhat a resonance with the old Leibniz, a universe being implied in every statement or every event implying the surrounding context.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie brought up Ludwig Wittgenstein and his approach to philosophy.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but when you try to work out the implications of there is no private language, you're always guessing statistically. That you're understanding that the other person, if you can't remember for sure that your own language is consistent and testable, when you look at the other person, you're just making a statistically sounder guess. There's no essential difference between shared language and the private language once you realize that they all depend on memory and interpretation.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie mentioned Wittgenstein's idea that there's no such thing as private language.

**RAY PEAT:** It's the physiological present of matter and the info is the matter itself that hasn't been incorporated into our perspective.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked what knowledge is if it's not matter, referencing a discussion about Lenin's ideas on knowledge and matter.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a living matter and it's always open to living a new phase and that openness to ________________. New life is matter, and ________________ is all we can say about matter. It's not denying the materiality, it's saying that this is the living matter that is our consciousness and that's like there's an internal fountain in effect. It's always going on, going ahead, becoming something else and that's the nature of matter that it's creating this constant flow of knowledge.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if knowledge is the structure of matter that we incorporate into ourselves.

**RAY PEAT:** It's some trace in our facial muscles, viscera, posture. We've worked through a series of reinventions, finding these pictures, which are arrangements of excitations, but we don't go straight to a picture. We work by inference and traces to reconstruct it. So every time we bring up the past, we're creating a new past.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked where knowledge is if it's not stored, and what the physiological process of accessing a memory looks like.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's always new, newly experienced. The idea that something is stored becomes part of that Platonist idea that it ends up saying that atoms are timeless entities and can be accurately described only by changeless units of logic. You can't let change into the system if you're in that logical atomism range all the way to Platonism. Reductionism is denying that atoms have a history, for example. The memory as reconstruction is that we're like a whirlwind of consciousness, but the shape of our individual whirlwind is always ongoing, but it is moving ahead with some degree of deduction from our previous states and looking back it's like reverse deduction to reconstruct that we must have experienced that being where we are.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if remembering is partially recreating the memory.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we're an animal experiencing a unique nature around it or people is aware of its needs and hopes. And also, any fears that it has, it interprets particular objects or processes as either hopeful or fearsome, otherwise it's in the process of going through the present situation with the intention of finding the realization of what it was. People's culture has piled up beliefs and stories that complicate that so that we don't see ourselves as surrounded by ouselves. Future future and and dangers future possibilities and threats and i think anytime you're going to get back on the track of realizing yourself the. The the larger intention that the thing that religious people feel as. Some kind of overarching meaning for the animal the human hopefully biologically amplified animal doing things that some animals can't do by by our energy amplification we can have the animal intentionality. Encompassing future possibilities on a transpersonal scale, seeing the need for the ecosystem and for the society, for other individuals, even for different kinds of organisms, taking responsibility in a straight line with yourself, feeling that you are responsible for all of the stuff around you, that you see it all as hopeful, moving towards the future, and don't have any of these cultural kinks that say, I own this, or I have to destroy this to do this, and so on. You try to picture overarching a series of meanings so that everything can get into a better future.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked Ray Peat to elaborate on his statement about starting and ending with being an animal and animal reality.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I see Kropotkin blending in with Vernadsky. Vernadsky is saying that the flow of energy from the Sun into the Earth is trying, the substance responding to that flow of energy is creating a living structural system that is assimilating and accumulating the energy from the Sun into the Earth. Interactions of the different levels of the ecosystem permitting the optimizing the metabolism of the big animal developing a big brain and doing the things that are appropriate, like animals tearing through the jungle are improving the fertility of the system. Not damaging it, like Alan Savery, his rough idea is compatible with Pernadsky, that the big animals are a big part of the ecosystems that they develop in and they are pulling, helping to pull the whole ecosystem forward. Because they are such massive energy dissipating structures.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if an amplified rate of metabolism coexists with a sense of solidarity with other humans or mutual aid, referencing Kropotkin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I don't see it as being strictly second. The first signal system P.K. Anokhin, who was a colleague younger than Pavlov, developed the picture of the consciousness in this unified sense. He called it the acceptor of action, which you can't really separate the orienting reflex or the dominant concept. From the acceptor of action, it's the present state of the organism in a pictorial space-filling model of the world. The second signal system in Pavlov's term is the third signal system gets its structure by acting as names for structures in this acceptor of action, like you have a little three-dimensional holographic movie going on with your intentions cycling through this movie model of the world. The words, the second signal system attaches to these, each part of the model of the world has a naming relationship, marks or angles referred to it as a name of a ghost. The end is near. The language system gets its structure exclusively from this pictorial model of the world, the acceptor of action.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if Ray Peat was referring to Pavlov's ideas of the first and second signal systems when talking about being an animal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I did when I was in studying psychology at the university, I did a survey asking people how they dreamed as well as their waking thought processes. And I found that there were people who never, who didn't know what it was to dream in pictures. They said a dream was like listening to someone tell a story. And those people were, on a scale of creativity, they would be absolute zero. They followed verbal rules. Somehow they could talk to people and seem to communicate in English, but they had no ability to think. With any innovation, it was only what could be said in a familiar way, and when your acceptor of action is de-energized, it tends to disappear, leaving just these solidified units of language. You can't learn a language without having some fluidity in this model of the world, but by the age of six or seven, people are often losing enough biological energy that they start seeing reality in terms of only the cliches that they can say.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the connection between intuition, analytical thought, and the emphasis on the second signal system in authoritarian minds.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can see, biological decline. I looked at the birth weight of different nations and the head size. And for much of the 19th and 20th century, birth weights and brain sizes were increasing steadily. 1980, several countries and an actual shrinkage of brain size, or a growth in height with no growth in, in brain from generation from decade to decade. So the cultural imposition really is literally shrinking people's brains now.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about personal responsibility and the destruction of the individual by culture, referencing vaccines and societal decline.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. And aspirin happens to be an antiviral agent in itself, antibacterial and antiviral. There was a study I think around Washington D.C. that tested it on AIDS patients. Just big doses of aspirin and it was working but no one was interested. I live in D.C. and I met one of the people who were involved in the study and he refuses to talk about it. Basically the statement was the question is too political and I said well I've seen the study. You guys claim that it was terminated because there was a rise in the levels of the liver enzymes in the aspirin group. He said, yeah, that was the official story, but that's not why it was stopped. And when I asked why it was stopped, he said, it's way above my pay grade.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if taking aspirin and niacinamide could reduce the risk of viral infection.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that whole subject of polyunsaturated fats, it's worse than any organized crime campaign. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats are gigantic criminal businesses, and the omega minus three fats are especially powerful in immune suppression, but they market that as being anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if the presence of polyunsaturated fats in the blood would increase susceptibility to viruses, referencing older studies.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. And aspirin happens to be an antiviral agent in itself, antibacterial and antiviral. There was a study I think around Washington D.C. that tested it on AIDS patients. Just big doses of aspirin and it was working but no one was interested. I live in D.C. and I met one of the people who were involved in the study and he refuses to talk about it.

And when I asked why it was stopped, he said, it's way above my pay grade.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if aspirin and niacinamide could reduce the risk of viral infection.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that whole subject of polyunsaturated fats, it's worse than any organized crime campaign. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats are gigantic criminal businesses, and the omega minus three fats are especially powerful in immune suppression, but they market that as being anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the role of polyunsaturated fats in viral susceptibility.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. And aspirin happens to be an antiviral agent in itself, antibacterial and antiviral. There was a study I think around Washington D.C. that tested it on AIDS patients. Just big doses of aspirin and it was working but no one was interested. I live in D.C. and I met one of the people who were involved in the study and he refuses to talk about it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that whole subject of polyunsaturated fats, it's worse than any organized crime campaign. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats are gigantic criminal businesses, and the omega minus three fats are especially powerful in immune suppression, but they market that as being anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the role of polyunsaturated fats in viral susceptibility.

**RAY PEAT:** Immunodeficiency is a big thing apart from any virus. Sepsis. Has been growing along with other degenerative diseases but young people never used to get sepsis practically but now sepsis is affecting younger and younger people in bigger numbers and I think it's largely the stress cumulative effects on PUFA.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the connection between PUFA and sepsis.

**RAY PEAT:** It sounds very much like a Nazi program. It doesn't have any convincing weight for me. It just makes me fear the people that say we're a herd that has to be treated one way or another.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the idea of herd immunity and its origins.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, one guy was routed out of bed to go on a forced march and collapsed while marching and died shortly after. And he was diagnosed as having swine flu. He was the only death acknowledged by the head of the CDC from swine flu. But I forget the exact number, but there were thousands of paralytic reactions. And I think it was around 300 deaths from the vaccine, so hundreds of times worse than the disease.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie mentioned the movie "Vaxxed" and its discussion of the swine flu vaccine.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, I wanted to mention something about HIV. Dr. Pete may have seen that study. I think it came out around 2014. Of course, didn't hit mainstream media, but it showed that at least the authors claim that you cannot develop AIDS if you're HIV positive, so you cannot develop AIDS unless there's high levels of endotoxin in your blood. And then there was a subsequent study in 2018 which showed that the single most reliable predictor of death of all cause mortality in HIV positive people was the level of this protein called soluble CD14, it's abbreviated SCD14, and that is the most reliable biomarker of endotoxin levels in the blood. And for some reason I never see virologists talk about the role of endotoxin in viral disease and multi-organ failure and in septic shock, while in reality it seems like all of these things are directly caused by endotoxin.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about a study suggesting that endotoxin is necessary for developing AIDS and its role in mortality.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I'm inclined to think that even cancer... is largely an endotoxin problem. Chronic, year after year, bad food irritating the intestine causing increased histamine and serotonin and estrogen, but a constant stream of endotoxin flowing through the system, shaking up chromosomes, creating inflammation, fatiguing the repair systems. Finally, when the repair systems are down to a certain extent, the cancers that are constantly popping up stop being removed. If you don't die of acute sepsis, then heart disease and cancer, I think, are the result of chronic exposure to the endotoxin.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the role of endotoxin in viral disease and multi-organ failure, and Ray Peat extended this to cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. When I mentioned the idea of systemic disease to cancer doctors or patients, they really have a hard time, just can't grasp, they've been so indoctrinated with the idea that it's a clone that develops, one single mutant cell develops into the clone, and so it's by definition the most localized thing conceivable. It's platonically localized. But way back 80, 80 or 90 years, people have been seeing precancerous gradations surrounding any tumor. If you look at all of the signs of stem cell signals, all of the inflammatory cytokines, disturbed chromosome balance, all of those things are increased in a gradient. The field concept of cancer goes way back 200 years almost, but it just hasn't been acceptable because of this platinistic genetic determinism, clonal descent of each tumor.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if the localized nature of cancer is due to the organ being the most energetically compromised.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you know lactic acid creates a reduced state, shifts the balance towards increased sulfhydryl, NADH ratio to NAD, and all of the electronic and energetic properties of cancer are initiated just by putting a lot of lactic acid into the system.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie mentioned a study suggesting metabolic disturbances and lactic acid precede genomic abnormalities in cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I don't know of any case where it doesn't.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if estrogen, being a powerful reductant, contributes to cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** As part of my understanding of what I'm doing here in the world, checking ideas and looking for new perspectives. Checking what people believe and trying to avoid the bad interpretations that lead to bad actions and results, it's always part of the same process of looking for something to do.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked Ray Peat why he does what he does.

**RAY PEAT:** There are two simple choices. One, that the genes have been laid out, have created a blueprint for creating the structures, and all the energy has to do is help to roll those out, and once they're in place, just to keep them running. I think that orientation leads to the idea that the less you live, the longer you will live, the idea that you're going to burn, burn up your, the whole apparatus will wear out the faster you use it, that all comes from the reductionist idea of a machine laid out in genetic blueprints. It's a machine powered by a Rube Goldberg system, which is 20th century science. And the other picture is the developmental picture that energy flowing from the sun through the atmosphere is creating structures that the flow of energy itself generates structures and the faster the energy flows, the more complex the structure becomes and the more energy is saved in the system in the form of complexity of structure. And the efficiency ____________________ increases, but the waste is part of what is powering it. You don't have to think in terms of the efficiency of the system because the energy flowing through the system, even though the oxidative apparatus is getting more efficient, you're building a bigger system. Faster than the complexity and efficiency accumulates, so it's the speed with which you can waste the energy while responding to it, building your complexity that is holding up the whole structure. It's simply a picture of an ecosystem. Responding physically to energy, it doesn't violate any of the known physical laws, it uses them in more intelligent ways than the Rube Goldberg science of membranes, genes and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked for Ray Peat's general hypothesis on what maintains health and what differentiates it from sickness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even earlier, J.C. Bose was one of my first inspirations.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if Ray Peat's inspirations included scientists like Szent-Györgyi, Otto Warburg, and Koch.

**RAY PEAT:** I think a good intrauterine environment is a tremendous part of it. Like Catherine Adalton's patients, the older kids of her patients. Had 95 average IQ, and just by treating the mothers with progesterone, her patients' kids have something like 135 average IQ, same mother, but better nourishment in utero. And that kind of a head start gives you a lot of energy for absorbing shocks from the oppressive environment.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if openness to new ideas in scientists was enabled by faster metabolism or childhood experiences.

**RAY PEAT:** Basically they don't have the energy to meet the demands of the world so they're retreating and hoping that they'll recover and then they'll come back. Usually there's something specific that has happened, they've eaten something or caught an infection, got poisoned and retreat and let the body repair itself. But Paracelsus was one of the first people to put it into practice. Paracelsus' pharmacological preparation on the sword that caused the wound and spared the patient the medication and discovered that patients recovered much better without the medication. Anytime there's been an opportunity to compare medicated people with unmedicated, the ones without medicine are much healthier. Like animals, we could just take a week or two to retreat and maybe have a milkshake now and then. People would be much healthier, more likely to survive to old age.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if sick organisms retreating and limiting their activity is a pathological choice or beneficial in the short term.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are people who do that, but they need new opportunities, and the culture isn't rushing to give them healthy, new, interesting opportunities. In many cases, they retreated because their doctor told them to. You know, they say stay in your room and until I call you and until it's okay to get out.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if chronic isolation becomes pathological over time.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think Trump theoretically had that in mind. a controlled collapse of the empire, withdrawing the army more or less quickly. But the imperialists in the military, for example, don't want to lose their power. But if Bernie could actually run against him, I think between them, they would die. They would possibly recruit more supporters for bringing the empire down fairly quickly.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if Ray Peat saw a way forward with the current political system, referencing Trump and Bernie Sanders.

**RAY PEAT:** If you freed up the Pentagon budget … for example, 90% of it putting the U.S. on a scale with other big countries … that amount of money removed from military destruction could far more than finance any kind of Bernie Sanders programs, free college.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked what bringing down the empire would entail.

**RAY PEAT:** The Armageddon crowd was in Reagan's government too. The Interior Minister said, the end is near, let's mine it all, get it before the end. Well, that really seems to be the premise they're all operating on, is that the end is coming soon and nothing matters, you know, so that's why maybe that validates endless war and things like that, so.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about people like Pompeo and their motivations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, that's why I emphasize biology and health thinking to get people to realize that they're dying on this path and that they have to change something radically. Simply save their own health, they've got to change the system, which is pumping, it isn't carbon dioxide, it's a thousand different toxins being pumped into the atmosphere and food supply that is killing people, vaccines and fake foods, I think. The movie VAXED and the various movements against genetically modified food and so on, that's a wedge that people can start to see their own survival and their children, depending on bringing this industrial system. To some kind of a safe conclusion.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if things needed to be improved before radical social change could take hold.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's at the heart of preventing organization. In the 1930s, there was a religious movement called moral rearmament. That organization still exists, but it was a Christian movement. A movement with branches still in this country and in Europe, religious reasons why you should destroy unions, but it applies to any kind of social progress, making change that impinges on the corporations and banks.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if the cultural push towards extreme individualism in the Western world was a veiled attempt at implementing isolation to prevent organization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CIA and FBI are several stages ahead of everyone organizing. Anything you think of, they've got it covered. Like Occupy Wall Street, they put organizers in who helped to prevent any constructive organizational outcome. But they had snipers on the roofs ready to kill the leaders if anyone organized something that actually led to action.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the choice between organizing and the risk of groups being undermined, or avoiding participation and lacking power.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it will change as cultural ideas evolve, but I think the first thing is to just start lots of organizations, two or three people in a group deciding on possible courses of action and creating networks of just little personal interaction groups. But linking them up and being aware that the organizations have to stay flexible in terms of basically about a million little groups with openness to interact with other groups at different levels. So basically create a large number of smaller organizations that will be much harder to subvert just because the FBI doesn't have that manpower that much manpower.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if there was a middle ground or if it depended on the situation regarding organizing.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they've had I don't know maybe a million people attending to breaking up organizations but if you have two million little groups developing it will overwhelm their their manpower. Advantage, like the communists used to say that for every actual communist party member, there were two or three FBI agents. Promoting domestic terror and stuff or getting people to do things. They otherwise wouldn't do like What was that famous quote that like the FBI is behind most terrorist attacks in the US or something like that?

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the FBI's role in disrupting organizations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but that has been documented over and over the people throwing rocks in Demonstrations are usually local police or FBI. What was it the Ferguson rap was am I thinking of the right place? but there provocateurs like breaking windows and they were flown in on planes to go like cause havoc during peaceful protests and stuff so yeah yeah and like in the ukraine there was oh yeah snipers i was shooting both sides and then people are so politically charged that they can't kind of see the force for the trees and then so it's like this bad ideology on top of the the corruption and the infiltration of both sides.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie mentioned provocateurs at protests.

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. I formulated it that way. 1957, I think, was the first time I said consciousness is the organized flow of... is energy through matter, but I have revised it to think of consciousness as a substance in itself. Since substances are defined empirically, matter is defined empirically as we experience it, I think it's proper to think of consciousness as a substance. For example, the donor acceptor molecules contributing an electron flowing through muscle causes it to contract. I think that same donor acceptor relationship activates a constant oscillation of excited electrons through the neurons and between the neurons even that these it's a substance analogous to the conductive electron bands in metal but it's the electrons are existing on the soft cytoplasmic material when the energy is properly activated by the oxidative acceptor function, raising electrons, creating holes basically for electrons to flow through the properly oxidized substance. It's like having a fire get wet when you have too many electrons. It fills the holes and prevents the luminous function, the perfume guy, I can't think of his name right now... Tonini? Was it Tonini or no? No. It starts with a T, T I think. Yeah. Anyway, he sees odors as being resonant. Not the shape of the molecule, but the electronic ability to resonate. Going back to P.K. Anokhin, for example, I think he saw his acceptor of action consciousness model as Existing as an excited electron substance, which follows the rules of Gestalt psychology, actually space filling material of electron, sort of a plasma, actually being what we experience the light that we experience as red, white, blue, green, and so on. I think there is actually that frequency resonating in our brain tissue, an odor, I believe the actual chemical pattern of that odor is what we experience. The consciousness of smelling a chemical, that structure exists in space and each of the senses, I think, involves the certain frequency or energy level of the electrons so that touch has a limited spatial ability, the vision is the one that tends to be coherent, forming complexly coherent structures of meaning.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about Ray Peat's statement that consciousness is the orienting reflex and how it relates to the idea of consciousness as a fundamental property of matter.

**RAY PEAT:** He has various arguments showing that ________________ much more information is carried per second than nerve firing could possibly account for. So it isn't information, it's actually the substance that we are experiencing.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie mentioned P.K. Anokhin's work suggesting that nerve firing alone cannot account for the richness of experience.

**RAY PEAT:** So you could perceive Mozart or Beethoven almost at the level of descriptive, rational listening, or you could have a full energy flow, like a high-fi consciousness, where everything, all of the senses are resonating full intensity. So basically the range of frequencies that the brain is capable of producing is limited, but their combination is infinite. So that's what... OK. The auditory frequencies are... we're actually transmitting the full range of frequencies. And a young person can actually experience all the way up to 35,000 or 40,000 cycles per second, like a porpoise. And those are actually tuned processes of the electrons resonating at those actual frequencies. And the frequencies of nerve firing are nothing really related to consciousness. They are like the infrastructure maintaining energy production and substance distribution. But the experience is floating over the infrastructure.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the infinite richness of experience and qualia.

**RAY PEAT:** So if two people are resonating, so to speak, if their consciousness are resonating and almost merging in a sense, is there a limit to the distance that these people can be separated with in order for this to occur? Or is this like a global universal phenomenon, no matter where these consciousness capable pieces of matter are?

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about Rupert Sheldrake's ideas on morphogenetic fields and resonance between consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Schumann resonance frequencies could potentially be those carrier waves that allow for the unification of consciousness of organisms on earth?

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if Schumann resonance frequencies could be carrier waves for the unification of consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. And he was basically saying that there's two kinds of order, the implicated order and the explicated order, and then the explicated order arises out of the infinite implicated order in a creative manner, right? And we've talked about this process of constant creation of both matter and meaning and knowledge. How do we participate in this creative process? Because... Do we also create matter ourselves? I mean, I know the Earth does, the stars do, right? And probably the ethereal medium of the universe itself does, but how do we participate in that creative process?

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about David Bohm's ideas on universal consciousness and how humans participate in the creative process.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know. David Baum was of the opinion that we are integral to the creative process of the universe, but unfortunately he didn't elaborate how. Yeah, I intuit that that's true, but I don't know how either, but I think it is most closely connected to this electronic jelly substance of consciousness or whatever is flowing through any substance according to its structure.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about participating in the universe's creative process, referencing David Bohm.

**RAY PEAT:** My best guess is that Horace Dudley was right. He described it as the neutrino sea. At that time, neutrinos were thought to have no energy, but he proposed that they do have energy and that they associate with matter according to its mass and that nuclear, so-called nuclear energy is converting, in conventional thinking, converting mass to energy or in this view, it simply being through time, passing through time as a mass that allows these......neutrinos to interact and crystals, Horace Dudley suggested that the crystalline structure of matter was, in some way, in charge of how the neutrinos resonate, that there's a space filling. Resonance of neutrinos corresponding to the orderly arrangement of crystals that he suggested could cause nuclear reactions to occur unpredicted. Simultaneously with his proposing that theory, an experimental physicist named Anderson observed that a monolayer of carbon ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ ______ __________ isotopes on aluminum foil had a non-random nuclear decay that Dudley had predicted that sort of thing that an orderly arrangement of matter such as a surface would interact with the neutrino sea in a way that would draw on the energy of the nucleus. But anyway, my inference from those two bits of data is that the brain, this structure of donor-acceptor activated gel of electrons. My idea is that this structure of the brain is like the surface of the aluminum foil, able to tap into the energy of the neutrino C. This is where the introduction of novelty as well as energy comes from.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked about the physical entity of time, referencing Kozirev's experiments and Horace Dudley's neutrino sea theory.

**RAY PEAT:** Sounds right.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if Aristotle's definition of time as the amount of potentiality converted to actuality for a system sounded correct.

**RAY PEAT:** I would think a galaxy, the streaming shape creating forces of galaxies are probably conscious. There's no more streaming. Energy through matter than the galaxy in action, but I think our brains are rivaling the galaxies for the complexity of activated substance that we're trying to imitate the galaxy energy with actual physical creation of substance.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie asked if stars, having intense metabolism, possess a type of consciousness, perhaps higher than ours.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.

**CONTEXT:** Georgie mentioned Aristotle's classification of pure actualities, including humans and galaxies.

**RAY PEAT:** You can email raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com and see if you can have people come up with ideas and create new organizations.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat was asked how people can obtain his newsletter and encouraged to have people come up with ideas and create new organizations.
