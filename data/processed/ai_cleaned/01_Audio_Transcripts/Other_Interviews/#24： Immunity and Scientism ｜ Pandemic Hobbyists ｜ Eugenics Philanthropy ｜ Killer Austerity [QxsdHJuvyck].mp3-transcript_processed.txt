**RAY PEAT:** The commission on defense preparations using artificial intelligence said that at the rate the Chinese economy has been growing, the world will be a standard on Chinese production, development of artificial automation, automatic factories, and the US for various reasons would not be able to keep up with that extrapolated progress. And that is the only way this commission could see to prevent China from taking over the world in 10 years is to stop the world economy as a whole, turn off, ruin the whole world economy. And then these other things, the claiming that there was a virus released last November, doing the news releases of a leaky lab and Fort Detrick preparing pathogens, all of that reinforced by China's cooperation in creating that huge quarantine that was acting out the plan to ruin the world economy as a way to save the ruling system, to keep the U.S. empire intact by ruining everything, meaning ruining small business primarily so that there can be an immediate takeover by monopoly corporations and finance, simplify the whole economy with basically everyone being a low wage employee, but working to overtake China on the matter of artificial intelligence production.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the geopolitical implications of China's economic growth and a commission's proposed solution.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure they've thought about that, but they have a basically humane concept of how artificial capitalism is working. It actually almost succeeded in eliminating poverty. China was one of the poorest countries when they started, and they have actually seriously brought up the lowest economic category.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about China's plans for its own population in an automated future.

**RAY PEAT:** They were taking profits from the industry in China, but reached a point where they saw that China as an economy was becoming the center of the world, making the world dependent on their production. And that was structurally interfering with the U.S. idea of empire, in which military bases were the essence of organization and the Chinese were making the flow of goods the means of organization.

**CONTEXT:** You were clarifying the motivations behind the actions discussed earlier, specifically regarding China's economic rise.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, that's part of it, to justify taking over the internet, requiring vaccination, and subordination of all sorts of things. But I think mostly it's part of destroying all of the middle-class competition for the giant monopolies.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the justification for restrictive measures.

**RAY PEAT:** Veblen was the first person who started talking about you could eliminate labor and create abundance. And then the people who called themselves the technocrats incorporated, started, the founder of technocracy knew Veblen and adopted his view of the economy.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the concept of technocracy and its origins.

**RAY PEAT:** By 2030, 100 years from when he wrote, he said that the discounting plagues and world wars by 2030, people won't be working any more than 15 hours a week. And when I was a kid, that was part of the environment, that the work week was getting shorter. That was the predicted future, it wasn't just the technocracy people by name, but they were outstanding in how optimistic they were that the people who owned things were going to let the engineers run them intelligently and efficiently. That constantly was running into interference with concentration of wealth and control. The progress towards the 15-hour week was more or less continuous, despite those interferences with the engineer category. But 1980 was the turning point. Reagan and the progress of the middle and working class took a sharp turn, and the GDP kept increasing, productivity kept increasing, but wages started decreasing. And the upper one percent and one tenth of one percent started getting all of the rewards of increasing production.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the historical predictions of a shorter work week and the turning point in economic trends.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, definitely. It started with the CIA and Eisenhower and the Green Revolution. It was being applied in agriculture, turning farming into agri-business and agri-industry rather than producing mixed foods for consumption, it was producing soybeans for profit. That started with Rockefeller and Eisenhower in 1952-3.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the co-option of the technocracy concept and its origins.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the government has been financing the upward distribution of ownership in all sorts of ways, but the funds going to people owning only 10,000 acres and such, that was slowing the progress of the great technocrats. So they're going to let those so-called relatively small farms of 10,000 or 15,000 acres go under to be consumed by the ones controlling a million acres.

**CONTEXT:** You were explaining the rationale behind agricultural subsidies and their role in consolidating land ownership.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, the public news is getting more controlling, more false. Dumbed down so that they're just giving instructions every day on what you should believe today. And it's horrifyingly effective with this plague thing. How people fell for it without any data at all. The decisions were made that a new kind of coronavirus was very infectious and very deadly, no data in support. My first thought was do they have guilty insider information that it was designed in the lab and they know that to be the case if they weren't the designers of it otherwise. There's no sane reason for saying those things, that it's very infectious or very dangerous, because they just weren't doing the tests to see what was making people sick or measuring the changes of sickness in relation to previous years. So I was looking at the CDC's report. And all of their actual cases and infections and deaths were right on the typical flu season mortality, sickness, and hospitalization. And as the tests became available by the millions around the first of April, suddenly flu mortality dropped like the fastest the stock market had fallen earlier, it was like a cliff falling off as the millions of tests became available. And the steep rise of the news talked about a sudden gigantic speed of communication caused this vertical rise in the incidence and deaths from the coronavirus, but the bigger curve of general respiratory mortality was right on previous year patterns. It was just coronavirus replacing influenza and syncytial and other respiratory viruses. And the same thing happened with the flu vaccines, for example, the polio vaccine, when it became available, the official definition of polio was changed. And other conditions that had been causing paralysis suddenly disappeared as polio was epidemic. The things like aseptic meningitis were either rising to replace the disappearing polio and alerts that the definition was the only thing that changed, paralysis stayed the same. And so if you eliminated polio by saying that it didn't fit the definition of what was causing paralysis, then the vaccine could get the credit for it. The same thing was done in the opposite direction with cancer from the 1940s through the 50s. They increased the definition of cancer of the breast and uterus, for example. Things that had been non-cancer became cancer. And so if you cure all of these cases of non-cancer, it shows that your treatment is effective. But if you look at the actual death from cancer, the deaths from cancer increased exactly at the speed that the treatment for cancer increased. And by definition, they were having a tremendous success in curing cancer by creating a straw man of disease and curing it. But meanwhile, the bystander patient was dying at a higher rate. And I think that accounts for why the coronavirus deaths are tending to displace.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the evolution of public news and its impact on public perception, using the example of the coronavirus pandemic.

**RAY PEAT:** As far as I couldn't tell, it could be either of those equally.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the reasons for widespread quarantines during the pandemic.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they didn't plan it all out with that meeting that came up with event 201. They left some details that were sloppy.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the shifting recommendations regarding mask-wearing.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, so the lockstep document I think came out in 2010, but I just I would imagine most of the public is not familiar with this Rockefeller Foundation document and things like 201, but they seem to see these things out in the public and then when you bring them up that they're identical to what we're experiencing now, you're called a conspiracy theorist.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the Rockefeller Foundation's "Lockstep" scenario and its relevance to current events.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, really, we're planning this. I think Harry Vox is right. You can't imagine them as being more evil than they really are. We're always short in our estimation of how bad they are.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked for your take on predictive scenarios like those from the Rockefeller Foundation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think doing everything possible on the internet and telephones and so on is important, but besides that, people have to start actually getting in touch personally and have passing messages personally, organizing on the ground level, literally, and establishing networks within the system and hoping to find contact within the surveillance structure.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the importance of personal organization and communication in the face of surveillance.

**RAY PEAT:** My experience in the past, just with trying to go abroad to teach, that involves surveillance to the extent that one of my old friends who turned out to be sort of my overseer for some government agency, he said he would tell me when he retired, but he died before retiring. But his wife confirmed that he was in surveillance. But every time I would have an idea, like to go to teach in Nicaragua or Salvador or something, he would somehow locate my location even though I hadn't kept in touch with him and didn't have a telephone. He would somehow find my address and get in touch and ask what I was doing and then say don't do it.

**CONTEXT:** You were sharing a personal experience with government surveillance.

**RAY PEAT:** I had a friend who was a union organizer who was intending to go to San Salvador with a group of other union people from the Northwest. That was about the same year I went. A fanatical anti-marijuana person because he knew that that would be used to damage the union workers if he was tainted by marijuana. But the night before he was to fly to San Salvador with the other union guys, his apartment was arrested, marijuana was planted. He was put in jail to miss his flight, and as far as I knew, he didn't know why it happened. He wasn't prosecuted, charges were dropped, but the guys that went there were sitting in a restaurant starting to get organized, and the Army murdered them all. So my view was that he had his friend somewhere in the government that protected him by having him frightened.

**CONTEXT:** You were recounting an incident involving a friend and government interference.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've been near-sighted and generally can be absent-minded and such, I never would notice things, but whenever this guy who was my surveillance person was with me, like I would come back to the school, put my key in the lock and pull it out and find shreds of paraffin on it. I said, what was that? And he said, oh, sometimes they do that to make a copy of your keys so they can break in. By the way, it was me, you know, don't worry about it. And other times I wasn't noticing someone being like a clown, a surveillance person who was doing a show of being sneaky but looking ridiculous hiding behind a skinny light post, for example. And I wouldn't have noticed it except my friend pointed it out and then there was a guy who wrote a number in the dust of my windshield and then it disappeared. And I said, I wonder why he wrote that number. And my friend said, that looks like an immigration tourist card number. So I pulled out my tourist card and it disappeared. It was my immigration number that this guy had written, but I wouldn't have noticed it if the surveillance guy hadn't pointed it out to me. I think part of his instruction at that point was to try to get me to leave the country.

**CONTEXT:** You were elaborating on your personal experiences with surveillance, detailing specific instances.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't imagine that very, very, very powerful people give as many interviews as Bill Gates. So what do you think he's an extension of? He likes to hobnob with the very top bankers, the Rockefellers and Rothschild type. And I think he's in the network, CIA, IBM, creating his business and his billions, that he's right from the start knowing somewhat what the scheme is, but that he's sort of a microcephalic type who follows orders, but doesn't do much else.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about Bill Gates' role and influence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the world economy is part of world health. You want to keep people just sick enough that they have to consume the drugs and be under the control of the doctors and the drug companies.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the relationship between the world economy and public health.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and when someone is in the hands of a healthcare system, where the military or the insurance company or the healthcare corporation, where they're responsible for their final sickness, it's well established that the final sickness is the most economical disposition. Morphine is the standard treatment for cancer, even though it's recognized for at least a hundred years that it makes cancer grow faster. But it's a very cheap way to finish them off and save money.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the medical system's approach to end-of-life care and its economic implications.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. They talk about that, the efficient population and the things that will not prolong poverty, get rid of the people who are occupying the land that needs to be made efficient.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the connections between Bill Gates, Planned Parenthood, and Rockefeller, and their potential motivations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, Fauci is another person that follows orders. And administers punishment and knows how to very efficiently, bluntly and crudely make things look right on the surface while stealing people's ideas and blocking their research.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about Anthony Fauci's role.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it was an actual indecision, not being a complete insider.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about Donald Trump's relationship with Fauci and his decision-making during the pandemic.

**RAY PEAT:** That's really where most of the profit comes from. Literally being handed money out. This cannot really be sustainable. I mean, at some point, even the dumbest member of the public will say, well, hold on a second, you've already experienced two once-in-a-generation recessions slash depressions. We have an entire generation calling them the Millennials who have no concept of ever owning a house or retiring or, you know, having a vacation longer than a week. Even even the regular people in the street are probably going to start to question this mode of operating where a crisis is manufactured now every less than every 10 years.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the sustainability of the current economic model and public reaction to repeated crises.

**RAY PEAT:** If they can keep their attention on fearing a mystical virus, that I think they're cunning. Keeping people under control, but like Occupy Wall Street, they have their different layers of control ready. If one doesn't work, they have the other. The money went right into the big corporations that failed to put it to use employing people. It created some temporary jobs, but most of the money didn't really get to the people, and as they realized that, maybe they'll send out another wave of money if it's needed. But if people start going into the streets demanding change, then they have their other levels of responding.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the government's response to economic crises and potential public unrest.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that this epidemic has given them an acceleration of what they were planning, but they'll let up on it to relieve revolutionary pressure if needed, but will be ready with something else, terrorism or something different to get them the people's attention.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the pandemic as an accelerant for pre-existing plans.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's all part of total subservience. 50 years ago, I was saying that it won't be long until they keep people on the assembly line by installing a screw eye in their skull and attaching it to a trolley so that they can only go from the bathroom to the lunch room to the assembly line and then home. But with the telephones, they don't need the trolley wire.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the future of societal control and its historical parallels.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that way they don't waste their pepper spray. Don't have to.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the role of social distancing in controlling populations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the health thing has always been my sense of a point of reality where you might be able to, if you can't show anyone what's happening politically, militarily in the outside world, you maybe can get their attention on the fact that it's affecting their health, get them to contact whatever reality they have the potential for and maybe work from there. And I found that the progressive people were totally out of contact with that sort of reality. But the far right, I found people coming to my lectures, it was only the extreme right that was interested in health and survival, and the same people who were saying that the communists were putting fluoride in the water.

**CONTEXT:** You were explaining your motivation for focusing on health issues and your observations about political ideologies.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, they found HCG in some of the African vaccines, and it's known that that will sterilize you at least for a few years. And that was designed, you know, the CIA doesn't announce that they're doing it or going to do it. But they plan for its possibility and then someone always figures out how to sneak it out into the world.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the potential for sterilization agents in vaccines, referencing a specific case.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, I think his background in population control is right there on the surface.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about Bill Gates' focus on vaccines and its potential connection to population control.

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of preventing epidemics by like the old 120 year ago Rockefeller idea of giving people shoes and food and curing endemic disease that way. That's now too expensive. Vaccines are a matter of economy. The known effects of vitamin A and vitamin D just making massive improvements in disease resistance of all sorts. That's more expensive. As cheap as those are, it's more expensive than a vaccine, not even counting the depopulation effects.

**CONTEXT:** You were contrasting the cost-effectiveness of vaccines with other public health interventions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the old women in that picture with the Rockefellers and other giants of civilization, they all look like Hollywood couldn't design evil characters as well as that.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked why certain powerful figures aesthetically appear "evil."

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't think there's much similarity, except that they both damage your immunity and make you sick. Did I ever tell you the story of the guy from Fort Detrick that told me about the AIDS research eleven, twelve years before? Age broke out in 1969, this guy came to one of my free university classes and hung around afterwards and wanted to talk to me as a biology graduate student, someone that might take him seriously, but I didn't even take him seriously enough to get his name and contact information. He said he'd quit his job at Fort Detrick because the people were seriously designing a virus that would be racially selective to kill black people, specifically. At that time, nothing had been published on ethnic genetic tags that a virus could attach to. Two or three years later, the first papers were published coming out of Fort Detrick, exactly what he had said, but without the purpose defined. And my molecular biology professors honored those as great progress in science.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about similarities between the AIDS epidemic and the current pandemic, and you shared a story about Fort Detrick.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the plan is constantly developing. It wasn't perfected at an early date. It develops.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked if the plan for engineered viruses had shifted.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the RAND Corporation and Tavistock and all these think tanks, they are making the plans for the elites and then they're being kind of put into place and where are the recipients?

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the role of think tanks in planning and implementing elite agendas.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the universities are working out the details often without knowing it. I think my molecular biology professors were just jerks, but they were playing right into the whole scheme.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the role of universities in the implementation of these plans.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they probably know about vitamin D or GC-MAF, right? That's what came up a few times in terms of treatment.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked if elites possess an antidote to engineered viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** I looked at brain size in relation to body size trends over the decades and right when massive child vaccination expanded in the US, that was the first decade that the brain didn't keep pace with the body growth in several countries around the world. The brains got either got smaller or didn't enlarge while the body did enlarge, so the brain-body ratio has shrunk. But starting with the decade of the 80s, and I'm sure you've seen the studies showing that the IQ, the average worldwide IQ after enjoying a century of rising, suddenly started dropping around the late 60s and at this point is 30% lower than what it was in the 70s. Yeah, but even the mass of the brain is now shrinking.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the potential impact of mass vaccination on brain development and IQ.

**RAY PEAT:** The Gates Foundation's prioritization of the vaccine solution for multiple health problems reflects the foundation's preference for interventions with quick, measurable, visible solutions. One of Gavi's and that's an acronym for something, senior representatives reported that Bill Gates often told him in private conversations that he is vehemently against health systems. He basically said it was a complete waste of money and that there was no evidence that it works. So I will not see a dollar or cent of my money to go to strengthening of health systems.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the Gates Foundation's approach to global health and its prioritization of vaccines over health systems.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I'm against medicine in general. So Medicare for everyone, that would be sort of an ideological thing, but it would make many things worse. Well, Ivan Illich, "Preservation of the sick life of medically dependent people in an unhealthy environment is the principal business of the medical profession," pretty much nails it. Yeah, so indirectly, and probably without knowing that, the far right are actually protecting the population by being so heavily against any kind of a universal healthcare system.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing your general stance against medicine and the role of the far-right in opposing universal healthcare.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people that identify as libertarian are among the most gullible. I've known lots of them and the ones that have studied it and make an ideology of it, things like death penalty combined with libertarianism. I think there's an old-fashioned kind of conservative.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the libertarian ideology and its potential contradictions.

**RAY PEAT:** The worship of power. Epstein flaunted his connections with power. He knew everyone powerful and that attracted Bill Gates wanting to associate himself with power wherever it was. I think the CIA has tried to infiltrate itself into every conceivable cultish movement, and probably the pedophiles are being manipulated by the CIA as much as the religious groups and political groups.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about Bill Gates' meetings with Jeffrey Epstein.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think Ghislaine Maxwell is pretty obviously an Israeli intelligence asset. She's she's either like her father like daughter, I guess. I mean, I think it's pretty obvious her job was probably to collect compromising information on all of the pedophiles that were visiting the ranch. I wouldn't be surprised if they have like a video on most of the powerful people in the world right now doing something nefarious and and that's how they get what they want from them.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing Ghislaine Maxwell's potential role in Epstein's network.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, events like that erase the immediate past and let us move on.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked if the Epstein case would be reopened.

**RAY PEAT:** Not especially. I think the Birch Society was pretty well investigating it. The people in the far right press were giving a good picture of what his plans were.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the significance of the Trilateral Commission.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I always would prefer the disease. Because it's usually less severe than, especially if you're not visiting a doctor, right? Yeah, I don't believe disease is especially harmful, so not much conflict between.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked to compare the severity of a virus versus economic collapse.

**RAY PEAT:** The mechanism by which it reproduces itself, it goes in and activates the enzymes that copy the RNA and make the proteins that form the capsule and then fast numbers pour out through the endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted. This mechanism is already making retrovirus particles under a microscope and by chemical analysis. Our structural close analogs of the various virus particles and they only began to be really studied at the beginning of this century, the exosomes, micro vesicles and various names for them, but the serum and the lymph are really full. Under an ordinary microscope, there's basically invisible dust in the background, but when you look at that dust under a microscope, they are these highly organized vesicles with a structured cytoplasm-like cover and RNA, DNA, enzymes, lipids, and so on. So the fact that maybe half of our DNA collection consists of things that structurally look like retroviral copied DNA, and that when we're under stress, we pour out large quantities of these exosomes that are thought to be a communication between different tissues. Like an injured lung will send exosomes that are absorbed by bone marrow cells, which then make particular kind of white blood cells that have the capacity to repair the lung. So they're known to have communication property in the organism. And they are abundantly present in maternal milk and are taken up through the intestine wall as immune support for the baby. And they are known to be able to enter the gonads in a way that would make them candidates for what Darwin called gemmules. He thought they accounted for the inheritance of acquired properties. The developing organ influenced by the environment would accumulate its properties and send them to the gonads for reproductive copying. In bacteria, starting with the simplest organism, bacteria can make particles like this. Transmit through a tube to other bacteria that lack the resistance factor, for example, for antibiotics, but bacteria have been using this before antibiotics were thought of. There's a communication, a genetic interchange between species and bacteria. Individuals of the same species, or across very different bacterial types, to share acquired information. Since we can use it within the organism, I think individuals probably habitually share stuff like this. For example, you can find the DNA from a woman's previous partners in her tissues, all of her tissues can be penetrated by the DNA she has been exposed to through semen. I think that, since the gonads are known to be able to take up these exosomes, that the semen will probably be found to contain lots of these exosomes, which look like and are structured like viruses. And if bacteria can do it, I think it's probably a routine thing for other organisms. And their existence hadn't been suspected by western science until just about the beginning of this century. And so even though people were writing about the apparent cross phylum transmission of genes 50, 60 years ago, it wasn't acceptable to talk about it, but now I think the way viruses came into being when I talked to my professors about it, they just didn't want to talk about it. Because they have to evolve in organisms and what that means they didn't want to consider. But since we now know that exosomes are repair material and cross-individual communication at least in bacteria, probably it's involved in that adoption of DNA from semen. It's probably something happening all the time that we take up exosomes and I think when an animal is very sick it's known that the exosomes participate in amplifying the sickness instead of correcting the sickness. So you steer them. From an old animal accelerates aging of a young animal and young serum retards aging of an old animal and it's probably the presence or absence of harmful exosomes that accounts for that property of serum. And I think it's reasonable that sometimes these exosomes of stressed individuals become toxic enough, that that would account for where viruses came from.

**CONTEXT:** You were explaining your theory on the origin and function of viruses, referencing exosomes and horizontal gene transfer.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, right. Within organisms that's established, but I think organisms other than bacteria are doing it.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked if viruses are a form of horizontal gene transfer.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, just like bacteria. When you're healthy, like 80% of the people who contract coronavirus don't even notice it. I think they're potentially constructive assistance improving our immune system.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked about the communicative role of viruses and their potential benefit.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's been known since ancient China times.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked if viruses could be a mechanism for communication between sick and healthy individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's basically my interpretation. Why I don't worry about this particular type of respiratory infection.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked to confirm your interpretation of viruses as a communication mechanism.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh no, not for many, many years.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked if you still teach at the University of Oregon.

**RAY PEAT:** That was permitted for about 15 years, I guess. And then they shut it down.

**CONTEXT:** You were explaining how you were able to teach courses at the University of Oregon.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I used to regularly lecture in places like health food stores. I would sponsor my lectures. And I would line up a row down the coast and then do it so I could drive between sites. At one trip, I had contacted someone about publishing my books who was a distributor to the health food industry, and they saw what I was saying about unsaturated fats. And on that trip, all of my scheduled lectures were cancelled without explanation. The health food store in San Diego, which had regular deal with a church auditorium for their weekly lectures, the guy who was in charge of the lectures was fired and unavailable when I got there and the people in charge didn't know that I had been scheduled. But all along the way there were these mysterious cancellations. So that was the last time I went on my lecture trips.

**CONTEXT:** You were explaining why you stopped giving lectures.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked if academia has become too authoritarian.

**RAY PEAT:** One of my old professors recently got fired for trying to invite Dewsburg for speaking at Georgetown University here in DC. As soon as the Dean found out, basically, that person, even though he was a tenured professor, got kicked out, because it was considered that Dewsburg is a quack, and no respectable university would want to associate themselves with inviting that person to even speak.

**CONTEXT:** You were sharing an anecdote about a professor being fired for inviting a controversial speaker.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we it will probably get colonized, but in terms of its effects on health, we're being fear-mongered that you have to have this bacteria. Otherwise, we'll die, our immune system will collapse, etc., etc. There is no evidence for that. I mean, if you look at the literature, nothing exists.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the microbiome and the lack of evidence for its essential role in health.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we it will probably get colonized, but in terms of its effects on health, we're being fear-mongered that you have to have this bacteria. Otherwise, we'll die, our immune system will collapse, etc., etc. There is no evidence for that. I mean, if you look at the literature, nothing exists.

**CONTEXT:** You were reiterating your point about the microbiome and the lack of scientific evidence for its necessity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we it will probably get colonized, but in terms of its effects on health, we're being fear-mongered that you have to have this bacteria. Otherwise, we'll die, our immune system will collapse, etc., etc. There is no evidence for that. I mean, if you look at the literature, nothing exists.

**CONTEXT:** You were asked for your opinion on the microbiome and the prevailing narrative around it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people who were really studying the issue said, I don't know why medicine claims that having bacteria in your colon is a good thing. Having a microbiome in nature is by far the exception rather than the rule.

**CONTEXT:** You were referencing scientists who question the necessity of the microbiome.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people who were really studying the issue said, I don't know why medicine claims that having bacteria in your colon is a good thing. Having a microbiome in nature is by far the exception rather than the rule.

**CONTEXT:** You were discussing the prevailing narrative about the microbiome.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people who were really studying the issue said, I don't know why medicine claims that having bacteria in your colon is a good thing. Having a microbiome in nature is by far the exception rather than the rule.
