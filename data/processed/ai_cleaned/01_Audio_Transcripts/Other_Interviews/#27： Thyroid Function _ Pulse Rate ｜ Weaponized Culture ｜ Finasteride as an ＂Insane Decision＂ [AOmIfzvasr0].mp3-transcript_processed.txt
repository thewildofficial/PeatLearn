**RAY PEAT:** China is just a convenient propaganda object to justify, for example, they say they'll be testing new atomic bombs, more usable atomic bombs within a few months. But that's been the very long-term plan of the Pentagon, justifying the invention of planetary warming through carbon dioxide, to have to change the economy away from carbon energy to nuclear energy so they can have a constant supply of nuclear fuel to make bombs. As simply a way to focus the attention of the world, as long as they have nuclear bombs that are more and more usable. Thank you for listening to me. Their nuclear bombs just for their police power, even if it's only within this continent, they'll still have their their nuclear deterrent.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential for war between the US and China, and Ray Peat explains the geopolitical motivations behind the focus on climate change and nuclear weapons.

**RAY PEAT:** Russia and China are now getting close militarily as well as economically. So basically, the US has lost. On that basis, they wouldn't have a chance in a nuclear war. Putin told them that Russia won't allow another war to be fought on their territory. They've had three great wars that ruined the country each time. He said it won't happen again. So they have demonstrated their weapons that can, at any invasion, they can eliminate the source of the invasion, either topically or systemically.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the perceived uniformity among global powers and Ray Peat clarifies the opposing military and economic stances of Russia and China versus the US.

**RAY PEAT:** The US isn't very sympathetic with their concept. China is very focused on public health and education. And the US is always behind on public consciousness and education supported by good health. They're doing things that have massively ruined the public's health, which drags down the way they're performing intellectually and productively. And so they see China continuing as things are with a more or less even playing field. China's obviously imminently winning the game. So they're trying to change the rules fast enough that they can. According to Eric Schmidt's description of the situation, a very detailed discussion of how artificial intelligence is to be used to preempt China's digitalization of the economy of the world.

**CONTEXT:** The host questions why the US would undermine its own population's health and productivity, and Ray Peat contrasts the approaches of China and the US, highlighting China's focus on public health and education.

**RAY PEAT:** That thing of automation and artificial intelligence has been such a deep part of them since the 1930s. That since then, they've considered public education as a drag on the system. It's just a waste of resources. Yeah, people were talking about it all through the 40s, and it was in just about 50, a little over 50 years ago, that it became a very open public policy that they were set on peonizing the whole United States, taking policy choices that would reduce income growth for nearly everyone in the country, while concentrating on Reaganism, was simply one stage of this process in peonization.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the US's strategy regarding automation and artificial intelligence, and Ray Peat explains the historical shift in policy towards viewing public education as a resource drain and implementing "peonization."

**RAY PEAT:** The thought of having a world of peons is such an emotional part of it. The ruling class hates the idea of competition from ordinary people. Choices way back were meant to degrade as many people as possible by lowering the quality of schooling at all levels, and nutrition, having diets. They scaled economically, they started that in the 30s. In Los Angeles, I saw doctors are trained to do that, grains, pasta, and beans as the economy diet, and then seafood, and fruit, and dairy foods for the privileged diet.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the US's actions are akin to a psychopath choosing torment over colonization, and Ray Peat elaborates on the ruling class's aversion to competition and their deliberate degradation of the population through diet and education.

**RAY PEAT:** Nelson Rockefeller and Franklin Roosevelt had agreed, the two party leaders on the post-war world, they were to develop first Latin America as part of our economic system, build them up as a consumer economy, and then Africa and Asia would come at later stages, but sort of a Marshall plan for the world was the idea to get the whole world up to speed so that capitalism could continue as a growing productive system. But the faction that took over with Truman, the Dulles faction, they were the elite haters of the public, and South Americans were less than the public.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential for space colonization versus internal conflict, and Ray Peat discusses the post-war economic plans of Rockefeller and Roosevelt, contrasting them with the policies of the Truman/Dulles faction.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, the Roosevelt family was convinced of it. Stalin was convinced of it. Anyone who knew what the Dulleses, Alan Dulles, what he had been doing during the war was treason, and it came out. Stalin's spies told Roosevelt what Dulles had been doing, working for the Nazi army. Roosevelt said, oh, that isn't possible. That would be treason. And before it took a couple of weeks for the facts to come through his system, because it was held up by the German Dulles intelligence apparatus, it took a long time to ever reach anywhere in the United States. But meanwhile, Roosevelt had died.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the rumor of FDR's assassination, and Ray Peat confirms the belief held by the Roosevelt family and Stalin, detailing Allen Dulles's alleged treasonous activities and the suppression of information.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CIA financing itself by selling drugs in the big cities in the U.S. That has been documented over and over that they were profiting two ways, by destroying poor people in the U.S. and financing their illegal operations with drug money.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if different power elite factions are aligned on austerity and societal degradation, and Ray Peat confirms the CIA's documented involvement in drug trafficking for financing and societal destruction.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, the New York Times too is in harmony with Murdoch's.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Rupert Murdoch's media influence and its connection to the Rothschilds, and Ray Peat notes the New York Times' alignment with Murdoch's media control.

**RAY PEAT:** Accidents, personal, stupid murders. Will be taken advantage of to excite racial hostility. But I think there are enough accidental racist events happening that it's just a matter of how the media present them and who is there to either try to point out what should be done, that you should immediately start fixing police forces, rather than making it a matter of racial identity primarily and then postponing actual changes.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the thought process behind events like the death in Minnesota and their propagation in the media, and Ray Peat explains how accidents and murders are exploited to incite racial hostility, emphasizing the media's role in framing these events.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, they have atom bombs backing them up. Speaking of, they've used Israel to train the police in military tactics so that they have all of the non-nuclear military weapons that they can use. And if that fails to hold down a revolution and a whole part of the state decides to secede and become democratic, then they have the tactical nuclear weapons that can be used for crowd control.

**CONTEXT:** The host questions the danger of the ruling class using racial tensions to distract the public, fearing a potential revolution, and Ray Peat explains the ultimate backing of atom bombs and the use of Israel in training police with military tactics, including tactical nuclear weapons for crowd control.

**RAY PEAT:** The Samson plan is Israel's plan, basically. At some point, Israel feels like they're starting to get overwhelmed by their enemies. They're just going to launch their 400 plus, I don't know how many nuclear warheads. I think they even have a count that the U.S. Department of Defense Secretary, I think it was Rumsfeld, who actually gave it away. Let's say about 400 nuclear warheads. Apparently, they're all pointed to major capitals and cities and economic centers of the world that these rockets can reach. And basically, Israel has said, you will defend us. I mean, by you meaning the world community. If Israel is about to disappear from the map, we'll make sure that the world will disappear as well by nuking everything.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the "Samson plan" and Ray Peat explains Israel's nuclear deterrence strategy, where they threaten global annihilation if their existence is threatened.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even more moderate groups are controlled. The whole New Left was a creation of the intelligence organizations. The Congress for Cultural Freedom. It was strictly CIA, but they created the whole idea of a New Left organization using supposedly progressive leftists. And, you know, the Trotsky movement, after Trotsky failed to take over Russia, he started working with the Nazis and the FBI and US intelligence organizations to create a takeover movement in Russia from within, which is standard policy. They undoubtedly have it in China and Russia now, doing everything they can.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the control of social movements, and Ray Peat reveals that the New Left was a CIA creation and discusses Trotsky's collaboration with intelligence organizations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I doubt that most Americans have paid any attention to the news that Syrian wheat crops across the country are being firebombed by U.S. helicopters, which is, even during war, it's a war crime, but it's a crime against humanity, but it's such a trivial thing. I haven't seen much talk about it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the US government's potential use of weapons to quell dissent, and Ray Peat points to the firebombing of Syrian wheat crops by US helicopters as a war crime and crime against humanity that has received little attention.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they always need the abject obedience in sufficient quantity to let them have servants and murderers, assassins, and so on. And at some point, that dwindles. They get weakened by their use, and their expendability makes them, I think, unsustainable.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the stability of evil if it triumphs, and Ray Peat explains that the need for obedient servants eventually weakens the system due to their expendability.

**RAY PEAT:** They keep increasing their power. The use of power is mainly to increase the power. And when you keep increasing the power, like the concentration of wealth, just the concentration of wealth is pretty soon going to mean that Amazon owns everything and everyone else is expendable. So you'll have one corporation, and what will they do to increase their power? The board of directors is going to start fighting for who has the most power.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the cyclical nature of empires and their eventual collapse, and Ray Peat explains that the pursuit of power leads to wealth concentration and eventual internal conflict within corporations.

**RAY PEAT:** The official figures of the U.S. government show clearly that the epidemic of chronic diseases began with the massive increase of vaccination in 1989. And that created quite a... I don't go on Facebook very often, but I posted that on there and it riled a lot of people up.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for more information about the link between vaccination and chronic diseases, and Ray Peat cites US government figures connecting the rise in chronic diseases to increased vaccination rates starting in 1989.

**RAY PEAT:** The size of a baby's brain, especially in relation to its body length at birth, has been growing from the early 20th century steadily down to the 1970s. And in some countries, it has actually in the 1980s begun shrinking. And I think that's a pretty good worldwide indicator of the state of well-being and of deterioration.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about what people need to know regarding vaccines, and Ray Peat discusses the shrinking size of babies' brains relative to body length as an indicator of declining well-being.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, do you know of Ernest Stern class's study of the SAT scores? Yeah, I've seen that. But and I've also seen the sperm counts and testosterone levels in males have been precipitously declining since the 70s and they're matching perfectly that declining curve in IQ as well.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the Flynn effect and declining IQ, and Ray Peat connects declining sperm counts and testosterone levels to the decline in IQ.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the hairlessness of the front part of the brain is just part of the fact that it's very hot. But by being uninsulated relatively, it can be cooler than the inside. One of the functions of the progesterone is to stabilize it so that it doesn't produce heat needlessly, but also to keep the temperature up so that the energy supply is there.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between balding scalp and temperature, and Ray Peat explains that balding is related to the frontal lobes being hot and uninsulated, with progesterone stabilizing this area.

**RAY PEAT:** The whole organ, any cell, when it's happy and successful and has done its work properly, it gets better. It maintains high energy, but quiescent. The frontal lobe of the brain is just the highest energy organ or tissue, but also the most able to maintain a high degree of quiescent. So in a sense, balding could be viewed as a brain excitotoxicity problem? Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah, you're not keeping the back part of your brain differentiated adequately from the front. If you raise your whole energy production, that whole syndrome of an ear lobe crease and high cholesterol and so on, almost always. It goes with the chronic low temperature.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if balding can be viewed as a brain excitotoxicity problem, and Ray Peat confirms this, linking it to a lack of differentiation between the front and back of the brain and chronic low temperature.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the exact function of estrogen is to have block a cell from going into that quiescent state to force it to act immediately and intensely and lead to the reproductive processes, which if you stay under the influence of estrogen, it will never go beyond the rapid multiplication and growth phase. You have to turn off that glycolytic type of metabolism and go to the oxidative aiming towards quiescence.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if inhibiting estrogen synthesis or blocking its effects would be beneficial for restoring hair growth, and Ray Peat explains that estrogen forces cells into rapid multiplication, hindering quiescence, and that a shift to oxidative metabolism is needed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can't have meaningful quiescence if you're simply exhausted. The Pavlovian had the idea of usually three energy states: the almost dead, parabiotic state, and the intermediate state of sort of frenzied activity doing its function on and off active, contraction, relaxation, and so on, and then the high energy resting state in which it's simply quiescent but totally charged up and ready to work. Babies are good at getting into the high energy resting state, and someone about to die tends to have parts of the brain and other tissues laps into the parabiotic, almost dead state, just being quiet to save the last little bit of energy for surviving. So psychiatry more or less as a profession is wasting both its time and the time of its patients by administering all these GABA agonist drugs for all of these anxiety disorders and all kinds of other psychiatric disorders that are really energetic in origin.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of the GABA system and energetic deficiency, and Ray Peat explains that meaningful quiescence requires energy, contrasting the states of babies, active individuals, and those near death, and criticizing psychiatric treatments for energetic disorders.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, people who have looked for among all known organisms, they could find lots of them that can live without oxygen. But they couldn't find any single celled organism that can live continuously without carbon dioxide. So it's the without which there is no life. So if there was a way to package carbon dioxide as a drug or a supplement and then you have thyroid as a supplement, I guess supplementing with carbon dioxide would be, I don't know, more systemic, less risky?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks whether thyroid hormone or carbon dioxide is more systemically beneficial, and Ray Peat emphasizes the fundamental necessity of carbon dioxide for all life.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everyone loses unnecessary fat. Their thyroid starts working properly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the recoverability of thyroid function without supplementation, and Ray Peat states that losing unnecessary fat, particularly polyunsaturated fats, allows the thyroid to function properly.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, there have been a couple big propaganda studies five or ten years ago, some in Denmark. And if you look at them carefully, they're just basically propaganda for selling blood pressure drugs, things to regulate your heart rate and pressure.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the correlation between low pulse rate and mortality, and Ray Peat dismisses studies promoting low pulse rates as propaganda for blood pressure drug sales.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the intelligence basically goes down with the metabolic rate. I had the chance to give the Raven Matrix tests to some kids at different ages. And my niece, for example, when she was eight, scored the same raw score as a university math professor. But when she was in her teens, she scored exactly the same score and hadn't advanced a bit. And just being around kids, you can see that at eight or nine, they're as bright as they're ever going to be.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the lifelong decline of metabolism and its relation to intelligence, and Ray Peat confirms this decline, citing his niece's experience with IQ tests as an example.

**RAY PEAT:** With the natural glandular material, if you take it with food, it isn't all going to be digested for hours and some of it is going to travel down your intestine. So with natural thyroid, you don't get such a bad effect as with a pure chemical. I experienced it myself taking 25 micrograms of T3 only in the morning. And I don't remember how many weeks it was, but just a few weeks and my heart began pausing for seconds at a time around sunset every day. And I found at sunset taking five or ten micrograms and rubbing it on the roof of my mouth within 10 or 15 seconds, my heart rhythm was going from pausing every 10 seconds to a restored perfect rhythm.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the difference between half a grain and a full grain dose of thyroid and the safety of T4, and Ray Peat shares his personal experience with T3, highlighting the importance of taking it with food and the potential for heart rhythm issues with pure chemicals.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, T4 is more slowly metabolized anyway, so it's going to equilibrate into your tissues at its background level is so much higher than T3. The effect is going to be a lot slower. If you lack selenium and aren't converting it, then it does build up over the weeks and reaches the point where it interferes with C3 and becomes anti-thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** The host clarifies if Ray Peat was referring to T3 or T4 in his previous statement about dosage, and Ray Peat explains that T4 is metabolized more slowly and can interfere with T3 if selenium is deficient.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, one tablet of Sinoplus is like a little over two grains of armor. And one tablet, I think has 30 micrograms of T3. And so if you take that on an empty stomach and absorb it quickly, it's going to have that upsetting effect. And your liver is going to eventually give you a low T3 effect. But the one grain at a time, 10 micrograms of T3 and 40 micrograms of T4, is that risky to take at one time? And not with food. Food is going to flow it out.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of taking Sinoplus and the dosage of T3 and T4, and Ray Peat explains the effects of taking it on an empty stomach versus with food.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, if you need, like I wanted my heart to not stop for three seconds at a time. And so I chewed it up and got the almost instantaneous effect. If you're having terrible insomnia, chewing up 10 micrograms. You can put your sleep in a few minutes. People with agonizing breast pain have chewed up 10 micrograms and found the pain was absolutely stopped in 10 or 15 minutes.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks whether to chew or swallow thyroid pills, and Ray Peat recommends chewing for faster effects, citing examples of relief from heart palpitations and breast pain.

**RAY PEAT:** It's always good to keep the free fatty acids low. Okay. But it wouldn't have any kind of like a synergistic effect to do that when you're taking thyroid. In other words, to get more use of the thyroid you're already ingesting. Would it help too in this specific case? In the case of glandular thyroid, the unsaturated fats are even blocking the breakdown of inner stomach and the further metabolism in your body is being blocked at all different points by polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lowering free fatty acids would have a synergistic effect with thyroid supplementation, and Ray Peat confirms that unsaturated fats block the breakdown and metabolism of glandular thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some of the food technology people have reasoned that the reason for polyunsaturated fats in so many seeds is to block mammalian stomach enzymes to make the seed unnutritious so they all stop eating it because it blocks the proteolytic enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the breakdown of thyroglobulin in the stomach when taking glandular thyroid, and Ray Peat explains that food technologists believe polyunsaturated fats in seeds block mammalian stomach enzymes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that was Dudley's view that it was participating in the mirror mass attracting the neutrinos which affect such things as nuclear decay that the mass is acting on itself through the neutrino seed. In such things as generating order. I've basically just energy and when energy appears unaccountably, he did calculations to show why the passage of time is always adding a certain amount of energy to the system which could involve Dudley's neutrino seed, but Kozirov called it time, but empirically. He started his theory to predict the source of stellar energy and scaling the mass of a star down. The mass of the sun corresponded, according to his astronomical measurements, to all of the stars he was looking at, and so he looked at the planets. And finally, the dark side of the moon as the smallest accessible planet, and aiming his spectroscopic telescope on the dark of the moon with a photographic plate in it, he photographed red spots periodically in the volcanic areas of the moon, volcanic eruptions were recorded and American astronomers said he was just a drunk Russian, there can't be volcanic action on the moon. But most recently, there's an anomalous heat emission from I think it's next to the last gaseous planet. This very recent new data about the heat coming out of this planet fits his predictions. According to the mass, all the planets except Venus are emitting the same energy in relation to mass as the moon and the sun and stars.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the concept of negentropy and how matter is sustained, and Ray Peat explains Dudley's view of mass attracting neutrinos and generating order, and Kozirov's theory of time adding energy, citing astronomical observations of volcanic activity on the moon and heat emissions from planets.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's exactly if the neutrino sea is the ether, and it's attracted simply as a dielectric, very, very light gas, then you would have some drift, some it carries, carries some of it along with some of it slips through. So Dudley exactly calculated things that were consistent with the measurements. The Earth has basically adrift, is basically moving preferentially in space towards the Sagittarius constellation. So he not only said that the ether probably exists, but also that its flow seems to have a preferential direction.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the ether drift experiments and their potential falsification, and Ray Peat explains that if the neutrino sea is the ether, then drift is expected, and Dudley's calculations align with measurements of Earth's preferential movement towards the Sagittarius constellation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think mostly they're something designed to fit the paradigm, and have you read, Seeing Red? Halton Arp, yeah. Halton Arp, yeah. His observations didn't at all fit with the Big Bang explanation of redshift, and redshift goes with the neutrino sea and electric universe and so on, so they wouldn't let him use the telescope anymore.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the nature of black holes, and Ray Peat suggests they are designed to fit a paradigm, referencing Halton Arp's observations that contradict the Big Bang explanation of redshift.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, for everything is changing. But specifically, they're saying those confirmations explain a lot of history. Would you take it that far? Do you think that is a reasonable explanation? Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the "Symbols of an Alien Sky" movie and its theory of planetary configurations explaining history, and Ray Peat agrees that everything is changing and finds the explanation reasonable.

**RAY PEAT:** Velikovsky. Yeah. So maybe that's what he was referring to. Maybe because of that different configuration, the cataclysms on Earth are what all these big religions are talking about. Yeah, I've read him and I think his arguments are plausible.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the movie's premise relates to Velikovsky's theories about Earth's cataclysms, and Ray Peat confirms reading Velikovsky and finding his arguments plausible.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, in general, things like that are not to be messed with unless you have a very specific knowledge of the deficiency because if you take a little too much, any of those defining feature creating hormones can change the whole system in an unpredictable way. I would suggest first getting a good picture of what the problem is and there are usually more ways to fix it, correcting thyroid, vitamin D, and DHEA and pregnenolone will usually bring your DHT up to where it should be.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Ray Peat's general rundown on Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and Ray Peat advises against direct supplementation without specific knowledge of deficiencies, suggesting that correcting thyroid, vitamin D, DHEA, and pregnenolone is a better approach.

**RAY PEAT:** No. Pregnenolone as a first thing and then DHEA if you need a more androgenic thing. Pregnenolone will push your neurosteroids, the crucial regulating things that you don't want to throw out of balance. And with a strong androgen like DHT, that would be one big risk that you could throw off your neurosteroids.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if DHT is similar to progesterone for males, and Ray Peat recommends pregnenolone first, then DHEA, warning that DHT can disrupt neurosteroids.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you have a definite problem that you want to fix, osteoporosis is one of the most common causes of osteoporosis or cancer, for example, then you can use it into the effect, and you will see the effect. Doses for that, for the people that do need it? One milligram. One milligram daily, dissolved in tocopherols, say, or like taken with fat? Uh-huh.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about specific dosages for DHT and its potential uses, and Ray Peat suggests one milligram daily, dissolved in tocopherols or taken with fat, for conditions like osteoporosis or cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** You don't have to worry quite as much as you do with testosterone but if you're very sparing with the testosterone, even DHEA can feminize a man if he takes 25 milligrams a day and almost every day I hear someone taking injections of 30 or 50 milligrams of testosterone per week which is several times what a teenage boy would be making and so it's it's all going to be going towards estrogen and and doing more harm than good.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if DHT requires the same caution as testosterone supplementation, and Ray Peat states that while DHT is less concerning, excessive DHEA can feminize men, and high doses of testosterone are counterproductive.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you find out what endocrinologists and pulmonologists, etc. are actually reading. It's pitiful that they simply don't know anything about their field. But do you think that they can at least do the this just a mechanical work of calculating what would be a physiological dose of DHA? It can they can they drop to that level of stupidity not even being able to calculate that?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why endocrinologists recommend high doses of DHEA, and Ray Peat criticizes their lack of knowledge and inability to calculate physiological doses.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a whole attitude of applying intelligence to physiology or anything in the world. They're they are trained in an authoritarian system of obedience and it's very hard to talk intelligence to someone with that 10 or 20 years of training in that direction.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if endocrinologists are capable of calculating physiological doses, and Ray Peat explains that their authoritarian training hinders their ability to apply intelligence to physiology.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we were talking about it. No, that's it. That's it. I don't, I don't have anything.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what would prompt an allergy specialist to consider T3 and magnesium, and Ray Peat indicates that their conversation about it was the trigger.

**RAY PEAT:** Nerve recovery, progesterone and vitamin D and thyroid and carbon dioxide are central things.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for thoughts on wound-induced paralysis from a bioenergetic perspective, and Ray Peat identifies progesterone, vitamin D, thyroid, and carbon dioxide as crucial for nerve recovery.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, when they interrupt my food and drugs. If they turn off my thyroid, Cytomelan, Xenoplas, and start changing the food supply, then it's necessary to leave.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat what his breaking point would be to leave the empire, and Ray Peat states it would be if his food and drugs were interrupted, specifically mentioning thyroid, Cytomelan, Xenoplas, and changes to the food supply.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. All right. I'm so sorry. Ray, how do you think that will be implemented? Do you like, how do you, what, what is the, because so many people seem resistant to it. Do you think working for these corporations, obviously, but what about the normal person? How do you think they'll incentivize a vaccine besides using fear?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how forced vaccinations would be implemented and incentivized, and Ray Peat agrees that forced vaccinations would be a significant sign to leave.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, even normal doctors are starting to refuse vaccines for their kids. And so the normal American is still absolutely subservient to the stupid things their doctors do to them. That whole thing has to change. The vaccines might be a catalyst for people throwing off the whole crazy authoritarian medical system.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about incentivizing vaccines beyond fear, and Ray Peat notes that even doctors are refusing vaccines for their children, and that the American public remains subservient to doctors, suggesting vaccines could be a catalyst for change.
