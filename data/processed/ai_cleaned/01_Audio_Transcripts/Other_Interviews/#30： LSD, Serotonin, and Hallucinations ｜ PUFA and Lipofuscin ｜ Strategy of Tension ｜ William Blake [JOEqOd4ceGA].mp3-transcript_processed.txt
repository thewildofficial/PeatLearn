**RAY PEAT:** Mechnikov. Mechnikov, okay. But that seems to be like, you know, you can count these people on one hand, and they've been, you know, Nobel winners across a hundred years, so this means a very small minority of good awards, the vast majority of them being mostly pathological discoveries.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about Nobel Prize winners for humanistic work versus pathological ideas.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and Mechnikov shared his with Paul Ehrlich. Who represented the business monopoly a chemical monopoly world, right?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi mentions Mechnikov shared his Nobel with Paul Ehrlich.

**RAY PEAT:** Followed it not in detail but on and off since about 1980 Have you noticed? Yeah that he's become a pariah In the scientific community because we started talking about hiv being Not really as dangerous unless you have a bad lifestyle and you know, low metabolism essentially He's talking about curing autism with antibiotics Which of course implicates serotonin and this guy is now gone He used to be the director of the posture institute in paris And I think now he hides he's in hiding used to be in africa now he's in china But nobody really knows where he is and everybody says he's insane

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about Luc Montagnier's work and his ostracization.

**RAY PEAT:** Um, yeah, it's, uh, much later, but you know, when Peter Duesberg, uh, uh, questioned, uh, he, he sort of started the, uh, uh, virus gene connection and cancer, uh, and, uh, uh, money began flowing from the government and the cancer research and, and then he said, wait a minute, I was mistaken there. Uh, uh, when, when the other work. Uh, uh, as long as he stayed out of the, uh, uh, the direct, uh, it interfering with the funding of, of the nonsense, uh, uh, uh, oncogene virus, uh, work, uh, uh, he, he, uh, continued his research, but then, uh, uh, when he questioned whether the HIV retrovirus had caused AIDS. Uh, that was the last straw, and, uh, he, even the other professors at the university told graduate students not to attend his seminars or courses, and, uh, NIH cut off funding, uh, all of the science organizations stopped inviting him, uh, because, uh, he would be a threat.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about Peter Duesberg's questioning of the virus-gene connection in cancer and HIV.

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, the, the risk of asking, uh, embarrassing questions, uh, uh, have you heard the Carrie Mullis talk, talk about, uh, uh, Luke Montagnier and, uh, and Peter Guzberg? No, no, I haven't. Uh, he, uh, uh, something, uh, he, he was, he was sort of a hyperactive kid who, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh, went into science and, uh, uh, didn't let his intelligence being, be, be ruined, uh, by, uh, getting trained in science. Uh, and, uh, so he continued, uh, to, to look at evidence and ask questions. Uh, and, uh, once he went up to, uh, Montagnier, uh, uh, uh, at a meeting and, uh, uh, said he, uh, needed, uh, a reference, uh, he was writing a grant. Uh, I said he needed a reference for this statement, uh, uh, HIV is the probable cause of AIDS and one time referred him to the, uh, declaration by the NIH that in fact it is the cause. And, uh, uh, Carrie Mollus said, well, but there was no evidence mentioned there. And so Montagnier said, well, recently, as someone showed that, uh, by treating a retrovirus in a certain way, you could get it to kill chimpanzees in a week after you inject it. And Mollus pointed out that that has nothing to do with, you know, deficiency syndrome. So, um, he said Montagnier just... walked away. No more... no more questions.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if Ray has heard Carrie Mullis talk about Luc Montagnier and Peter Duesberg.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it's becoming too dangerous for him to speak, right? Yeah, but then, 30 years later, the science world turned away from him.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi comments on the danger of speaking out in science.

**RAY PEAT:** I haven't looked closely at how they pick up the signals and analyze it, but they say that they're getting signals, sort of an echo in the water, which if people don't challenge it. I don't know. You have to approximate the measuring system before you can say it simply doesn't exist.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about Luc Montagnier's work on bacteria and DNA emitting electromagnetic waves.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he was actually able to replicate the HIV virus across two different containers of a serum and the second one didn't have any, but it was in close proximity, didn't have any traces of the virus and he confirmed this with a PCR test. But if the second container was in close proximity to the one that contained the virus and both of them were in a resonating field of the Schumann resonance frequency, which I think is between six and ten hertz, the earth apparently emitted, then apparently after about twelve hours, he could actually prove that the second container was able to fully replicate the virus if you give it the starting materials. Like if you give it like a, you know, an RNA. And the actual enzyme, I guess, DNA polymerase, is that what it's called? Yeah, that sort of thing has been around, I think it was in 1940, someone was adding proteins to different types of cells. And finding that the cell could replicate and that the offspring would still contain that protein and they would do it for several generations. And one of these was showing that with extreme techniques for removing any contaminating. A protein that they would calculate the amount of protein coming out of the cell and it would be thousands of times greater than the amount of protein the cell had been exposed to a foreign protein and very clear evidence that on a single exposure a human cell......could absorb and copy and produce unlimited quantities of a foreign protein. Meaning that it had not only copied DNA, it had translated the protein into RNA or DNA and then used the nucleic acid to produce......endless quantities of that protein. The amount after a hundred generations or so they said would be thousands of tons of starting material if it had been a matter of absorption and dilution.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi elaborates on Luc Montagnier's experiment with replicating the HIV virus and its implications.

**RAY PEAT:** If two people, one of them HIV positive or, you know, carrying any other virus or pathogen really for that matter are in close proximity for a sufficiently long period of time and we're all bathing in Schumann residence all the time because that's what the earth emits as electromagnetic frequency, wouldn't that imply that we could potentially replicate the infection into a healthy person without any actual physical pathogen in exchanging places? So there's no need for direct infection.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if proximity to an infected person, under Schumann resonance, could lead to replication of infection in a healthy person without direct pathogen exchange.

**RAY PEAT:** Um, but I think it works the other way that, uh, the healthy person is going to, uh, give the sick person, uh, uh, a boost at eradicate problem. I think that's how life has been working all along, uh, bacteria, uh, a little particle of new DNA, uh, that they created to make them immune. Uh, to something in the environment, such as an antibiotic, uh, to pass it on to other bacteria to replicate, uh, and protect themselves, uh, and, uh, whether it requires, uh, passing a chunk of DNA or simply the information needed to make the DNA protein, uh, I think the protective healing effect, uh, is likely to be predominant, uh, unless the __________________. The whole system is so sick that it's on the way to dying as a whole.

**CONTEXT:** Ray responds to Georgi's question about replication of infection, suggesting a healthy person can boost a sick person.

**RAY PEAT:** Right. So would you say it's a sort of like an averaging effect? So if you have more healthy organisms in the community and then let's say like you have five organisms, three are healthy, two are sick, then on average you'll have like, I don't know, three-fifths of a healthy person per person. I mean, I know I'm simplifying it, but because I'm tying this to cameras work on seriality and how ________________________________________________ systems tend to approximate each other and imitate each other. So the whole community tends toward like a similarity or an average of sorts. So would you say that there will be like a slight decline in the health of the healthy person and a boost in the sick one? Or is it strictly a one directional thing where the healthy people are pulling the sick towards health and it's just a matter of the number of the healthy people you have?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if it's an averaging effect where healthy people's health declines slightly while sick people improve, or if it's a unidirectional pull towards health.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think there's sort of a ratchet on it in the direction of surviving healthy and superior individuals. Okay. And it requires a sickness of the whole community before you get regression.

**CONTEXT:** Ray clarifies that the effect is a ratchet towards healthier individuals, requiring widespread sickness for regression.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay. So the reason I'm asking this is because I'm sure as you've said in several interviews that we should be, we should try to surround ourselves with healthy, you know. Positively minded people and that, you know, certain people can be really toxic, which leads me to another question I'll ask later on, but So if if a healthy person is more or less, I don't want to say immune But if it's the sick people that benefit then there shouldn't be a danger really if if we're surrounded by sick Negatively minded people or is there another mechanism through which they can hurt our health?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if surrounding oneself with negatively minded people poses a danger if only sick people benefit from proximity to healthy individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think so If they're well if you have for example a geographic area where sick people have accumulated because of some cultural habits like like drug use then you can have such a sick environment that it would take a big infusion. of healthy people and there would be social, political conflict between the people with the unhealthy culture. You have to look at the number of people supporting an unhealthy culture and the number of people running around obediently wearing masks. Behaving stupidly reaches a point where it feels like it's bad for one's health.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that a sick environment can be detrimental, especially when unhealthy cultural habits are prevalent.

**RAY PEAT:** Speaking of that, you know, last time we did this, I was in a smaller town called Pichai and we came to Chiang Mai, which is like a bigger city in Thailand. And to get to the good grocery store, you have to go into a mall. And so you have to like put a QR code. Right now, I think it's kind of voluntary, but you're you're expected to do it a QR code. Wash your hands, which I don't do get temperature checked and then be screened by like a thermal scanner. And that's just to get into the mall. And then there's guards on not like there's people watching people on from each level of the mall. And then to get into the grocery store, you have you're expected to also do a QR code. And to write your name down and to get temperature checked. And so, uh, yeah, it's, uh, it's definitely hitting, uh, like a, a reality check point of just total insanity. And then also I didn't wear my mask or I wore it and then took it off when I got into the store and a woman chased me throughout the, the store to tell me to put it back on. And so I could see how a non-crazy person might be okay with that, but it definitely reduces, uh, it makes me crazy. You know, and so it's, it's hard, it's hard to handle, um, for sure.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi describes his experience with stringent COVID-19 protocols in a mall in Thailand.

**RAY PEAT:** Ray, did you guys, both of you guys, do you see, sorry, go ahead, Ray. What was the, no, no, no, just many statements, but I was just, it was just a realization because the Peach Town was very small and they didn't have these, uh, orders to do this kind of stuff. And then coming to the bigger city was a realization of what life was going, like, I guess the TSA ification of daily tasks. And if like, and the TSA is one situation where it makes my blood pressure go up, like through the roof. And so that, that just sounds like a terrible life and fits into that killer austerity idea that we've been talking about a lot.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi contrasts his experience in a small town with a larger city, highlighting the "TSA-ification" of daily life.

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, yeah, the, the, the, the, even when people are, are alone, walking down a pre-lined street with no one within 200 feet, wearing a mask and hot weather, obviously suffering, I don't know, pitiful or something to see such terrible obedience.

**CONTEXT:** Ray comments on the pitiful sight of people wearing masks unnecessarily.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, don't worry Ray, because apparently the experts say that. Protests of up to 100 people are OK, but social outdoor gatherings of only up to 12 people and then. I mean, it's it's aren't they is the population so dumbed like this is an obvious showing of the hand of something because it's so absurd. But what do you think. What do you think the point of them even putting this stuff up stuff out through the news is it's like it's so bizarre. That they would these would be talking points on the news.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi questions the absurdity of the rules and the point of the news disseminating such information.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that thing about the hundred people allowed with the protest. It shows that if people just ignore them, they'll change their rules so that they seem to be in control.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that protests of a certain size being allowed indicates that authorities will change rules to maintain a sense of control.

**RAY PEAT:** And since you have a broad, broad view of these types of things, I did want to talk about. Like race a little bit, like what is your over the course of your life, what is your general perception of how racial tensions get stoked just in your experience?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about Ray's perception of how racial tensions are stoked.

**RAY PEAT:** I took a couple of trips into and through the southern states 1960 and 1964. And... even though I thought of myself as being a white person, I was for some reason seen by the natives as at least as dangerous as a black person. I'm not sure what it was, but I narrowly escaped getting killed a couple of times once on each trip. And... I stayed away after the second time for about 30 years, but I saw it as just the worst sort of sadistic xenophobia. I can see why black people would... shuffle and say, yes, if I hadn't thought that would have saved me, I might have tried to... but something about my face or my manner made them want to kill me.

**CONTEXT:** Ray recounts his experiences in the Southern states in the 1960s, where he was perceived as dangerous.

**RAY PEAT:** Just they just targeted you for some unknown reason? It must have been that I had an out-of-state driver's license and fat sideburns and probably dressed in an unconventional way. I'm not sure, but... You could see the hatred emanating when I would stop at a gas station or something.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks for more details about why Ray was targeted.

**RAY PEAT:** On those trips, I talked to only one......sane person in the whole South who was an Irishman, a motel owner, an immigrant from Ireland, and somehow he was surviving there, but it was a general culture of total obedience to some......some mysterious standard of being.

**CONTEXT:** Ray describes encountering only one "sane" person during his trips to the South.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they aren't really doing anything threatening to the system, getting city council people to say they'll defund... the police. What does that mean? That the police will incorporate, privatize, and then be autonomous? Somehow, the whole system has to be broken up. Crime has to be recognized when it's committed by police.

**CONTEXT:** Ray discusses the ineffectiveness of current protests and the need to break up the system.

**RAY PEAT:** But... the Nazis and Klansmen have infiltrated many of the police departments, so there is organized racism and classism wanting to kill homeless people as well as black people.

**CONTEXT:** Ray points out the infiltration of police departments by Nazis and Klansmen, leading to organized racism and classism.

**RAY PEAT:** In one of your interviews you spoke about how the Occupy Wall Street movement could have been the really the real party for... for everybody, for the majority of the population, but it got infiltrated and manipulated away from making any real demands, and there were also snipers ready to take out the real leaders. Have you seen something similar happening with the current Black Lives Matter movement?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if Ray sees similarities between the infiltration of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, by avoiding the general class question, making it too narrow... and the things that won't get real continuous support. A lot of the people that voted for Trump had mistaken understanding about what class is and what really threatens them. And those people should be......incorporated into a reform that eliminates crime in all directions, but especially obliterates the organized crime of the police forces.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that movements fail by avoiding the class question and alienating potential supporters.

**RAY PEAT:** I would never stick up for police. I've never met a police officer that I liked or had any positive experiences with them. But was there any kind of change? Because the dominant narrative right now is that white supremacists are the most. This paper talking about white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19. And then, the- the- the- basic ideas of like a white privilege or white savior complex or white guilt or white fragility and these terms just being like, uh, I don't know so synonymous with like activism nowadays, but it's it's it's oddly some kind of like overt racism, you know, and so again, I don't have I don't I don't care about uh defending white people that I could care less but it just seems a little bit odd that that is the dominant narrative that so-called like using air quotes white people are responsible for all the the problems that we're seeing nowadays

**CONTEXT:** Georgi questions the dominant narrative of white supremacy as a public health issue and the use of terms like "white privilege."

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when Martin Luther King began emphasizing the problems of white people almost immediately that was when he got killed made it a non-racial but a class issue

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that Martin Luther King Jr. was killed after he began emphasizing the problems of white people, shifting the focus to a class issue.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I guess that's what I'm getting at like i i don't doubt that there's the actual racism for sure but like what how is that used to i don't know occupy the minds of people in favor of not thinking about class and just somebody that doesn't know what class is like what what how would you define that

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks how racism is used to distract from class issues.

**RAY PEAT:** The simply not possessing property, not having the social power and privilege above the middle income in the country, people... are able to think of going to college and buying a house and so on. The lower half of the population realizes or should realize that they are in the lower class, but they've been taught to call everyone down to about $15,000 a year income middle class. But just turning the thought process to thinking about will it be possible to have those things, to get the education you want and to be secure, or will you always be struggling to rise socially?

**CONTEXT:** Ray defines class as not possessing property or social power, and notes how the definition of "middle class" is manipulated.

**RAY PEAT:** For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov What's happening now with the pandemic is clearly designed to destroy all of those people who have thought of themselves as the middle class, and some of the actual middle class is going down. As the unemployment rate goes up. Lots lots of small and medium-sized businesses are failing and if traditional cyclic unemployment if it was causing hundreds of thousands of deaths by by suicide and alcoholism and drugs imagine what the destruction of all of these businesses and jobs. Will do it will be killing millions of people.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains how the pandemic is designed to destroy the middle class and the devastating impact of business failures and job losses.

**RAY PEAT:** This is a bit of a me we can touch upon this in the last show but isn't this a bit of a plane with fire on behalf of the powers that be and at some point. You know a lot of people in this country armed if you push them into a corner there's no there's no telling what they will do i mean and there's largely no controlling them or do you think they're firmly under control and. They will never revolt or you know cause another civil war god knows what else.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the current situation is playing with fire and if people will revolt.

**RAY PEAT:** The people causing their problems have tremendous security forces. People like Fauci, you can't even get close to a scientific meeting to ask a question. They aren't subject to a force of that sort. They don't have anyone to shoot, despite. How many guns do they have? They're infinitely outgunned, so that sort of revolt is worse than useless.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that those causing problems have security forces, making revolt futile.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, since it's already underway, do you expect sort of like a large scale kind of collapse here in the United States in the next few years?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about the likelihood of a large-scale collapse in the US.

**RAY PEAT:** I can't see how it can do anything but get worse. Until maybe if 5 or 10 million people would start rejecting orders and instructions, that might cause a movement that could save the whole country, the whole world.

**CONTEXT:** Ray believes the situation will worsen unless a significant number of people reject orders.

**RAY PEAT:** Do you think the declining population of the young has… something to do with the fact that people are so obedient and willing to follow orders? I mean, I'm sure you've seen the news where they say… There are studies that have come out that say that now a 30-year-old person on average has the same health, or, you know, bad health, as a person who is 60 years old. So the young have become the old. There's no chronological and biological age… have basically completely diverged. You know, you can use to be… you can tell a person's… biological age, in other words, health, by kind of asking them how old they are. These days, you're just as likely to find cancer in an 18-year-old as potentially in a 40-year-old, right? Do you see this as contributing to the problem?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the declining health of the young contributes to obedience and if the divergence of chronological and biological age is a problem.

**RAY PEAT:** Going in that direction, definitely. The allergies and systemic inflammation is becoming the worst plague. And young Americans… are dying at a higher rate than most other countries from the coronavirus because of the background of extreme vaccination, use of birth control and other estrogen, SSRI, increasing serotonin exposure, all kinds of pro-inflammatory things that make young people in this country a lot more… …vulnerable to relatively harmless viruses like the corona or…

**CONTEXT:** Ray confirms that allergies and systemic inflammation are major issues, exacerbated by vaccination, birth control, and other pro-inflammatory factors, making young Americans vulnerable.

**RAY PEAT:** There is a horrible video floating around of like an eight-year-old boy and his like mom is holding his hand and there's two nurses giving him multiple vaccine injections while he's like screaming and like it's like it's really one of the most disturbing things I've watched in a long time. But they only gave him like four or five vaccines. But I know that they need to get many, many, many more. But it was just a video that perfectly encapsulated that that process.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi describes a disturbing video of an eight-year-old boy receiving multiple vaccine injections.

**RAY PEAT:** The one last question about race, Ray, as a biologist. What is racism just like a product of a low IQ individual? Is there a biological imperative to seek out your own type of person?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if racism is a product of low IQ or a biological imperative.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't think it's biological, but going into a pure indigenous population. Sometimes I got off the road in Mexico and I would find myself among oddly closed indigenous people. They didn't seem unfriendly, but they were definitely puzzled by having such a strange person there. I think it depends on their experience as a group if they haven't been robbed or attacked by foreigners. They just are curious and wonder why you're so different, but other groups will get together and organize some ways to get rid of you, but I think that's all cultural and based on their group experience and stereotypes that have developed.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that racism is not biological but cultural, based on group experiences and stereotypes.

**RAY PEAT:** You Speaking of, I want to kind of finish up the topic of the collapse, so what do you think is the end game here? You said before it's a streamlined economy so there can be better chance of competing with China. Is that what it's all about, just competing with the new empire?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about the end game of the collapse and if it's about competing with China.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, bringing the empire rapidly to absolute world power. Control and and China is the big massive impediment to that and so they see China prepared to do a better job of automating everything and increasing efficiency and so they want to hurt all of the economies and. Be the only ones who reach the automation through artificial intelligence and use that along with some kind of fear to control people. There might be something other than viruses, but viruses are… currently doing the job that they'll save us with vaccines. And if vaccines don't work, then they'll require everyone to take some kind of a drug, but anything to get people obedient enough to take their treatments.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains the end game is world power and control, with China as an impediment, and the use of automation, fear, and vaccines to achieve this.

**RAY PEAT:** So do you think China jumped on this as an opportunity as well to even further streamline and put its own population under control? Because they must be seeing through this charade for what it is, but they seem to be going along with it at least partially as well.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if China is using the situation to further control its population.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think part of that is a matter of sophistication. Very few people are talking about the germ warfare thing. It briefly came out in February or March, each side accusing the other of deliberately spreading it to weaken the other's economy. But anyone who knows the actual history knows that the U.S. has been in the business. For the whole 20th century, basically. And so, China doesn't want to get in that competition, I suppose.

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that germ warfare accusations between the US and China are part of a competition, with the US having a history in this area.

**RAY PEAT:** That's the only confusing thing for me. I feel like the war tension with Russia has been being stoked for a long time. And again, I could be just ignorant, but the China thing doesn't seem like they've been pushing that as hard. Like, even... What was that? Romney and Obama, and Romney said Russia was the largest threat, and Obama said the 1950s called and they wanted their foreign policy back, or whatever. But like, since the Hillary and Trump in 2016, there's been like a war drum for Russia, but you're saying there's tension specifically between the US and China, but also the US tends to, or these certain think groups, tends to praise China, how they're handling... coronavirus, and then implementing the changes they've made here. And so maybe it's like more of a friendly competition or something? Who would see it as friendly? Again, just my ignorant point of view. You're saying it's a tension between China and the US of what's happening right now. Like that's why all this stuff is happening, to maintain the dominant empire.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi expresses confusion about the US's focus on Russia versus China and asks if the current situation is about maintaining US dominance.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, China's population being so huge relative to the US, and the US population is huge relative to Russia, so the real drift of history is strongly in the direction of China now that they've got an efficient economy. is almost a determinant of the outcome. And so extraordinary measures are needed to change that trend of history.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that China's large population and efficient economy are shifting the balance of history, requiring extraordinary measures from the US.

**RAY PEAT:** And then one last question on this. We might have talked about this the first time, but are things declining despite the elites conspiring to do these things? Like, do the elites know that there is a bad time coming ahead, therefore, coronavirus, racial tension, etc., etc., or is it totally manufactured by them? I heard that Bill Gates, his income has been a billion dollars a week. During the lockdown, no, I think it's exactly what what they want, nothing hurts them.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the current events are a conspiracy by elites who know a bad time is coming, or if it's entirely manufactured.

**RAY PEAT:** So if the population is the determining factor, all other things being equal in developed economies, like let's say China, Russia and the United States, then wouldn't it make sense for the United States as bad as it sounds to do something nefarious to, I don't know, decimate China's population, but prop up its own? Instead of decimating its own population or is or does the Empire not really care about the United States as a country? It's more like a transnational Cabal that that can be can sort of The Industry went to China and so at most Americans are useless in the sense of producing profit for the financial class and so they aren't going to lose anything if suddenly millions and millions of middle class and lower class Americans start dying off. Their income is going to accelerate for quite a while in proportion to the die-off of masses of Americans.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi questions whether the US would decimate China's population instead of its own, and if the "Empire" cares about the US as a country.

**RAY PEAT:** But, you know, if all the money went to China, in other words, to paraphrase, it's kind of dangerous, don't you think? The Chinese government can very quickly nationalize the businesses slash profits of these powers that be that just moved their operations there. China doesn't seem to play ball.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi expresses concern about the danger of businesses moving to China and the potential for nationalization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's why they don't want to go right to germ warfare. That's why they don't want to go right to germ warfare, that's why they don't want to Americans own such a big part of the Chinese economy. It's international capital.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains why germ warfare is avoided and the US's stake in the Chinese economy.

**RAY PEAT:** I see. Okay. So it really doesn't really make sense to like speak of countries anymore. It's more like where is the current manufacturing and financial industry concentrated? Where it's deriving its profits from? And currently it's not the United States.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi concludes that it's more about the concentration of manufacturing and financial industry than countries.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that was Trump's point that the United States lost its essential power and has been living on money manipulation since it exported its industry.

**CONTEXT:** Ray agrees with Trump's point about the US losing power after exporting its industry.

**RAY PEAT:** Can I read one quote from William H. Gates, his book Showing Up for Life? He says, every corner we've turned in the field of global health, we found that the Rockefellers were already there and had been there for years. We when we committed to childhood immunization, we found ourselves building on the efforts the Rockefeller Foundation had helped launch and fund in the 1980s, dot, dot, dot. And we learned that such goals are not prizes claimed by the short winded. The Rockefellers stay with tough problems for generations. And so this is just like we talk about. I think of you, Ray, as following in this tradition of great scientists, you know, and William H. Gates is and his son. Are following in the great or the terrible shadow of these eugenicists. And so people think or are trained to think that there's no patterns to any of this and it's all random and that you shouldn't investigate these things.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi reads a quote from William H. Gates about the Rockefeller Foundation's involvement in global health and compares it to Ray's work and the Gates family's legacy.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, someone sent me a letter they had from some government official. Denouncing the people who asked questions and suggested fraud, they said that you aren't experts, we aren't experts, we have to listen to the expert opinion, but the trouble is who picks those experts, the mindless crooks, are defined as experts. Defined as top scientists by the the financial world.

**CONTEXT:** Ray shares an anecdote about a government official denouncing those who question authority and defining "experts" by the financial world.

**RAY PEAT:** We can we can move on to health stuff after this. I did I did get many requests for us to talk about like the esoteric uh part of the elite and so I have on screen here the Jacob Rothschild with that the Marina Abramović women. And so like there's clearly some element of mysticism or like Luciferianism or religious context for a lot of the things the elites do and I asked you a long time ago and you said it was more of like a window dressing thing, but more of a window dressing.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about the esoteric and mystical elements of the elite's practices.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, I think they're the real philosophy. It's a worse than any of the Christian heresies or demonisms and such. I think it's the belief that they can encode reality and that reality is a... computable and controllable, basically by defining it as a quantized, digitizable something. In other words, an absolute mentalism, or idealism, that... far beyond these little culturish ideas, but it's a seeing of reality as lacking everything that you feel as a living part of experience. The thing that animals and kids feel... the intrinsic fluidity of being, they believe or assert that it is all absolutely at base, nothing but symbols and digitizable symbols. So everything reduces to... isolated quanta of existence, and these ultimately are explainable only by randomness.

**CONTEXT:** Ray describes the elite's philosophy as a belief in encoding and controlling reality through quantization and digitization, reducing it to symbols.

**RAY PEAT:** So in other words, reality is fully computable, right? Absolutely. That started being the explicit language in the 1930s, and by the 19... 50s, it had become such a religion that people like Norbert Wiener and Vannevar Bush, who believed in an analog approach to cybernetics and reality, in which all of the in-betweens exist and are meaningful and controllable. Not just the definable quantized units, Wiener and Bush were just written out of science. Wiener was ostracized at MIT, pretty much the way Peter Duisburg has been at California. Meanwhile Chomsky represented the vanguard of this. A mentalistic, Conrad-Lorentzian, fascist view of reality, claiming that you don't need an experience of language. It could all be dealt with objectively as particles ultimately. connected to genes which are similar quantized units and you can't experience them, you can infer them. So everything is abstract inference from symbols to symbols, eliminating all continuity and ultimately meaning. Chomsky was working for the Pentagon, basically financed by them, creating language schemes that would work to give organization and instructions to troops through computers. While he was posing as an anti-imperialist, anti-militarist, he was socializing with top people in the Pentagon. He even supported a Pentagon guy as Chancellor of MIT and Norbert Wiener was going into obscurity because of supporting a holistic view of cybernetics and reality.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains how the concept of reality as computable and digitizable gained traction in the 1930s and 50s, leading to the ostracization of scientists with analog views.

**RAY PEAT:** So do you think that some of the reasons behind this push to really restrict life? And what people are allowed to do and how they are allowed to behave and it really like the way their consciousness functions some of the reasons behind that push is because. I guess they quickly realized that that computers are really powerless at emulating intelligence in its full richness and fluidity so they said well guess what. Which is gonna make people behave like computers and it will be a lot more easier to emulate them and we're gonna cause we're gonna call it a success because the computer will be able to emulate the human. But the human is no longer a human. It's acting like a computer.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the push to restrict life and behavior is because computers are powerless at emulating intelligence, leading to a desire to make humans behave like computers.

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. It's all authoritarianism put into an ideology of idealism.

**CONTEXT:** Ray agrees that it's authoritarianism disguised as idealism.

**RAY PEAT:** I just want to point out that they're standing in front of Sir Thomas Lawrence Satan summoning his legions and I thought I looked at it and it looked I didn't know who the painting was and. It looked a little like William Blake to me, and then I realized it, of course, wasn't in Blake's Satan calling up his legions by Blake is about 1000 times better. But yeah, and then we don't have to dwell on it, but the gates implantable quantum dot microneedle uses an enzyme called a Lucifer race and. So do you think this is a. Like a way of more of a way of control, like didn't Michael Aquino like the temple of set in the temple of Satan and so that that might if you tell a person the elite their doctrine is to do whatever you feel like that's a perfect way to get people on really compromising situations. Just just the fact that you can get them to submit to the treatment. Everything is over then. If they submit to it, there's no need to even use the technology because they're already victimized.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi points out a painting and mentions the Gates implantable quantum dot microneedle using "Luciferase," questioning if it's a form of control.

**RAY PEAT:** Bizarre answers that you thought were like because they were damaged by the school system and they couldn't really see what Blake really meant Do you remember that that that occurrence and what the discussion was about? No, I don't remember the conversation.

**CONTEXT:** Ray asks if Georgi remembers a discussion about William Blake and the school system's influence.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay lots lots of published critics have Superficially Blake used language ironically used the language of the angels by whom he meant satanic powers but he called it the angels inverting things and a lot of critics have totally misunderstood what he was saying totally blind to the meaning of what he was saying and thought he was on the side of the angels who he was describing as satanic sadists so what do you think he meant that there's a famous quote what is it the god the fox provides for himself but god provides for the lion that's a very famous quote what do you think he is referring to is it an allegory of some sort? what was it what? is it an allegory of some sort? an analogy?

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that critics misunderstand William Blake's use of language, particularly his ironic use of "angels" to mean satanic powers. He then asks about a Blake quote.

**RAY PEAT:** no, no, just that reality is variable I see the lion is governed by appetite and fox uses cleverness the lion is physically more powerful than a fox and it might have been slightly allegorical, but he didn't have anything against foxes or cleverness, but he did say that trickery and imposed meanings were used to enslave people.

**CONTEXT:** Ray interprets the Blake quote as reality being variable, with the lion representing appetite and the fox representing cleverness.

**RAY PEAT:** Horses of instruction was another thing. Horses are enslaved and learn their lessons. That's analogous to people who are obedient and do their jobs. Many mainstream critics seem to portray Blake as a religious fanatic, but my understanding of him is that he was actually highly critical of traditional Christianity. He thought that that's an image of the demons, the church and all of its structure and all the rules that it creates. Does that ring a bell as a true statement?

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains Blake's concept of "horses of instruction" as analogous to obedient people and his criticism of traditional Christianity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's where his ironic language comes in. It was the whole meaning of much of what he wrote. And if you don't see that the angels are Satan in the sense of evil and that the devils are the oppressed who have the potential to rebel and save some life. Like the Claude and the Pebble, the Claude was a person who obediently accepts that God is in heaven and everything is okay, and the Claude gets trampled all day, and the Pebble, who is tough and resistant, takes care of himself and doesn't. He doesn't fall for the orders and instructions and enslavement.

**CONTEXT:** Ray elaborates on Blake's ironic language, explaining that "angels" represent evil and "devils" represent the oppressed with potential for rebellion. He uses the analogy of "Claude" and "Pebble" to illustrate obedience versus resistance.

**RAY PEAT:** So in other words, if there is truth, we will have to discover ourselves not to be told by some third party, be that God or whoever else is in position of power.

**CONTEXT:** Ray emphasizes that truth must be discovered individually, not dictated by authority.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you have some of the Pebble's toughness, you can get through the oppression.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that having the "Pebble's toughness" is necessary to overcome oppression.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what I thought, it's kind of sad because, you know, we need pebbles in order to, you know, the toughness of the pebble in order to get through these trying times, but at the same time it seems that the health of the younger generations has been so compromised, things are not really looking up very good right now. I mean, there are not many pebbles like you said.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi laments the lack of "pebbles" (resilient individuals) and the compromised health of younger generations.

**RAY PEAT:** Speaking of variable reality, I have a question here about LSD and hallucinations and they say is there a relationship between hallucinations and serotonin and like kind of add on to that, are the hallucinations separate from the drugs effects on the serotonin system? And so what are your thoughts on that?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about the relationship between hallucinations, serotonin, and LSD.

**RAY PEAT:** The accumulating evidence for the first 15 or so... years was very clear that LSD was a simple anti-serotonin action and that serotonin in overdose can make you crazy and hallucinate but it's a misery experience not an enlightenment experience. And the small amounts of LSD that will oppose serotonin on blood vessels and smooth muscles, all of the visible systems of the body, LSD is protective against serotonin and the stress experience. An unavoidable stress poisons you with serotonin, increases your tendency to be obedient, to want to be controlled from the outside. And a little bit of LSD by blocking the serotonin can open a person up, get them out of this digitized world.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that LSD has an anti-serotonin action and that serotonin in overdose causes misery and hallucinations, while small amounts of LSD are protective against serotonin and stress.

**RAY PEAT:** There are some interviews with Kerry Mullis in which he suggests that his LSD experience helped him break out of the insane science world and see the actual complexity in looking at any sort of scientific situation if you don't start out. Recognizing and assuming the infinite complexity of things, you're going to fall for all kinds of arguments. All of the mechanisms of science start seeming plausible to the degree that you accept the basic idea that the world is reducible to digitized symbols. And when you when you see it's a continuous, infinitely complex thing, then you can actually start looking at the data as objective data, but tremendously complex at every point. And every point needs to be explained in the argument. Almost 100 percent of the so-called scientific literature advances without examining the meaning of almost any of their words. They pile one word and one mechanism on top of the other to arrive at some predetermined goal. And they say that's... That's the result of their scientific investigation. It's all essentially a kind of authoritarian, religious blather.

**CONTEXT:** Ray references Kerry Mullis's LSD experience, suggesting it helped him see the complexity of scientific situations and break free from a reductionist worldview.

**RAY PEAT:** I feel like a first-year philosophy student asking you this, but if the culture tends to increase serotonin and serotonin influences the visual perception... Are things, maybe at a certain level, when somebody takes LSD, are the things they're seeing more real than what a person might see day-to-day? Does that make any sense?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if things seen under LSD could be more real than everyday perceptions, given the culture's tendency to increase serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** Very often they are. It was the drug industry that caught on to the idea of promoting serotonin and tryptophan. They wanted to get rid of that LSD idea and so they said that if LSD makes you insane it's because it's blocked your serotonin so you have to increase your serotonin to make your mind work, emotions work properly. But it was driven by the drug industry, and serotonin is really primarily a stress emergency signal and hormone.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that LSD-induced perceptions can often be more real and explains how the drug industry promoted serotonin to discredit LSD.

**RAY PEAT:** Again, again, correct me if I'm wrong, but if that is more real than what I am currently seeing right now, is there a way to mimic that to some extent, or is that just not possible given the environment we live in?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the LSD-induced perception can be mimicked or if it's impossible in the current environment.

**RAY PEAT:** A lot of that is the overdose effect, but in someone like Terry Mullis, they come back from it. And realize how flexible the knowing process is, but just coffee and good health and good experience will duplicate just about everything up to that. I think the most important thing that the expanded consciousness does is to realize that consciousness extends through both time and space, that you are present in the oncoming future as well as the recent and more distant past. The digital civilization doesn't want people to experience themselves in that way. And when you're doing that, when you're experiencing yourself extending through time and space, you see a person's arguments and how they're mounting their argument and usually mounting it on fraudulent assumptions and concepts. It helps you ask the right questions to, if possible, knock their phony structure apart.

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that coffee, good health, and experience can mimic some of the effects of LSD, and emphasizes that expanded consciousness involves realizing consciousness extends through time and space, which the digital civilization opposes.

**RAY PEAT:** Two questions, one related to LSD and one to consciousness. What do you say to people who would bring up studies that show that selective serotonin antagonists... such as ciproheptadine and ketanserine can both prevent the hallucination trip from an LSD and actually can also stop one that is already in progress. Wouldn't that give credence to the idea that the trip from LSD is somehow connected to the serotonin system?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about studies showing serotonin antagonists preventing LSD hallucinations and if this supports a connection between LSD trips and the serotonin system.

**RAY PEAT:** I think some of the hallucination type experiences come from... the overdose effect of LSD starting to act like ergot and serotonin and constricting blood vessels in the brain, shedding off energy production and leading to distortion of perception rather than opening and amplification.

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that some LSD-induced hallucinations stem from an overdose effect, leading to constricted blood vessels and distorted perception.

**RAY PEAT:** I see, but the hallucinations are really not necessary for the... for the positive effect of the drug to occur. They're just more of a side effect.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if hallucinations are necessary for the drug's positive effects or if they are a side effect.

**RAY PEAT:** Not at all. They're a harmful side effect. All right. Well, many people... Okay, that's quite a revelation because many people who use LSD, I think, a significant majority of them, I would dare say, are probably using it specifically for the trip. They think it's what gives them this religious experience of feeling oneness with the world and the ego dissolution, but... If I'm hearing correctly, this is just a side effect, they're actually the real benefits of the drug for the opposition to serotonin, and even much lower dosages would be sufficient. There's no need to go on a trip to have this benefit.

**CONTEXT:** Ray clarifies that hallucinations are a harmful side effect and that lower doses of LSD are sufficient for its benefits, which are related to opposing serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the range of 10 to 20 micrograms is adequate for expanding consciousness.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that 10 to 20 micrograms of LSD is adequate for expanding consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** I see. So, question related to consciousness, you said that people need to understand that consciousness extends both in space and in time. So, would it be a useful analogy to basically imagine consciousness is, let's say if reality is a lake or like a body of water and we throw a stone in it, so then you have these concentric rings of waves, so would it be a correct analogy to say that consciousness is the totality of those waves, not just the place where the... stone dropped, right, so it's the waves that you've been making in the past and also in the future that are converging in that central point, but the consciousness is really the totality of all of those waves that are in the lake.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if consciousness can be analogized to the totality of waves in a lake, extending through time and space.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so the consciousness isn't in your head. It's never in your head if you're conscious.

**CONTEXT:** Ray confirms the analogy and states that consciousness is not located in the head.

**RAY PEAT:** Right. Can you touch on that a little bit more like you should not like I think a lot of people describe like they're thinking there's like a frontal sensation of I don't know presence or being but you're saying that is not what you necessarily want to feel or you're saying something different.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks for clarification on the sensation of presence or being in the head versus Ray's concept of consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, feeling, feeling being is a very complex. Always changing thing. That's what one wants to do.

**CONTEXT:** Ray describes "feeling being" as complex and ever-changing.

**RAY PEAT:** That actually reminded me of something else I did want to talk to you about, like in I think maybe in nutrition for women, you were talking about feelings in your stomach associated with happiness and things like maybe maybe call it your smile energy or something like what? How much are in our present environment? Are we cut off from these types of things? And given the specific food supply, do you think maybe the real human condition is is much more complex that than maybe what a person experiences day to day and right now?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about "smile energy" or feelings in the stomach associated with happiness and if we are cut off from these in the current environment and food supply.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, your body. As it approaches other beings, these feelings from your heart. And solar plexus, especially. You feel connection, the sort of thing, maybe Luke Montagnier was experiencing that when he thought of how particles interact, but I think those are actual radiation-like experiences or processes in your organism. That are actually interacting. When you feel that you're interacting through those nerve centers in your body, I think you are, in reality, interacting. There have been lots of experiments showing that sort of thing. And that's a very functional......part of consciousness that is easily cut off. The frown of an authority figure will cause your solar plexus or heart plexus to shrink and wither into itself and cut you off from others. And the thing of wearing a mask and having spatial distance......among other things, that's making you have a sense of withered biological interaction. A geometrical spacing of people through a park or building is just a horrible parody of the digitized reality that they're imposing.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that feelings from the heart and solar plexus are actual radiation-like interactions within the organism, which can be cut off by authority figures or measures like masking and spatial distancing.

**RAY PEAT:** So when two people are feeling, when they say, oh, I'm vibing with that person, there is, you're saying that there is actually a very, very objective physical process underlying that feeling of both experience?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the feeling of "vibing" with someone has an objective physical process behind it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Okay. Is it based on digestion or is it based on their consciousness somehow resonating? Or is it, I guess, two sides of the same coin?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if this "vibing" is based on digestion, consciousness resonating, or both.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's... physical resonance of those nerve nodes or plexuses in the body that they are like semi-autonomous nodules. Each one can interact... in its own way, but the whole interaction of the organism comes if you have responsive organisms, and aren't interfered with by the threat of authoritarian opinion.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that it's physical resonance of nerve nodes or plexuses, and that responsive organisms are key to interaction, free from authoritarian interference.

**RAY PEAT:** Speaking of resonance, I'm sure you're familiar with the ideas of Rupert Sheldrake's idea several times. He talks about the morphic resonance fields and reality being essentially a super field composed of many subfields, consciousness being one of them. What are these fields composed of? Is it like ripples in the neutrino sea? Is that what the underlying medium is?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about Rupert Sheldrake's ideas on morphic resonance fields and what they are composed of.

**RAY PEAT:** That's why Horace Dudley's work intrigued me. I had been reading Andrea Puharich's things. Puharich was believing that the autonomic nervous system was creating a vortex in some kind of an ether that would, in a particular state, it would draw in some kind of an ether that would, in a particular state, it would draw in some kind of an ether that would, contact with others regardless of distance and the Michael Persinger sees it in terms of electromagnetic waves but I prefer the Horace Dudley idea that the neutrino scene is fundamental. It's the sub-quantum medium.

**CONTEXT:** Ray mentions Horace Dudley and Andrea Puharich's work on the autonomic nervous system creating vortices and ether, and Michael Persinger's electromagnetic wave theory, preferring Dudley's neutrino sea concept.

**RAY PEAT:** Sheldrake, so the serial events, the synchronicity that Carl Jung spoke about and Kammerer actually tried to define more scientifically, they were both essentially talking about the same overlapping fields that Sheldrake sort of defined 100 years later more accurately.

**CONTEXT:** Ray connects Sheldrake's morphic resonance to Jung and Kammerer's ideas on synchronicity and overlapping fields.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think Sheldrake sometimes lapses over in the slight. Idealism rather than something substantial like electromagnetic fields and neutrino see under the fields.

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests Sheldrake sometimes leans towards idealism rather than substantial fields like electromagnetic fields or the neutrino sea.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, so I've read some of Sheldrake's work and he talks about how like a specific group of people have a collective memory because of their similarity, whether that's physiological or cultural or whatnot. So if let's say if a person of that. A member of the group learns something, then the rest of the members would, if they try to learn the same thing, would be easier because they will be drawing on that sort of like field that the person has created with their own consciousness. Why would this be limited to a specific culture or a group of people? Why wouldn't it be a universal field that everybody contributes to?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks why Sheldrake's morphic resonance fields would be limited to specific groups and not be a universal field.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's the, partly the. Interactions that has a tuning effect. People are embedded in the authoritarian culture which has a suppressive dividing effect. And small groups can create somewhat private culture that gives them some freedom from the big authoritarian. And the authoritarian larger culture, American, European, the historic things that have gone on for thousands of years, having some common properties assumptions, those things suppress us. is the biological connectedness. But when you have a geographical interaction, I think that, just like the health interactions, when you have a certain visible people around you, that lets you tune into each other. to momentarily forget the outside interferences.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that interactions have a tuning effect, and authoritarian culture is suppressive, while small groups can create private cultures for freedom. Geographical interaction allows tuning into each other and forgetting outside interferences.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm sure you're familiar with the ideas of Native Americans about every person having a totem, like a guardian animal, but they also, apparently their culture also has this, what do you call it, myth or not, doesn't matter, but the idea that you can actually draw on the experience of any animal that basically, um, that your group has associated in the past with. So you can essentially learn, you can, you can teach yourself to behave like a bear, live like a bear, and even see the world like a bear. Do you think those, the lack of restrictions in those cultures are what allowing people to draw from the collective consciousness that includes both animals and people?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the lack of restrictions in Native American cultures allows them to draw from a collective consciousness that includes animals.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. I think our real society includes our animal neighbors as well as our human neighbors, often more the animals. The birds, for example, birds seem very aware when someone is different from the pack. They sort of hang around and wonder what's happening.

**CONTEXT:** Ray agrees that society includes animal neighbors and that birds are aware of differences.

**RAY PEAT:** So, what doesn't that give a little bit of... credibility to the argument that vegans would say, well, we don't eat meat because we don't want to eat sentient beings. Of course, it's a little bit duplicitous because plants are also sentient beings, so you have to be eating something at some point, but don't you think that the moral argument of not wanting to eat animals, doesn't that give it a little bit of credibility because those are essentially human... they're not human, but they're beings like us?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the moral argument against eating sentient beings, including animals, has credibility, acknowledging plants are also sentient.

**RAY PEAT:** Of course. When you look at food cosmically, looking at the nature of cosmic energy produced by fusion, presumably, or whatever it is that makes stellar energy flowing through substances, the process of nutrition... You should see it in that cosmic dimension and it happens that the safest nutrition for long life and clear consciousness, unstressed consciousness, happens to be fruit and milk. The milk purifies nutrients and rebalances them in an anti-stress way. With the selection of fruits, the fruit is designed to nourish its seeds or to feed an animal that will distribute the seeds. The seeds would be... unethical to eat, and the body of the fruit would be an absolute positive thing in the cosmic flow of energy.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that the safest nutrition for long life and clear consciousness is fruit and milk, viewing nutrition in a cosmic dimension.

**RAY PEAT:** What about eggs? Would eggs be okay in that framework of thought?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about the acceptability of eggs within this framework.

**RAY PEAT:** Less ideal, but still no sentient process has developed.

**CONTEXT:** Ray considers eggs less ideal but still acceptable as no sentient process has developed.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that reminds me of a, I think somebody wrote you a long time ago and I think they were contemplating suicide or something to the effect of you have to realize there's lots of intelligence left in the world. It's just not human intelligence. Something, something to that effect.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi recalls Ray's advice to someone contemplating suicide, emphasizing the existence of non-human intelligence.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, let's take a mild break here, guys. We have, I don't know how many people are watching this at the moment, but give this episode a like. Huge thank you to Ray, huge thank you to Georgi. These episodes are always super special, so I appreciate it. And Ray, can you just let everybody know how to order your newsletter?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi announces a break and asks Ray how to order his newsletter.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, email raypeachnewsletter at gmail.com. And then I just got the novel flu one a few weeks ago. And so, yeah, you're sending those out via email. I get that question all the time, unless you had any more big questions. I guess we could go through some like logistical supplement food related questions. Georgie. I mean, the question about Pufa and life requesting. Yeah. Okay. So right. I don't know. I think it's like a secondhand quote from somebody else, but maybe you said something to the effect of by the time a person is 30, they have enough proof of the last a lifetime. But one is that accurate? And then to. Yeah, what does that mean in the grand scheme of things? Just it's even more important to keep the total polyunsaturated fat pretty low. Right. I don't think I understood the question. I guess so. Okay. Okay. Just this statement by the time a person is 30, they have as much. Polyunsaturated fat in their tissue to last a lifetime. So that seems seems to presume that there's some use for polyunsaturated fat. I see them as harmful right from the start. A well-fed, healthy mother. When they analyze a newborn's brain. The conventional science says they're all born with a PUFA deficiency, an essential fatty acid deficiency. No, that's the healthy, very high metabolizing brain that has been protected against PUFA by the placenta. But as soon as breastfeeding stops, or... if they start using a formula that has added PUFA, the brain starts assimilating it, forming esters of cholesterol that accumulate, ultimately causing atherosclerosis, but accumulating in the brain and other tissues, slowing metabolism so that constantly, as exactly as the cholesterol level... ester content of PUFA increases, the metabolic rate decreases. And that it simply, by the age of 30 or 40, it's reaching the point that it is causing aging symptoms to set in. And it progresses with the onset of a cold brain. Alzheimer's disease and dementia, the cholesterol ester content of the brain is becoming extreme and blocking metabolism progressively.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that by age 30-40, PUFA accumulation in tissues slows metabolism and causes aging symptoms, and that PUFAs are harmful from the start.

**RAY PEAT:** You're right that it's like a positive thing on the question but I appreciate your answer that makes sense. I have a question so let's say some breeze. I read a study that said that when you're eating a combination of fats, the saturated fat gets preferentially oxidized, while the PUFA gets preferentially stored in the fatty tissue. Doesn't that sort of imply that it would be really, really difficult to change your fatty acid composition through diet, because every time, unless you're eating almost 100% saturated fat diet... I'm under stress. The PUFA... comes out preferentially, and it increases in the fat cells with aging, but that just means that when you're under stress and are releasing free fatty acids, they become more toxic the older you get because you have more of them in the system. But they're also in the phospholipids and cholesterol esters. Not just in the storage fats. So in terms of displacing that PUFA or increasing the ratio of saturated fat to PUFA in the tissues, I think there seems to be more, I don't want to call it more optimal, but the longer chain saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid, stearic acid, anything over chain length of, carbon chain length of 14. Seems to be better because they, these get preferentially absorbed through the lymphatic system and they can get to the tissues, while the shorter chain fatty acids like those found in coconut oil seem to be quickly picked up by the portal vein system and get into the liver and the liver oxidize it. So if somebody wants to change their tissue composition, they need to be eating longer chain saturated fatty acids. Am I reading this right?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if longer chain saturated fatty acids are better for changing tissue composition due to preferential absorption.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are quite a few studies showing longer life. In proportion to the percentage of highly saturated, completely saturated fats and inverse cancer incidents. And do you remember the old vitamin E? People were finding that the crude vitamin E had a stamina. Increasing effect, but it turned out when they refined it a little more, it was the very long chain saturated fats were providing the protective athletic endurance and stamina increasing effect of wasn't the vitamin E, but with the waxing material associated with it and. Since refining vitamin E has eliminated those waxy, highly saturated, long chain fats, the studies of vitamin E are no longer so positive.

**CONTEXT:** Ray cites studies showing longer life and inverse cancer incidence with higher saturated fat intake, and explains how refining vitamin E removed beneficial long-chain saturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** You mean the polycosinols, the ones that the Cubans are running studies with for cardiovascular disease? Yeah, yeah. So yeah, I remember, yeah, those studies seem to abruptly stop around the late 40s, the ones that talked about the wheat germ oil, the stamina effect of wheat germ oil, and then they purified it, they found out it's the long chain fats, the fat acid alcohols, and then the Cubans started doing some research with those, and I feel like as soon as the Cubans picked up on that, because they extracted them from sugar cane, then a whole... slew of studies came out in the United States, and actually in the general Western medical press saying, this is a complete scam, these things do not work, this is communist science, you know, this, but it seems like this is so strange because the original science happened in the United States, it was just before the 1950s.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi discusses polycosanols and their studies, noting how research in the US stopped after Cuban studies emerged, labeling it "communist science."

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, science is all about marketing. You just shouldn't believe... 98% of the things published as science, it's everything except some cosmology and some physics. Everything else tends to be marketing.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that science is largely about marketing, with exceptions in cosmology and physics.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, so would you say that these extremely long chain fatty acids like the polycosinols are actually better at displacing the PUFA in the tissues?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if long-chain fatty acids like polycosanols are better at displacing PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so.

**CONTEXT:** Ray agrees.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay. Do you have a recommendation for someone, because they actually sell this, assuming someone can get it as a pure powder or supplement. Most of the Cuban studies say just 10 to 20 milligrams a day is enough. And that seems to be what all those studies with the unrefined vitamin E, that seems to be what a daily intake would provide. Do you have any recommendation on specific dosages?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks for dosage recommendations for polycosanols.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's about the right quantity.

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests 10-20 milligrams per day is the right quantity.

**RAY PEAT:** Ray, the ketone...go ahead. Well, related to the lipophosphine, but I guess you can ask about the ketone. I just wanted to go over the ketone body ratio again, because I think that is...I think the very dominant alt-paradigm right now is keto, fasting, low-carb, carnivore diets, and some of the big proponents in that camp and camps similar. They talk about that... fasting and ketosis increase NAD relative to NADH. And given the ketone-body ratio, it seems like... And they'll quote these two papers, I should have wrote them down. But that seems impossible given the limited investigation I've done on the ketone-body ratio. It's like so clear that any...

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks to revisit the ketone body ratio, noting the popular keto, fasting, and carnivore diets and their claims about NAD/NADH ratios.

**RAY PEAT:** All of the best biochemists... that I know of, showed that diabetes and fasting caused extreme reduction of NADH rather than NAD shift towards the cancer physiology.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that the best biochemists he knows show that diabetes and fasting reduce NADH, not shift it towards cancer physiology.

**RAY PEAT:** Is that happening in every system equally? Do different systems compensate when the stress first starts to appear or something?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if this happens equally in all systems and if systems compensate for stress.

**RAY PEAT:** I think... very bad biochemical technique always messes up the reduction balance analysis. Glutathione and NADH are so sensitive to conditions that I think in the last 30 years or so, most of the... work published is doctrine rather than fact.

**CONTEXT:** Ray attributes inaccuracies in reduction balance analysis to bad biochemical technique and suggests much published work is doctrine rather than fact.

**RAY PEAT:** I have a little bit of clarification on that. I think most of these papers are measuring the NAD to the NADH ratio in the cytosol. And in the cancer cell, you actually, in the diabetic cell, the NAD to the NADH ratio in the cytosol of these six cells is actually very high because those cells are using pyruvate as an emergency oxidant and they're generating lactate. But the mitochondrial ratio of NAD to the NADH is actually very low in cancer, diabetes, and fasting. So I would like to see those papers. Where did they measure that ratio? Because even the Wikipedia page on the Randall cycle talks about fatty acid oxidation dramatically shifting the redox balance towards reduction in the mitochondria. So that seems to be already sort of like commonly accepted knowledge.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi clarifies that most papers measure the NAD/NADH ratio in the cytosol, where it's high in cancer/diabetic cells, but low in mitochondria. He questions where the studies measured the ratio.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and some of the ketones so-called are not ketones. The beta-hydroxybutyrate, they call that a ketone body, but it's not a ketone. And it's not a ketone. It's not a ketone. It shifts cell balance the same way that lactic acid does. It's a reductant.

**CONTEXT:** Ray points out that beta-hydroxybutyrate is not a ketone and acts as a reductant, similar to lactic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** And I know you've gone over this a hundred thousand times, but when somebody does benefit from a ketosis style of diet, you hypothesize maybe that it's disinfecting their intestine possibly to some way and maybe they're changing their food just better quality in general.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks Ray's hypothesis for why some people benefit from ketogenic diets, suggesting intestinal disinfection or better food quality.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, someone who has been eating pasta and sweet potatoes and so on, if they shift to a meat and egg and cheese diet their intestine is going to be very happy and for a couple of years they'll feel great.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that shifting from pasta and sweet potatoes to meat, eggs, and cheese can make the intestine happy and lead to feeling great for a couple of years.

**RAY PEAT:** That's a moment to moment thing, correct? Like if you eat a meal that is higher in phosphorus, that could turn on your parathyroid hormone for the next few hours, is that right?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if hormonal responses are moment-to-moment, using phosphorus and parathyroid hormone as an example.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. And it's a very good indicator of stress. And so the... the whole system that turns on aldosterone, androtensin, renin, aldosterone, that's behind the process of increasing your parathyroid hormone. And so many kinds of stress will do it, but it happens that high phosphate is very closely connected. Calcium and vitamin D are connected in the other way, protecting against all of those pro-inflammatory anti-metabolic things. So a high calcium diet with vitamin D seems to energize your thyroid function because it's getting you out of that parathyroid hormone, aldosterone, and protensin.

**CONTEXT:** Ray confirms that hormonal responses are moment-to-moment and linked to stress, with high phosphate closely connected to increased parathyroid hormone. He also notes that calcium and vitamin D protect against pro-inflammatory, anti-metabolic factors.

**RAY PEAT:** I have a question about vitamin D. I'm sure you're aware there are plenty of studies that try to portray it in a bad light, and some of the older studies show that if you administer high doses of vitamin D, even in the absence of increased calcium intake in the diet, apparently it can cause soft tissue calcification. Do you think there's any truth to those studies, or do you think vitamin D needs a cofactor to make it more safely, like maybe vitamin K?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about studies portraying vitamin D in a bad light and the potential for soft tissue calcification with high doses.

**RAY PEAT:** A lot of them are confusing one 25 hydroxy with the 25 hydroxy, and that the literature is dominated by that confusion. If you start with Clotho, the anti-aging protein, you'll see that 25 hydroxy supports Clotho and at 125, the so-called active vitamin D knocks down Clotho and raises parathyroid hormone and anthotensin. All of the toxic degenerative things is done by the activated vitamin D. There's a very massive confusion on that. People are talking about active vitamin D as if it's the relevant thing rather than being evidence of extreme stress and sickness.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that many studies confuse 1-25 hydroxy vitamin D with 25 hydroxy vitamin D, and that activated vitamin D (1-25 hydroxy) is associated with stress and sickness.

**RAY PEAT:** But the 25 hydroxy in the body, I think in the kidney or in the liver, it gets converted into 125 hydroxy, right? So wouldn't taking a precursor like that raise the risk?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if taking a precursor like 25 hydroxy vitamin D would raise the risk of conversion to 1-25 hydroxy.

**RAY PEAT:** No, no. It lowers it, in fact, by helping you put calcium where it belongs. Taking calcium and vitamin D will lower parathyroid hormone. It will lower inflammation and raise blood flow and pretty much turn off the activation in the kidneys, which happens in end-stage kidney disease, for example. The activation goes wild and kills the person.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states that taking calcium and vitamin D lowers parathyroid hormone, inflammation, and increases blood flow, effectively turning off harmful activation in the kidneys.

**RAY PEAT:** What about the potential risk for... hypercalcemia with high doses of vitamin D? Do you think that's still tied to that confusion about calcitriol versus cholecalciferol?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if the risk of hypercalcemia with high doses of vitamin D is tied to the confusion between calcitriol and cholecalciferol.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. The studies I've seen with very big doses of 25-hydroxy show no harm at all up to a million units or something for an extended period.

**CONTEXT:** Ray believes the risk is tied to confusion and cites studies showing no harm from high doses of 25-hydroxy vitamin D.

**RAY PEAT:** Just a clarification, I know you've also talked about this before, but cortisol is made from progesterone but doesn't increase it. And so when people look at those steroid synthesis charts, I think it's very confusing. And so is there an easy way of a layman grappling with the fact that when you take progesterone, it's not going to increase your cortisol levels?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks for a layman's explanation of why progesterone doesn't increase cortisol levels, despite cortisol being made from progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. Think of the connections as being like a rope. If there's a deficiency, there's a weight on the rope, it'll pull the precursor along. But no matter how much pressure you put on your end of the rope, you can't push the other end of the rope. Those charts have to be thought of holistically, and there's no pushing allowed. It's all pulling.

**CONTEXT:** Ray uses a rope analogy to explain that progesterone doesn't increase cortisol because the process is a pull, not a push.

**RAY PEAT:** That's interesting. And then last question for me, the progesterone DHEA ratio. And so you and I, I don't know, maybe two years ago or something, I was asking you about an amount of DHEA to use with a progesterone specifically for male. And we had a back and forth. But you don't think that they have to be used in some specific ratio all the time?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about the progesterone-DHEA ratio and if they need to be used in a specific ratio.

**RAY PEAT:** That was, I don't know, you want to... Yeah, if someone is going to blindly use it, it would be a good idea just to have a ballpark somewhere in the ratio that you can't poison yourself with DHEA and you can't suppress your nervous system so much that you... don't make any, but a lot of people find that they increase their DHEA and testosterone just by taking progesterone because progesterone turns off aromatase, for example. And aromatase tends to waste DHEA and testosterone by grinding it through the estrogen process.

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests a ballpark ratio for blind use of DHEA and progesterone, noting that progesterone can increase DHEA and testosterone by turning off aromatase.

**RAY PEAT:** So wouldn't this be a statement in favor of using DHEA with some progesterone to lower the risk of it converting into estrogen in a, let's say, hypothyroid person?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks if using DHEA with progesterone would be beneficial for hypothyroid individuals to reduce estrogen conversion.

**RAY PEAT:** No, if you don't have any DHEA being produced, it's good to have some in your body. It's very often helpful all the way up for a very old person, 10 or 12 milligrams per day backed up with progesterone can be curative, can bring back tissue, connective tissue strength and so on. Both progesterone and progesterone can be curative. And DHEA in a really old person can have very powerful restorative effects, but in a younger person, often the body doesn't have any problem making DHEA and the progesterone will just help activate the thyroid and reduce the aromatase and inflammatory processes.

**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that DHEA is beneficial for older individuals, and progesterone helps activate the thyroid and reduce aromatase and inflammation in younger people.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I guess my question was, if someone were to take DHEA, it would be safer if they combined it with progesterone. Wouldn't you say so?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi reiterates if taking DHEA is safer when combined with progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because so many people take more DHEA than they really can use in the proper ways. And so a 30-year-old taking 10 mg is very likely to be producing too much estrogen from it. If they happen to be slightly hypothyroid or deficient in vitamin D or under stress of some sort.

**CONTEXT:** Ray agrees, stating that many people take too much DHEA, leading to estrogen conversion, especially in hypothyroid, vitamin D deficient, or stressed individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay. I have a question about a pregnant alone. In one of your articles in several interviews, you mentioned an old study where they fed rats, the human equivalent of a cup a day. And I've been trying to find that study and you said that pregnant alone essentially lowered their cortisol back to normal. Do you remember what year that study was or where it was published or where you saw it because I couldn't find it.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about a study where rats were fed pregnant alone, which lowered their cortisol, and requests details about the study.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I saw it in a book published I think 1950 edited by Abraham White.

**CONTEXT:** Ray recalls seeing the study in a 1950 book edited by Abraham White.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, Ray, getting some of your references is like an investigation of like many months. I know you provide a significant amount but sometimes you'll mention something. And it will literally take me like a year to find eventually, but like without Scihub, I wouldn't be able to find anything, you know, like Scihub, are you familiar with that Ray? Without what? Scihub, S-C-I-hub, H-U-B, basically the pirate website to download articles. Oh, oh, uh huh. Well, well, anyways, that's like a huge boon to I think anybody with an active interest in this field, but Yeah, anyways, it's very fun tracking down some of the things you mentioned, um finding them in old books and such So let me uh, let me read through these super chats and then we can wrap this up, uh, linda bell for five dollars Thank you so much. She says good evening lisa ferraro for 9.99. Thank you lisa. Thank you linda Uh lisa says I love these conversations between ray georgie and danny. Thank you guys. Please keep having them. Uh, thanks for that lisa Pure therapy for 4.99 and he has a dancing uh gif emoji. Thanks for that pure therapy tone. Um, we won't be able to get to questions Here because I feel bad because we never answer questions on here. Uh, Here for 20 though. Thank you tones. Sincerely appreciate harry burgos for 25. Thank you harry and machelle, uh, for 50 Well, that's a lot and he says let's not be trodden with cattle's feet go pebbles Thank you for that. Michelle. I sincerely appreciate it and i'll forward these directly to ray George you have any final questions for ray one last question on lipofuscin yes because i think that's go for so we talked about pool for cumulation with age and let's say like eating longer chain saturated fatty acids can over time this place it but would they take care of lipofuscin ray because my my impression from the studies that i've been reading is that wants it forms inside the cell you have to take some kind of a solvent. And there's some studies on potentially vitamin e or even alcohol drinking alcohol can potentially help with that but yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi discusses the difficulty of finding Ray's references and mentions Sci-Hub. He then reads super chat messages and asks a final question about lipofuscin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that was interesting they were in nerve cells they were studying vitamin ease ability to disintegrate lipofuscin and they were dissolving the vitamin e and ethanol and so they tested plain ethanol and it worked. Just almost as well as vitamin e with ethanol and that got me interested in its antioxidant action. It takes something like a teaspoon full of ethanol per day to have a very powerful antioxidant effect. I learned that in physics and some very sensitive engineering where they are using transistors and such and need to be free of free radicals, just a tiny amount of ethanol vapor is a powerful anti-free radical agent.

**CONTEXT:** Ray shares an observation about vitamin E and ethanol's effect on lipofuscin in nerve cells and its antioxidant properties.

**RAY PEAT:** So, would those be the safest things for potentially dissolving lipofuscin until more is known? Vitamin E and a tiny bit of ethanol, maybe like one drink a day? Years ago I saw people who had a frightened appearance from so much age pigment and taking a progesterone within a few weeks. Their skin looked restored and normal. So I think if you turn off estrogen very efficiently, you stop making it and your body can clear it up. That person that I first saw it happen in was in her 40s. I think there's still enough good thyroid metabolism going. Progesterone could be the catalyst suppressing estrogen and shifting the balance away from formation towards elimination.

**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests vitamin E and a small amount of ethanol for lipofuscin, and notes progesterone's ability to restore skin appearance by suppressing estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** Understood one final question what is your general opinion of the steroid and i emphasize steroid aromatase inhibitors. Would they have any place in any kind of like a compromised health condition or do you think progesterone can offer everything they could. and do that safe more safely.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks for Ray's opinion on steroid aromatase inhibitors and if progesterone can offer the same benefits more safely.

**RAY PEAT:** They have side effects and I don't think there's been a great effort to explore why those side effects happen and so I think maybe in 20 years more will be known but I think they're good to avoid and use any of the known very effective anti-aromatase even even the endotensin receptor blockers are pretty effective lots of things inhibit aromatase anything that that stops the basic inflammatory oxygen deprivation process

**CONTEXT:** Ray advises avoiding steroid aromatase inhibitors due to side effects and suggests using known effective anti-aromatases or angiotensin receptor blockers.

**RAY PEAT:** Final question in one of your recent emails with a person they forwarded to me you spoke about eugenol and if it's potentially it's a great spectrum of beneficial effects and i looked at the molecule and reminds me a lot of dopamine do you think eugenol has some of those effects on the nervous system kind of pro-dopamine anti-serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi asks about eugenol's potential effects on the nervous system, noting its similarity to dopamine and its pro-dopamine, anti-serotonin properties.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I don't know. There are some good effects seen with it but I haven't used enough to really have an opinion.

**CONTEXT:** Ray states he doesn't have enough experience with eugenol to form an opinion.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, alright. That's it. I don't have anything else. Ray, what are you working on right now?

**CONTEXT:** Georgi concludes his questions and asks Ray about his current work.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, thinking about how education is going to be affected by the takeover lockdown mentality with people like Governor Cuomo putting Eric Schmidt to work at. Converting from real education to digital education, I think some thought needs to be given to how actual real living education might be protected against this authoritarian pseudo using......digital systems to apply indoctrination and call it education.

**CONTEXT:** Ray is thinking about how education will be affected by the lockdown mentality and the shift to digital education, emphasizing the need to protect real education from authoritarian indoctrination.

**RAY PEAT:** There are a few requests for us to talk about Jonathan Taylor... I'm sorry, I screwed up the name. But maybe we can save that for next time, because that is a huge topic, so I'm glad you brought it up. Ray, do you have any parting words for everybody? I think 150 or so people are listening right now.

**CONTEXT:** Georgi mentions a request to discuss Jonathan Taylor and asks Ray for parting words.

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, no.

**CONTEXT:** Ray has no parting words.
