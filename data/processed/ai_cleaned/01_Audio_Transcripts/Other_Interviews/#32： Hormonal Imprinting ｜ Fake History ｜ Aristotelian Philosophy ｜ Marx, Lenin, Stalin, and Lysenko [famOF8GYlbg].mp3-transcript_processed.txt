**RAY PEAT:** The border patrol has no limits on their authority. They can go into your house and search your person, do anything they want without a warrant. And that applies to everyone within 100 miles of any border. That means the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Canada, and Mexico. And it includes about two-thirds of the US population. Most of the major cities are within 100 miles of the border, so their jurisdiction has just been expanded.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to the expanded authority of the border patrol.

**RAY PEAT:** I remember during the Boston bombings, they invoked something called "exigent circumstances" to be able to go into people's houses and search for the two bombers. Under the official rules, they're not supposed to, if they find something illegal during that search because it's executed without a warrant, they're technically looking for these two bad people. If they find you doing something illegal, like growing weed in your basement or anything similar to that, they're not supposed to be admissible in court, and they're not supposed to be using it to prosecute people. Guess what happened? Two weeks after the Boston bombers got caught, 47 people got indicted for growing weed, having ecstasy, small amounts of pills on them on their property, and things like that. And all of that was obtained during those searches under exigent circumstances. And when the lawyer said, "This is not admissible, you're not supposed to be using it," the government said, "Oh no, we're invoking national security, so everything is classified, and these people are convicted, but you cannot know why." And you know what the reason is? So they very much abuse the law any way they want, it seems. They are convicted on the basis of secret evidence, having secret laws, keeping essential documents secret forever, especially when they would incriminate huge numbers of people.

**CONTEXT:** The conversation shifts to the abuse of legal procedures and the use of secret evidence.

**RAY PEAT:** When you were dealing with Blake College in Mexico and you were coming back into the States, were you ever harassed by Border Patrol for political reasons? Yeah, I was very careful not to have any botanical matter stuck to my clothes or anything. They would do things like, once I was bringing a little clay flute, and they scraped it to see if it was solidified cocaine or something, and the pride of the heels off my shoes.

**CONTEXT:** A personal anecdote about interactions with the Border Patrol.

**RAY PEAT:** Contact tracing? Oh, no more than the usual awareness of what they're doing without calling it anything special. If they have a cell phone, they trace them by that, get the phone company records to find their location, and mostly it's through cell phone tracing, I think. Eventually, they'll get to that. I have a view of the future of people being called by contact tracers and talking about a barbecue they went to last week.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion moves to contact tracing and surveillance technologies.

**RAY PEAT:** Pandemrix. There was a huge epidemic of narcolepsy in Finland immediately after a vaccination campaign. And I imagine that's one of the bases of the action against the maker of that particular vaccine. There were several other countries that had epidemics of narcolepsy, but not as big as Finland. But I think one of the things that needs to be done is to get information on the people who were vaccinated for influenza last year in that huge campaign, especially old people. All of the studies done on the follow-up looking for the effect of flu vaccines on the following year's incidence of influenza, they managed to find a way to claim a certain amount of prevention of flu using very, very odd methods. But something that came out in all of those studies was a very big increase in the incidence of other respiratory infections. Even though they saw a slight decrease in flu, there was a great increase in coronavirus infections. And just looking at those published papers, you would assume that the great mortality from coronavirus was undoubtedly increased by the fact that they were probably 100% vaccinated for flu the previous year, just a few months earlier.

**CONTEXT:** The conversation addresses the Pandemrix vaccine and its link to narcolepsy, and the potential impact of flu vaccines on subsequent respiratory infections.

**RAY PEAT:** If you look at immune activation on PubMed, you'll find lots of studies of the damaging effects of basically any kind of immune activation, meaning activating an inflammatory process. If it happens during pregnancy, such as either a bacterial or viral infection occurring naturally, or a flu vaccine with an aluminum adjuvant in it, any activation of the immune system during pregnancy has very great, long-term, lifelong effects on the fetus. The next generation will have depression and all kinds of after-effects. And cognition is one of the major themes of the degree of immune activation. The number of pathogens you've been exposed to corresponds negatively to mental ability.

**CONTEXT:** The impact of immune activation during pregnancy on offspring is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you seen people with Gulf War Syndrome? When they give interviews, they look like they're about to fall asleep, and many of them suffer from narcolepsy. Do you think serotonin is somehow involved in that symptomatology? Oh, yeah, whatever they were exposed to, including 20 vaccines, I think at least, just to go there.

**CONTEXT:** The connection between Gulf War Syndrome, narcolepsy, and serotonin is explored.

**RAY PEAT:** What can we learn from H1N1? Do you think that was a failed attempt to do what they're doing now, maybe 10 years ago? Not as many things were put into place like they are now, for example, like Gates is intertwined with not only the vaccines but also the identification and the contact tracing. And so clearly, there's a big spider web of things that had to be in place before something of this magnitude could be employed and set up so thoroughly.

**CONTEXT:** The H1N1 pandemic is compared to current events, highlighting the role of organizations like the Gates Foundation.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you seen the recent study that came out about 5G electromagnetic fields potentially capable of inducing the organism to synthesize the coronavirus de novo without any external infection? That would be in line with Montagnier's experiments with the virus acting as an antenna and transmitter. Exactly. And the study that just came out is by five, three of them are physicists, two of them are doctors, they're all Italians from the Guillermo Marconi University, I believe in Italy, which is a fairly legitimate institute of higher education. And it seems to be peer-reviewed and published, and they describe the exact same mechanism that because the 5G electromagnetic waves are such a short wavelength, they can actually get inside cells, and the cells can act as antennas, and then the DNA can act as an inductor. And then, when the body is exposed to these 5G fields, the movement that these waves induce into the DNA is causing certain gaps to appear in the cell. And apparently, the cell is trying to plug that, so to speak, and it's producing RNA that is indistinguishable from the RNA of the coronavirus. At least, that's what the study claims.

**CONTEXT:** A study suggesting 5G electromagnetic fields could induce coronavirus synthesis is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** The principle is that when I was taking developmental biology, someone accidentally put in a publication from around 1940 in which they were exposing cells to foreign protein and then reproducing in culture several generations of the exposed cell and finding that it was emitting copies of the protein that had been exposed to. That was a perfect demonstration that a cell can perceive a very different molecule that it presumably could not possibly have a DNA for. And after exposure and multiplication, several, I think 10 or more generations of cell division, it was still producing very measurable amounts of this foreign protein. So that indicated that cells have an apparatus for copying a protein, transforming the information from the sequence of the protein into a sequence of DNA or RNA, and then reading out endless copies of a protein indistinguishable from the one it was exposed to. I commented on that paper, and then it disappeared from the file, and I hadn't made notes on it, so I think it disappeared from the whole library because someone had accidentally included it.

**CONTEXT:** A historical study demonstrating cellular adaptation to foreign proteins is recalled.

**RAY PEAT:** So, under the same principle, we could be producing HIV endogenously, right? Yeah, that's Montagnier's argument, and why he's banned and went to China to work.

**CONTEXT:** The potential for endogenous retroviral production is linked to Montagnier's theories.

**RAY PEAT:** The interesting thing in this BMJ article, they say the controversy erupted when the German newspaper Der Spiegel reported that top politicians and government employees were going to receive a Selvapan and Baxter's unadjuvenated H1N1 vaccine, not Pandemrix. And so that seems especially prudent to point out what's fit for the peons is not fit for the government employees, and so they're going to get the unadjuvenated vaccine. And I imagine something similar will happen for whatever is released for coronavirus. Much less harmful and almost totally ineffective.

**CONTEXT:** A disparity in vaccine distribution for politicians versus the general public is highlighted.

**RAY PEAT:** This will be the first RNA vaccine. And I think the people who are talking about it and making it are probably totally unaware that our cells have lots and lots of reverse transcriptases just waiting for a bit of foreign RNA to come in to make copies and send it into our genome as permanent DNA, so that our great-great-grand descendants will be able to make the most toxic spike protein part of the virus in uncontrolled quantities. If we can multiply it to produce immunity to it, we're going to be able to multiply it, and our descendants will be able to produce the same thing.

**CONTEXT:** The potential long-term implications of RNA vaccines and their interaction with cellular machinery are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** In itself, the whole story of the spike protein and what it does, why it is the key to making the virus infectious for humans, which all of the studies of the last 10 or 15 years have been working on perfecting that spike protein so it fits a human ACE2 enzyme. ACE2 is the enzyme that detoxifies angiotensin, destroys our basic inflammation and blood pressure-raising peptide. And so, the danger of having a lot of coronavirus is simply that it creates inflammation by knocking out our intrinsic defense against angiotensin. And that fact has been covered up or ignored or put into some way of thinking about the idea of the virus and its replication. So the disease will be a standard where you find the virus, which is the lungs and the intestine, but it also turns out to be the heart and the gonads and lots of other tissues. But the intestine and the respiratory membranes are actually major sites of viral replication. So that's what they say. Inflammation of the lungs is what you have to think about, but when you knock out ACE2, you're creating systemic inflammation, and inflammation of the bowel creates systemic inflammation. So the whole thing is the turning on of the renin-angiotensin system.

**CONTEXT:** The role of the spike protein, ACE2, and the renin-angiotensin system in inflammation is explained.

**RAY PEAT:** The spike protein can't undergo a series of confirmation changes. It can't create the confirmation that makes the perfect receptor binding site. And the spike protein doesn't work, the virus isn't infective. And I found a recent publication, C. Toelzer et al., showing that the final step in forming the active binding site of the spike protein requires the binding of linoleic acid, which it finds on the cell surface if the person has been eating their vegetable oil regularly. The more linoleic acid you have floating around in your system, the more likely the virus is to be activated and successful in sticking to you and causing inflammation. And that has only been published in abstract form so far, and I'm afraid it isn't going to make it much farther because of its implications for nutrition.

**CONTEXT:** The role of linoleic acid in spike protein activation is discussed, with implications for dietary choices.

**RAY PEAT:** The renin-angiotensin system, yeah, it exists in everyone and in every cell. They used to think it was a matter of the liver and kidney interacting, renin and so on. But mast cells in any tissue can make renin, and then local converting enzymes can convert the renin into the series of antioxidants and peptides. So it's a local inflammation promoter anywhere you have a mast cell or many other basic defense immune-related enzymes. It's a universal thing, more basic than nitric oxide. Estrogen, serotonin, for example, it closely relates to those, turns them on. It's an activator of aromatase, for example. So it activates this explosion of all kinds of inflammation promoters, cytokines, and so on. And so if you can knock out the enzyme that destroys that, you've created with the least effort the most destruction.

**CONTEXT:** The pervasive nature and inflammatory role of the renin-angiotensin system are detailed.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's regulated by a very ultra-organized system, that antenna we were talking about. There is a website called Cell Intelligence. Albrecht Buehler. A very good website in which he gives his argument that the cell knows how to call up exactly the genes it wants by such things as the antigen that it's exposed to. The cell has a reading system like a super librarian system that knows where to find everything specifically. And the normal use of the system that reads out retroviruses is, I'm sure it's the same system that produces the exosomes, which are a part of a repair system, repair and maintenance system that replicates RNA and DNA and proteins as needed, forming these particles that are almost under a microscope indistinguishable from the coronavirus and other viruses and manufactured in the endoplasmic reticulum and secreted in the same way into the bloodstream. But they have to be, for example, if you have injured lung tissue that needs repair, it composes by drawing out just the RNA, DNA, and proteins that are needed for repair to compose exosomes, which are put into the bloodstream. And they travel to the bone marrow, where they're picked up by the cells that are more or less stem cells waiting for a call for help. And they are taken up and processed the same way a vaccine will be processed. These exosomes, virus-like particles are taken up by the bone marrow cells. They cause the bone marrow cells to differentiate into a pre-lung cell, not quite a stem cell, but a stem cell differentiating towards becoming a lung cell, and they're then excreted back into the whole cell, leaves the marrow, and enters the bloodstream, where it's because it's already on the pathway to becoming lung tissue, it is recognized and sticks to the region where it's needed as repair. It's like a repair lung tissue that has wandered away, and so it sticks when it gets where it's needed. It does its job of repairing the injury. So it's a very powerful specific intrabody communication system between stem cells and injured cells.

**CONTEXT:** The cellular mechanism of exosome production and their role in repair and differentiation is explained, drawing parallels to viral processes.

**RAY PEAT:** So, basically, these viruses that we're internalizing are like tissue-specific alarm signals that can be called upon for help when needed. Yeah, and so random stuff getting added to that system is going to have the potential to change our development, course of development.

**CONTEXT:** The concept of internalized viral material as tissue-specific signals is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the body probably has various filters, but a lab in Germany has published many papers showing that the DNA in our foods can be found. There is quite a bit of uptake even from our foods. And autopsies on women who have had two or three husbands have demonstrated DNA from husbands one and two, as well as the most recent one, in her tissues, including brain tissue. She's putting away and storing the semen DNA, probably those are useful because there are cases where, for example, a white man going into a totally black part of Africa 50 or 60 years ago and having a picture of his kids were progressively lighter, each baby got paler as the woman similar to Xenia, and specifically, I think it would be telegony.

**CONTEXT:** The potential for DNA uptake from food and partners, and the concept of telegony, are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Up until right after World War II, people used to talk a lot, and a lot of it was personal experience, and there was a lot of mimeographed underground stuff going around, very small numbers, but people who were curious could get a fairly good picture of what the government was doing in medicine, for example. I never got in the newspapers, but it could be documented later, and once you find a library that has been careless about censorship. When I first went to the University of Oregon in 1956, I went as an English major, but I found anthropology and biology. I read lots in those areas, and ten years later I went back to the library looking for those books. None of the most interesting ones were there anymore, and they had opened a bookstore in the basement selling unwanted books for a nickel or dime.

**CONTEXT:** The historical methods of information dissemination and censorship are described.

**RAY PEAT:** Health involves interaction with the environment: air, food, and information, and the medical system, and the various sources of poisoning. And so, immediately, as soon as you think about a symptom and what doctors do about it, immediately you're involved in politics. And then when you start investigating any little part, either political or historical or biological, whatever, you find that that leads into more and more expansive implications. It takes years and years to put together a fairly general picture, but it starts with the suspicion that things aren't what they're supposed to be as said to be in the regular newspapers, radio, and television. Like 1945 on the radio, Harry Truman said, "We have just dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a military base." And I started thinking about that and tried to find out more about it. Then it turned out Hiroshima was a big city, and then later, every anniversary, they would repeat Truman's announcement, but that phrase was deleted, just neatly clipped out, and the tape joined together. And I started doubting and looking for background information. Every time Roosevelt or every time Eisenhower would talk, I would see if there were alternative opinions and objections and started seeing what an immense web of corruption Eisenhower was involved in. Money flowing from the oil industry, hydroelectric industry, all very big industries were funneling money to him to buy his support for their policies. Senator Wayne Morse was someone who started investigating that sort of corruption around the same time. Senator Estes Kefauver did the investigation of the drug industry, and he was by far the most popular presidential candidate, but the party did the usual thing and elected a right-wing middle-of-the-roader, a two-time unsuccessful candidate, to keep out anyone who was really interested in starting to investigate what the government was really about.

**CONTEXT:** The interconnectedness of health, politics, and history is explained, with examples of historical deception.

**RAY PEAT:** The manipulator's ability to memory hole information is astounding to me, you know, like every event will have a series of anomalies, but they are totally eliminated within, I don't know, a few days or a few weeks. And then the narrative is crafted. It's cemented in Wikipedia, and then nobody ever thinks about it again. So it's pretty... I mean, just living through that in real time, and you have a way broader sense of that than I do. But you have to document the validity of the documents themselves because those are very often forged. Just destroying them is the first thing. But they have done lots of very convincing forgeries. And when the documents are sealed during that keeping them from the public, you can be sure that there are people working on expunging the most incriminating material. Documents aren't safe anywhere in the government. So you have to look critically at even the documents that should be the last word. You have to look for eyewitnesses, people who lived through it and can tell the story. And when you see several people who had similar experiences, didn't know each other, but had exactly the same sort of experience, then you can start to form an opinion about what really happened. Almost all of 20th-century history, as far as it regards Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, is based on forgeries as far as American historians are concerned.

**CONTEXT:** The manipulation of historical narratives and the importance of eyewitness accounts are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the mass media can keep even when the secret is out, 100 or 500 people know it. The mass media can keep everyone else, everyone that counts, from knowing it. Just this last week, someone I had lost touch with for 55 years heard me on one of these talk programs and got in touch. We're starting to put together experiences from things related to the government shutting down Blake College. He was there through the whole thing and experienced a lot of things that I didn't have any perspective on at all. So we're going to put together a new picture that neither of us could have formed independently. And if we could get in touch with other people who had gone through that experience, then we could start to put together a historical picture. He's Luis Urias, who was an associate of Alejandro Jodorowsky, who made the movies *The Holy Mountain*. You was going to make *Dune*, but never did? Yeah, yeah. Luis was involved in a lot of his projects, and Luis says he thinks important historical information will come out of several of us putting together what the government was doing there. There were so many government agencies involved.

**CONTEXT:** The power of collective memory and the potential for uncovering historical truths through shared experiences are highlighted.

**RAY PEAT:** As the empire and the ecology decline, the civilization is being taken down with it. The CIA did a great job on degrading the civilization throughout the world with their Congress for Cultural Freedom in 1950, with their action art, action expressionism, and so on.

**CONTEXT:** The decline of civilization is linked to imperialistic actions and cultural manipulation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the picture that is imposed as part of the cultural sustaining system, justifying this particular kind of authoritarian individualism that goes with an ideology and an ontology really about the very nature of what matter is. It comes down in their view to quanta. It's a digitized view of the substance that we're made of, and so of ourselves and genetic information. It is reductionism made into a universal philosophy of being, which necessarily extends into this individualism, a particular philosophy of individualism as the basis. Margaret Thatcher's idea of society doesn't exist; it's only the quanta that make up the personality. The concept of long-range order in the cell, which is necessary for these antenna functions or cell intelligence functions, long-range order doesn't exist in the same sense that society doesn't exist for Margaret Thatcher. So the digitizing of ethics, politics, education, everything is part of the very deep degradation of the whole business. If you see the substance we're made of in a certain way, that means we have that same digitized quality. Our consciousness is ultimately like computer consciousness. It's only patterns of meaningless fragments, on or off signals. And so it really removes the best basis for criticism and correction at all of these levels. So as far as it has become the dominant philosophy of information handling and using computers, that then has destroyed our ability to build up something new.

**CONTEXT:** The philosophical underpinnings of reductionism and digitized consciousness are critiqued as a source of societal degradation.

**RAY PEAT:** So, at the organismic level, basically, the organism can only tolerate so much of a reversal, a degradation of the energetic process. So, at the social level, do you think something similar might happen, or do you think society can successfully revert to a more primitive structure and maintain it stably, or do you think, similar to the organism, once the social cancer gets into effect and it consumes enough of the ability of society to produce, to maintain a high level of consciousness, eventually it will be the same collapse as it happens at the organismic level? So, in other words, do you think this process can be evolution, social evolution, can go back a few steps and stay at the brute level of the barbarian level, or do you think nature will simply not tolerate that and say, "The heck with it, you know, we're going to collapse and then start rebuilding everything from scratch?"

**CONTEXT:** The potential for societal collapse mirroring biological degradation is explored.

**RAY PEAT:** There are reasons for thinking that there has been a threshold passed that if we don't somehow establish an energetic, functional society, like the ecosystem, then we're going to see that there might be a point at which regeneration of forests is no longer possible. There are some kinds of evidence that suggest that, for example, in the tundra, the melting tundra has a capacity, probably, and subterranean methane clathrates are another source of carbon that as these melt, vast amounts of carbon dioxide coming into the atmosphere, going up from parts per million to something like one or two percent, a gigantic increase in CO2 would change mental function, mental energy, knock out the inflammatory degenerative diseases, increase the growth of forests, and allow the reconstruction of much of what has been destroyed, just on the basis of a sort of explosive healing. The dose of carbon dioxide to suppress the inflammatory processes that we're now under the influence of.

**CONTEXT:** The potential for environmental tipping points and the role of carbon dioxide in ecological regeneration are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** With a population of this size, it's going to take some organization beyond just individual family farms. It's going to take something like cooperative farms to have efficiency, to use land more efficiently than private farmers could, buying diesel for their equipment, everyone having their own machinery. A tremendous expense would go into trying to survive in family farms that probably wouldn't be possible at this number of people. But I think there's plenty of productive land that if people can form cooperative groups, it could be politically compatible groups breaking up in the regions in which they start using the land and resources for survival and development rather than destructive exploitation.

**CONTEXT:** The necessity of cooperative farming for large populations and efficient land use is argued.

**RAY PEAT:** Militarism is the first. There have been important anthropologists saying that militarism is the essence of civilization, but I think it's the essence of everything going downhill.

**CONTEXT:** Militarism is identified as the most anti-civilization factor.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, to restore the productivity of the land, it's going to take diversification, getting more trees to create water retention, soil retention, and cool the summers, level the rainfall out so it doesn't come in cloudbursts. The buffalo and the grass were a very stable soil-preserving, water-preserving system. Without going back to that and having dairy herds grazing on natural prairie grass, that could be done in some regions. Restoring as much as possible of the West Coast heavy forestation would be another climate-reversing process.

**CONTEXT:** Ecological restoration through diversification, reforestation, and grazing practices is proposed.

**RAY PEAT:** As a basis, I think that's very good, with as many perennial plants as possible, trees producing fruits, for example, so that there isn't a constant plowing up and a waste of energy that way.

**CONTEXT:** Perennial plants and fruit-bearing trees are recommended for sustainable agriculture.

**RAY PEAT:** I think of it as people used to think. It's very easy to deplete it in a few years. Well, starting with abolishing fish oil and abolishing the conversion of gigantic amounts of fish into pet food and fertilizer, for example, that would go out with the fish oil industry. Using seafood for fertilizer and just destroying a big part of the ocean animal life is going to maybe help the oceans regenerate too.

**CONTEXT:** The unsustainable practices of the fish oil industry and their impact on ocean ecosystems are criticized.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, lots of countries are shrinking in population now and trying to actually recruit more people to come in or to reproduce faster. It's a natural tendency when insecurity has been the main driver of population increase. Poor people had no social security, and so they would have several kids who would be able to support them in their old age. And so every generation needed their social security by expanding the population. As soon as a population gets a fairly modest degree of social security, they stop having too many kids, the population starts shrinking naturally. You just brought up a great point. Danny and I discussed last week, apparently, despite all the propaganda that's being produced by the media, if you look at the actual numbers on demographics, the expectation for the world population is not at all to explode. In fact, they expect a slight increase to maybe 9 billion by 2050, and then by the turn of the next century, they expect the world population to go back to about 2 to 3 billion precisely because of, if the processes of improved security continue, then people are just not going to have that many kids as they used to. That was pretty well demonstrated around 1970. There were some very good articles published then, but the political biologists, the Malthusians, insist that they need more authoritarianism because population is predetermined to explode, and so you need to control them.

**CONTEXT:** The relationship between social security and declining birth rates is explained, challenging Malthusian population theories.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the idea of basic income, basic guaranteed national income of $1,000 or $2,000 a month for every citizen, that is going to be a kind of social security that lets people do what they're interested in, get educated, find interesting work rather than destructive, foolish work making anything that can be sold. People don't like doing the kind of stupid jobs they're doing, and if they can stop, they will, and that will remove the need to worry about who's going to support them in old age.

**CONTEXT:** Universal Basic Income (UBI) is presented as a form of social security that can foster individual development.

**RAY PEAT:** Competitive individualism has been indoctrinated into people, but like Rapatkin said, if you look at nature all the way from bacteria up, cooperation is our basic instinct within and between species. It has been only a few basically authoritarian political theorists who have promoted the Randian tooth-and-claw idea of nature, that it's all competition and destroy all of the competition. That's it. It's a very trivial ideology that is powerfully supported by the right-wing foundations.

**CONTEXT:** Cooperation is identified as a fundamental instinct in nature, contrasting with the ideology of competitive individualism.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, a good place to start is by looking at a criticism of the major American historians of the Soviet Union or Stalin or Trotsky. We have a falsified history of Trotsky, just as much as of Stalin. Trotsky's connections to the US and Hitler have almost totally been eliminated. But there is convincing data that he was acting as an agent for Germany and the US way back while he was still in Russia. And if you look at the evidence that the historians have simply lied about all of these people. For example, if you just think historically about what the great famine, the Ukrainian famine that is called genocide, and where Stalin is accused of creating the famine to eliminate the kulaks and create mass murder. The US immediately after World War I not only took its troops and sent them with other European armies to invade the Soviet Union, but they started collaborating with Germany on the development of biological warfare. And one of Germany's advances in that was developing a fungus that kills wheat plants by invading the developing seed called wheat rust blight. And the famine, Stalin's people and all of the agronomists that were watching the production of crops were seeing a great bumper crop of wheat production coming on in the year that led to the famine. They were seeing the big heads of wheat growing. And when it came time to harvest them, they found that the seeds, the heads were big, but the seeds were absent. They had been destroyed by the wheat rust blight, something that Germany and the US had been working on as germ warfare. So it created some big question about who caused the Ukraine famine, which is one of the main propaganda pieces against Stalin. One historian, a professor who had been an English professor and specialist in medieval English history, got interested in Russian history when he discovered some outright lies in standard American history books. And he has done a series of, I guess, about 15 books. A good one to start with is *Khrushchev Lied*. And Khrushchev was functioning in some ways as an agent of the CIA. He was going along with the American doctrine and following the analysis of Khrushchev's lies, he then goes into several of the major American historians and documents in tremendous detail, page after page of fabricated documents, saying that some documents didn't exist which were incriminating. In the wrong direction, using mistranslations, every sort of historical evil has been criticized. These recognized major American historians are basically liars. A lot of it is because they believe their lies. At every opportunity, they're bending things to suit their ideology.

**CONTEXT:** The historical narrative surrounding Stalin, Trotsky, and the Ukrainian famine is challenged, with evidence of falsified history and collaboration between the US and Germany on biological warfare.

**RAY PEAT:** Hitler and his people were using, they were aware of public relations techniques, and they looked at what seemed popular. There was a threat that Germany would be taken over by the socialists, the actual left socialists. And so Hitler and his people said, "Okay, we're going to be the best socialists of all, and we'll do everything the socialists are asking for." So he got the support of a big part of the left, but totally with the knowledge of the corporations. The Americans, the big banks, all of them knew that he was using the language of progressivism to enslave the people, shift them over to support a totally authoritarian government. And step by step, he introduced the changes. It isn't the capitalists; it's only the Jewish capitalists that are responsible for your suffering, so we'll get the Jews, and then we won't have to worry about the good capitalists who really run the banks and the basic industry. So he was the agent and mouthpiece of the banks and giant industrialists, both of America and Germany and the rest of Europe.

**CONTEXT:** The rise of Nazism is explained as a manipulation of socialist rhetoric by corporations and banks, with the scapegoating of Jewish capitalists.

**RAY PEAT:** Really wanted to get Jews out of Germany as part of his propaganda business that it isn't capitalists; it's only Jews. But there were the Zionists who saw that as their opportunity. Same with England, they made deals with the English to give them Palestine, and they were getting support from Germany for a while to move out the Jews in Palestine, so they had overlapping interests.

**CONTEXT:** The role of Zionism and English support in the emigration of Jews from Germany is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it would automatically be just as a rotten swamp of communism as it is of so-called democracy.

**CONTEXT:** Communism and democracy are presented as equally flawed systems.

**RAY PEAT:** Reading quotes here when I was about 14 or so convinced me to start looking at the counter to the so-called Darwinian competitive individualist view of life, and it worked everywhere you look, in the organism as well as the species and the ecosystem. Kozyrev was right, all the way from the biggest ecological interactions down to the simplest cellular and biochemical interactions. It's interactive and cooperative from top to bottom.

**CONTEXT:** The principle of cooperation as a fundamental force in nature, from cellular to ecological levels, is emphasized.

**RAY PEAT:** I went on a student boat. It cost $200, and it was a very leisurely nine-day trip. Very pleasant. No, just to England and then train through Russia. We didn't go on a tour, we just went where we wanted. We got to just walk around and look for people. It turned out that most of the people I wanted to talk to were on vacation. Everyone went on vacation for the summer during that period. Lysenko, I wanted to talk to him, and I went to his lab, and he only came to the lab one day a week, and it didn't match with the time I was in Moscow. But I got to talk to the bio-magnetism man, Yuri Holodov, and he gave me a very good list of books, things that were available in the U.S., a lot of them that my professors never would have heard of. The science people were very nice and open. Holodov said, "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know." He wasn't allowed to show his lab to foreigners, but he told me everything he was doing and gave me this big, big help for my later study. The tourist people, they didn't like my disrupting their routine by just not joining a tour and such, but it was an opportunity to take the subway around and see who was in the headquarters of the science establishment, walk around the university and such.

**CONTEXT:** An account of a trip to the Soviet Union to meet scientists, highlighting interactions with Yuri Holodov and the challenges of accessing information.

**RAY PEAT:** It was the Khrushchev, for a while, supported Lysenko and what he was doing when he was supporting massive organic farms, for example. But when Khrushchev went out, then that was the end of Lysenko's career. Wikipedia says Lysenko was a strong proponent of soft inheritance and rejected Mendelian genetics in favor of pseudoscientific ideas termed Lysenkoism. He anticipated Barbara McClintock and the work that got her the Nobel Prize. Epigenetics, everything he did now is not at all controversial, but he increased grain production and food production. People who used his methods. But the academic geneticists still had lots of power. The Soviet Union wasn't at all monolithic; the Western factions in science were very powerful.

**CONTEXT:** The downfall of Lysenko is attributed to political shifts and the influence of Western scientific factions, despite his contributions to agricultural productivity.

**RAY PEAT:** Basically, it turned towards the Western ideals, and that was really the goal to undermine it from within. Yeah, Yeltsin represented the truly materialist approach to reality. And Western genetics theory represents the imposed rationalist, reductionist approach to reality. So the Westernization required knocking out any of the remaining actual materialists. And materialism, one of Lenin's best pieces of writing was explaining, essentially, that the concept of materialism in the West is pure idealism, absolutely the negation of materialism in Lenin's sense. Lenin said, knowledge is composed of memory, but the memories are recordings of experience, and experience is always new, and the source of experience is matter, and so matter is only what is potential to be experienced. So materialism means looking to the future and the possibilities of experience, where the genetics and reductionists try to base their rationalism on an organization of existing knowledge, pre-existing ideas, and breaking those down into logical, computable units and so on. The essence of Lenin's type of materialism is essentially identifying it with the life process. The process of being conscious and having new experience is the process of interacting with the material world.

**CONTEXT:** The ideological shift in the Soviet Union is analyzed, contrasting Lenin's materialism with Western reductionism.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, no, but he did so many things right. You don't want to throw everything out just because of some. He was much less authoritarian than Plato, for example. Plato did some things right, saying that you shouldn't impose education on children. You should let them play, educate themselves. You look at what someone has to offer, and Aristotle, he was a source for much of the good thinking of the medieval philosophers, and much of it got into Christian theology by way of Islamic and Jewish theology. But the good parts of Christianity derive from largely from Aristotelian ideas modified by the medieval philosophers. And Lenin picked out these good developmental, future-oriented, unfinished business parts of Aristotle.

**CONTEXT:** Aristotle's contributions are defended despite criticisms, highlighting his influence on subsequent philosophical and theological thought.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's part of the imprinting process, starting with prenatal inflammation and stress. It goes with the quality of breastfeeding. The baby detects the mother's anxiety or happiness and pleasure. And if the mother is not comfortable and pleased to be feeding the baby, the baby starts assimilating those ideas. And it starts seeing things instead of the mother as a source of everything living and good, it starts seeing objects as threats. Objects begin to be closed, self-contained, limnitian sort of units, no windows, windowless monads. And this develops into the preference for things that aren't weirdly unchangeable. And so it went, timeless objects, and looks for the ultimate unchanging basis of matter, which turns out to be logical atoms or quanta or digits.

**CONTEXT:** Prenatal stress and the quality of breastfeeding are identified as crucial factors in shaping an individual's worldview and perception of reality.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if they get good breastfeeding from the substitute mother, a wet nurse, it can be a very good mother, and probably the more complex antibody support from a volunteer new mother, if she is giving all of the signals of loving support to the baby, then it's perfectly equivalent, I think. Very few daycares are like that. I mean, I guess maybe I should have said, like, the third person, in other words, there are these businesses where it's almost like a farm. You give your baby, and there's, yeah, no, okay. Yeah, that's like the horrible orphanages where they tend them like in the factory and bottle feed them and keep them wrapped up and are essentially brain damaging them as thoroughly as they can.

**CONTEXT:** The potential for positive outcomes in alternative childcare arrangements is discussed, contrasting with the detrimental effects of institutionalized care.

**RAY PEAT:** I guess they found foster parents as a substitute, but lots of the foster parents turned out to be just as bad as the orphanages. The reason I'm asking is because it seems to me that from an authoritarian point of view, orphanages seem like the perfect breeding ground for imprinting whatever pathological ideas you would like on a very large portion of the population. And for the National Institutes of Health to experiment on.

**CONTEXT:** The historical disappearance of orphanages and the potential for their use in social engineering and experimentation are questioned.

**RAY PEAT:** I think there's still a lot of that going on under the name of Black Lives Matter, but I don't know who really is the main influence on it. But obviously, the whole idea that police shouldn't murder citizens, whatever color they are, it's obvious that they are murdering a lot more blacks than whites, especially in proportion to their percentage of the population. And so concentrating on stopping the murderous police should be everyone's concern, it wouldn't matter whether Soros or Karl Marx or whoever was financing these crimes. But I think people use the word Marxism without the slightest idea of what it means. Splitting everything up into different classes and seeing issues in relation to that. Does that relate to the animal kingdom at all? Do you think?

**CONTEXT:** The Black Lives Matter movement is discussed in the context of police brutality and the misuse of the term "Marxism."

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of development is really the only key concept. Hegel saw logic, logical interactions, the dialectic as the motor of history, and logic reaches a conclusion, history comes to an end, the ruling class sits there forever. Marx said he had it upside down, basically, that things are developing, but it's not driven by ideas and concepts, and so its outcome is not going to be the same that Hegel foresaw. Hegel was rationalizing for the ruling class that wanted eternal stable power. And Marx wondered the same thing that a lot of the Christian communitarians, Christian thinkers, and people putting their ideas into practice, trying to eliminate destructive competition, warfare, and so on. If you look at the history of the Christian socialists and Marx... What Marx added was the idea of development as the essential thing. It's in the nature of people and society and substance to go on developing. There's a branch of professors who like to call themselves Marxists who are simply Hegelians who I think it's more adventuresome to call themselves Marxists, but they subscribe to the idea of the dialectic having these units for Marx, they were provisional. The class division was in the process itself of defining itself and changing constantly. All of the units interacting in Marxism are themselves open and in process. There's not a trace of the Hegelian authoritarian idealism in the thought of Marx and Engels and Lenin. And Lenin did a really good job on the level of language and ontology. Almost no one reads those because they overlap with Whitehead and the Christian process theologians. He went a few steps farther than Bertrand Russell in clarifying the nature of language and logic. They're really intellectual people. I just don't like to touch the immense implications of how far Engels went in the meaning of process and development.

**CONTEXT:** The philosophical underpinnings of Marxism are explained, contrasting Marx's dialectical materialism with Hegel's idealism.

**RAY PEAT:** The oligarchs, the dynasties, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, is that impossible under a Marxist philosophy? Or is that more related to communism? No, the oligarchy, the concept of people that leads to ideas such as a ruling class or class superiority and so on, it's all embedded in history and process. The working class is what actually produces the stuff that makes the economy run, and that becomes money, what is manipulated by the bankers and so on. So, as they function, they are the source of meaning and change. But the whole thing, all of the parts of the process are in change and continuous definition. And you can't possibly imagine a terminal state of such a process, much less a stable oligarchy. Once you have the recognition that these timeless definitions of matter or organization, these are logically impossible constructions. They self-contradict themselves out of existence. So what you have is a continuing biological-like process.

**CONTEXT:** The concept of oligarchy and its incompatibility with Marxist philosophy is discussed, emphasizing the dynamic nature of social and economic systems.

**RAY PEAT:** So, what you have is a continuing biological-like process. If I can make an analogy, as you said, knowledge and memory is not matter. They actually come from matter, and matter is pure potential. What do we have? Sort of correct analogy, or at least along the correct lines, to say that the social structures, the working class and the ruling class, are sort of the analogies of memory and the matter. In other words, the working class is the potential that's producing progress, and the ruling class is the memory of what the ruling class has produced. In other words, a record of what the ruling class has produced. And they want to solidify this memory into an eternal Platonic thing that can't be tampered with. That's where the whole computer ideology comes from. If it's computable, its place in time is irrelevant. It's what it is and it always will be that. And so the ideology is frozen memory. And it can only persist as far as it tries to freeze the productive processes.

**CONTEXT:** Social structures are analogized to matter and memory, with the ruling class seeking to solidify a static "frozen memory."

**RAY PEAT:** Very, very clearly stated. It's what science should be. And it's actually what science isn't working as now.

**CONTEXT:** Lenin's emphasis on process and change is presented as the ideal for scientific inquiry.

**RAY PEAT:** That principle has actually been in practice in graduate schools in the U.S. They don't like critics. High IQ people used to be dangerous critics, and so they were flunked out as quick as possible. Any organization doesn't like critics, and so they have to, to the extent that the IQ test actually discovers intelligence. Some of the tests... The Cattell scale was really a class identification rather than identifying dangerous intelligence; it was identifying acceptable class manners as high IQ. So the power structure is currently selecting for stupidity rather directly.

**CONTEXT:** The historical practice of discouraging high intelligence in academic and professional settings is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there's quite a bit of evidence that the people who choose to go into police departments are biased in that direction. They see the ability to exercise power as something they want.

**CONTEXT:** The psychological motivations of individuals entering law enforcement are explored.

**RAY PEAT:** Their empire is based on capitalism now, and the great distress of the Pentagon is that they've been doing capitalism better than the United States empire. And that Eric Schmidt's National Commission on Artificial Intelligence described the need to destroy the present economy so that we can go directly to artificial intelligence and get there faster than China. Otherwise, China is on course to reach a computerization degree of automation that will make them unbeatable. So the Pentagon got Google's Eric Schmidt to head this commission, and now Governor Cuomo in New York is instituting Eric Schmidt's plans and advice in New York. And it's definitely what the World Economic Forum has in mind for the whole world process: to quickly get rid of all of these middle-level free enterprises and go directly to automation and a complete monopoly of the banks and Amazon-type corporations.

**CONTEXT:** China's economic success and the Pentagon's concerns about artificial intelligence and automation are discussed, with a focus on the influence of figures like Eric Schmidt and organizations like the World Economic Forum.

**RAY PEAT:** So, China is very much a copy of the imperialistic blueprint, and it's just at a larger scale. Is that what I'm hearing? Well, it doesn't have a thousand military bases like the US. So it's depending on the market economy, and that's what the pandemic was designed to get rid of the ordinary market economy and move straight to a mandate economy.

**CONTEXT:** China's economic model is compared to the US imperialistic blueprint, and the pandemic's role in shifting towards a mandate economy is suggested.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, world capital is deeply involved in Chinese production, so they're already representing a world empire, and it's sort of a sub-theme that there's competition between Chinese world capital and what America has left of a productive capital. The trouble is that so much of American industry went to China and other countries that that kind of market capitalism is what is a threat to the Pentagon.

**CONTEXT:** The interconnectedness of global capital and the competition between Chinese and American economic interests are analyzed.

**RAY PEAT:** It'll matter for two or three months anyway. It's most likely going to be the installation of Biden. The real powers are going to do anything necessary to get Biden in. And when they get him in, then I think the virus is going to have go on vacation for two or three months. That really doesn't bother anyone to have a stupid president. If you read Eisenhower's statements to the press, he really didn't have much knowledge of what he was doing. Neurologically damaged.

**CONTEXT:** Predictions are made about the upcoming election, suggesting a predetermined outcome and the potential for a temporary abatement of the virus.

**RAY PEAT:** I think all of the top political people have had friends who were in the army, and so they took advantage of the very good medical care that army people do, and they died very prematurely. I think intense medical supervision will deteriorate your brain and the immune system pretty quickly.

**CONTEXT:** The potential negative effects of intensive medical supervision on health and cognitive function are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** The little opposition countries... Iran has its good points. Venezuela and Cuba are doing lots of good things. Anyone who tries to break out of the system. Libya under Gaddafi had really big plans to break out of the dollar economy and to create a new currency to break African imperialism. It would have democratized Africa to the extent that it would have ruined the empire forever. But there are lots of little countries that would like to break out of the empire and will keep trying to do it. I think that's going to be a good possibility. It's stopping the deterioration.

**CONTEXT:** Countries attempting to resist imperialistic control and establish economic independence are highlighted as potential beacons of hope.

**RAY PEAT:** So, in terms of possible ization, sometimes I guess it does pay off to be small. You're simply not that interesting to the big power, so you're given a little bit of freedom to do what you want.

**CONTEXT:** The strategic advantage of smaller nations in maintaining autonomy and freedom from larger powers is discussed.
