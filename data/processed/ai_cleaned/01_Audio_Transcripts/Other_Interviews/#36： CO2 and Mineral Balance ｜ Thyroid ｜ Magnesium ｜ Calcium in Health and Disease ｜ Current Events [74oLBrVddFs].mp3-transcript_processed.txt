**RAY PEAT:** Caffeine increased the transcription effects through the androgen receptor by three to four hundred percent. So they concluded that caffeine somehow increases the effects of the anabolic steroids, at least of androgens like dihydrotestosterone.

**CONTEXT:** A study was published in 2004 about a bodybuilder who was taking steroids and 200 milligrams of caffeine. Researchers found that caffeine increased the effects of dihydrotestosterone on the androgen receptor.

**RAY PEAT:** Caffeine works probably analogously to the steroids and carbon dioxide, a structural electron-attracting effect that they all have in common.

**CONTEXT:** The question is posed whether caffeine has similar effects to steroids and carbon dioxide in stabilizing the cell.

**RAY PEAT:** Caffeine does the same thing. I think that's the basis for caffeine's protective effect on the liver, against fatty liver and fibrosis of the liver and carcinogenesis, all kinds of cancer. Causing processes are blocked by caffeine, whether it's radiation or chemical carcinogens or even viral processes. All of those are pro-inflammatory, pro-glycolytic reductive processes. Caffeine is like progesterone, supporting the oxidizing structures.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to the protective effects of caffeine on the liver and its role in blocking cancer-causing processes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that would account for the stimulating effect, but at the same time it has the calming, in a bigger sense, stopping the dangerous types of excitation, well, letting the cell respond to adrenaline.

**CONTEXT:** The question is asked if caffeine's stimulating effect is due to it being a mild irritant, causing the cell to ramp up metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** Most of the best studies that I've seen have found five cups a day, the benefit was still increasing and the population, they said five or more cups per day, for example, had the least liver disease and least dementia, and in some studies, least cancer. So I think it depends on your need. And some people might go up to maybe 50 cups a day. When I was hypothyroid, I felt best when I would have 30 to 50 cups, just constantly drinking fairly strong coffee with cream.

**CONTEXT:** The optimal daily amount of caffeine is discussed, with studies suggesting benefits increase with consumption up to five cups or more per day.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, if your urine starts getting very dark and thick, you should take more fluid. It doesn't hurt to pour excess water through. Sometimes in hot weather, when I would drink gallons and gallons, I might make maybe two quarts of urine. Depending on the heat and activity, sometimes I could evaporate two or three gallons out of my lungs and skin.

**CONTEXT:** A question is asked about signs of dehydration from excessive fluid intake, with the response focusing on urine color and viscosity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, probably.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion briefly touches on osmolarity in cold weather.

**RAY PEAT:** Things that support oxidation like thyroid hormone are acting largely through forming carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide, one of its major functions is in proportion to its increase. It suppresses the formation of lactic acid as the alternative low energy form of metabolism. And the low energy goes with letting large amounts of calcium and sodium accumulate in cells, leading to eventually chronic structural changes. So keeping your CO2 up steadily and on average, year after year after year, gradually prevents the structural changes, so that keeping yourself in the CO2 thyroid-responsive state doesn't get harder with aging. If you slip back periodically, going out of the carbon dioxide state tends to allow, for example, collagen to increase, and lipofuscin and other esters of cholesterol with polyunsaturated fats and other things increase sort of as a harmful baggage that builds up with age, so just steadily keeping your energy up day after day has the long-range protective effect of not letting those things accumulate so fast.

**CONTEXT:** The role of carbon dioxide in supporting oxidation, suppressing lactic acid, and preventing cellular accumulation of calcium and sodium is explained.

**RAY PEAT:** So the absence of CO2 in the cell in itself makes the cell gain an affinity for calcium and the lack of CO2 in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid. It will cause the calcium itself to go into a form that has an affinity for inside the cell.

**CONTEXT:** The mechanism by which a lack of carbon dioxide leads to increased intracellular calcium is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** ADP outbinds magnesium, so most of the magnesium in the cell is attached to the ATP molecule and with a lower energy state, less thyroid and less CO2, the ATP isn't reformed as fast so you have more ADP which binds calcium and so that's part of the cell increasing its affinity for calcium. At the same time, the calcium is losing its affinity for the blood cell solution.

**CONTEXT:** The role of ADP in binding calcium and increasing cellular affinity for it is explained, linking it to lower energy states and reduced CO2.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, calcium or CO2 effectively by streaming as it's formed, it's constantly streaming out from the mitochondria into the extracellular fluid and that tends to drag with it the mobile ions of calcium and sodium so they're being mobilized by the moving stream of carbon dioxide and when you lack carbon dioxide, the formation of lactic acid takes over and lactic acid has the same destabilizing effects that calcium does or lack of oxygen or lack of thyroid. The lactic acid shifts the oxidative reductive ratio of everything in the cell. So that all of the components lose their electron affinity to a small degree and so the cell to some extent loses its interactive affinity for carbon dioxide and progesterone and so those become less effective if you're producing lots of lactic acid and letting the cell get into its more reducing state tends to be a higher pH which causes the cell to take up more water and lactic acid itself is to some extent a chelator of calcium and it turns out that probably the best explanation for calcification of the arteries and other soft tissues is that lactic acid goes into the blood vessel or other cell at an abnormal concentration along with increased calcium and together the chelated calcium and lactate combination with phosphate tends to form permanent crystallization inside the cell. But that sort of thing happens everywhere. It's just most visible in the blood vessels because they're constantly exposed to the lactic acid formation by the endothelium and red blood cells as well as what's happening in the tissues.

**CONTEXT:** The mechanism by which CO2 mobilizes calcium and sodium, and how lactic acid, in its absence, destabilizes the cell, leading to calcium accumulation and calcification, is detailed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, block the energy. Aldosterone and cortisol both directly interfere with mitochondrial oxygen use.

**CONTEXT:** The question is whether cortisol and aldosterone contribute to blood vessel calcification by interfering with oxidative metabolism and increasing lactic acid production.

**RAY PEAT:** It's in one situation it's a challenge to adapt to and so it can be a growth and development signal that accounts for our particular shape but that same process when we are no longer evolving fast enough to invent something new to do with it, then you start getting the effect in which it makes tissues stay too long in the excited state. It gets harder and harder to rouse your oxidative resources to relax the tissues and squeeze the calcium.

**CONTEXT:** Intracellular calcium's role as a signal for adaptation versus a biological malfunction is explored.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, apparently that's what happens when your thyroid is low. So the medical test, if you go to the doctor, they'll say, oh, let me test your magnesium. Well, maybe magnesium in the blood shouldn't be high. That wouldn't necessarily be a good sign, right? Since it's an intracellular mineral.

**CONTEXT:** The implication of low thyroid on intracellular magnesium levels and the interpretation of blood magnesium tests are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, exactly like potassium. High potassium often means that your cells are dying and letting their potassium leak into the bloodstream. Same with magnesium.

**CONTEXT:** The parallel between high blood potassium and high blood magnesium as indicators of cellular issues is drawn.

**RAY PEAT:** Except that erythrocytes are mainly glycolytic in their energy system, so they aren't very representative of the oxidative cells. It's undoubtedly better than just a dissolved magnesium.

**CONTEXT:** The limitations of using erythrocytes for intracellular magnesium testing are explained.

**RAY PEAT:** The nails are probably pretty good but hair is exposed to the air and any water that you get on your hair and dust and fumes bind strongly to the hair so hair is a terrible way to get an impression of what's happening in your body. But nails will be better and for things like steroids maybe?

**CONTEXT:** The reliability of hair and nail tests for assessing mineral status is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. Probably the long range thing is the cholesterol PUFA ester that interferes with the proper stabilizing functions of cholesterol and so in a way it's keeping the cell in an activated condition that lets calcium remain too long and in that semi-activated condition you just don't have as far to move in effect if you're already half contracted then it takes a giant stimulus to get you to contract the rest of the way. The readiness to contract is a very high structural energy storage effect. ATP and proteins in a hydrophobic state when they get just a sufficient trigger will undergo a lot of huge activation with contraction if they're a muscle cell but with a powerful conduction if they're a nerve cell but if they're in already a half-activated state the triggering mechanism is already half spent and so it takes something different to get the residual mostly glycolizing cell to become functional and active.

**CONTEXT:** The connection between cholesterol PUFA esters, cellular activation, and calcium retention is explored, explaining how this state reduces cellular responsiveness.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know. I haven't seen that.

**CONTEXT:** The question of calcium and albumin binding to deactivate endotoxin is posed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are a lot of pathways that converge on nitric oxide too. Like on calcium uptake, they all end up lowering oxidative production of energy, blocking CO2 formation.

**CONTEXT:** The relationship between nitric oxide, calcium uptake, and reduced oxidative energy production is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The compound with magnesium probably is the right way to use ATP therapeutically, because other forms will break down easily, become external free ATP is very dangerous. It's one of the major danger signals or activators, inflammation, but when it's bound to magnesium, it is probably not toxic outside the cell, and can get inside the cell easier.

**CONTEXT:** The therapeutic use of ATP bound to magnesium is discussed, highlighting its stability and reduced toxicity compared to free ATP.

**RAY PEAT:** No, the harmful calcium overload usually results from a high parathyroid hormone which usually goes with increased aldosterone and other problems. But the overload is intracellular under the influence of the anti-metabolic action of parathyroid hormone. And so vitamin D and calcium act first to knock down parathyroid hormone. The lower, the better. And let the cells return to the self-maintaining state. People who've had their parathyroid hormone, parathyroid glands removed surgically for kidney disease often recover from lots of the symptoms of chronic kidney disease. Their sleep improves. They might stop having seizures. A lot of inflammatory things are decreased when they simply cut out the parathyroid glands, but that's because there are poisons being produced mostly in the intestine when the kidneys are failing that drive up the parathyroid hormone. If your kidneys haven't deteriorated then taking vitamin D and getting lots of calcium will hold down your parathyroid hormone and let the cells re-energize themselves and get rid of their calcium and when I talk about vitamin D, I mean the 25 hydroxy or dihydroxycholecalciferol that activates the so-called calcium or vitamin D receptor and those are activated by high parathyroid hormone and they do the dirty work of the hyperthyroid hormone turning on lactic acid production is one of their essential. Production of lactic acid in the bones is the sometimes useful effect of parathyroid hormone. When you need to draw calcium out of the bones, the parathyroid hormone makes lactic acid locally and dissolves enough calcium to move into the bloodstream. If you have persistently high parathyroid hormone then that keeps acting and you're constantly moving calcium into the bloodstream and in the presence of the lactic acid being produced everywhere in the body under the influence of parathyroid hormone than the calcium. It gets stuck in all of your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** The rationale behind recommending high calcium intake is explained, focusing on its role in lowering parathyroid hormone and its downstream effects on cellular metabolism and calcium regulation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yep. I've been thinking for a long time that there should be. A regular testing every time a person has a medical blood test, I think they should check the level of lactate in the blood. You can diagnose cancer even if you can't find a tumor. If you have a serious cancer developing somewhere, your blood lactate is going to be increasing. The lactate becomes carcinogenic to other tissues, so the cancer doesn't necessarily have to metastasize to spread because it's putting out the toxic levels of lactic acid tending to turn other cells into either cancer or cells that favor the development of cancer.

**CONTEXT:** The importance of regular lactate testing as a diagnostic tool for cancer is emphasized, as lactate can promote cancer development in other tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** Now they usually say the normal range is 0.05, I think it's millimoles, to 2.2. And already at 2, the mortality is increasing people with 2 and above when they come into a hospital. Are less likely to get out alive than the people who are well under 2, so I would say maybe 1.0 would be a maximum compatible with health.

**CONTEXT:** The normal range for blood lactate levels and the increased mortality associated with levels above 2.0 millimoles are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the lactic acid is, starting with endotoxin, lactic acid produced under the influence of endotoxin becomes the agent of all of the problem symptoms, blood clotting, increased serotonin effects of all sorts inflammatory. uh swelling uh congestion and uh edema of the lungs and the brain all of those things are activated by the lactic acid.

**CONTEXT:** Lactic acid, particularly when produced under the influence of endotoxin, is identified as the agent behind various symptoms including blood clotting, inflammation, and edema.

**RAY PEAT:** FC Mayerson had his famous calcium triad which was the Japanese researcher at Fujita concentrated a lot on the ubiquity of calcium intracellular concentration with deterioration and death but FC Mayerson said these besides contraction calcium acts to increase proteolytic enzymes and lipolytic enzymes and nucleic acid degrading enzymes. Those were the three main effects that made calcium deadly under the prolonged influence of stress and lactate.

**CONTEXT:** Intracellular calcium's role in cell deterioration and death is explained through FC Mayerson's "calcium triad," which includes increased proteolytic, lipolytic, and nucleic acid-degrading enzymes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. The prostaglandins are just one of the consequences of lipolysis, sort of random inflammatory lipolysis creates even the lesser than like compounds become toxic when released inappropriately.

**CONTEXT:** Prostaglandins are identified as a consequence of lipolysis, and the release of lesser compounds during inflammatory lipolysis is noted as potentially toxic.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are a lot of pathways that converge on nitric oxide too. Like on calcium uptake, they all end up lowering oxidative production of energy, blocking CO2 formation.

**CONTEXT:** The convergence of various pathways, including calcium uptake, on nitric oxide and their collective effect of reducing oxidative energy production and CO2 formation is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** The right amount of caffeine helps. All of the anti-inflammatory things are helpful.

**CONTEXT:** Caffeine and anti-inflammatory agents are suggested as interventions to help lower lactate levels.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think vitamin K and ubiquinone are part of the defensive process.

**CONTEXT:** Vitamin K and ubiquinone are mentioned as part of the body's defense mechanisms against lactate buildup.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. It's very reasonable because some of the flavonoids, like phycetan, just by a slight shift in the electron affinity in the direction of more oxidized retraction of electrons will have a big effect on stopping lactic acid formation and getting the cell back into the oxidizing condition.

**CONTEXT:** Flavonoids like phycetan are discussed for their ability to shift electron affinity, reduce lactic acid formation, and promote cellular oxidation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think those are the three most active, but there are several with a similar... not quite as intense. pro-oxidative effects.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion confirms that phycetin, apigenin, and naringenin have pro-oxidative effects, with several other compounds exhibiting similar, though less intense, properties.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The compound with magnesium probably is the right way to use ATP therapeutically, because other forms will break down easily, become external free ATP is very dangerous. It's one of the major danger signals or activators, inflammation, but when it's bound to magnesium, it is probably not toxic outside the cell, and can get inside the cell easier.

**CONTEXT:** The therapeutic use of ATP bound to magnesium is discussed, highlighting its stability and reduced toxicity compared to free ATP.

**RAY PEAT:** No, the harmful calcium overload usually results from a high parathyroid hormone which usually goes with increased aldosterone and other problems.

**CONTEXT:** The importance of regular lactate testing as a diagnostic tool for cancer is emphasized, as lactate can promote cancer development in other tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so, and lots of people. I've got convinced that they have chronic Epstein-Barr problems. It's the estrogen driving their antibody-producing system wild, and what they need is progesterone. I've seen cases diagnosed as fairly serious, if not terminal. Lupus, for example, clear up overnight or within a week of using progesterone. Simply by restoring the balance between progesterone and estrogen gets rid of that wild production of antibodies.

**CONTEXT:** Estrogen's role in driving antibody production and its potential link to conditions like lupus and chronic Epstein-Barr virus is discussed, with progesterone suggested as a balancing agent.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it destroys the thymus type. cell processes. It drinks the thymus gland the way estrogen does, so it tends to leave the antibody system working.

**CONTEXT:** Cortisol's effect on the thymus gland and its impact on the antibody system is explained.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're getting away with a nonsense virus pandemic. And if people ever catch on that the whole thing is fraudulent, they'll have to come up with something new. So they could come back with an acute climate problem. Actually, they're blaming the fires on the Pacific Coast on climate change, but the climate change is really being driven by the hundred hundred years and more clear-cutting, destroying the forests, which were the climate moderators. The forests were responsible for the moderate amount of rainfall that sustain those forests. When they clear cut them and at the same time began draining lakes and rivers in the cities, the clear cutting destroyed the soil, started depleting the underground water and that added to the clear cutting to destroy forests more quickly, dehydrating the whole region. And now the clear-cutting has changed the climate, and the dryness itself is stimulating the spread of fires, which increases the destruction of vegetation, and it's a self-stimulating desertification process, but has nothing to do with carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** The narrative of climate change as a driver of fires is challenged, attributing them instead to deforestation and its impact on climate moderation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a lot of these things we've been talking about increase the foldedness of the cortex. The low energy things tend to give us a flatter, less wrinkled, thinner cortex, even within an individual lifetime. You can see thickening or thinning of the cortex according to, for example, your progesterone to estrogen ratio, your carbon dioxide to lactate. The cortex is growing all the time given the energy and conditions and as it produces more functioning cells. It gets thicker and in effect longer and has to wrinkle since the whole the linear or the area of it increases and on a sphere that means it has to get more and more wrinkly and that thickens it even though the layer in itself is keeping the same structure. The wrinkles get deeper. I think that's the thing that can, in a very short time, account for a very big skull like the Baschow.

**CONTEXT:** The relationship between cellular energy, hormonal balance (progesterone to estrogen ratio), CO2 to lactate ratio, and the development of a thicker, more wrinkled cortex, potentially explaining large skull formations, is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, all of the history and biological books are written to confirm a paradigm which is radically wrong. If you start with Franz Boas, who was sort of the founder of scientific anthropology, he studied head shape and had the reason he isn't popular is that he showed what profound effects an environment can have on the overall shape of the skull in just a single generation people with parents coming from the same region of Europe with the same in the community in Europe their heads all had the same ratio of length and width and height but if they lived in New York or Puerto Rico their heads have changed according to the head shape of the people around them obviously something about the climate and diet in a single generation changed those so-called evolutionary anthropological physical characteristics.

**CONTEXT:** The influence of environment, climate, and diet on skull shape within a single generation is highlighted, challenging established anthropological paradigms.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a progesterone is compensating, tends to increase and make up for the reduced oxygen concentration. The progesterone facilitates the delivery of oxygen. oxygen and sugar to the tissues and so they tend to have a higher ratio of progesterone to estrogen during pregnancy which would favor that proportion of the skull.

**CONTEXT:** Progesterone's role in compensating for reduced oxygen concentration and facilitating oxygen and sugar delivery to tissues is explained, particularly in the context of pregnancy and skull proportion.

**RAY PEAT:** I think high... salt and calcium. They tend to live in salty lakes and I think their diet is exaggeratedly overloaded with both calcium and salt.

**CONTEXT:** High salt and calcium intake are suggested as potential factors contributing to the longevity and health span of flamingos.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, all of the things that reduce stress and rigidity, lowering your serotonin, tends to make you less authoritarian and rigid and so increasing cell energy makes you more flexible mentally and... Margaret Mead, who was Franz Boas' student, in her work she showed that literacy freezes everything associated with literacy, which tends to be authoritarianism, but the literate cultures tend to freeze and give the impression that cultural change is as slow as as biological evolution is supposed to be and she showed that in the non-literate cultures as soon as anything changed requiring a cultural adaptation they were absolutely flexible and simply intelligently revised their whole culture so the whole idea of cultural history being a long-term rigid process, it falsifies what the person is really doing. They're constantly re-inventing culture if they aren't having it drilled into them by authority.

**CONTEXT:** The connection between reduced stress, lower serotonin, increased cellular energy, and mental flexibility is discussed, alongside Margaret Mead's observations on the rigidity of literate cultures versus the flexibility of non-literate ones.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the perception of others right from the beginning, you feel empathy as soon as you recognize that you are in the world, you see how others express their body movements you feel in your own body, when you see them make a gesture or expression, you feel what it feels like on yourself. And so right from the beginning, all of our understanding is empathetic. There is no awareness of the world, which isn't also assimilating the empathetic view of others, that you feel their need for justice the same way you feel it for yourself. And that's one of the things that has to be educated out of people, the tendency to feel community with everyone you know. Because you wouldn't have the proper acquisitive behavior, you wouldn't fit into a society in which inequality is a virtue.

**CONTEXT:** Empathy is described as an innate, foundational aspect of human understanding, and the societal tendency to educate this out of people for the sake of acquisitive behavior and inequality is noted.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, serotonin creates basically fear and anxiety and withdrawal and education. Yeah. It really is designed to change our organism towards a leader follow instructions kind of behavior.

**CONTEXT:** Serotonin is linked to fear, anxiety, withdrawal, and a predisposition towards following instructions, shaping behavior towards a leader-follower dynamic.

**RAY PEAT:** Stream into you with newness. Any contact with the world tends to be exhilarating. And it's only the essentially learned helplessness that makes people turn inward and detach from the environment and its stimulating properties, particularly other people.

**CONTEXT:** Contact with the world is described as exhilarating, with learned helplessness being the cause of inward turning and detachment from stimulating environmental factors, especially other people.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're calling everything that tests on one test or another if a test positive they're calling that a case. But case always has meant a case of sickness but a case of positivity on a test. It's dishonest to call it a case when it's only a test, and the test, if it's very accurate in finding some of the nucleic acid or protein of the virus, it doesn't mean that you have reacted to the virus at all, and if you've reacted to it, it doesn't mean that you have you have had any sickness reaction at all. It simply means that the virus has been detected, and the people who are susceptible to getting sick from that sort of virus, this particular kind of coronavirus happens to attach to the ACE2. Enzyme which is a proteolytic enzyme that destroys angiotensin and so if there is a huge amount of of the enzyme of the virus circulating if you have reproduced it and there's a lot of it in your bloodstream it will be in activating the proteolytic enzyme that destroys the inflammatory angiotensin so that the virus is capable of turning on your inflammatory system. Everything that angiotensin acts on will be released and intensified until you have the resources to turn off angiotensin. For example, progesterone and carbon dioxide will counteract the effects of angiotensin and so the process of getting sick from coronavirus simply doesn't happen if you have the proper physiological response to increasing angiotensin, which is to increase your carbon dioxide and progesterone, turn off the inflammation at the base.

**CONTEXT:** The definition of a "case" in the context of virus testing is questioned, highlighting the dishonesty of equating a positive test with sickness. The mechanism by which coronavirus can trigger inflammation via the ACE2 enzyme and angiotensin is explained, along with progesterone and carbon dioxide as counteracting agents.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's okay to find out that you have the virus sitting on. Your nasal membranes or wherever, but if it's there and you haven't got sick, that's just the normal 80% of the people don't bother getting sick when it's present because they have enough progesterone and carbon dioxide and not too much PUFA, linoleic acid is required for the virus to take on its virulent shape.

**CONTEXT:** The presence of the virus without causing sickness is attributed to adequate progesterone and carbon dioxide levels, and the absence of excessive PUFA (linoleic acid).

**RAY PEAT:** Stimulate a reconsideration of the whole 115 years of medical immunology theory, but I don't think it will. The whole history starting with Paul Ehrlich and his lock and key thing and equating his chemical toxins with antibodies, that whole thing is bogus. The real immune system is everything in the organism that makes it able to stay healthy in the presence of things that could possibly make it sick, but his die-mercury compounds are various. Organic chemical treatments that he equated to the lock-and-key antibody androgen reaction, that happens, but it isn't what makes us immune. It's a horrible chemical commercial ploy to sell products absolutely lacking science, which should start with cells such as T cells and all of the different white blood cell-like resin tissue cells, mast cells, dendritic cells, a whole range of things that don't produce antibodies but that are essential for maintaining good health. Those things are the real immune system, but to understand them, you have to understand the whole physiology and it's easier to think in terms of lock and key and something you can buy from a pharmaceutical monopoly.

**CONTEXT:** The foundation of medical immunology, particularly Paul Ehrlich's "lock and key" theory and the emphasis on antibodies, is criticized as a commercial ploy. The true immune system is described as a broader range of cellular functions that maintain health, rather than solely antibody production.

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is considered an immune suppressant but that's because it limits our antibody production where estrogen drives furious production of antibodies but limits estrogen destroys our thymus if it's dominant. A progesterone can regenerate the thymus. What it's doing is reducing the potentially autoimmune, anti-survival antibody system and promoting the thymocentric innate resistance system, reducing inflammation while allowing regeneration and restoration.

**CONTEXT:** Progesterone's role in modulating the immune system is explained: it limits antibody production and promotes innate resistance, while estrogen drives antibody production and can damage the thymus.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so, and lots of people. I've got convinced that they have chronic Epstein-Barr problems. It's the estrogen driving their antibody-producing system wild, and what they need is progesterone. I've seen cases diagnosed as fairly serious, if not terminal. Lupus, for example, clear up overnight or within a week of using progesterone. Simply by restoring the balance between progesterone and estrogen gets rid of that wild production of antibodies.

**CONTEXT:** The connection between high estrogen, an overactive antibody system, and conditions like lupus and chronic Epstein-Barr virus is discussed, with progesterone being presented as a solution to restore balance.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're getting away with a nonsense virus pandemic. And if people ever catch on that the whole thing is fraudulent, they'll have to come up with something new. So they could come back with an acute climate problem. Actually, they're blaming the fires on the Pacific Coast on climate change, but the climate change is really being driven by the hundred hundred years and more clear-cutting, destroying the forests, which were the climate moderators. The forests were responsible for the moderate amount of rainfall that sustain those forests. When they clear cut them and at the same time began draining lakes and rivers in the cities, the clear cutting destroyed the soil, started depleting the underground water and that added to the clear cutting to destroy forests more quickly, dehydrating the whole region. And now the clear-cutting has changed the climate, and the dryness itself is stimulating the spread of fires, which increases the destruction of vegetation, and it's a self-stimulating desertification process, but has nothing to do with carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** The narrative of climate change as a driver of fires is challenged, attributing them instead to deforestation and its impact on climate moderation.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, the overall policy is to change the whole economy, get rid of any hint of self-sufficient economic activity. And turn everyone into a potential employee, make room for useful eaters, and if someone chooses not to be useful in their system, then their fate probably isn't going to be much better than what the Nazis did with their useless eaters.

**CONTEXT:** The overarching policy is described as aiming to dismantle self-sufficient economies, create a dependent workforce, and marginalize those deemed "useless eaters."

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are thousands and thousands of homeless people in Portland and Eugene, and they've been herding them around, moving them in places that are less conspicuous. Not, not doing anything to help them, but keep them from being a nuisance or spectacle.

**CONTEXT:** The management of homeless populations is characterized as a process of displacement rather than providing assistance.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there will be more unemployed and homeless people as soon as the moratorium on foreclosures comes to an end. I can't see any alternative except a huge expansion of the homeless population. It's possible to survive living in a cardboard box with a plastic field against the rain, but it isn't going to create a stable population, so within 20 years it will have meant a reduction of the population.

**CONTEXT:** The end of foreclosure moratoriums is predicted to lead to a significant increase in homelessness and a subsequent population reduction within two decades.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a cog in the wheel, whatever the machine is that they intend to have operating, I can't really visualize how they perceive this artificial intelligence guided society to be working 50 years from now. But if we're moving more and more towards centralization and automation, even if you turn all of the useless eaters into useful eaters, I think it's going to be a lot of These people are largely useless anyways, right? I mean, what are they going to do? They don't really have jobs for all these people. I know that that's why I can't foresee any viable future for the reset economy of world economic forum. Now, most people are employed. Someone is making lots of profit. for having billions of people making junk, useless electronic gadgets to keep the people occupied and being willing to work. As long as there's money to be extracted, this system is working. But it isn't self-sustaining. It requires constantly pumping resources in. from the Empire. And once Africans and South America have been mined to the limit, they're simply going to have to either rethink the whole program or eliminate vast amounts of the population, the whole Imperial. The World Economic Forum program is currently based on the Empire and it's getting essentially free raw materials and extremely cheap labor to sell to anyone who has the money to buy it.

**CONTEXT:** The concept of "useful eaters" is defined as individuals integrated into a centralized, automated system, serving as cogs in a machine. The viability of the "reset economy" is questioned due to its reliance on constant resource extraction and the lack of sustainable employment.

**RAY PEAT:** They already have all of these levels of of local, state, county, city government trained to be integrated with the military. And the plans, the economic plans, all kinds of minor officials have been contacted by the Homeland Security to participate in their anti-terrorist programs and so on. So they're ready to deal with anyone who starts. Gorilla chicken farms or potato farms or whatever. They'll get ruby-rigged.

**CONTEXT:** Local and state governments are integrated with military and homeland security structures, prepared to suppress independent economic activities like farming.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 30s, they did exactly that. They sent the military or police out to wipe out vast amounts of pigs and chickens and fruit and vegetables, destroying and burying. Huge amounts of food, to increase the price of food, to start investment coming back. That was done supposedly to get employment increasing, and it was actually the coming war that increased employment and stopped the depression, but they did it with the supposedly good intention of......restoring the economy, but now they'll have other reasons for condensing any organized, shooting-capable force, state police or county police or whatever, to do the Ruby Ridge sort of thing, identify the... independent co-ops as terrorist dangers. And then they'll have pretext because the animals will have COVID-19, and so therefore the people will be harboring, like, killer virus animals, and they'll be, like you said, like they'll be considered terrorists. And I'm sure there'll be a media campaign against these people as well, if you're just like a homesteader.

**CONTEXT:** Historical parallels are drawn to the 1930s, where food was destroyed to inflate prices. Future scenarios are envisioned where independent homesteaders and their livestock could be targeted as "terrorists" under the pretext of disease.

**RAY PEAT:** In the... in 1930s, while the government was doing that official destruction of resources, the corporations had their goons out burning down alternative newspapers, burning out co-ops of various sorts of consumer co-ops and producer co-ops were just... they would last a few months and then they would be destroyed by corporate employees.

**CONTEXT:** Corporate actions in the 1930s are described, involving the suppression of alternative media and the destruction of consumer and producer cooperatives.

**RAY PEAT:** At some point, the Empire necessarily has to fail when it reaches the limit of what it can extract from these colonies. And when the Empire totally fails, then we can expect intelligence to erupt in unexpected places, including such things as rural police.

**CONTEXT:** The eventual failure of empires due to resource extraction limits is predicted, with a potential for intelligence to emerge in unexpected sectors, including rural law enforcement.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and they're just very, very heavily indoctrinated with the ideology that the big economy has to be preserved.

**CONTEXT:** Local law enforcement is described as heavily indoctrinated with the ideology of preserving the larger economy.

**RAY PEAT:** I think historically they would be satisfied to be self-sufficient, but they are historically very, very good business. Dealers, better than Trump at making deals, and so I think they're almost necessarily going to be a new economic empire, even if they don't have to enforce it with the military, the way the US has. They're already succeeding faster than the US is, despite the US having hundreds of military bases. Everywhere. And now they're in the process probably of setting up new colonies in Armenia and Azerbaijan so that they've got Russia and China even more encircled than before with their colonized agents. As they say, when the bank robber runs out of banks to rob, the bank robber's lifestyle necessarily has to suffer.

**CONTEXT:** China's historical inclination towards self-sufficiency is contrasted with their current trajectory towards becoming an economic empire, driven by their business acumen and expansionist policies.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, it can go on for easily 10 or 15 years, but things get less and less stable. So I think the opportunity for opting out of the system, people are seeing the possibilities more and more.

**CONTEXT:** The current system's instability is predicted to continue for another 10-15 years, with increasing opportunities for individuals to opt out.

**RAY PEAT:** What you'll get will be a few B vitamins that are fairly stable and lots of iron and also lots of potentially irritating or toxic breakdown products of all of those highly oxidizable compounds, vitamin A in the process of oxidizing can catalyze all kinds of attacks on surrounding materials so oxidizing the vitamin A could destroy some of the otherwise stable B vitamins. So it's not really a very logical way to get your liver. Eggs have many of the same nutrients in a lower concentration and so eggs would be the next best substitute rather than a dehydrated liver.

**CONTEXT:** Desiccated liver is described as containing stable B vitamins, iron, and potentially irritating or toxic breakdown products due to oxidation of compounds like vitamin A. Eggs are suggested as a more logical alternative.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you carefully de-fat it to start with get rid of ubiquinone and vitamin A and vitamin D and K and and so on some of the most useful things in the liver Then you can dehydrate it and have a good vitamin B complex However with lots of iron.

**CONTEXT:** The process of preparing desiccated liver is discussed, noting that removing ubiquinone, vitamins A, D, and K would yield a good vitamin B complex, but it would still contain significant iron.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, radiation. I think people often get White whiskers where they've had dental x-rays just because the x-rays Destroy so much of the apparatus you Iron probably goes into the when iron is circulating in the body it will probably Settle into the damaged pigment forming copper containing Enzymes that have lost their copper So even though excess iron wasn't necessarily the cause of the whitening It's likely to show up As a presence associated with the white hair Sort of like in an area with toxic metals You'll find aluminum in the Alzheimer's brain But the aluminum gets there just because the Alzheimer's process Normally would be from the build up of calcium under stress Lactic acid production and so on. But the if you're exposed to aluminum It'll out compete the the calcium in some of the places The same way with with the iron. It isn't necessarily the cause but it'll be associated with it very often.

**CONTEXT:** Radiation, particularly from dental x-rays, is suggested as a cause of white hair. Iron's presence in white hair is explained as it settling into damaged pigment-forming enzymes, rather than being the primary cause. Similar associations are drawn with aluminum in Alzheimer's brains.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I've tasted it, and I've read about how the FDA has been abusing it by turning it into a proprietary, super expensive drug instead of a natural herbal remedy, but I don't really know much about how it works. The hydroxychloroquine, which is basically a, you know, a synthetic derivative of quinine, right?

**CONTEXT:** Quinine's history with the FDA and its relationship to hydroxychloroquine are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. The reason I'm asking is, well, first for, you know, in regards to COVID, there's a recent study came out that showed that quinine was actually 10 times more effective without any cell toxicity. In killing the COVID, the coronavirus, and both preventing the virus from entering the cell and stopping an already existing infection. So I thought that that's pretty remarkable. And again, it shows how FDA can bastardize pretty much anything good that the world provides, just for the purpose of making money. But the reason I'm asking is that, if you look further into quinine on PubMed, there are a number of pretty interesting studies showing that. It depletes tryptophan similar to the way, well actually it has similar effect to the drug fenclonine, parachlorophenylalanine. But instead of inhibiting the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, somehow the quinine is capable of depleting tryptophan inside of the cell and basically making it deficient in serotonin. And on top of that, apparently it's acting as a similar to the drug cyproheptadine. And that also blocks the serotonin receptors. So I thought that those two, that those effects were remarkable because I don't know of any other chemical that has such effects. So I thought, you know, I was wondering if you've seen anything, but if you haven't, that's fine. That convinces me to try some tonic water.

**CONTEXT:** Quinine's potential efficacy against coronavirus, its ability to deplete tryptophan and block serotonin receptors, and its comparison to fenclonine and cyproheptadine are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, me too. Apparently the British, when they were drinking tonic water while they were colonizing India, they were drinking tonic water that was not ruined. By FDA's regulations, so it had a much higher amount of quinine. I think right now FDA limits it to about 85 milligrams per liter, while the British were drinking it in a concentration of 300 to 500 milligrams per liter, and they were guzzling this all day with no ill effects, it seems. They managed to conquer entire India and survive malaria and many other diseases.

**CONTEXT:** The historical consumption of tonic water by the British in India is contrasted with current FDA regulations, highlighting the significantly higher quinine concentration in the former and its perceived benefits against diseases like malaria.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not convinced that he even has anything. It would be politically opportune to get it. I don't think it matters very much one way or the other.

**CONTEXT:** Skepticism is expressed regarding the authenticity of a political figure's reported illness, suggesting it might be politically motivated.
