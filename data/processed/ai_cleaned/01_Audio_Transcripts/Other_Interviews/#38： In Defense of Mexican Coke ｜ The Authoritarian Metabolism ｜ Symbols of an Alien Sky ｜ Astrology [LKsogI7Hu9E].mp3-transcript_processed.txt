**RAY PEAT:** "I think of it as a. A basic reflex of being of matter itself that is a starting point of life and there is. You can go off in an infinite number of directions except as limited by those innate impulses intrinsic to matter. So I would not. Limit my possibilities to thinking that organisms had to have been the source."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to the nature of life and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The question arises about what constitutes life and whether our current scientific understanding is too narrow.

**RAY PEAT:** "My picture of a solid substance is very similar to everything we think of as life. In a metal, you have the little magnetic domains, the crystal-forming domains, that are in the passage of time and energy through the metal, like if the metal bends back and forth, these domains will interact and build up and form crack possibilities. And similar domains to the little magnetic domains that, for example, if you hammer a magnet, it gradually loses. Magnetism, unless it's in a magnetic field, but just hammering a piece of iron in the Earth's magnetic field, the iron will rearrange itself and form a big magnet because those little domains are constantly ready to respond to their environment. And I think there are... electric domains, even though the metal seems to be conducting as a whole or a unit, I think there are electronic domains on a small scale that define properties such as photoelectric properties and all of these intrinsically... organizing subunits of something that seems to be a mere mass of an element, all of these have lifelike properties. So I would see granite, for example, as tending to become more alive."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores the idea of life beyond biological organisms, using examples from the physical properties of matter.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, exactly. Okay. But then again, the shape, if we can say the shape of that life form would be context-specific. You'll be different depending on where you're looking at, right? Saturn would have a different life form, Venus would do. Because all of these things like the iron hammer in the Earth's field. It's taking on, its nature is developing in relation to its environment and I think that's always happening. Everything on some level knows where it is in the world, not only where but when. So the awareness of process. Everything really is not only needing to be defined in terms of everything in its momentary environment but in the tendency of the environment to be changing in a certain direction."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion continues to elaborate on the concept of life as an emergent property of matter, emphasizing the role of environmental context.

**RAY PEAT:** "Exactly. They are ideologues as to what life is. And if you look at what they dogmatically believe a cell is, you have to say that the whole enterprise is stupid. Even as they try to understand bacteria on Earth, they're committed to impossible doctrines. So naturally, if they look for something that doesn't quite exist on Earth, they're likely to be missing everything interesting."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation critiques the narrow, dogma-driven approach of mainstream science in the search for extraterrestrial life.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think that happens all the time. Okay. The raw data everywhere is more entry official conclusion, like the Michelson-Morley experiment. Uh, the textbooks, uh, uh, uh, uh, insist... Uh, that they didn't find an ether drift, uh, but it's very clear in, in their data. Uh, and in the follow-up studies over the next 20 or 30 years, uh, it kept being confirmed. Uh, and, uh, the, the establishment, uh, uh, periodically subsidizes someone to, uh, uh, shoot down, uh, uh, the alternative interpretations, uh, just because they were... close to the actual recorded data isn't sufficient. They, they violate the paradigm, and so have to be destroyed."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion shifts to the suppression of scientific findings that challenge established paradigms, using the Michelson-Morley experiment as an example.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, it's exactly the same sort of thing that led to Gilbert Ling being isolated and absolutely walled off from the whole scientific world. You mentioned Halton Arp a bunch of times. If what he found was taken seriously, that would lead to a reimagining of everything, right?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation draws parallels between the suppression of scientific dissent and the isolation of researchers like Gilbert Ling and the implications of Halton Arp's work.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's their idea, but Halton Arp, or Fred Soddy, believed that cosmic rays represented... newly-created atoms, and Halton Arp was seeing these clouds, the red-shifted clouds, attached to an old-looking galaxy. I think he was seeing the concentrated, newly-formed matter, and Halton Arp was suggesting the stray bits of it that didn't condense. in a new, red-shifted galaxy that we're seeing newly-created matter constantly streaming through the world."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion delves into theories of continuous creation in the universe, referencing the work of Fred Soddy and Halton Arp.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, yeah, any coseriff would argue that it was the passage of time itself. The asymmetry of being, that time is a property of matter, getting richer and more in quantity, improving its complexity and mass even. No one ever really attempted to... argue against his reasoning that there was simply the assumption 160 years ago that time must be symmetrical, that there must be the possibility of time going in the other direction, which just doesn't make sense. There was a mathematical physics professor... at the University of Oregon, who believed he could explain the nuclear fission and lots of things in terms of particles coming from the future, coming backwards in time and hitting at present things, but no one has rationally tried to deconstruct Kozyrev's view that... matter is asymmetrical in the sense of always getting later and that passage of time in asymmetry is adding information and energy to the universe constantly."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores Nikolai Kozyrev's theories on time as a property of matter and its implications for energy and information in the universe.

**RAY PEAT:** "Not that particular paragraph, but that would overlap nicely with Kozyrev's time. Kozyrev said matter is being, or energy is being created in relation to the mass and his predictions. of planetary internal energy have been confirmed fairly recently, even in terms of the big gaseous planets. Everything is fitting his scheme of heat production internally in proportion to their mass. And he worked it out for stellar energy in terms of mass, but then applied it. to the Earth's internal heat and was looking to test it in the dark of the moon when he saw red eruptions on the moon. And that has been confirmed repeatedly, but it was denied just because it violated the conservation of matter and energy at such a radical level."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion connects Kozyrev's theories to planetary energy production and the denial of findings that challenge fundamental physical laws.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but he pointed out that that was all deduced from Christian beliefs about the creation of the universe."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation addresses the potential religious underpinnings of established scientific laws like the conservation of matter and energy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, yeah, I think all of these people have given... a rational side of the answer, that neutrinos appearing according to the mass of the matter, that and Kozyrev's projection of stellar energy in terms of mass or cosmic rays have... being the earliest form of matter coming into existence with kinetic energy as part of their inheritance from the nature of matter. And I think the process of knowing where matter comes from will involve......getting a grasp on what the nature of a neutrino is, and what electrons and protons and neutrons are, and all of their potentialities, and I think a picture will emerge that has a more satisfying......answer to why is matter emitting energy and becoming greater in complexity and mass."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores the origins of matter and energy, linking it to neutrinos, fundamental particles, and the theories of Kozyrev.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yep. That's just another way of talking about the same thing."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation acknowledges the convergence of different scientific perspectives on a fundamental creative principle.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think of consciousness as a sort of electronic gel inside the brain. It has different properties according to the chemical."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to the nature of consciousness and its potential electronic or chemical basis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think of consciousness as a sort of electronic gel inside the brain. It has different That when it's operating at a low energy, some people, for example, will never dream in anything but words or symbols, others will only dream in monochromatic images, and people who have had a very happy life, not too much stress, will have... more satisfying full sensory polychromatic dreams, and their thought processes will be similarly able to be relatively free-floating, so that you can imagine things kinesthetically and involving all of the sensory properties informing. Images that make your thought processes tend to stay very close to empirical reality, but that we are helping the universe to generate the possibilities for the next step of substantial change, that the energy is reaching a point where it can......guide the organism to make the decisions that will allow a richer biological life, further supporting the range of the mental creative qualities."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation delves into the relationship between consciousness, dreams, and the overall energetic state of an individual, suggesting a role in universal evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, anyone can do it if they just pay attention. Many times I've asked people what they see when they close their eyes, and they usually say, what do you mean? You don't see anything when your eyes are closed. But if you say, well, don't you see? Black, or red, or something, and lots of people will deny that they see blackness when they close their eyes. So would you say that this is an indication of basically the brain's constant need to create through dreams?"

**CONTEXT:** The discussion explores the phenomenon of seeing images when the eyes are closed and its connection to the brain's creative processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Once you start doing it, you see that there's stuff going on. It just isn't... just the color of your eyelids or darkness that you're seeing. You're looking into your brain, and the brain is constantly playing around, producing all sorts of things. If you happen to notice something interesting pass by in your attention, you can direct your attention to it. It's like tuning in. A very rich TV, according to the way you tune, you can get more and more information, sort of a hypertext of imagery."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation elaborates on the internal visual experiences when the eyes are closed, likening it to tuning into a "hypertext of imagery" within the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can get perfect blackness if you are very calm and in the dream-ready state. The background should be able to quiet down into total blackness. A very impressive darkness you don't necessarily notice at night or in a cave. It's the internal quietness of your retina and brain but as soon as you are active in any sense then you start seeing thoughts and dreams."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion focuses on achieving a state of internal quietness to experience true blackness and the emergence of thoughts and dreams.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh sure it's creating a stimulus inflow on your retina and that activates your visual center of the brain and those who are going back and forth all the time."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explains how physical stimuli, like pressing on the eyes, can activate the visual cortex and lead to perceived imagery.

**RAY PEAT:** "So it shows that people are constantly activating their retina from the brain with endodromic impulses. So basically the dreaming is during the day external impulses are imprinting patterns on our retina and at night when the stimulus is no longer there the brain basically goes into you know free creative mode in juxtaposing all of these images and does it does it does it project them back to the retina is that what we see them when we're dreaming?"

**CONTEXT:** The discussion explores the concept of the brain actively re-energizing the retina, leading to the perception of images during dreams.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, not necessarily the LSD type dream. It tends to be like perceiving luminosity in space, but it can concentrate on the retina and you can tell the difference. Salvador Dali was very good at that kind of introspection and he called the brain dependent. I independent imagery, he called the camembert for its continuity and lack of granularity and he called the seeing that involves the retina a caviar because it's broken up into nervous units."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation references Salvador Dali's insights into different types of imagery, distinguishing between brain-dependent and retina-dependent perceptions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Probably, yeah. He fell into the fascist DNA mentality. He got rich by doing it."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation touches upon Salvador Dali's later views and a potential shift towards a more rigid, possibly ideologically influenced perspective.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, my first experiences with ciproheptadiene were to improve my breathing at night and over the first two or three nights I was getting a good sleep because of the the relieved bronchitis, but after about five nights... I started having weirdly intense dreams that I think was the changing balance of serotonin and histamine, and so I stopped taking it for a while, and when I returned to taking it, I found that I had become about ten times more sensitive to it. It did something building up. So that I didn't need it after about five days, but in the process, it let loose something in the dream apparatus that made them disturbingly random and intense."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation shares a personal experience with ciproheptadiene, highlighting its impact on dream intensity and the potential interplay of serotonin and histamine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that sounds reasonable."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation acknowledges the plausibility of a proposed physiological mechanism for nightmares related to serotonin and melatonin.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think our brain development Is very susceptible to the weak magnetic fields of the earth and and those are changed by events on the Sun. Velikovsky and several other people have theorized that it was these solar system events that created the great religious myths, stories of the flood and so on, being actual historical memory of interactions, a spark. Uh, uh, passing between Venus and earth, for example, uh, like they, I mean, they call it, uh, the, the, the great period, do you think, uh, but, uh, well, I guess I, I could be not miss, uh, not understanding, but in the vernacular sense of the sun is like a central to the evolution and the complexifying nature of throwing energy into a system would, would Saturn. Be that or the Venus would that have taken the role of our sun and besides the magnetic fields, the heat being thrown at the Earth would that have been that could have led to some superior evolution of humans and interactions and things or or what."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores the influence of solar system events and magnetic fields on human evolution and the origins of myths, referencing the theories of Velikovsky.

**RAY PEAT:** "Michel Gauquelin. He was the French guy who wanted to debunk it. Oh, cosmic clocks, cosmic clocks, yeah. Okay, so those planets being in very close proximity would have changed everything. Is that right to say?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation introduces Michel Gauquelin and his work on "cosmic clocks," suggesting the potential impact of planetary proximity on human experience.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, our time, the actual passage of time, and... intensity of chemical reactions, everything influenced by gravitational fields, the concentration of neutrinos, that was Horace Dudley's ideas that could explain the Michelson-Morley aether drag, that if neutrinos have a taste for associating with mass, then they tend to form a gradient getting more concentrated towards the center of the Earth and dropping off at high altitudes, and so when Miller took his apparatus up either to higher mountains or put it into holes in the ground, deep basements, he found less drag at high altitude. And more drag in the basements consistent with Dudley's idea that the neutrino sea constitutes the luminiferous ether that used to be in the textbooks."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation delves into Horace Dudley's theories on neutrinos and their potential role in explaining the luminiferous ether and phenomena like aether drag.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I exchanged a few letters with Horace Dudley and asked his opinion on what he thought about crystal domains being resonant. Key's resonance factors for neutrinos and that the crystalline nature of the earth would be the crystals that they were attracted to as well as the mass and he agreed that that seemed reasonable but he hadn't mentioned it himself."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation highlights an exchange with Horace Dudley regarding the potential resonance of crystal domains with neutrinos.

**RAY PEAT:** "I ran across a clipping by a physicist who had put radioactive carbon isotopes in fatty acid, incorporated into fatty acids and showed that in the test tube they produced the perfect normal or random nuclear decay, which is... the principle that everything, nuclear power reactors, are based on the absolute randomness of decay. But when he put a drop of this, let it form a monolayer on aluminum foil, he then recorded non-random decay, showing that something as... a force as weak as the crystalline-like surface of a metal, would allow the... some energy to store up and then hit the atoms in a non-random, intermittent fashion, and corresponded with Dudley, he said that crystalline interaction with neutrinos seemed reasonable, but he hadn't talked about it, but he was warning that we don't know enough about the factors that cause nuclear decay, and in the ignorance of what actually is causing the nuclear decay being a interaction with a neutrino, he... warned that nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors might not obey their assumption of random nuclear disintegration."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation discusses a physicist's findings on non-random nuclear decay influenced by crystalline surfaces and its potential implications for nuclear safety, linking it to Dudley's neutrino theories.

**RAY PEAT:** "I went to look up Anderson's article, the physics guy who put the fatty acid oil on aluminum, and I found it. Anderson had published his article in the very week, the same journal, in which Dudley was warning against the dangers of non-random fission in nuclear reactors. And neither of them was aware of the other, but both came up to a similar conclusion that they were not aware of the dangers of non-random fission in nuclear reactors. So I went to look up the article, and I found it in the very week, the same journal, in which Dudley was warning against the dangers of non-random fission in nuclear reactors. And neither of them was aware of the dangers of non-random fission in nuclear reactors. Nuclear disintegration is not a random event."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation highlights a remarkable coincidence where two researchers, Anderson and Dudley, independently arrived at similar conclusions about the non-random nature of nuclear disintegration, underscoring the potential dangers of current assumptions.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I haven't heard that, but that's the same idea that weak forces in the environment are not... trivial or are not absolutely irrelevant to nuclear decay just because of the high energy it takes for a physics person to cause fission, nature undoubtedly has many alternative routes to creating disintegration."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation acknowledges the influence of external forces, like the Sun's magnetic field, on radioactive decay, reinforcing the idea that weak forces are not negligible.

**RAY PEAT:** "They said that's not reliable. Anderson in particular got involved in that and that whole thing. Creationist people were also challenging carbon dating and so that was a further problem for Anderson's reputation that he was talking about things that the creationists were interested into."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation discusses the unreliability of carbon dating and how Anderson's findings became entangled with creationist challenges, impacting his reputation.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. Apparently, I mean, if you Google it, you'll find it. But the reason I'm bringing this up is that the archaeologists found that there's been a nuclear reactor that apparently, if we believe the carbon dating, it's been sitting there and periodically creating mini nuclear explosions every couple of hundred years. And they think it's at least 100,000 years old, if not more. And they were kind of worried. The article that I read is that well, if this nuclear reactor is capable of spontaneously going off, what does that mean for our man-made nuclear reactors? It was a pretty interesting article. But if you Google Gabon nuclear reactor on Google, the Wikipedia page will come up immediately. That sort of thing must be suppressed. It will destroy all of the existing assumptions of physics."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation introduces the natural nuclear reactor in Gabon, Africa, and its implications for the safety and understanding of man-made nuclear reactors, suggesting its suppression due to its challenge to established physics.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. If you're familiar with a variety of physics professors. You can get an idea of how rigidly dogmatic they are about their assumptions. When there was evidence of cold fusion, for example, they practically foamed at the mouth in saying what an awful thing that was to propose cold fusion. It just caused their brains to undergo. spontaneous reactions. They did ruin the careers of those, I think, those three original scientists that proposed it in the 70s, if I'm not mistaken."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation highlights the dogmatic resistance of the scientific establishment to new ideas, using the example of cold fusion and the suppression of its proponents.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, Dudley warned me not to talk about any of these things if I was not financially independent. He said he retired from the Navy and had a pension he could live on. I didn't dare to talk about such things."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation reveals a personal warning from Horace Dudley about the risks of discussing unconventional scientific ideas without financial independence.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, all right. Yeah, yeah, there is intelligence popping up everywhere. My favorite old civilization was the one that made those giant round heads in Mexico. They were so intelligently designed and sculpted that they weren't archaic looking anatomically like the Egyptian sculptures. Were those the Aztecs or not? No, they were Olmecs, I think they associate them with."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation touches upon ancient civilizations and their advanced artistry, specifically mentioning the Olmecs and their distinctive sculptures.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I'm open to all kinds of alternative interpretations."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation expresses an openness to unconventional explanations for historical artifacts and phenomena.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. As soon as an interesting idea pops up in a university or a corporation, it's likely to be destroyed before the person can talk to a reasonable number of informed people. And so if you stop shooting down... all of the interesting alternative ideas, things would necessarily multiply realistic possibilities exponentially."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation criticizes the suppression of novel ideas within academic and corporate institutions, arguing that fostering alternative thinking would accelerate progress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, I was... Old people at the time were always talking about how awful things are getting, but just from the late 30s to the late 40s, I saw a horrible increase in authoritarianism. And the 1950s was when it really took off with full government support. To cleanse the high schools and universities of descending thinking in physics, biology, politics."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation reflects on a perceived increase in authoritarianism in the mid-20th century, particularly its impact on academic and intellectual freedom.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I think it's the accumulation of power. In the ruling class, I think we can see all of the links, like Hitler accumulated power from American, British and French banking institutions, and the defeat of Germany was really the universalization of the structure of evil he had constructed. His intelligence apparatus was taken over by the CIA, so Hitler himself lost, but the project continued. The same bankers that created Hitler collaborated with the CIA. To continue the project that's that's why there was such a burst of evil with the year that the CIA was born. That was when Lamarckism was rooted out of all of the schools in the United States."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation links the accumulation of power to the rise of authoritarianism, citing historical examples and the influence of financial institutions and intelligence agencies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, energetically it's like cancer. It runs very fast but very stupidly. So it's basically in a very inhospitable environment. It's indispensable to survival but that's about it. It doesn't really have any other evolutionary usage. Yeah."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation uses the analogy of cancer to describe the nature of power, highlighting its rapid but unintelligent progression and limited evolutionary utility.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think the World Economic Forum has taken over right along with the CIA and the top biggest banks. The Gates Foundation is one of their tools. I think the brain of the system is between the World Economic Forum and the CIA."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation identifies the World Economic Forum, CIA, and major banks as central to a controlling system, with the Gates Foundation acting as a tool.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think he's on the level of the Gates Foundation. He's a tool of the American digital community."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation positions Eric Schmidt as a tool of the American digital community, akin to the Gates Foundation's role.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think the World Economic Forum has taken over right along with the CIA and the top biggest banks. The Gates Foundation is one of their tools. I think the brain of the system is between the World Economic Forum and the CIA. Because I just don't remember hearing about Klaus for the last like, maybe I'm just totally ignorant, which is a real possibility, but I just don't remember hearing about him very much through all the so-called conspiracy channels. No, he was very open for the last five or six years. He's been saying all of these horrible things, we need more genetically modified organisms to completely take over the food economy. Everything has to be made artificial."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation discusses Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum's agenda, noting his increasing openness about promoting genetically modified organisms and artificial food systems.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think the World Economic Forum has taken over right along with the CIA and the top biggest banks. The Gates Foundation is one of their tools. I think the brain of the system is between the World Economic Forum and the CIA. Because I just don't remember hearing about Klaus for the last like, maybe I'm just totally ignorant, which is a real possibility, but I just don't remember hearing about him very much through all the so-called conspiracy channels. No, he was very open for the last five or six years. He's been saying all of these horrible things, we need more genetically modified organisms to completely take over the food economy. Everything has to be made artificial."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation reiterates the influence of the World Economic Forum, CIA, and major banks, highlighting Klaus Schwab's public statements about genetically modified organisms and artificial food.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. If the courts have any autonomous function, that's going to be continuing to get more interesting. But it's funny because I, when you sent me that video that was, um, what's it called? Scroll up here. It's, um, uh, crimes against humanity by Reiner, a full, full Mitch and that video had, I mean, it wouldn't have a million views or something, but I have it, I put it in the note, the notion document that I was going to use to collect all the notes for this episode. And right now I'm staring at like a dead video. Like it was taken off YouTube. And so that's, that's very encouraging the censorship that we're now dealing with."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation expresses concern over the censorship of information, citing a specific video that was removed from YouTube.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's, it's a win in court. It's going to get some attention. Like, was it Minnesota where they got a court decision against the governor? Michigan. Michigan, Michigan. The governor was Michigan. Oh, yeah. There's a funny meme going around. It's like the founding fathers of the constitution and it says, just in case anybody, I'm going to screw this up, but it's like, just in case anybody needs to know, all of this doesn't matter in case there's a virus. So it's like. All these constitutional rights disvanish instantaneously when the WHO declares a pandemic apparently and so very very interesting."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation discusses legal challenges to government overreach during the pandemic, referencing a court decision in Michigan and a meme about the suspension of constitutional rights.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, that's true that they are a branch of the military establishment. Their only difference is that they aren't weapons user. Someone from another branch of the government, if they want to have weapons when they visit you. Right. I mean, I was reading a few blogs and apparently a lot of this is classified, but the reason they're involved is, officially at least, that's the official reason, is that because of that vaccine injury program that the Health and Human Services runs, apparently that's also, so the military says, look. We need to be involved as well, and that's the National Health Service is apparently mostly involved with reviewing the claims and determining if there's any national security threat to any of that. So that's the official reasoning, but the, like, there have been some declassified documents that suggest that the military is actually actively looking at every vaccine trial and trying to glean information if this could become like another bioweapon. So they're getting access to all the medical records to everything that happens in that vaccine trial. And sometimes, of course, this is all in the area of speculation, even if a vaccine is known to be dangerous and ineffective, the military will push for it to be released because they will think it can become an effective weapon in the future if it's only slightly modified so they can turn it against a foreign country."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores the military's involvement in vaccine trials, citing official reasons related to vaccine injury programs and declassified documents suggesting a focus on bioweapon potential.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they've um been throughout history of the 20th century. They've been operating a biological weapons establishment, researching it and it periodically becomes public. I think the reason the news around 2015 started coming out of how sloppy they were, thousands of jazz musicians playing all over the world. Potentially dangerous leaks of engineered viruses that were designed to be specifically infective to humans and more toxic symptoms produced than the wild virus. This information, it had been leaking out slowly. About five years ago, they started letting out more publicity about how dangerous this program was, and that led to the moratorium, which led to Fauci taking some of the programs outside the country to China, for example. But there are... germ warfare labs operated by the U.S. in several countries of Europe and Africa, as well as China. So they're outside the U.S. jurisdiction. But I think the fact that we got so many leaks appearing suddenly was specifically part of the program, the Rockefeller Foundation, Gates Foundation, and World Economic. Forum were working on this planned creation of a panic, and as part of getting the public to panic, it's very effective to let information leak out that these super-dangerous engineered viruses might have been leaking all along for several years. They were basically sending a message to China that they might actually be ready to return to biological warfare against China with one of these super dangerous viruses. China already in the Korean War had experience with American attempts at biological warfare. Wilfred Birchert was the journalist who was following that and interviewing the people in China and Korea who had experienced the drops of the various organisms. So I think it was sending a message to China to help to create the environment. For declaring the pandemic. They knew they were going to declare a pandemic years in advance, and it helped to give it realism by having these press releases."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation discusses the history of U.S. biological weapons research, leaks of engineered viruses, and the potential strategic use of this information to create a climate of fear and justify pandemic declarations, with a specific message to China.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think they were hoping that... they would have more knowledge of what the threat was, if they were actually participating in it. OK, so it's a form of like voluntary economic espionage. China said keep your enemies closer, right? Get the US on our territory to do that work and we can learn what they're doing and potentially be ready to protect ourselves and also maybe develop even something better. Yeah, but I... I doubt that they realized that these plans had been going on for years to create the pandemic or to declare the pandemic, but they took all the necessary precautions in case it was a dangerous germ warfare agent, but then within just two or three months, they Right in Wuhan, they were celebrating holidays in gigantic public assemblies. There's a picture on the internet of hundreds and hundreds of people crammed into a giant swimming pool. Right at the peak of the pandemic here in the United States, these people were a thousand or so together standing. Two or three feet apart."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores China's potential motivations for collaborating on virus research, suggesting a strategy of "keeping enemies closer" for intelligence gathering, while questioning their awareness of long-term pandemic plans.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think they realized this was gone about May and they reopened everything. So how do you think the U.S. public, a significant portion of the U.S. public and, I don't know, a significant portion of Europe, Western world in general, how can they look at China being fully reopened and several other countries as well and still believe that we need to go into a lockdown and there's a surge here and all these masks and all the other measures are necessary considering the Chinese are having the times of their lives right now?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation questions why Western populations continue to adhere to pandemic restrictions when China has fully reopened, suggesting a disconnect in public perception and media reporting.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think they're just so confident that they've... done a thorough brainwashing job, controlling the media now for 77 years total control. I've never seen... I haven't seen a single article in the popular press that said, hey, look, China is fully open. How come they're open and we're not? This has never been brought up to my knowledge in any of the major newspapers in the United States or Western Europe. Yeah, they can get away with... saying that everything coming out of China is fake because they're a communist country, even though they're nominally communist, they're the world's biggest capitalist economy. Right."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation attributes the continued adherence to pandemic measures in the West to media control and a deliberate suppression of information, particularly regarding China's reopening.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, many, many other bad things too. Last question for me, then I'll give it to Georgie, then I'll read the super chats and then let you go, right? A few times you said that the Sinoplus tablet is two and a half grains, but I thought it was always three grains. Am I missing something? It depends on what your definition of a grain is. The FDA decreed that glandular thyroid has a certain composition, but they apparently haven't bothered measuring. The differences, whether it's pork or beef and where the animal grew up, affects very strongly the composition of the hormone value of the glandular thyroid. And by decree, again, about 50 years ago, they said that 100 micrograms of T4... is equivalent to 25 micrograms of T3, and also by decree, they said that glandular thyroid usually has 3.1 parts of T4 when it's digested to each part of T3. But all of those things are variable according to the particular mineral. So... the most important thing to realize is that that ratio of a hundred micrograms to one microgram of T4 to T3 to 25 micrograms of T3, that ratio is imaginary. An ideal male medical student maybe would get results like that. But in the average 35-year-old female... there's no such equivalence at all. A hundred micrograms of T4 very often has anti-virate effects in a middle-aged female. And so T3 has much more value than 4 times the value of T4. But like a third of a Sinoplus tablet, and I think that weighs out to like 53 milligrams, that would be, you're not objecting to calling that like a grain, right? You're just saying it's very complex, the history of what a grain is and what a grain isn't?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation delves into the complexities of thyroid hormone equivalence and dosage, questioning the FDA's standardized ratios and the variability of glandular thyroid preparations.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, at the beginning of the 20th century, they were still using raw thyroid or cooked, but wet thyroid tissue. And so they talked about the therapeutic dose as being......one or two or three or four grains, the grain being a weight measure, 62 and a half, I think it is, milligrams. And when the armor company and a couple of other smaller companies began dehydrating the product, taking out the 65 or 70 percent water......meant that the de-padded gland was three or four times as effective as the wet gland, simply because of the absence of water. And so they added lactose to make up for the water weight, so that their product......doctors who were familiar with the wet gland prescription, in terms of grains of wet fresh gland......they could......go directly to a certain weight grain of the dehydrated product, because the added lactose brought up the weight, so the potency per weight was identical to the fresh gland. But during its development, ARMA was constantly mixing their different batches, recognizing that... one particular batch of dehydrated, de-patted gland would have very different potencies. So they would mix them until they could get a product that had the expected potency of fresh gland on mice. All of the batches were standardized for decades, testing them on mice. There was no rigid formula, it was a matter of mixing until they got the right effect. That all went away in the 90s when armor went out of the thyroid business and the FDA took over by proclaiming the content. glandular thyroid actually contained T4 and T3, it doesn't contain those until it's broken down and digested. Your digestive system is where the T3 and T4 are formed. So it's misleading to describe the hormonal content at all of an untested glandular preparation. So just talking about T3 and T4 in micrograms is a lot simpler than the erroneous measurement of grains. Yeah. And the Xenoplus is very consistent in how many micrograms of each they put on each tablet. Understood."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation provides a historical overview of thyroid medication, from raw tissue to dehydrated preparations, and discusses the shift towards FDA standardization, highlighting the loss of batch-to-batch standardization and the misleading nature of describing hormonal content without digestion.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but lots of people have been bitten by a rabid dog and weren't where they could get treatment or maybe took an herb and were fine. I've known several people who were bitten by an officially tested rabid dog and took a cactus potion or or some herb. They didn't get rabies, so they were convinced that the herb was curative. I think it was just their natural tendency not to contract rabies."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation questions the absolute lethality of rabies, suggesting that natural immunity or other factors might play a role in survival, even without conventional treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** "I suppose there would be a difference between chicken pox and smallpox, the nature of the sort it produces, and herpes, for example. They just have the type of cell they favor to live in or reproduce in, but some people are innately. immune to those, even though they don't have antibodies against them, their whole system just isn't compatible with the properties of the virus. So I guess all other things being equal, things like maybe if the virus, like the herpes virus tends to attack the nervous system, there's a more potential for, you know, a more serious outcome, all other things being equal."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores how viruses might have varying lethality based on the cells they target and the concept of innate immunity, where the body's system is incompatible with a virus's properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but the better a person's health is. The less they notice having contracted herpes."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation emphasizes that a person's overall health status influences their experience and perception of viral infections like herpes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there haven't been any studies really that are relevant to human susceptibility."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation points out the lack of relevant studies on human susceptibility to viruses like rabies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that one part per thousand or less, if it's something very active like an estrogenic fragment of a steroid, it takes only a few micrograms of estrogenic substance to cause symptoms like sore breasts or uterine spasms. I started having bad reactions to everything except the old Syntex product, the ones who were the first steroid producers, and developed the very rigid German. chemists in charge, made sure everything was done punctuously, and other products that came on the market, some of them even smelled different, but all of them had a very high chemical purity test, but I started having bad reactions, intestinal inflammation reactions to it. So, I pretty much stopped using it about 20 years ago."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation discusses adverse reactions to pregnenolone, suggesting that even highly pure products can cause issues due to trace amounts of estrogenic contaminants, and shares a personal experience with a specific brand.

**RAY PEAT:** "Probably possible."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation acknowledges the possibility of pregnenolone degrading over time into estrogenic substances, even in pure forms.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you have it from a source and have tested it on oneself and friends and can take a teaspoonful of it with no adverse effects at all. Two or three days, then you're pretty sure it's the real stuff."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation offers a practical method for verifying the quality of pregnenolone by testing it on oneself and others for adverse reactions.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so. Okay. Yeah, that's actually a good idea. I mean, there aren't that many at least that are known, so a lab should be able to test even if they're in microgram quantities. Mm-hmm. Okey-doke."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation endorses the idea of testing pregnenolone for known estrogenic metabolites as an additional quality control measure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think Sucrose has a great... virtues therapeutically. I've heard stories about fatally apparently injured animals and people who were in the hospital with hopeless symptoms being given a mouthful. In the case of an animal in shock, they would pour a mouthful of honey in its mouth. and hold its mouth shut, and in a few minutes the animal would be up, not dying at all. And that has happened to dogs and sheep and ducks and all sorts of animals, as well as patients who were in the hospital in a hopeless condition. Someone slipped them a jar of honey and gave them a tablespoon of it. And their symptoms disappeared, and dozens and dozens of stories like that convinced me that in an emergency of almost any sort, a good big dose of sucrose is very important. But if you compare just coffee with added sugar, it's a very different experience. Sucrose. I don't think you get quite the effects you do with Mexican Coke. I think the coca leaf extractives are really biologically active, doing something very different from the caffeine content."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation highlights the therapeutic virtues of sucrose, particularly honey, in emergency situations, and contrasts its effects with those of Mexican Coke, suggesting the unique biological activity of coca leaf extractives.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when they compared Pepsi to Coke, Pepsi was high in sodium, so that in Indochina, it was recommended for babies with diarrhea as a sterile source of sodium and sugar. But Coke didn't have nearly that much sodium, but it was very high in potassium. And that you plant extractives are the only logical source for potassium. And then the chemical for methyl limidazole, that's like brown, similar to the brown that in coffee. Is there any harm to that substance? It probably is some harm in it, but it's offset by the other values."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation analyzes the mineral content of Pepsi and Coke, noting Pepsi's high sodium content and Coke's high potassium, and discusses the chemical methyl imidazole, suggesting its potential harm is offset by other beneficial components.

**RAY PEAT:** "They know there are several containers of cocaine that are biologically active but they just don't want to talk about it because they might be ordered to take those out too and no one would buy the product."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation suggests that coca leaf extractives contain other biologically active compounds besides cocaine, which are not disclosed to avoid product removal.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's such a powerful stimulant. It can make things run at such a high intensity that it destroys the system. But its main stimulant effect, do you think it's happening through the dopamine system or by stimulating metabolism?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation discusses the stimulant effects of cocaine, its potential to overtax the system, and questions whether its primary mechanism is through the dopamine system or metabolic stimulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, it somewhat stimulates metabolism but it activates the expenditure of energy so fast that where you can get ahead of the metabolic support system and get sick from taking too much too often. Is that why cocaine was used as a weight loss drug by housewives back in the early 1900s?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explains that cocaine's rapid energy expenditure can outpace metabolic support, leading to illness, and suggests this might be why it was used as a weight loss drug historically.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Probably. It does run the system at a high speed and it's likely to give you vitamin deficiencies and mineral deficiencies for that reason. So similar to dinitrophanol basically?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation confirms the potential for cocaine use to lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies due to its high-speed systemic activation, drawing a parallel to dinitrophenol.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the fat people are quick to jump in and say, eat polyunsaturated fats and cut down your sugar intake. But that's the worst advice ever given. It's causing chromosomal injury in millions of. of kids to have parents that have grown up on a high proof of anticyroid situation."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation strongly criticizes the advice to consume polyunsaturated fats and reduce sugar intake, labeling it as detrimental and linking it to chromosomal damage in children.

**RAY PEAT:** "You can make up for The absence of liver But but it takes a lot of attention to do it Because it's such a rich source of of many of the other luxury nutrients Vitamin A is hard to get enough of in the active animal source of retinol. They're pushing carotene, which is a powerfully anti-thyroid, anti-progesterone agent. So if you try to meet your vitamin A requirements with carrot juice, for example, you're very likely to get... all kinds of metabolic problems, including hormonal deficiencies."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation emphasizes the importance of liver as a nutrient source and warns against relying on beta-carotene from sources like carrot juice, as it can be anti-thyroid and anti-progesterone, leading to metabolic and hormonal issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, many, many other bad things too."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation reiterates the negative consequences of consuming beta-carotene, extending beyond lung cancer to other adverse health effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, at the beginning of the 20th century, they were still using raw thyroid or cooked, but wet thyroid tissue.
