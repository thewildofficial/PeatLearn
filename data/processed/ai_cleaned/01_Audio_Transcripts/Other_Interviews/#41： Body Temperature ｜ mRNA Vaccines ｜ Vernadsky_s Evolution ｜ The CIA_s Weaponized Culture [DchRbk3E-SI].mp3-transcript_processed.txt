**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the earth was outgassing, uh, uh, lots of carbon dioxide and, and oxygen and, uh, internal heat was probably, uh, adding to the climate warmth.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether the Earth was more geologically active during the time of massive animals and vegetation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, he, he was interested in oil chemistry and he dissolved iron in acid and floating on liquid when it was dissolved was an oily material and he took samples of it to, uh, various petroleum chemists and asked them to identify it and they all recognized it as petroleum and could even give the region that it smelled like and that was, I guess, 1859 or something. So he dissolved iron into what, hydrochloric acid, I think it was. Okay, so dissolving metal into hydrochloric acid basically made it look like oil. Iron is a high carbon content metal and so it was the catalytic effect of the iron and the intrinsic carbon that produced the oil. And so that interested me in the Russian understanding of petroleum and that had been they were publishing various theories of that in the early 60s. 1960s is when I started reading it and there was an article about something to do with the renewability of oil wells published in, in Science News and I wrote them a letter about the Russian studies on the theory that it's being generated deep in the earth and so you can pump out an oil well and have it come back after several years. And when that letter was published, this guy, Tom, what's his last name, he's the one that is considered to have invented the abiotic oil theory, at least for Western chemistry. He, about a year after that, published his first article on abiotic oil, but leaving out all of the interesting art and history.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the abiogenic theory of oil creation.

**RAY PEAT:** And the intrinsic heat of the giant planets that is still being confirmed and the giant gas planets are emitting heat in proportion to their mass. And that's consistent with the whole planetary creation of everything that happens on the planet, not just driven by solar energy but the internal chemistry of the planet.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion was about the discovery of liquid methane and oil on Saturn's moon Enceladus and its implications for the origin of fossil fuels.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the deep ocean vents that are emitting organisms, basically a whole ecology of up to worms in the super hot ocean water. The high pressure lets them tolerate the heat and the emissions, volcanic emissions into the ocean water are providing the life-supporting system. I think that's a model of how life originated, hot rocks and gas interacting with water producing a very quick, highly developed ecologies and the whole story of gradual evolution. I think it's really just looking at how the phases of the Earth's development turn out rather than random gene accumulation.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origin of life and whether it was driven by internal planetary processes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but the big novel thing is to see it driven from the inside of the planet rather than just from the sun.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether evolution is driven by internal planetary energy or solar activity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there have been fossil observations of what seemed to be petrified human-like things in Broxac. It was believed to be millions of years old, and all of those extreme anomalies, people include them in literature and such, but they don't make it into the science journals.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether there were more advanced humanoid beings in Earth's past, referencing mythology.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and even in the last 100 years or so, we see extreme differences in lifespans. That the official biology industry just says that it's all lies, but the churches have been keeping birth records on people for hundreds and hundreds of years, and the records are there showing people quite a few well over 150 years old.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether past civilizations had longer lifespans, referencing mythology.

**RAY PEAT:** Volcanic powers the obvious thing, basically converting that to, yeah, like geothermal energy. Is that what you have? Yeah, it's generously available and easy to get.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about an optimal energy source for civilization.

**RAY PEAT:** Life arising from the ocean that was in in the living state. St. Georgie, that was also his thesis, that we couldn't leave the ocean until we figured out how to bring it with us, like the water in our bodies. Is that on the right track?

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origin of life and the role of the ocean.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm no, I don't think that's the membrane. People talking invent genes that could make a seal membrane that would let the cell hold water. But the primitive proteins spontaneously generated in a few minutes in the lab by Sidney Fox, those proteins are water regulatory, create their own appearance of a membrane. They have a very standard, regular size and they can assimilate new proteins and when they do, they bud off just like a yeast forming a little sphere that then assimilates more protein and grows up to the standard size at which point it buds. So all of this is something that happens in a matter of hours in the experimental laboratory and the evolutionists are just trying to hang on to their picture of history and how a cell requires a membrane.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the role of membranes in the origin of life and Sidney Fox's experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, well, you mentioned how it, life can be, the volcanoes and the creation of life in the water. How does that translate to like eventually forming us? Like, what's the, when a volcano happens to be in near the edge of the ocean or just in a place that gets rained on, then you get the same thing happening just with the drier surroundings. But the proteins, they regulate the ocean to keep out excess water and they regulate the air environment to keep in the right amount of water. It's hydrophilic enough that it's self-regulating for the water and mineral content. So the ocean plays the role of the, what was that experiment that recently was done, somebody threw like water on like really hot rock and then amino acids started spontaneously emerging?

**CONTEXT:** The question was about how volcanic activity and water lead to the formation of life.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's Sidney Fox, the spontaneous cell-like spheres.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about Sidney Fox's experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Things spontaneously organize and create higher and higher organized structures.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about Vladimir Vernadsky's ideas on the spontaneous organization of matter and its relation to evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** The present condition on Earth is being slightly modified and directed by changes that interact between planets and the sun. But the same basic tendency to basically create hotter, faster, bigger brains that organize a bigger, longer life organisms, that's the general drift that Vernadsky talked about.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether Earth's internal activity or solar activity is a bigger factor in driving evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and there's a Russian that I think he died about 20 or 30 years ago that had carried on the idea to study the energy dissipation in an egg. He described the process as an egg unscrambling itself. The intensity, the energy that it produces. So in other words, it's the energy dissipation that keeps the egg from randomizing itself. And the same thing for all life. It's a generator of higher and higher order. So the egg is apparently mostly random stuff when you compare it to the organism that comes from it, but it's the ability to produce energy with just enough of the residual information put into it by the mother system that will shape how that energy develops. But the whole process is really the ability to produce energy very fast, starting with the egg and the early embryo, and that's modified by the conditions it runs into.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about a professor at MIT's theory that life is an energy dissipating mechanism and its relation to a Russian scientist's work on energy dissipation in an egg.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so the somatic dregs are just constantly wearing out the way a machine wears out, because there's no mechanism for renewal. And so that set the tone for the 1900 rediscovery of Mendel and the creation of the so-called Neo-Darwinian view, in which Darwin is censored. The genetics industry was committed to this idea of the mortal body being a machine. And the mechanistic reductionist approach to biology, strongly based on those religious, Mendel did it for religious glory and Weizmann did it for who knows what.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion was about the origins of aging theories, referencing Mendel and August Weismann.

**RAY PEAT:** So these attempts to drive evolution by the modern genetics establishment by messing with the genes, they really, they're not really affecting evolution at all. If you want to affect evolution, you should be modifying, you should be modulating the energetic supply, which is exactly what they're not doing. Am I reading this right?

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether genes are the drivers of evolution and the effectiveness of genetic modification.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, Sidney Fox in demonstrating that his artificial cells could not only assimilate nutrients and increase their size and numbers, but he added the makings of nucleic acids, just the free bases that our DNA synthase system turns into genes. He said these nucleic acid precursors to his proto-cells and they, with only the spontaneously formed proteins, they polymerized the precursors into DNA-like substances.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about Sidney Fox's experiments and their implications for the origin of DNA.

**RAY PEAT:** All kinds of alternatives are possible. For example, one that a vegan tribe decided to restrict their diet to leaves and an occasional bug and that caused them to expand their digestive system and get big bellies and to not be able to support such big brains. And they turned out looking like chimpanzees. And if you look at the implications of what Sidney Fox did, that amino acids spontaneously make proteins which spontaneously are able to make analogs of DNA, then you've got the central dogma of the Watson-Crick approach to genetics. They said that information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, never the other way. But Sidney Fox showed that information is generated spontaneously in proteins and that they can then insert order into the precursors and actually make DNA from protein. So it completely shows the experimental basis, energy basis for reversing the Watson Crick approach.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the lack of archaeological evidence for human-chimpanzee common ancestry and the implications of Sidney Fox's work.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think the real evolution was happening in the tropics with good diet and happiness. And that when people drifted off trying a wheat-based industry and agriculture, some of them created a dairy industry and turned out to continue evolving. Others didn't do so well and degenerated into a war-loving.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether humans evolved under harsh conditions like an ice age.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the just the whole idea that the brain requires an abundance of energy flowing through the organism to develop. And the whole fantasy that magic, like cosmic rays, for example, are breaking genes. People have been looking at the effect of mutations on proteins now for 100 years and they've never created a better gene.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the role of energy in brain development and the idea of cosmic rays causing mutations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, speaking of which, by random mutation. I have friends who work in genetics and we've had these exact same arguments. They said, look, our field has been trying for over 100 years to create new species in the lab. And we've been unsuccessful. And I said, well, what have you been doing? Well, we've been blasting them with ionizing radiation. We've been exposing them to mutagens. We've been stressing the cells in all kinds of different ways. And yes, they do mutate, but they don't appear to be creating new types of organisms. And those people are walking around free in society.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the success of geneticists in creating new species through mutation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the, you know, the whole idea that competition between individuals drives improvement. There's no more evidence for that than for X-rays causing evolution.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether competition drives evolution and its relation to mental development.

**RAY PEAT:** That's right. There was an article that came out maybe about five years ago which said that, and of course it was immediately vilified, and it was in the Nature Journal, it said that all the evidence that we have so far indicates that when organisms strive, they regress. And I thought, then how is it possible that this is the driving force of evolution, and we should be seeing more and more primitive life forms? It would be evolution in reverse.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about an article suggesting that striving leads to regression in organisms.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the, uh, the control of Occupying Wall Street, you know, the government allowed the industries to have snipers ready, overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things got out of hand, so that the government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine. There were snipers shooting people on both sides to rouse the crowds against the government. And the point was to kill the leaders if the movements started being successful, and so the surrounding apparatus, everything from assassination down, has been put into action.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the government's response to Occupy Wall Street and its potential for violence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, divide and conquer idea. You have people putting their attention on things. They were mostly not issues in the socialist countries, but they made them issues. Specifically, a transgender thing, that never would have taken off by itself, was promoted by government and industry as part of the distraction.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about how controlled opposition themes like racism and feminism are used to distract from real issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh no, total capture. At first there were only three or four skeptics publishing and it took 20, 30, 40 years to develop a fairly sizable skeptical population. Did nobody question the fact that the chairman of the Kennedy Commission wasn't one of the Dulles brothers? Wasn't what? One of the Dulles brothers, wasn't he the chairman of the Kennedy Commission? Allen Dulles, yeah, the whole thing on its face. Anyone who was paying attention immediately knew it was a coup. But, like, M.S. Arnone had a little newsletter called Minority of One. He immediately gave a detailed analysis of what would happen as a result of this coup. Absolutely correct. And it was, I think, something like November 27th when he sent it out. But the people who, instead of reading that, maybe a thousand people read it, but everyone else was reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and TV, and hearing the discussion of how Oswald was a Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union, and came back and visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico, and they were, I think they call it sheep-dipping, they were creating this legend around him so that when they needed someone to kill and put off the assassination on a victim, he had this aura of Marxism around him, but he was actually just a normal Texas Marine right-winger who worked for the CIA on the U-2 spy plane, knew the codes needed to use radar to shoot it down, which the Soviets hadn't had, so then they had him with that information defect to the Soviets. And then when he was in place, and they wanted to block Eisenhower's attempt to establish detente with a summit meeting in May of 1960, they flew the U-2 plane, Gary Powers flew it, over the appropriate rocket sites with the information Harvey Oswald had and got a shot down, or if that failed, probably had a self-destruct bomb in it. So they arranged for it to fall and interrupt the detente Eisenhower had in mind as his legacy for ending the presidency. And when his job in the U-2 business was finished, he came back and they continued his creation of this aura around him by having him join the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, become get in the news by having a fight with the anti-Castro people, get on the radio interviewed as a Marxist member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he wasn't really. And distribute leaflets in the street, pseudo-Marxist propaganda, but with the address for getting in contact with him on this leaflet was the same address that the CIA and FBI used in New Orleans. He didn't do a very thorough job of cutting his connections with the CIA, which have eventually been brought out.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the public's acceptance of the official story of the Kennedy assassination and the role of propaganda.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CIA's feminist program was exactly an anti-socialist feminism program. Because what you just described is absolutely destructive to the capitalist ethic. So they basically said, oh, this is what the commies are doing, and if you're a good capitalist woman, you will embrace our version of feminism and not what the reds are trying to sell you on.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the difference between socialist and Western feminism and the CIA's role in promoting a specific version of feminism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, machismo. It is one of these implanted ideas. It defines you, what you can become and how you should behave early as a child. Four or five years old, it's already embedded. And that machismo implant is just one side of the CIA, a feminist implant.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the term "toxic masculinity" and its connection to CIA-driven culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, that was the motive for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, very, very conscious. People like John Dewey was already working on it, as far as anyone knows, free of the secret police, but definitely in harmony with them. These pre-existing pro-capitalist ideas were scooped up by the CIA when they saw the real danger of the ideology of a more or less libertarian approach to a self-determining individualism in the socialist countries. The CIA created the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was to pick out things that could be promoted in all of the cultures as the ultimate product of free enterprise and they got philosophical and economic leaders in the various countries to organize this and take money from the CIA, which was diverting it from the Marshall Plan, the vast amounts of money that were intended to restore Europe. The CIA was using to indoctrinate, create exhibitions of art and concerts and journals, journals of science, technology, economics, politics, philosophy, everything subsidized by the CIA was a huge, huge fountain of money going into particular CIA-approved ideology, all intended to counter the danger of those liberating aspects of the socialist idea.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether the CIA was concerned about socialist ideas spreading in America and their efforts to counter them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Nazis introduced estrogen for use in the slave camps, concentration camps. Because it made them into authoritarian people who would follow orders and, if necessary, harm their fellow inmates.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the contraceptive pill and its potential connection to Nazi experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it was the fact proven in the 1930s by my thesis advisor at the University of Oregon worked on the fact that estrogen at any level is creating abortions. If it has been implanted for two weeks or a month or two months, the dose has to be bigger, but you get the same contraceptive effect. But if they all work after conception has happened, so at every level, estrogen since the 1930s has been known to be an abortion pill. And it was only in the early 1950s when they started thinking of a way to sell it as something other than an abortion pill, and they called it a contraceptive. It was absolutely no evidence, but that was just a sales point to shut the church up.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about why the contraceptive pill, which was known to cause abortions, was marketed as a contraceptive.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the, uh, the control of Occupying Wall Street, you know, the government allowed the industries to have snipers ready, overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things got out of hand, so that the government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine. There were snipers shooting people on both sides to rouse the crowds against the government.

Allen Dulles, yeah, the whole thing on its face. Anyone who was paying attention immediately knew it was a coup. But, like, M.S. Arnone had a little newsletter called Minority of One. He immediately gave a detailed analysis of what would happen as a result of this coup. Absolutely correct. And it was, I think, something like November 27th when he sent it out. But the people who, instead of reading that, maybe a thousand people read it, but everyone else was reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and TV, and hearing the discussion of how Oswald was a Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union, and came back and visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico, and they were, I think they call it sheep-dipping, they were creating this legend around him so that when they needed someone to kill and put off the assassination on a victim, he had this aura of Marxism around him, but he was actually just a normal Texas Marine right-winger who worked for the CIA on the U-2 spy plane, knew the codes needed to use radar to shoot it down, which the Soviets hadn't had, so then they had him with that information defect to the Soviets. And then when he was in place, and they wanted to block Eisenhower's attempt to establish detente with a summit meeting in May of 1960, they flew the U-2 plane, Gary Powers flew it, over the appropriate rocket sites with the information Harvey Oswald had and got a shot down, or if that failed, probably had a self-destruct bomb in it. So they arranged for it to fall and interrupt the detente Eisenhower had in mind as his legacy for ending the presidency. And when his job in the U-2 business was finished, he came back and they continued his creation of this aura around him by having him join the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, become get in the news by having a fight with the anti-Castro people, get on the radio interviewed as a Marxist member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he wasn't really. And distribute leaflets in the street, pseudo-Marxist propaganda, but with the address for getting in contact with him on this leaflet was the same address that the CIA and FBI used in New Orleans. He didn't do a very thorough job of cutting his connections with the CIA, which have eventually been brought out.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the public's acceptance of the official story of the Kennedy assassination and the role of propaganda.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CIA's feminist program was exactly an anti-socialist feminism program. Because what you just described is absolutely destructive to the capitalist ethic. So they basically said, oh, this is what the commies are doing, and if you're a good capitalist woman, you will embrace our version of feminism and not what the reds are trying to sell you on.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the difference between socialist and Western feminism and the CIA's role in promoting a specific version of feminism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, machismo. It is one of these implanted ideas. It defines you, what you can become and how you should behave early as a child. Four or five years old, it's already embedded. And that machismo implant is just one side of the CIA, a feminist implant.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the term "toxic masculinity" and its connection to CIA-driven culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, that was the motive for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, very, very conscious. People like John Dewey was already working on it, as far as anyone knows, free of the secret police, but definitely in harmony with them. These pre-existing pro-capitalist ideas were scooped up by the CIA when they saw the real danger of the ideology of a more or less libertarian approach to a self-determining individualism in the socialist countries. The CIA created the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was to pick out things that could be promoted in all of the cultures as the ultimate product of free enterprise and they got philosophical and economic leaders in the various countries to organize this and take money from the CIA, which was diverting it from the Marshall Plan, the vast amounts of money that were intended to restore Europe. The CIA was using to indoctrinate, create exhibitions of art and concerts and journals, journals of science, technology, economics, politics, philosophy, everything subsidized by the CIA was a huge, huge fountain of money going into particular CIA-approved ideology, all intended to counter the danger of those liberating aspects of the socialist idea.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether the CIA was concerned about socialist ideas spreading in America and their efforts to counter them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Nazis introduced estrogen for use in the slave camps, concentration camps. Because it made them into authoritarian people who would follow orders and, if necessary, harm their fellow inmates.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the contraceptive pill and its potential connection to Nazi experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it was the fact proven in the 1930s by my thesis advisor at the University of Oregon worked on the fact that estrogen at any level is creating abortions. If it has been implanted for two weeks or a month or two months, the dose has to be bigger, but you get the same contraceptive effect. But if they all work after conception has happened, so at every level, estrogen since the 1930s has been known to be an abortion pill. And it was only in the early 1950s when they started thinking of a way to sell it as something other than an abortion pill, and they called it a contraceptive. It was absolutely no evidence, but that was just a sales point to shut the church up.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about why the contraceptive pill, which was known to cause abortions, was marketed as a contraceptive.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the, uh, the control of Occupying Wall Street, you know, the government allowed the industries to have snipers ready, overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things got out of hand, so that the government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine. There were snipers shooting people on both sides to rouse the crowds against the government. And the point was to kill the leaders if the movements started being successful, and so the surrounding apparatus, everything from assassination down, has been put into action.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the government's response to Occupy Wall Street and its potential for violence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, divide and conquer idea. You have people putting their attention on things. They were mostly not issues in the socialist countries, but they made them issues. Specifically, a transgender thing, that never would have taken off by itself, was promoted by government and industry as part of the distraction.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about how controlled opposition themes like racism and feminism are used to distract from real issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh no, total capture. At first there were only three or four skeptics publishing and it took 20, 30, 40 years to develop a fairly sizable skeptical population.

Allen Dulles, yeah, the whole thing on its face. Anyone who was paying attention immediately knew it was a coup. But, like, M.S. Arnone had a little newsletter called Minority of One. He immediately gave a detailed analysis of what would happen as a result of this coup. Absolutely correct. And it was, I think, something like November 27th when he sent it out. But the people who, instead of reading that, maybe a thousand people read it, but everyone else was reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and TV, and hearing the discussion of how Oswald was a Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union, and came back and visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico, and they were, I think they call it sheep-dipping, they were creating this legend around him so that when they needed someone to kill and put off the assassination on a victim, he had this aura of Marxism around him, but he was actually just a normal Texas Marine right-winger who worked for the CIA on the U-2 spy plane, knew the codes needed to use radar to shoot it down, which the Soviets hadn't had, so then they had him with that information defect to the Soviets. And then when he was in place, and they wanted to block Eisenhower's attempt to establish detente with a summit meeting in May of 1960, they flew the U-2 plane, Gary Powers flew it, over the appropriate rocket sites with the information Harvey Oswald had and got a shot down, or if that failed, probably had a self-destruct bomb in it. So they arranged for it to fall and interrupt the detente Eisenhower had in mind as his legacy for ending the presidency. And when his job in the U-2 business was finished, he came back and they continued his creation of this aura around him by having him join the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, become get in the news by having a fight with the anti-Castro people, get on the radio interviewed as a Marxist member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he wasn't really. And distribute leaflets in the street, pseudo-Marxist propaganda, but with the address for getting in contact with him on this leaflet was the same address that the CIA and FBI used in New Orleans. He didn't do a very thorough job of cutting his connections with the CIA, which have eventually been brought out.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the public's acceptance of the official story of the Kennedy assassination and the role of propaganda.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CIA's feminist program was exactly an anti-socialist feminism program. Because what you just described is absolutely destructive to the capitalist ethic. So they basically said, oh, this is what the commies are doing, and if you're a good capitalist woman, you will embrace our version of feminism and not what the reds are trying to sell you on.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the difference between socialist and Western feminism and the CIA's role in promoting a specific version of feminism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, machismo. It is one of these implanted ideas. It defines you, what you can become and how you should behave early as a child. Four or five years old, it's already embedded. And that machismo implant is just one side of the CIA, a feminist implant.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the term "toxic masculinity" and its connection to CIA-driven culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, that was the motive for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, very, very conscious. People like John Dewey was already working on it, as far as anyone knows, free of the secret police, but definitely in harmony with them. These pre-existing pro-capitalist ideas were scooped up by the CIA when they saw the real danger of the ideology of a more or less libertarian approach to a self-determining individualism in the socialist countries. The CIA created the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was to pick out things that could be promoted in all of the cultures as the ultimate product of free enterprise and they got philosophical and economic leaders in the various countries to organize this and take money from the CIA, which was diverting it from the Marshall Plan, the vast amounts of money that were intended to restore Europe. The CIA was using to indoctrinate, create exhibitions of art and concerts and journals, journals of science, technology, economics, politics, philosophy, everything subsidized by the CIA was a huge, huge fountain of money going into particular CIA-approved ideology, all intended to counter the danger of those liberating aspects of the socialist idea.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether the CIA was concerned about socialist ideas spreading in America and their efforts to counter them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Nazis introduced estrogen for use in the slave camps, concentration camps. Because it made them into authoritarian people who would follow orders and, if necessary, harm their fellow inmates.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the contraceptive pill and its potential connection to Nazi experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it was the fact proven in the 1930s by my thesis advisor at the University of Oregon worked on the fact that estrogen at any level is creating abortions. If it has been implanted for two weeks or a month or two months, the dose has to be bigger, but you get the same contraceptive effect. But if they all work after conception has happened, so at every level, estrogen since the 1930s has been known to be an abortion pill. And it was only in the early 1950s when they started thinking of a way to sell it as something other than an abortion pill, and they called it a contraceptive. It was absolutely no evidence, but that was just a sales point to shut the church up.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about why the contraceptive pill, which was known to cause abortions, was marketed as a contraceptive.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the, uh, the control of Occupying Wall Street, you know, the government allowed the industries to have snipers ready, overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things got out of hand, so that the government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine. There were snipers shooting people on both sides to rouse the crowds against the government. And the point was to kill the leaders if the movements started being successful, and so the surrounding apparatus, everything from assassination down, has been put into action.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the government's response to Occupy Wall Street and its potential for violence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, divide and conquer idea. You have people putting their attention on things. They were mostly not issues in the socialist countries, but they made them issues. Specifically, a transgender thing, that never would have taken off by itself, was promoted by government and industry as part of the distraction.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about how controlled opposition themes like racism and feminism are used to distract from real issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh no, total capture. At first there were only three or four skeptics publishing and it took 20, 30, 40 years to develop a fairly sizable skeptical population.

Allen Dulles, yeah, the whole thing on its face. Anyone who was paying attention immediately knew it was a coup. But, like, M.S. Arnone had a little newsletter called Minority of One. He immediately gave a detailed analysis of what would happen as a result of this coup. Absolutely correct. And it was, I think, something like November 27th when he sent it out. But the people who, instead of reading that, maybe a thousand people read it, but everyone else was reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and TV, and hearing the discussion of how Oswald was a Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union, and came back and visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico, and they were, I think they call it sheep-dipping, they were creating this legend around him so that when they needed someone to kill and put off the assassination on a victim, he had this aura of Marxism around him, but he was actually just a normal Texas Marine right-winger who worked for the CIA on the U-2 spy plane, knew the codes needed to use radar to shoot it down, which the Soviets hadn't had, so then they had him with that information defect to the Soviets. And then when he was in place, and they wanted to block Eisenhower's attempt to establish detente with a summit meeting in May of 1960, they flew the U-2 plane, Gary Powers flew it, over the appropriate rocket sites with the information Harvey Oswald had and got a shot down, or if that failed, probably had a self-destruct bomb in it. So they arranged for it to fall and interrupt the detente Eisenhower had in mind as his legacy for ending the presidency. And when his job in the U-2 business was finished, he came back and they continued his creation of this aura around him by having him join the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, become get in the news by having a fight with the anti-Castro people, get on the radio interviewed as a Marxist member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he wasn't really. And distribute leaflets in the street, pseudo-Marxist propaganda, but with the address for getting in contact with him on this leaflet was the same address that the CIA and FBI used in New Orleans. He didn't do a very thorough job of cutting his connections with the CIA, which have eventually been brought out.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the public's acceptance of the official story of the Kennedy assassination and the role of propaganda.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CIA's feminist program was exactly an anti-socialist feminism program. Because what you just described is absolutely destructive to the capitalist ethic. So they basically said, oh, this is what the commies are doing, and if you're a good capitalist woman, you will embrace our version of feminism and not what the reds are trying to sell you on.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the difference between socialist and Western feminism and the CIA's role in promoting a specific version of feminism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, machismo. It is one of these implanted ideas. It defines you, what you can become and how you should behave early as a child. Four or five years old, it's already embedded. And that machismo implant is just one side of the CIA, a feminist implant.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the term "toxic masculinity" and its connection to CIA-driven culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, that was the motive for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, very, very conscious. People like John Dewey was already working on it, as far as anyone knows, free of the secret police, but definitely in harmony with them. These pre-existing pro-capitalist ideas were scooped up by the CIA when they saw the real danger of the ideology of a more or less libertarian approach to a self-determining individualism in the socialist countries. The CIA created the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was to pick out things that could be promoted in all of the cultures as the ultimate product of free enterprise and they got philosophical and economic leaders in the various countries to organize this and take money from the CIA, which was diverting it from the Marshall Plan, the vast amounts of money that were intended to restore Europe. The CIA was using to indoctrinate, create exhibitions of art and concerts and journals, journals of science, technology, economics, politics, philosophy, everything subsidized by the CIA was a huge, huge fountain of money going into particular CIA-approved ideology, all intended to counter the danger of those liberating aspects of the socialist idea.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether the CIA was concerned about socialist ideas spreading in America and their efforts to counter them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Nazis introduced estrogen for use in the slave camps, concentration camps. Because it made them into authoritarian people who would follow orders and, if necessary, harm their fellow inmates.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the contraceptive pill and its potential connection to Nazi experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it was the fact proven in the 1930s by my thesis advisor at the University of Oregon worked on the fact that estrogen at any level is creating abortions. If it has been implanted for two weeks or a month or two months, the dose has to be bigger, but you get the same contraceptive effect. But if they all work after conception has happened, so at every level, estrogen since the 1930s has been known to be an abortion pill. And it was only in the early 1950s when they started thinking of a way to sell it as something other than an abortion pill, and they called it a contraceptive. It was absolutely no evidence, but that was just a sales point to shut the church up.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about why the contraceptive pill, which was known to cause abortions, was marketed as a contraceptive.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the, uh, the control of Occupying Wall Street, you know, the government allowed the industries to have snipers ready, overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things got out of hand, so that the government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine. There were snipers shooting people on both sides to rouse the crowds against the government. And the point was to kill the leaders if the movements started being successful, and so the surrounding apparatus, everything from assassination down, has been put into action.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the government's response to Occupy Wall Street and its potential for violence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, divide and conquer idea. You have people putting their attention on things. They were mostly not issues in the socialist countries, but they made them issues. Specifically, a transgender thing, that never would have taken off by itself, was promoted by government and industry as part of the distraction.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about how controlled opposition themes like racism and feminism are used to distract from real issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh no, total capture. At first there were only three or four skeptics publishing and it took 20, 30, 40 years to develop a fairly sizable skeptical population.

Allen Dulles, yeah, the whole thing on its face. Anyone who was paying attention immediately knew it was a coup. But, like, M.S. Arnone had a little newsletter called Minority of One. He immediately gave a detailed analysis of what would happen as a result of this coup. Absolutely correct. And it was, I think, something like November 27th when he sent it out. But the people who, instead of reading that, maybe a thousand people read it, but everyone else was reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and TV, and hearing the discussion of how Oswald was a Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union, and came back and visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico, and they were, I think they call it sheep-dipping, they were creating this legend around him so that when they needed someone to kill and put off the assassination on a victim, he had this aura of Marxism around him, but he was actually just a normal Texas Marine right-winger who worked for the CIA on the U-2 spy plane, knew the codes needed to use radar to shoot it down, which the Soviets hadn't had, so then they had him with that information defect to the Soviets. And then when he was in place, and they wanted to block Eisenhower's attempt to establish detente with a summit meeting in May of 1960, they flew the U-2 plane, Gary Powers flew it, over the appropriate rocket sites with the information Harvey Oswald had and got a shot down, or if that failed, probably had a self-destruct bomb in it. So they arranged for it to fall and interrupt the detente Eisenhower had in mind as his legacy for ending the presidency. And when his job in the U-2 business was finished, he came back and they continued his creation of this aura around him by having him join the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, become get in the news by having a fight with the anti-Castro people, get on the radio interviewed as a Marxist member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he wasn't really. And distribute leaflets in the street, pseudo-Marxist propaganda, but with the address for getting in contact with him on this leaflet was the same address that the CIA and FBI used in New Orleans. He didn't do a very thorough job of cutting his connections with the CIA, which have eventually been brought out.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the public's acceptance of the official story of the Kennedy assassination and the role of propaganda.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CIA's feminist program was exactly an anti-socialist feminism program. Because what you just described is absolutely destructive to the capitalist ethic. So they basically said, oh, this is what the commies are doing, and if you're a good capitalist woman, you will embrace our version of feminism and not what the reds are trying to sell you on.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the difference between socialist and Western feminism and the CIA's role in promoting a specific version of feminism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, machismo. It is one of these implanted ideas. It defines you, what you can become and how you should behave early as a child. Four or five years old, it's already embedded. And that machismo implant is just one side of the CIA, a feminist implant.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the term "toxic masculinity" and its connection to CIA-driven culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, that was the motive for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, very, very conscious. People like John Dewey was already working on it, as far as anyone knows, free of the secret police, but definitely in harmony with them. These pre-existing pro-capitalist ideas were scooped up by the CIA when they saw the real danger of the ideology of a more or less libertarian approach to a self-determining individualism in the socialist countries. The CIA created the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was to pick out things that could be promoted in all of the cultures as the ultimate product of free enterprise and they got philosophical and economic leaders in the various countries to organize this and take money from the CIA, which was diverting it from the Marshall Plan, the vast amounts of money that were intended to restore Europe. The CIA was using to indoctrinate, create exhibitions of art and concerts and journals, journals of science, technology, economics, politics, philosophy, everything subsidized by the CIA was a huge, huge fountain of money going into particular CIA-approved ideology, all intended to counter the danger of those liberating aspects of the socialist idea.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about whether the CIA was concerned about socialist ideas spreading in America and their efforts to counter them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Nazis introduced estrogen for use in the slave camps, concentration camps. Because it made them into authoritarian people who would follow orders and, if necessary, harm their fellow inmates.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the origins of the contraceptive pill and its potential connection to Nazi experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it was the fact proven in the 1930s by my thesis advisor at the University of Oregon worked on the fact that estrogen at any level is creating abortions. If it has been implanted for two weeks or a month or two months, the dose has to be bigger, but you get the same contraceptive effect. But if they all work after conception has happened, so at every level, estrogen since the 1930s has been known to be an abortion pill. And it was only in the early 1950s when they started thinking of a way to sell it as something other than an abortion pill, and they called it a contraceptive. It was absolutely no evidence, but that was just a sales point to shut the church up.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about why the contraceptive pill, which was known to cause abortions, was marketed as a contraceptive.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the, uh, the control of Occupying Wall Street, you know, the government allowed the industries to have snipers ready, overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things got out of hand, so that the government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine. There were snipers shooting people on both sides to rouse the crowds against the government. And the point was to kill the leaders if the movements started being successful, and so the surrounding apparatus, everything from assassination down, has been put into action.

**CONTEXT:** The question was about the government's response to Occupy
