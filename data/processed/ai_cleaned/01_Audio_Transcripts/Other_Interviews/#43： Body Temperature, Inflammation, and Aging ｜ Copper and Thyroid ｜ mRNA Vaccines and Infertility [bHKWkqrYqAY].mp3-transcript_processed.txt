**RAY PEAT:** I've just been watching for many years, doctors like a totally psychotic woman. Her brother said, but it isn't significant that her eardrum temperature is only 96 degrees, and the doctor said, oh, but that's normal for these people. And about 40 years ago, a woman supposedly with dementia, she couldn't find her way home if she was let out of the house by herself. She mentioned that her temperature had been as low as 92, and when she took a little progesterone and got her body warm, she returned to graduate school and got straight A's for a master's degree. So just warming up the brain 5 or 6 degrees, you can gain about 60 or 70 IQ points. And when I was working on the physiology of hamster aging, I noticed that there were some changes that worked under the influence of either temperature or hormones. Estrogen, which lowers your temperature, happened to cause microtubules to appear, and progesterone, which actually raises the temperature, had the opposite effect on the microtubules. And I started thinking about the effect of cold and hot water when the microtubules are sensitive to the structural temperature of the water, how much order there is in it. And there are lots of enzymes in our cells that are structurally sensitive to the temperature of the environment. For example, to the degree that as the temperature goes down, some enzymes are suddenly totally inactivated while others are activated. So it isn't just a chemical reaction, but it's a shift in the structure according to the temperature of the water. And so there's something about mammals and birds that they function very well if they live at or above 37 degrees Celsius, about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Birds very often like a much, much higher temperature. So it's a shift in temperature. Every organism has a specific range where its enzymes work, and the transition can be very sudden. There's a system that has just been more recently discovered called the heat shock proteins, and it happens that estrogen receptors are closely tied into the heat shock proteins. And so what these proteins and estrogen are doing is trying to save the terribly stressed organism that doesn't have the heat to keep working. It does something to lock the structure up and protect it structurally. And you can see that in the appearance and disappearance of microtubules and the activity of various enzymes. And anyway, that has been in the background of watching people when they take thyroid or need thyroid or warm up their brains by taking progesterone or eating more sugar and protein and so on. And so the fact that the national temperature, especially in the last 50 years, has dropped about a degree Fahrenheit for men and somewhat less for young women. But for postmenopausal women, their temperature has fallen about as much as men. So the fact that women, young women, have a higher body temperature than the average man is an indicator of progesterone ruling their physiology enough to keep them working and avoiding some of the aging diseases that men get as long as they still are cycling and making progesterone. So in this newsletter, I just go through all of the things that have been known relating to inflammation, aging, degeneration, and disease as it relates to failing to keep your temperature up where it should be.

**CONTEXT:** What is the core message of your newsletter regarding body temperature, inflammation, and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** It's a big part of it. It's the big hollow ones that are involved in cell division and part of the system of movement, but there are several types of smaller, intermediate, and smaller filaments.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding microtubules, is that the same thing as the cytoskeleton of the cell?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, cholesterol of pregnant alone and progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** Wasn't there a recent study showing that progesterone alone is one of the most effective stabilizers of the structure of the microtubules, and cholesterol as well?

**RAY PEAT:** And energy, and unfortunately, this was, I think, an interview that never actually aired, but it was really interesting talking about energy having a softening effect, and then the deprivation of energy having this hardening effect. And that's of course associated with like a fibrosis and calcification, correct? And cancer.

**CONTEXT:** You're talking about the hardening and suppleness of tissue or a cell and that being a big part of aging and energy. And you mentioned that deprivation of energy has a hardening effect, which is associated with fibrosis, calcification, and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** There are several articles that are very interesting that, for example, once you know that a tumor hardens. These people will say that, for example, for telling whether a breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, all you have to do is feel for the lymph nodes and see if they're abnormally hardened. If they're not hard, they're not cancerous. And you see estrogen is one of the primary hardening aspects of aging and things like that, that's driving the hardening.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that tumors harden and that this hardening is a sign of cancer. You also stated that estrogen is a primary hardening aspect of aging.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, anything that knocks the energy down. And it's kind of odd, like the carbon dioxide and the generation of heat have totally been sidelined as the effects of proper mitochondrial respiration. But people in the health world are so obsessed with mitochondria. But those two things are rarely ever talked about. Is that a little strange?

**CONTEXT:** You find it strange that carbon dioxide and heat generation, which are effects of mitochondrial respiration, are rarely discussed by people focused on mitochondria.

**RAY PEAT:** Very strange. That's part of what organizes my thinking, looking at the reason and the nature of the myths that people have created to support their way of life and their belief system, and mostly the giant corporations that run science and publication. The ignoring temperature in my newsletter, I talk about the basis that goes back to the idea that Raymond Pearl, a professor at Johns Hopkins, promoted that if you live fast and warm, you'll use up all your heartbeats and burn all your permitted calories and have to die young. And so he advocated being very lazy and staying cool to live a long time.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that Raymond Pearl advocated for living slowly and staying cool to live longer, and that this idea is a basis for the myths you discuss in your newsletter.

**RAY PEAT:** Was he just stupid or was he supported by industry? Like, is there a specific outcome for the rate of living theory?

**CONTEXT:** You're questioning the motivation behind Raymond Pearl's "rate of living" theory.

**RAY PEAT:** It, um, I, I think he had to be really pretty stupid. You put up a picture of a hummingbird right below his picture, and you can see the difference in vitality and mentality between the two organisms.

**CONTEXT:** You're contrasting Raymond Pearl's theory with the vitality of a hummingbird.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, his experiment was on seeds or something. It sounds, I mean, to me, a layman, it sounds really stupid. It just sounds really ridiculous. What his experiment was, once you get used to it, that's not at all unusual. For example, someone was just asking me about the telomere theory of aging and the idea that we have an inborn number of cell divisions, which really derive straight from Pearl's idea that we have only so many heartbeats or so many calories that we can produce in a lifespan. For Hayflick, it was so many cell divisions that were allotted. And the first group of his papers that I read was in 1970, and I had to show them around to my friends because I couldn't believe that anyone could really say such stupid things.

**CONTEXT:** You're connecting Raymond Pearl's "rate of living" theory to the telomere theory of aging and Hayflick's concept of limited cell divisions.

**RAY PEAT:** His whole career, if you see it in terms of, for example, one paper, he kept one group of cells frozen in liquid nitrogen, very cold for a year or two, and another he kept in the lab in the usual dish. And his conclusion was that being frozen at minus 70 degrees Celsius or whatever was cells don't age, for sure.

**CONTEXT:** You're describing a specific experiment by Raymond Pearl that you found to be flawed.

**RAY PEAT:** Your orientation was shaped before this by Albert St. Georgie, so you were kind of reading the good stuff, and that's why these ideas seem so ridiculous to you, like when you were confronted with them?

**CONTEXT:** You're asking if Albert St. Georgie's work influenced your perspective, making Pearl's ideas seem ridiculous.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, but I had started reading the encyclopedias of which even the little Funk and Wagnalls had very good objective articles in it. And then we got the 1950 Britannica, and some of its articles are still the best on the subject available. The newer 1960s editions have gone somewhat stupid compared to the classics from 1900 to the 1950s. The Britannica was a great source of orientation in science and culture.

**CONTEXT:** You're mentioning the Britannica as a source of scientific orientation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, Albert's interview was much later. Was there a counter, was Lamarck like the counter to this kind of rate of living theory? Or you're talking about the Britannica? Was there an idea that was suppressed in favor of the rate of living theory?

**CONTEXT:** You're asking if Lamarckian ideas or other suppressed theories served as a counterpoint to the rate of living theory.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it grew most directly out of August Weismann's wear-and-tear theory. The rate of living is just another version of Weismann's wear-and-tear. And the free radicals, Denham Harman's theory of free radical aging, damage to the mitochondria, it's just more wear-and-tear theory. Part of the essence of Weismann's ideology was to destroy Lamarck and actual Darwinism to support the essentially idealistic, anti-evolutionary position of the, what's the first genetist guy, the monk, Mendel, Gregor Mendel. His position was simply derived from Catholic doctrine that nothing essential changes. Genes are immortal, and so the apparent changes that you see that are mistaken for evolution are just mixing immortal genes. And for Weismann, the germline is immortal, and the body, the soma, is mortal. So Weismann was just rephrasing the Christian doctrine of Mendel. And so those were getting built into the authoritarian side of medical and biological cultures. Meanwhile, there was the actual science going along at ground level with people like Jacques Loeb and Alexis Carrel, Otto Warburg, and St. Georgie, and so on.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining how Weismann's wear-and-tear theory, which influenced the rate of living theory, was part of an ideology that suppressed Lamarckian and Darwinian ideas, aligning with Mendel's views derived from Catholic doctrine, and contrasting this with the work of scientists like Loeb, Carrel, Warburg, and St. Georgie.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, Warburg, obviously, and Frederick Koch. Frederick Koch inspired at least St. Georgie, and I don't think Warburg ever said anything about Koch, but his ideas were really kind of vitalistic or holistic, because he said the whole organism is the immune system. The vitality of the whole thing isn't separable. And that's what the mainline embryologists were seeing, that you can take part of an early embryo and isolate it, and it will produce a whole organism. So it's not an assemblage of parts. What you need is the important rectangle that does the job to separate it from the embryo. The ovum has an intention, and if you cut the dividing parts of the ovum into several pieces, each one can still fulfill its intention of becoming a whole organism. And that idea continued into field theories of all sorts in the 20s and 30s of people recognizing Warburg's work, for example, saw that if you look at an area that's developing a cancer, you can find at the center a perfect malignant bunch of cells, but surrounding that, the next training, a ring of cells will be pre-malignant, very degenerated, but not decisively cancerous and revertible if you change their embryological position or their place in the organism. And surrounding that is less and less inflamed cells. So in the 30s, there was lots of evidence showing that cancer is a field process under some degree of control of the surrounding organism. And in psychology, Gestalt psychology was extending that whole thing, thinking of the brain as similar to the organism, working in terms of holes and not wires, but digital, computable units, but as holes and images. That whole thing, the Second World War distracted from it, but there was a very deliberate killing off of it, with several, both government and industry trends, to sell the idea that we are mechanisms, and to totally knock out of the science history all of this holistic embryological field understanding of nature and the organism.

**CONTEXT:** You're identifying Otto Warburg and Frederick Koch as pro-metabolic figures in the 1930s, and discussing their vitalistic or holistic ideas, contrasting them with the mechanistic view that emerged later. You also mention the embryological concept of field processes in cancer development and the influence of Gestalt psychology.

**RAY PEAT:** I've gone through the arguments, it's been about 15 or 20 years, I think, but at that time there was accumulating very clear evidence that some very old, 90- or 100-year-old individuals had long telomeres, and some young people in their 20s and 30s had extremely short, worn-out looking telomeres. And I think the correlation of it strictly with aging has been a biased sampling to fit the ideology.

**CONTEXT:** You're discussing your observations regarding telomere length and its correlation with aging, suggesting that the correlation might be based on biased sampling to fit an ideology.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's some kind of growing up, family personality development that happens.

**CONTEXT:** You're commenting on the development of certain viewpoints, possibly in relation to Richard Dawkins' ideas.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, they identify with the interests of the royalty and ruling classes. The ideology is a classical, ancient doctrine that the divine right of kings is something built into the universe. And, for example, meritocracy derives from the idea of an unchanging, unevolving social order. And naturally, you can't have monkeys turning into people if you're going to have divine kings, everything arranged in a heavenly order, a great chain of being, from angels to kings, all the way down to ordinary people and monkeys near the bottom. It's so deeply into our culture. Most professors don't want to acknowledge that that's where our history has come from.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining how certain ideologies, like meritocracy, are rooted in ancient doctrines of divine right and a hierarchical social order.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, absolutely. He was as high in the ruling class as you can be in England without being royal, and so he grew up with that perfect concrete view of logic and mentality. I just wanted to show that our defined mentality and clear logic is identical with mathematics. And then in middle age, he actually started thinking about it and said, well, we really don't know whether Leibniz might have been right that everything is defined partly by where it is and what it's with. And if everything is part of one's being is where one is, then everything is constantly changing its essence. And so how can you have language and a perfect mathematical language if reality is actually context-sensitive? If it makes a difference to the earth that the moon and the sun and Saturn and Mars are moving around in space, could it affect the essence of the earth that other things are related to it in space and time? And Russell just had that simple insight: how can you define things in isolation? Where do we have the evidence that there are timeless entities which atoms are believed to be? And at first, he was calling the units of his thinking logical atoms, but as he thought more about the Leibnizian possibilities of metaphysics and ontology, he realized that there is no evidence basis for having these abstract atomic views of logic. So, simply his ability, being very intelligent, he was able to learn and actually think his way out of it.

**CONTEXT:** You're discussing Bertrand Russell's intellectual journey, his initial focus on logical atoms, and his later realization about the context-sensitive nature of reality, influenced by Leibniz.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, pretty much. He didn't talk about it because there was no place to talk effectively. I think the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein also had a big impression on him because he was one of his students. And Wittgenstein then asked Bertrand Russell to write the foreword to his magnum opus, Tractatus, Logical Philosophical, as it was called. And Bertrand Russell wrote it, and Wittgenstein absolutely hated it and said, "You think like a computer. This is not what this book is all about." And he had a falling out. And I think that's one of the things that Russell was devastated because he thought Wittgenstein was brilliant. And if this brilliant mind thinks that I'm dumb as a bag of rocks, and I just don't get what logic and philosophy and life are about, that I must change my...

**CONTEXT:** You're describing the falling out between Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, and its impact on Russell's thinking.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. He said that that was the event that made him turn to politics and social moral philosophy. He realized he wasn't smart enough, but he actually was intelligent enough to change his mind.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining how Wittgenstein's critique influenced Bertrand Russell to shift his focus to politics and social philosophy.

**RAY PEAT:** You just cannot get funding. If you try to convince a funding body to give you money for vitamin B1 or acetazolamide, I'm pretty sure they will laugh you out of the room. What was different back then? I mean, it was still a fairly authoritarian time, wasn't it?

**CONTEXT:** You're questioning why funding for certain medical treatments, like those involving vitamin B1 or acetazolamide, is no longer available, despite their historical success.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and before that, some psychiatrists put some patients in the house with continuously elevated carbon dioxide, and all of their psychopathic conditions improved. And what that elevated CO2 does is to increase your metabolic rate and body temperature. So there have been lots of workable therapies that no one sells. Those things can't make a trillion dollars selling thiamine or carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining how elevated carbon dioxide levels were used to treat psychiatric conditions by increasing metabolic rate and body temperature, and why these therapies are not commercially viable.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. It's a continuing process. They're trying to finish it off now. They're trying to even get the nuisance students and professors out of the universities and turn it over to a few, one or two corporations who will prepare the courses and sell the licenses to the students.

**CONTEXT:** You're describing the trend of corporations taking over educational institutions and controlling course content.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, experiments have mostly been a nuisance to the business of science. You know, the journals just won't publish things that are anomalous-seeming observations. You know, the fate of Halton Arp and his pictures of galaxies, they wouldn't let him use their telescope anymore because he saw things he shouldn't have.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining how scientific journals often reject anomalous observations, citing the example of Halton Arp.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I have a few friends that have chemical degrees, graduate degrees in chemistry, and little by little, chemistry seems to move entirely towards the so-called in silico modeling. Basically, they're just using computer models to design new molecules and predict the effects of those molecules in organisms. So I'm guessing that has some sort of validity, but it seems that chemistry is moving towards trying to replace almost entirely the process of experimentation with modeling in a computer.

**CONTEXT:** You're observing a shift in chemistry towards in silico modeling, replacing traditional experimentation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it will rarely cause embarrassment for anyone. The computers aren't going to invent anything shockingly unexpected, but experiments actually are constantly doing that.

**CONTEXT:** You're contrasting the predictability of computer models with the unexpected discoveries that can arise from experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** The ability to detoxify the free radicals increases when your metabolic rate is higher. Slowing your metabolic rate, you shift towards the reductive antioxidative state and you grossly slow down your ability to inactivate the free radicals that are produced.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining how a higher metabolic rate enhances the ability to detoxify free radicals.

**RAY PEAT:** You can avoid the main things that kill old people, and you can extend life span up to 90 or 100 or so. And that's what the genetic determinists emphasize. They say that the process is essentially mechanical, and it's all foreordained, whether by some Hayflick principle or the necessary accumulation of free radical damage. But the experiments that showed that the more saturated fat animals live at a higher temperature without damage and live much longer than animals of a similar weight with highly unsaturated membranes. So the hotter you are, the more you revise your fats away from unsaturation. If you just grow soybeans, for example, in a hot, humid climate or in a northern climate where they usually grow them, they'll have more saturated fats when they grow in the more humid and warm climate. And if you have a pig in the north eating the usual corn and beans diet, it's going to have very unsaturated fat in the layer under it, close to its skin, because the skin is constantly living at a lower temperature. But if you put a sweater on the pig so its skin doesn't get so chilled on the same diet, its subcutaneous fat will be much more saturated. So we adjust to keep the hot tissues from getting over-unsaturated, and the breakdown largely in the mitochondria of polyunsaturated fats turns down the oxidation, energy production, and lets only the random kind of oxidative damage occur.

**CONTEXT:** You're discussing how saturated fats are retained at higher temperatures, while unsaturated fats break down more easily, and how this relates to animal fat composition and temperature regulation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in general, the life-extending things do increase the uncoupling activity.

**CONTEXT:** You're confirming that life-extending practices generally increase uncoupling activity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. A Russian experimenter noticed that the temperature connection at both testicles and ovaries live considerably cooler than the core temperature of the body. And that's surprising in the case of ovaries because they're in the core of the body, but they have some kind of cooling system that keeps their temperature lower. And so he chopped up bits of ovaries and implanted them under the earskin of rabbits. Their long ears in the cool climate are several degrees cooler than the rest of the body. And he found that they went into constant estrus and they had the ovaries living at that very low temperature.

**CONTEXT:** You're describing a Russian experiment that observed cooler temperatures in testicles and ovaries, and how implanting ovaries under the earskin of rabbits led to constant estrus.

**RAY PEAT:** So they were overproducing estrogen basically?

**CONTEXT:** You're asking if the rabbits in the experiment were overproducing estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think I understand why it happens. The proper response to injury doesn't involve inflammation, and so I think those are being used in a way that they weren't intended by the organism to be used. I think the function in a healthy environment, in a complete, well-nourished environment with the right oxygen tension and so on, I think they function as regulators and don't really turn on that anti-biological kind of inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** You're expressing uncertainty about the adaptive function of chronic inflammation under constant exposure to low temperature, suggesting it might be a misuse of the body's intended regulatory mechanisms.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's part of why injured fetuses inside the womb don't heal by forming a scar, they heal perfectly, just like a fragment of an embryo can complete itself. The damaged part of the fetus can regenerate itself without forming a scar. I think that's because of the high temperature, steady temperature, and carbon dioxide and glucose meeting the needs so that those very same peptides and such that cause inflammation in the worst situation are constructive, reparative rather than causing the damage of inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining that fetal healing without scarring is likely due to high temperature, steady temperature, carbon dioxide, and glucose, which make inflammatory peptides reparative rather than damaging.

**RAY PEAT:** Locally produced, yeah. The amino oxidase, I think that's the enzyme in the lungs and a few other places that destroys serotonin. So, I guess the medical industry, when they say reactive oxygen species, from what I understand is they tend to accumulate or form when there's actually a blockage of metabolism. There was a recent study which showed that administering chemicals that block any of the electron transport chain complexes drastically increase the production of reactive oxygen species. So, it's low metabolism that causes ROS, not high.

**CONTEXT:** You're clarifying that locally produced reactive oxygen species can have positive functions, such as destroying serotonin, and that ROS accumulation is linked to blocked metabolism, not high metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** His books came out, I think, early 1970s, and I didn't connect him specifically. I had been thinking about it for years, but since I had a much above normal metabolic rate, I had to learn other things before I was willing to experiment with thyroid, because I was, for example, on a BMR machine where you breathe oxygen while lying at rest. The machine is set up so that you're supposed to, in the couple of minutes during the test, you're expected to breathe somewhere between a third and two-thirds of the can that contains the oxygen that you're measuring. And during the time of the test, before the test was over, I had used up the oxygen, so it was looked from the slope of the line like it was about three times the normal rate, and I was aware of that for just about nine or ten years before I finally convinced myself to try taking a thyroid, and when I did, within a few days, my rate of metabolism had come down to approximately normal.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining your personal experience with a high metabolic rate and your eventual decision to try thyroid medication after years of consideration.

**RAY PEAT:** No. Okay. Oh, yeah. When I lectured, someone asked why I wasn't fidgeting the way I always did before. And I slept much more easily without being fidgeting. Awakened by any little environmental noise, I was going into a deeper sleep. So those were very sudden changes that went with the metabolic rate.

**CONTEXT:** You're describing the immediate positive effects you experienced after taking thyroid medication, such as reduced fidgeting and improved sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, and if somebody has a very high rate of oxygen consumption but low rate of carbon dioxide production, that means they're running on the stress metabolism. They're getting rancid quickly.

**CONTEXT:** You're explaining that a high oxygen consumption rate with low carbon dioxide production indicates stress metabolism and rapid "rancidity."

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, okay, that's the basically adrenaline and cortisol driving their metabolic rate.

**CONTEXT:** You're identifying adrenaline and cortisol as the drivers of this stress-induced metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they've known that for a long time, that animals eat unsaturated fats in the fall when the nuts are ready, and their bodies become much more polyunsaturated, and then they go to sleep, or don't really go to sleep, they go into a torpor. That's the typical hibernator who gets very torpid and cold, they usually have to wake up two or three times from the torpor to go to sleep because they actually need a real sleep for brain maintenance and repair. And we don't go into hibernation, we just get a cold brain and get sick when we go into our pseudo hibernation phase.

**CONTEXT:** You're discussing how animals consume unsaturated fats in the fall, leading to increased polyunsaturation in their bodies before entering a state of torpor, and contrasting this with human "pseudo hibernation" during cold weather.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the deep sleep needs a good warm temperature, right up to 98 plus something to slip into the deep sleep.

**CONTEXT:** You're stating that deep sleep requires a warm body temperature.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, this is someone who's assuming that there is something sensible going on.

**CONTEXT:** You're commenting on the assumption that there is a sensible explanation for the observed phenomena.

**RAY PEAT:** If you pay close attention to the experts, especially the government-connected experts, I haven't seen anyone who is either both informed and honest. A lot of them, I think, are both ignorant and not caring about the honesty of it. Everything they talk about, like describing COVID as a new, uniquely bad disease. I've heard probably 15 or 20 people who are supposedly experts say that they named the various features, but everything they say is unique about it was an outstanding feature of influenza. And supposedly, they're respiratory experts, so how can they say that because something has exactly the same side effects that influenza had, that it's some uniquely new and bad condition? Everything you look at, they would be embarrassing themselves if they had the scent. Because this is so sloppy.

**CONTEXT:** You're expressing skepticism about the honesty and knowledge of government-connected experts, particularly regarding their descriptions of COVID-19 compared to influenza.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, this is someone who's assuming that there is something sensible going on.
