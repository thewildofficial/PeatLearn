**RAY PEAT:** "Well, have you seen the news of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? How many people started suddenly dying in Norway and in Israel? And basically the effectiveness that they claim is there now. Apparently it's not 12,000 people in Israel immediately got infected after getting vaccinated. And in one county of New York, which had been free of the so-called virus for a whole month, I think it was on the 22nd of December. Vaccination started in one nursing home. They vaccinated 198 old people and in, I think it was only about two weeks. I think it was on the 22nd of December, I think it was on the 22nd of December. 23 or 24 of those had died. That is a huge statistical indication that the nursing home people said, well, they had the local epidemic of the virus that happened to kill only the vaccinated people."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, with specific examples of adverse events being cited.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's the adjuvant and no one is talking about that. I think they falsely labeled it as a carrier for the RNA when those same things have been sold for years as adjuvants."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation delves into the potential dangers of vaccine adjuvants versus the mRNA component.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the RNA aspect of the vaccine is less dangerous than the polyethylene glycol lipid adjuvant? I would guess so. That's pretty wild. But for a long range possibility of having the RNA for making the spike protein, which creates inflammation, if we become permanent factories for inflammation proteins, that isn't a good thing."

**CONTEXT:** Further exploration of the potential long-term consequences of mRNA vaccines, focusing on inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Did you see the news about the Australian vaccine? I mean, it's already been terminated, but it contains a portion of the HIV virus and as soon as they started giving it to people, people started testing HIV positive, so they freaked out, they shut down the vaccine and said, don't worry, it's not causing HIV infection, but I thought maybe they're concerned that, okay, so you have only two choices, either the vaccine causes HIV, infection, or the tests that are detecting HIV positive people are useless, because what about all these other people that were detected HIV positive that didn't get the vaccine? So which one should we pick?"

**CONTEXT:** A discussion about a terminated Australian vaccine trial and its implications for HIV testing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I agree with Peter Duesberg, though, that there has never been any evidence that such a virus causes the AIDS condition."

**CONTEXT:** A reference to Peter Duesberg's views on the cause of AIDS.

**RAY PEAT:** "Uh huh. Yeah, what will activate a positive test might only take a stretch of two or three nucleotides to be indicating a similarity to the HIV virus. For the PCR test, if its sensitivity is cranked up all the way to the max, I think right now they're using 40 cycles or something like that for the coronavirus. If you crank it up even more, can you come up with basically a positive test for pretty much any virus? Because they're they're they're so similar. I mean there's a there's probably an overlap of at least 10% across all viruses, isn't there?"

**CONTEXT:** The conversation shifts to the sensitivity of PCR testing and potential for false positives due to viral similarities.

**RAY PEAT:** "Uh, yeah, I I think they ordered people to test all across the country using that many turns of the cycle, because they knew it would create supposed evidence of a big epidemic. But I'm sure that if they can get a large number of people vaccinated, then they're going to change the instruction, go back to actually measuring something rather than producing false positives for it and then use that to claim that the virus eliminated the epidemic."

**CONTEXT:** Speculation on the deliberate use of PCR cycles to create evidence of an epidemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, he had the good points, but sometimes he got terribly carried away and I think Q Anon Might need a psychological Did you when you first got with of that did you did you smell fraud Yeah, yeah or Lack of a sense of reality basic cultism and lack of critical thinking Some guy named Ward I forgot his name people are swallowing The strange things that he says two or three days later. They haven't happened and he comes up with a new Explanation and they keep swallowing it time after time as if their memory lasts only two days"

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's assessment of QAnon, highlighting a lack of critical thinking and potential for fraud.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so and uh the uh one strand of culture that is coming out in insane ways in the last several years of getting emails on the internet i've had only maybe half a dozen really insane sounding people but just in the last week i've had more letters like that than all 20 years of use the internet of people saying that numerology blaming numerology on the jesuits even though it originated in the old testament with in the beginning there was a word and the word was with god the uh tradition uh the jewish uh kabbalah uh in particular uh promoted and amplified this essentialist ideas idea that the uh hebrew god spoke hebrew and so uh every letter and word of hebrew is a quoted message from god and people like uh noam chomsky uh cited the kabbalah as a kid and that says that you can assert anything that numerology confirms and you don't need any real world evidence because uh the at least the hebrew word is with god and defines reality and chomsky used to bypass the people who wanted to explain language as a matter of the brain dealing with the world uh and he said no you don't need any evidence at all the way you get that scientific view of language is to treat the person and the brain as an absolute black box Don't try to look for any information coming from the people who use language and experience it constantly because the only thing that counts is this word-derived reality and so if you don't have words, you can't think. For example, he was saying that my dogs, and I think he called them canines. I don't understand what I'm saying because they have no words, they can't understand anything. But then he explained that he used the word canine because if he spoke the word dog, they would make the wrong conclusion that he wanted to do something with them. He demonstrated that they are thinking and would draw a mistaken conclusion if he suddenly started using the word dog, but then he denied that thought is possible without words and that since thought defines a mental being. Basically, humans are the only ones that count because they can, if they work, they can identify the numbers that define the essences of reality, a deep scientific heresy cutting out. Empiricism. That's what I see as the greatest danger happening now. Everyone is being discouraged. From looking for evidence and that forces you to rely on the experts and whoever is running the cult of the time."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the influence of Kabbalah and essentialism in philosophy, particularly in relation to Noam Chomsky's views on language and thought, and criticizes the rejection of empiricism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes. About 40 or 50 years ago, I wrote a little article that I haven't written yet. I've been able to find the impact of Kantianism or neo-Kantianism on our culture. Starting about 1900, it was one of the most evil but widespread influences. I told several people when I was in the US, that I was very much influenced by Kantianism and neo-Kantianism. I told several people when I was in the United States. I graduated school about my experience of criticizing neo-Kantianism and tending to get a B or C on the paper. But every time I found something good in neo-Kantianism, I always got an A on the paper. A couple of people tried that, people who had been going along supporting neo-Kantianism. Got such reactions when they found something wrong with it, that they were really annoyed with me."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat elaborates on the negative influence of Kantianism and neo-Kantianism on culture.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't think so. What is Kantianism? Sort of the ultimate denial of empiricism. Didn't even Kant, toward the end of his life, say that pure, rational, idealistic knowledge is impossible? We can never develop it and it always has to be modified? Yeah, but in practice, it's impossible. They always find a way to remain essentialist and rationalist."

**CONTEXT:** Further critique of Kantianism as a denial of empiricism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and... I think the degree of success... that the organism finds in keeping its basic purpose despite the slight deviations. That's what leads to delayed aging among other things. So the system that basically prevents the intentional intelligent action from humans by enslaving them in all these possible ways, that's one of the worst things you can do for the health of your organism or for its future because you block the realization of its potential."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat connects the suppression of intentional action to aging and the health of the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've experimented several times with using DHEA in oil on the sides of my eyebrows that have gradually gone through aging and disappearance and took about six months to create new dark normal hairs or changing the color of topical copper solution. The very next day I could see the colored hair beginning at the base. In the case of lost hairs it was a very slow process."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat shares personal experiments with DHEA and topical copper for hair regrowth.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the androgenic homosurides such as DHEA are involved in sickening maturation of the normal head hairs and armpit and crotch hairs. I think there's a difference between the hair type that the baby has and a balding person has. The baby has very low levels of androgens and very high levels of pregnenolone, at least based on the studies that I've seen, while the balding people tend to have high levels of estrogen and prolactin in the scalp. So both of these hormones prolactin and estrogen are known to thin and destroy the follicle and thin the hair, and they can actually... make a very thick head of hair turn into very thin mop of hair like that of a very old person. So I wouldn't...just because they look similar, the hormonal underpinnings of both types of hair I think are very different. At least that's what I've seen in the studies. And I think the reason the babies don't have all that thick black hair is, relatively speaking, the low levels of the androgens. But the thinning of the hair in balding adults is, from what I've seen, is mostly driven by prolactin and estrogen and cortisol."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the hormonal differences between infant hair and balding hair, attributing hair loss to prolactin, estrogen, and cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the whole. Menopause, a supposed estrogen failure, is a total fraud created by the industry to sell a product for which it didn't work. First they prescribed it to prevent miscarriage even after it had been demonstrated for several years to predictably cause miscarriage. Doctors at Harvard promoted the idea for the estrogen companies that supplementing estrogen would prevent premature delivery or miscarriage, and what they were doing was increasing the risk of miscarriage. The shift that happened in the first missed period involves the failure to form a corpus luteum, and estrogen stays at the same level, so at the transition, you're experiencing a sharp drop. Almost absolute disappearance of progesterone and the maintenance of estrogen. In rat studies, they actually bothered to measure what happens to the blood estrogen level when the ovaries are removed, and the few people who bothered testing it. Found that within a week, the body, which is normal recovery from surgery period, they found that the rats were right back to their normal estrogen level, but without progesterone. My dissertation was basically based on the fact that... sterility in the middle of the life span is caused by an unopposed estrogen. But the sales system of the drug companies has kept this misquoing. There's a lack of estrogen at the menopause."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat critiques the medical industry's narrative on menopause and estrogen therapy, highlighting its potential for harm.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I don't know of any studies that compare it to the receptor effect, but it's the whole thing. It's a good sign of deficiency of vitamin D as you become deficient in the 25-hydroxycholesterole. You begin to produce both the receptor and the so-called active vitamin D 1,25-dihydroxycholesterole. People get very confused and fail to work out the ramifications of the so-called active vitamin D and receptor as being associated with a lot of toxic harmful effects that are reduced by adequate calcium and the not active form of vitamin D. It's active, but it isn't what they call active."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses vitamin D, its metabolites, and the potential for confusion regarding its "active" forms and their effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I can't think of the references right now but i've i've seen good evidence of opposition of of good vitamin D and calcium to uh the effects of estrogen"

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms evidence of vitamin D and calcium opposing estrogen's effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, excitation of the cell generally turns it on stress, tendency to be on the test pathway. That is part of the aging process and it gradually increases the amount of estrogen coming out of your arms and legs and fat and other parts. But a deficiency of dietary calcium also increases aromatase because it increases PTH, right? Right, it's like a deficiency of the good vitamin D, calcium deficiency, it increases stress and activates the whole system, and endotensin, aldosterone, paracyrate hormone, and estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how cellular excitation, stress, and deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D can increase estrogen production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Great care with what you eat is part of it. Anything that irritates your bowel is a risk. Finding the diet balance, sometimes you have to be fairly extreme to start improving the whole situation. Sometimes going to a strange different form of fiber in your diet can help. Each one might not be right for a certain person, but usually by trying out different ones you can find a dietary fiber that reduces inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat offers dietary advice for reducing endotoxin symptoms and improving gut health, emphasizing careful food selection and fiber.

**RAY PEAT:** "It does seem logical, but it's something I would......prefer to leave to rad experiments because of the fact that any kind of unmetabolizable particle, if it gets preserved, basically, it kills off part of your whole system by blocking the smallest arteries."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses caution regarding the use of charcoal due to potential risks of blocking small arteries.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, biosporin can be very powerful because it's producing a broad spectrum antibiotic. The bacteria in it are producers of antibiotics. And then there's an over-the-counter product called, I think it's called Megaspore Biotic. It's kind of expensive, but it does contain, I think the B subtilis and the B licheniformis that the biosporin has."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the potential benefits of biosporin and Megaspore Biotic as broad-spectrum antibiotics.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's effective against both fungus and bacteria. But you have to make sure that you are in full order to it."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms the antifungal and antibacterial properties of coconut oil, with a caveat about proper usage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. And it's totally not scientific to label a cause of death as COVID-19. A lot of people don't bother checking the temperature of your mouth, eardrum, and extremities. Old people in particular, their brain might be at a good temperature, oral 98.6, eardrum 99.5 for example, but they're producing less energy and that shows up as an extreme gradient. From the extremities to the brain area, keeping that in mind, paying attention to the outside temperature, that can have a profound effect. The indoor temperature might be 70 degrees and seem perfectly safe. But even through ordinary insulated walls, the outside temperature can profoundly drain your body's energy-producing ability and create that gradient effect. That means that your system is......experiencing stress everywhere, even though the brain is maintaining its own temperature. It's also perceiving that the bulk of your body is being de-energized. That's because such a large percentage of our biological......energy goes out as radiation. Something like three quarters of the energy we produce goes out as microwaves and infrared, and so if it isn't reciprocated by returning radiation from something approaching body temperature, having an outside temperature of two degrees, our cooling energy goes out as well. 45 degrees, for example, your body is draining vastly more energy than it would be in the summer with 80 degree weather."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how low temperatures and energy deficits can lead to death, emphasizing the importance of body temperature and radiation in energy balance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think the whole body exposure to all of the good light is much better than just on the thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that whole-body light exposure is more beneficial than localized thyroid exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think the earth is basically Doing the best things that can Melting Tundra ice is releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide and If the earth is expanding as some of the measurements over the last half century has suggested an expanding earth would be Deluting the atmosphere Resembling high altitude even at lower altitudes so an expanding earth could Improve our atmosphere as well as the Releasing more actual co2 into the air"

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the Earth's natural processes, including melting tundra and potential earth expansion, and their impact on atmospheric CO2.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the brain metabolism, oxidative metabolism, increases with higher CO2. And that greater consumption of electrons, I think, is tending to keep the brain in a positive... productive, more conscious condition."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how increased CO2 can enhance brain metabolism and consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think there is a possibility, but I would give priorities to all kinds of government fraud over actual evidence of aliens. I imagine the fact that it's being released specifically now makes it that much more suspect."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses skepticism about UFOs, prioritizing government deception as a more likely explanation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it is strictly a cliche. I think it's a dose-dependent effect. Currently MDMA is in clinical trials for post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers, and they found out that really at very low doses where you almost don't even get the psychotropic effect, it has a powerful antidepressant and anti-trauma effect. The animal studies that were accompanying the human ones show that this is tied to a large release of dopamine and a drop of cortisol."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the therapeutic potential of MDMA at low doses, linking it to dopamine release and cortisol reduction.

**RAY PEAT:** "I was very impressed by Joseph Needham's uh, uh, books. Uh, and, uh, Chinese. Survey and summary of a Chinese philosophy. Uh, and. Uh, other sources I found very interesting. Uh, and, in how the acupuncture can work, for example. I don't agree with any of the Western theories of what acupuncture is doing. I think the Korean theory there activates the movement of exosomes to restore tissues is, so far, the best theory."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat shares his interest in Chinese medicine and his preferred theory for acupuncture's mechanism of action.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, things like carbon dioxide. Adequate oxidation of glucose, these things should give you 24-hour-a-day euphoria. Anything that interferes with this highly efficient energy production is amplifying damage, leading to permanent damage from inflammation. You weren't metabolizing, right? That life feels good, feeling your breathing, feeling your heart beat, and feeling the blood circulate through your tissues, all of that is background, all of it feels good and so it gives a general tone to everything you're thinking and doing. It makes them feel good too."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that proper metabolism, including glucose oxidation and CO2, should lead to sustained euphoria and a positive overall feeling.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the... the common condition, you know, doctors have been taking... thinking of euphoria as something dangerous. If thyroid leads to euphoria, they'll tell you to stop taking it. Because they think of those good feelings as not quite compatible with life. And the whole business of living is this background of feeling your blood circulate and energy being produced. And if you ask a person to pay attention to their heart beating, they often get nervous. And first reaction when a person takes a… an exactly right dose of thyroid, one typical response was thyroid is love, a feeling that radiates out of the chest, all of the good feeling nuclei throughout the body. All of these are intensified by thyroid, and your heart is one of the major emotion sensors. If you're low in thyroid, then those same areas of your body that should be sensing the pleasure of living are reporting anxiety. People feel anxiety around their heart and chest, but the right response to it, getting the right dose, the experience of love is probably the best description to what the euphoria of metabolism is doing."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat criticizes the medical establishment's view of euphoria as dangerous and highlights how thyroid hormone can promote feelings of love and well-being through improved metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "When the weather is so cold, I sometimes have to sit at the computer with my legs in a big plastic bag. Plumped up with carbon dioxide, and it helps to increase warmness."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat shares a practical application of carbon dioxide for maintaining warmth in cold weather.
