**RAY PEAT:** It's part of the... the general picture, how to understand biology usefully, and the reductionist breaking it up into parts. You can have an infinite amount of that kind of knowledge and never be able to do anything with it. But if you are... actually, under the principle of how the organism works, bacteria don't have any of our ordinary analytic abilities, but they have the intelligence and computational ability that lets them redesign themselves radically to meet a challenging environment. And Barbara McClintock showed that that same sort of redesigning your genome happens in plants and it should be obvious that if bacteria in plants can radically pick themselves up and change themselves to do better in the world, there's no reason why people should feel put there. Weighted down by the horrible ballast of genes and inherited from reptiles or whatever, and the factors of this simplifying picture are the physics of phase change, essentially what Gilbert Ling was talking about, but what was a major movement early in the 20th century for understanding the origin of life and what life is in its basis. A view that life is a substance rather than an accumulation of 20,000... independent pieces of DNA, that idea of life is a substance. A substance, it can change the phase in one direction of losing energy, or it can, with good luck, come back to a high energy state, because all of the parts are subordinate to the flow of energy. managed by the the whole organism itself.

**CONTEXT:** What was the motivation for writing your newsletter about cumulative damage, degeneration, and aging possibilities of reversal, particularly concerning heat shock proteins?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, the encyclopedias that I read as a kid, I reported those experiments, the regular mainline... encyclopedias, included the Lamarckist experiments. And when I was in graduate school, there were still people doing experiments of that sort. Previously they had done them with various sea organisms and plants, hybridizing plants by grafting. branches to them, causing a change in the whole organism. These experiments with fruit flies, since fruit flies were the main organism, the genetics dogma based itself on bacteria, single celled organisms, and then finally fruit flies. Two different kinds of experiments, one fed fruit flies a very high salt diet, and they adaptively changed their cuticle so that it wasn't irritated by the flow of salt in and out that their anal scales were toughened up, and putting others under a very hot. Artificial light caused the wing structure to thicken up and get thick veins. So these were strictly first generation adaptation to a stressful environment. Then they turned off the light and gave them a normal salt diet and crossbred them. And from then on, they could... have a Mendelian-like inheritance of these traits that they had never seen before in fruit flies. They sorted out generation after generation with the thickened scales and the thickened veins in their wings. And I asked several of my professors about that, and the standard action was those were hidden genes. They were there all along and once they expressed them, then they were able to continue expressing them. But that is the scientific method genetics is based on. If it happens, then it must have already been there in these immortal genes. Because nothing new happens. So it's better than a deus ex machina. It's saying that, well, we knew that already. You didn't do anything except we hadn't previously expressed that gene, but it's immortal and it's always been there.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Lamarckian-like experiments with fruit flies adapting to stress. Can you elaborate on how these adaptations were inherited and how this contrasts with the prevailing genetic dogma?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, yeah, it, it, I mentioned that it functions as a protein solvent and so if you lower your energy and don't have the ATP binding it and keeping the cell together, uh, some proteins have come out of the solution and go into a different phase. So these become stress-induced organelles, but they always depend on the situation, the type of stress. And so the way the protein comes out of solution when the cell is de-energized is shaped by the other factors acting on the organism. And the practical... The use of that idea is something that has been noticed ever since experiments by St. George that ATP has a softening, relaxing effect on isolated protein material from cells. And that's exactly the idea of keeping... everything together and in solution in the cytoplasm or the coacervator, the whole protoplasm. And in a fatigued muscle, for example, the muscle gets harder and harder. And when it's fully energized, the cytoplasm is flexible and soft, and it can in a moment contract. And do a maximum of work, like a fatigued heart gets harder and harder. But on stimulation, it's already tight and hardened, and so it can't do much more to become tighter. So the ATP functionally represents the flow of energy of carbon dioxide produced from... oxidizing glucose, for example. The energized, well-nourished cell is in a relaxed state and that has to do with insomnia, muscle cramps, all the biological functions, all the way down to cancer, for example. Cancers can be adequately diagnosed just by their hardness. Doctors have noticed that if the lymph node is hard to the touch, it's going to look cancerous on the inside if they cut it open, but the hardness involves first the inability to relax and then the stabilization of a fibrous. A form of actin, one of the mobility producing proteins of any sort of cell. And then the depleted energy turns on collagen synthesis and the actin, which is hardening the cell from the inside, attaches to this groin. A collagen produced surround and you get a system that is harder and harder the more energy depleted it is.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed ATP's role in maintaining cellular structure and function, relating it to the concept of phase transition. Can you explain how ATP's presence or absence affects cellular "hardness" and its implications for conditions like cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** The rigor mortis is the phase change and when you get... smaller degrees of that phase change then you get chronic things like intracellular bodies that produce anything from arthritis-like inflammation to dementia, formation of prions, proteins that are no longer soluble, becoming the... mad cowl or Alzheimer's agent.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned rigor mortis as a phase change. How does this relate to chronic conditions like arthritis or dementia, and the formation of prions?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, promoting cell division is one of the alternatives and you want to lose the complex energy. Consuming cell functions, thought and organization and secretion, all of the fancy specialized things cost energy, and to escape from whatever is causing the stress and the damage, turning off the differentiated functions and resorting to a simple. A cell division making new cells hoping that they will survive and overcome the environment so the hardening process is broken free of by activating the differentiating cancer producing property.

**CONTEXT:** When a cell is extremely stressed, does it prioritize cell division as a way to escape damage, and how does this relate to the hardening process you described?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's able to stop the energy loss. It turns off some of the deranged DNA repair mechanisms and can just let the cell die peacefully rather than draining tremendous amounts of energy. So it plugs the leak and that solubility thing. It has all degrees of visibility. About 1971 or 2, I was experimenting with things like bread dough. I was making bread at the time, and the relation of water retention to the bread dough is a big factor in the texture of the bread. And I was thinking of the bread dough as an analog for the cytoplasm and what happens when the cytoplasm is energized and relaxed or stressed and tensed up. And I tried different stimulants and sedatives and found that the free-water content is much more flexible. better. Barbiturate was one thing I tried. It made the dough slippery and wet because it was unable to hold the water in solution. And stimulants like caffeine, which also has a solubilizing effect on other substances, it made the dough bind water and retain more water. So it could be very humid, containing a lot of water, and still not be wet and slippery.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned niacinamide's ability to stop energy loss and turn off deranged DNA repair. How does this relate to its potential role in cellular solubility, and can you draw an analogy to your bread dough experiments?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it would probably depend on the starches present, one of the classical... examples for study and co-acervation was to make gelatin and gum arabic starchy molecule. And they handle water in different ways according to their proportion. And so, gelatin is bound to run into things like RNA and... polymer carbohydrates that will affect the water holding properties.

**CONTEXT:** Would gelatin have similar effects on increasing the solubility of intracellular proteins, considering its interaction with starches and water?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that should involve a constant flow. When the excess electrons are being drained away quickly enough, that is the living state. It should be constantly active with electrons. Flowing into the electron vacuum of oxygen.

**CONTEXT:** If an excess of unpaired electrons inhibits protein solubility, how would agents that accept these electrons, like quinones, affect protein solubility and cellular structure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, that's its molecular structure, the phenolic structure, that shifts the electrons. Away from oxidation and changes the whole water protein system so that while stopping oxygen energy production it activates the enzymes that govern glycolysis and lactic acid metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's phenolic structure contribute to its effects on heat shock proteins, protein solubility, and the shift towards glycolysis?

**RAY PEAT:** Its direct action is probably on proteins in general, not just a protein of progesterone receptor, but it is apparently effective on a great variety of proteins. including the cell division apparatus and motility and conductivity and so on. And it is one of the things that helps the cell retain water under control, but not having the wetting property where estrogen releases. Water from proteins makes them swell up with bulk inactive or glycolysis supporting water. Progesterone causes the water to be bound into a solution with the proteins and exclude the free bulk water.

**CONTEXT:** Is progesterone's inhibition of HSP formation a direct effect on proteins, or is it more about its opposition to estrogen's effects on water retention and protein solubility?

**RAY PEAT:** That's true that they will help us all survive partial cooking and so on. That's where the whole idea of... of them being strictly beneficial, that they do help survival of terrible conditions, like being poisoned by germs or cooked by excess heat or starved by energy depletion. But the drug companies are among the first to become aware that that process... de-energizing cells, turning them towards the lactic acid, cancer-like or stress-like metabolism, that the whole energy of the cell goes down. As the life of the cell is saved by the heat shock proteins, its energy tends to revert to that simple cancer metabolism that loses......the basic function of what the organism was trying to do, so the drug companies are producing chemicals that they hope will be non-toxic that will reverse the process, knock out the heat shock proteins and restore cells, bringing them back from the cancer or stress metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** Many people advocate for activating heat shock proteins through saunas to improve stress resistance. How do you view this approach, considering their role in survival under stress?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, in general. There's a line of aging that's like a ratchet that keeps you alive for the moment, but each time it is called on for that short-term survival, it reduces your flexibility, just like a scar. It plugs the hole, but it limits function. If you have... get your attention on the whole coacervate-like quality of your organism, getting rid of that high quantity of heat shock proteins at the same time that you're energizing the whole cell. And it happens that progesterone has many layers of functions blocking... and reverting away from the heat-shock state and activating the right kind of energy production, suppressing lactic acid metabolism, antagonizing estrogen, blocking collagen production. All of the levels happen to be touched on by progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that activating heat shock proteins can leave a "scar" that reduces flexibility. How does progesterone help revert from this heat-shock state and restore cellular function?

**RAY PEAT:** De-energizing the cell. Exactly. So I guess it's a bit of a misnomer to call them heat shock proteins. They're more like stress shock proteins or just shock proteins in general.

**CONTEXT:** Given that stress beyond heat can activate these proteins, would you agree they are more accurately termed "stress shock proteins"?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah. They block the disorganizing factors that come from. Everything that de-energizes the cell.

**CONTEXT:** What exactly do heat shock proteins block when they are activated by de-energizing factors?

**RAY PEAT:** Yep. If you pay attention during stress, you can learn to see the taste in your mouth and the odor of expired air through your nose, for example. You can tell when the energy supply is under stress and basically aging is happening when you… see these signs. For example, if you stay in a hot bath too long, you start getting weak and feeling stress. At an extreme, you can get a metallic taste in your mouth and a dry, odd odor in your exhaled breath, and you realize that if you have a pint of orange juice or so. You can stop those processes and get things working again.

**CONTEXT:** How can one recognize the signs of energy depletion and aging during stress, and what immediate interventions can help restore energy flow?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's just lipid peroxidation when the free fatty acids reach a certain point. Anything available as a catalyst will start lipid peroxidation. Since metals cause it, we associate that taste with metals, but you don't need the metal because it's the lipid peroxides you're tasting.

**CONTEXT:** What is the cause of the metallic taste in the mouth during stress, and is it related to actual metal presence or lipid peroxidation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are so many of these pathways towards death that the... each pathway gives you mental confirmation, but the fact is they're all happening at the same time because it isn't being run by a cascade of signals acting on receptors, it's the phase change is happening.

**CONTEXT:** You've linked estrogen, hyperventilation, and lactate to increased serotonin, which then increases parathyroid hormone and nitric oxide, potentially activating heat shock proteins. Is this a cascade of secondary messengers, or is it a more holistic phase change?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, it's part of normal adaptation for the cytoplasm to differentiate according to the challenge. When the de-energizing is extreme, you get things like the prions forms that can start a real degeneration, cancer and dementia and so on. But ordinarily, any little pressure can cause the quality of the coacervate to change accordingly and usefully, and that's what's happening. When bacteria do the reorganization of their genes, it isn't that they have a messenger service that has the address of the gene that they send in after having computed which gene they need to meet the environmental stress, but it's that the whole system is such that the... genetic resources are always in touch with the problem situation. And so the phase change occurs according to a schedule of real world probability. And those small perturbations are really... like the organisms, a holistic way of doing calculations.

**CONTEXT:** Is the formation of coacervates within a cell, especially under extreme de-energizing conditions, akin to a mini-cancer, or is it a normal adaptive process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the fatigued state is a degree of the inflamed state. And the... One of the deranged things related to the genetic causation doctrine is the idea of the cell surface membrane as being a barrier, but if you think of it being nothing but the end of the co-acerbate of the cell and the beginning of the extracellular world. The state of energy of the co-acerbate or the degree of water, protein, solubility of the cell as a whole, the barrier function on the microscopic level that Gilbert Ling talks about, it's a phase-governed. A selectivity, not a poor-governed. The idea that you can let in small, moderately water-free potassium ions to the energized cell and exclude the hydrated, bigger sodium ions, that's the idea that there's a barrier. That's the answer put forward. The drug companies have taken advantage of that and convinced researchers that to get certain drugs or big molecules in the cells, they need to buy a certain delivery or targeting molecule, like the vaccine, the current RNA vaccine has lipids that are actually functioning as inflammation-promoting adjuvants, but they're being advertised as delivery agents for the nucleic acid, as supposedly the strip of RNA is so big it can't get across the barrier membrane unless it's enclosed in these targeting specific lipids. When one group of researchers was genetically modifying cells, they would buy the targeting agent and put their stretch of a big DNA molecule into this targeting lipid and as a control for how successful. The genetic change was taking up the targeted DNA, they introduced bare naked stretches of the same DNA and they found they went into cells even easier than the targeted deep piece of DNA. The cells, ordinary cells, can. take up or dissolve DNA from the environment. So what you eat, a certain amount of the DNA is getting into your lymphatic and blood circulation and cells have the option of taking up whole genetic stretches of information if the cell judges it can be helpful. So the idea of the cell state, the inflammatory state, it's really the cell that is already stressed, de-energized and inflamed is an obvious target for a virus. The virus doesn't have to necessarily have clever attaching machinery and enzymes. It can just fall into a weakened cell just because the cell is relatively water-soluble.

**CONTEXT:** How does the concept of the cell membrane as a phase-governed selectivity, rather than a simple barrier, explain why naked DNA can enter cells more easily than targeted delivery systems, and how does this relate to viruses and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah. And in your newsletter, you say the drug companies are creating a variety of heat shock protein inhibitors, and you said that also before, but I imagine minocycline or the tetracyclines in general and progesterone, those are drugs that already exist that probably do that, right? Yeah. Medline Blue is also another extremely potent one specifically for heat shock protein 70.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned drug companies are developing heat shock protein inhibitors. Are existing drugs like minocycline, tetracyclines, or progesterone already acting as such inhibitors?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, there are different layers and probably most important to an organism with a big skeleton, but I think analogs of parathyroid hormone go way back in the different evolutionary levels. I don't remember. Where it starts, but I think it's something analogous is a very early part of the systems.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding lowering parathyroid hormone with milk, cheese, vitamin D, and K, do you see this as a newer aspect of metabolic regulation, or is it a more ancient system?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it is. Those are things you can look up. The phylogeny of hormones. A lot of people have seen how far back you can find a molecule.

**CONTEXT:** Is the renin-angiotensin system more ancient than the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, repeats with an S, newsletter at gmail.com, they can give you information. And then this... It's $28 for 12 issues over two years. And then the same situation for your books, so you can email that same address.

**CONTEXT:** How can people obtain your newsletter and books?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I've used it for 45 years or so myself after researching it in animals, but I finally got interested in how people could use it and so I experimented with what the safe and effective solvents were and that was how I came up with the... progesterone complex formula in the 1970s and I tried it out on all my friends and pets and such like a roommate's pet rabbit had a brain tumor and had reached a point as that it couldn't couldn't hop couldn't see standing up if it tried to hop so and when I was blind the vet had said it was beyond help couldn't couldn't even do its basic functions and so my friend said okay try try your progesterone and I rubbed the oily solution on the relatively bare skin inside both of its ears so it was really a huge dose because of the size of the ears and I tried setting it up and previously it had just fallen over this time it fell over and went into a deep sleep I came back two or three hours later and my friend thought I had killed the rabbit, it was so stretched out and relaxed, but when I approached it, it leaped to its feet like a new rabbit and the first thing it did was to hop straight ahead and came to a wall and stopped and... copiously urinated and apparently it was unloading some large amount of water that had been causing swelling and pressure and so on. And after that it could hop and do everything rabbits normally do, turn corners quickly and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Can you share your experience with progesterone, particularly the complex formula you developed, and its effects on a pet rabbit with a brain tumor?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it looks like a wet dish. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a picture from Hans Selye's textbook of endocrinology showing a rat that appeared dead but was actually just extremely relaxed. Does this relate to the rabbit's state after progesterone treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it hadn't killed you. It showed that each of the steroids has a range of properties, and aldosterone has its estrogen resembling and antiandrogenic properties, each one has a range, and it just turns out that progesterone will fill in for a deficiency. of aldosterone or cortisol or androgen, but it will also protect against an excess toxic dose of those same things because it has a weak mineralocorticoid effect that makes up for the absence of aldosterone as well as a toxic excess. The same thing, testosterone has progesterone-sustaining, pregnancy-sustaining effects if you give it to a pregnant animal, but it's not nearly as effective at that purpose as progesterone is, and estrogen is the thing that it's strictly. It will have some of the anti-inflammatory properties of cortisol, as well as being a major protector against excess cortisol poisoning. And it does a lot of those things on the enzyme level, as well as the so-called receptor level. And you look at a list of it. Actions, coordinated effects on both receptors of all sorts and enzyme activation changes. You would think it was a magical invention. It's so extremely complex but organized.

**CONTEXT:** Why would progesterone be able to compensate for adrenal gland deficiencies when pregnenolone wouldn't, and how do steroids like aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens have overlapping properties?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's true of both pregnenolone and progesterone. I don't think of either of them as a hormone. The FDA, at least for 50 years, classified the pregnenolone as a hormone. Pregnenolone is a non-hormonal steroid. I include progesterone in that category, non-hormonal, because when you look at everything it's doing, it's stabilizing the energy and structural systems. Pregnenolone is so different from... hormonal excitation and activation just doesn't fit the word.

**CONTEXT:** Would you classify pregnenolone and progesterone as non-hormonal steroids, given their primary role in stabilizing energy and structural systems?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's true of both pregnenolone and progesterone. I don't think of either of them as a hormone. The FDA, at least for 50 years, classified the pregnenolone as a hormone. Pregnenolone is a non-hormonal steroid. I include progesterone in that category, non-hormonal, because when you look at everything it's doing, it's stabilizing the energy and structural systems. Pregnenolone is so different from... hormonal excitation and activation just doesn't fit the word.

**CONTEXT:** You've described pregnenolone and progesterone as non-hormonal steroids. How does their function differ from what is typically considered hormonal excitation and activation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a large amount of vitamin E taken orally. If you have a sensitive gallbladder or something, that sticky oil creates nausea, gaining all kinds of digestive reactions. But if you mix it with butter, for example, and take it with a... baked potato or some food you don't even notice it.

**CONTEXT:** If someone has a sensitive stomach and wants to take progesterone orally, are there ways to mitigate potential digestive issues, such as mixing it with vitamin E and butter?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything you do practically changes a million things about the organism. And... The known effects if someone is dying of cancer, obviously you don't worry about what it's going to do to their sex life in five years. they're really never gonna be the same again.

**CONTEXT:** When considering hormones like testosterone or DHT, you've cautioned against altering them without a specific deficiency. How do you view the practical implications of these hormones on the overall system, especially in severe cases like cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** If you see the problem as energy depletion, and inflammation. That sort of change, then you will take into account thyroid, carbon dioxide, glucose, the balance of amino acids in your proteins, cutting proteins that contain mycyanine, cysteine and tryptophan, supplementing instead some gelatin, all of the... anti-inflammatory things, and aspirin, coffee or caffeine, and progesterone are very effective stabilizing, energy restoring, anti-inflammatory things that help all of those. But I think it's important to think of those as a deviation from the... proper functions of the organism and look to restoring the energized, unenflamed, but purposeful processes of the organism. And a lot of that is getting your attention away from the medicalization that people can get so... interested in that particular problem, the phenosteroid syndrome or post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, that they forget what it is they're doing in their life. And if they can get the sense of excitement and play as a governing... principle of their activities and start imagining the constructive anti-inflammatory energy restoring things rather than trying to work out the thousands of details of what particular substance would be most effective.

**CONTEXT:** When addressing issues like gynecomastia, where do testosterone and DHT fit into a broader strategy of addressing energy depletion and inflammation, alongside thyroid, vitamin D, and bowel disinfectants?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, but in conjunction with... adequate sugar and the right protein and mixed nutrition and feeling out the effects of what the aspirin is doing. Because those hormonal effects are leaving the estrogen excitatory process in your brain, for example, to dominate and that tends to... create an obsessive process in the brain where the others, when you lose interest in your particular health problem, you're probably on the right track.

**CONTEXT:** You suggest exploring aspirin and other anti-inflammatory therapies before considering testosterone or DHT. How does adequate sugar and proper nutrition play a role in conjunction with these therapies, and how does this affect brain function?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, definitely. There are clinics going up around the country selling testosterone treatments, and the doses they give are ridiculous. 50 or 100 milligrams at a time, for example, where a healthy young male makes maybe four or five milligrams a day, and maybe 10 or 15 milligrams of DHEA per day. If you take, for example, one milligram of DHT and back it up with... a few milligrams of DHEA and progesterone, aspirin, coffee, steady supply of sugar and related nutrients, then the DHT is more likely to have a constructive repairing role.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding testosterone treatments, what are the typical dosages prescribed, and how would a more targeted approach using DHT, DHEA, progesterone, aspirin, and coffee be more constructive?

**RAY PEAT:** In my experience, nothing terminates a severe stress reaction for me like a few milligrams of DHT, but... my experience is that it's not something that can be used on an ongoing basis without interruption. It's more like the emergency fix when you're really in trouble and you don't feel like taking three grams of aspirin or you don't have them with you. DHT works in minutes like a charm. But Ray, I definitely don't want to mischaracterize. You're saying there's a hundred other things to check before doing that, right?

**CONTEXT:** You've found DHT to be effective in neutralizing severe stress reactions. Is this an emergency fix, and are there other foundational issues that need to be addressed first?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, yeah, just because it... makes you feel so good that you're going to get stuck on that if you don't fix the whole energy system that started the whole process.

**CONTEXT:** If DHT makes you feel so good, what are the risks of becoming reliant on it without addressing the underlying energy system issues?

**RAY PEAT:** I have taken as much as a gram, uh, but, uh, uh, you have to, um, be familiar with it. Uh, uh, I think usually, uh, 300 to 500 milligrams at a time, uh, with food, uh, is. Uh, uh, safe and comfortable. Uh, and you can repeat that amount, uh, usually very safely.

**CONTEXT:** What is a safe and comfortable single dose of aspirin, and how frequently can it be repeated?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, either it's turned into something very different or just vaporizes and then a lot of people and again, I know you've talked about this already, but the water doesn't contain the agarotene after a few hours. No.

**CONTEXT:** When cooking mushrooms for extended periods, does the agaritine vaporize or transform into something else, and is it removed from the cooking water?

**RAY PEAT:** No, no, I haven't.

**CONTEXT:** Have you seen any studies suggesting that agaritine has estrogenic effects, aside from its classification as a carcinogen?

**RAY PEAT:** A fungus is a nucleated cell that works so much like a human cell that the poisons they have for treating them happen to knock out our own mitochondria because they're generally intended to knock out the fungus mitochondrion energy system. People who are convinced they have systemic fungal infection will take those toxic drugs for a long time and get worse and worse and think it's the fungus that's responsible and it's really the drug knocking out their mitochondria. And bacterial infections, if they reach your bloodstream. They can quickly become deadly and a good strong dose of antibiotics gets into your bloodstream and will take care of systemic bacterial infection. But once a fungus actually gets into your bloodstream, I think a person might have something like a week to live. Because there are no really effective, safe drugs once you have an actual systemic fungal infection. It can linger in your lungs, but not getting into your bloodstream. So it can damage the lungs over a period of years. But if it was actually a systemic infection, like many people are told that Candida does, but that's all just......selling treatment that goes on forever.

**CONTEXT:** How can one distinguish between a fungal and bacterial infection, considering the toxicity of antifungal drugs to human mitochondria and the rapid progression of systemic fungal infections?

**RAY PEAT:** Extreme sickness. It grows so fast because it has everything it needs in the blood and there's... no no good immune defense once it gets in the bloodstream. People with a very weak immune system can live for years with it thriving in their small intestine and even stomach. So that yeast can grow high enough up that you can make alcohol when you eat carbohydrate because the yeast will ferment it right in your stomach and small intestine, but that isn't reaching the bloodstream.

**CONTEXT:** What are the signs and symptoms of a developing systemic fungal infection, and how does its rapid growth in the bloodstream differ from intestinal candidiasis?

**RAY PEAT:** One thing is not to starve the yeast, because if you know what happens if you've baked bread, when the yeast runs out of sugar from breaking down starch, it starts attacking the proteins and you get a very stinky batch of dough. Yeah. And that same thing happens. The yeast that's starved for sugar changes radically and becomes very invasive and toxic and destructive. So not taking the very popular no sugar diet approach. Thyroid to improve the......acid production and enzyme production and peristalsis stimulated by fiber in the diet will increase the resistance to the growth of the fungus and should eventually, over a period of several days, clean out and disinfect your small intestine.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding intestinal fungal infections, why is a no-sugar diet potentially counterproductive, and what role do thyroid, fiber, and digestive enzymes play in combating fungal overgrowth?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the oils, coconut or olive oil, are both bacteria killing and fungicidal. Some people have used olive oil doses for age pylori in their stomach, for example, but it also helps to... suppress it in the small intestine. That's the idea of having a little bit of it with shredded carrot. The carrot itself has some anti-fungal ingredients and combined with a touch of vinegar and olive oil, it's disinfecting your intestine while stimulating it.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of coconut oil and olive oil in combating intestinal fungi and bacteria, and how do they work in conjunction with ingredients like carrot and vinegar?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the saturated fatty acids are fairly germicidal. I just forgot what I was going to say. I was going to ask you about the olive oil but would you prefer that over coconut oil? Uh for kind of a disinfectant effect, right? I think I would. And so even with the daily keeping the PUFA as low as possible it would be worth it to find a high very pure olive oil to use every day maybe on the mushrooms or the carrot. Yeah and it tastes the best too. The FDA or Department of Agriculture years ago did a survey and found I think it was 70 percent of the olive oil sold in the U.S. was fraudulent, contaminated with canola or some other oil.

**CONTEXT:** Between coconut oil and olive oil, which do you prefer for their germicidal effects, and what are the implications of olive oil fraud for its purity and efficacy?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, once it gets into your tissues, like the lungs or the skin or toenails, it's very hard to get rid of because it's so closely, structurally and functionally, similar to human cells.

**CONTEXT:** Is a fungal infection that has entered the tissues, like the lungs or skin, significantly harder to eradicate than a bacterial infection, and why?

**RAY PEAT:** All of those have been tried and proven effective for like two or three weeks, not just taking it for a few days. Yeah, just to be sure.

**CONTEXT:** When treating H. pylori, what is the recommended duration for antibiotics like tetracycline, macrolides, or penicillin to ensure effectiveness?

**RAY PEAT:** If you are watching the symptoms of the infection, the first dose you take, like 250 milligrams of penicillin, you might not feel anything. Take another dose four hours later, and at some point, a second or third dose, you usually feel a sudden subsiding of the symptoms, and with the third or fourth dose, the symptoms of the infection are often gone, but I think it's a good idea to taper off, take them... maybe at eight hours intervals for the next day or so. Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead. Just making sure that the symptoms are noticeably subsiding and then disappearing and that they don't come back. But like chronic gas or diarrhea or things like that, that would be more of a serious type of... a person could guess they probably had something worse than just a... mild endotoxin problem or something like that?

**CONTEXT:** When taking antibiotics like penicillin for an infection, how can one gauge the effectiveness of the dosage, and what are the signs that indicate a more serious underlying issue beyond a mild endotoxin problem?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if it's a fungus producing gas, the penicillin isn't going to do much. And flowers of sulfur and fibers and thyroid are the way to get your digestive system active. The flowers of sulfur are turned by fungus. They have actual enzymes that... act to reduce the sulfane form of the sulfur, producing hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to them. So they produce their own toxic form of sulfur, but it's local, and you might... for a few hours, you might smell like hydrogen sulfide if you have a lot of fungus, but... that's what's killing the fungus, and so it's a very safe way to get rid of intestinal fungus.

**CONTEXT:** If chronic gas is caused by a fungus, how do flowers of sulfur, fiber, and thyroid help, and what is the mechanism by which flowers of sulfur combat fungal infections?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a few studies found. That it the infection could linger and that there would be spores that if you stopped it after four or five days whenever the symptoms were gone, the spores could germinate after 10 days or so. And so what they're doing is, is killing the second infection. with the first prescription. They're just taking account of the possibilities of the spore being a return of the infection.

**CONTEXT:** Is there evidence to support the common medical recommendation of taking antibiotics for two weeks, or is it purely ideological, and how does it relate to the concept of lingering spores?

**RAY PEAT:** On a population basis, that happens. That's where the resistant bacteria come from. Hospitals do it so consistently they breed their own toxic resistant strain, but one person. It just doesn't happen.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding antibiotic resistance, how does it develop on a population level, and is it accurate to say that individual use of antibiotics doesn't lead to resistance in the same way?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that famously happens with the heavy two week program that's so commonly prescribed. Really sterilize your intestine, but without paying attention to your hormones that govern the digestive enzymes, a sterile intestine, which isn't digesting properly, is a good place for fungus to take root. So you want to make sure if you really sterilize your intestine. That you're taking into account the things that will restore secretion of stomach acid, pancreatic enzymes, and mucus production, everything that takes energy to produce.

**CONTEXT:** Does the common practice of long-term antibiotic use, which sterilizes the intestine, create an environment conducive to fungal overgrowth, especially if hormonal support for digestive enzymes is lacking?

**RAY PEAT:** If they're going to take such a gigantic dose as doctors usually prescribe.

**CONTEXT:** If a person is taking antibiotics, would it be beneficial to also take flowers of sulfur to prevent potential fungal overgrowth?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's even used in... in trees and such for fungal infections. And at the same time, it's anti-inflammatory and inflammation predisposes to all kinds of infection. And so the tetracyclines, I think their major effect might be the anti-inflammation. The medical world... reacted to the suggestion that azithromycin was part of the proper treatment for the COVID virus, but because they saw it as a bacteria killer, not a virus killer. But its anti-inflammatory effect is very powerful at knocking out the symptoms. of the virus infection and by knocking out the symptoms of inflammation that in itself creates a resistance to the virus getting into your cells.

**CONTEXT:** Considering that tetracyclines are quinones with antifungal properties, do you believe their primary benefit in infections like COVID-19 is their anti-inflammatory effect rather than their antibacterial action?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, any reaction that you have, you should stop taking that one.

**CONTEXT:** If a person experiences a negative reaction to tetracycline antibiotics, what is the recommended course of action?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know. What causes it exactly, but I've had bad reactions to different antibiotics that could have just been a batch effect or could be a peculiarity of my system. I don't know of any studies that explain why people have those bad reactions.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that minocycline might inhibit the thyroid. Can you elaborate on the potential mechanisms or reasons why some individuals experience adverse reactions to it, even when it's used for its anti-inflammatory properties?

**RAY PEAT:** Adrenaline and cortisol, when those are lowered by getting rid of the inflammation, then you feel a letdown and realize you're compensating for something like hypothyroidism by running high on adrenaline and cortisol.

**CONTEXT:** When minocycline reduces inflammation, and consequently lowers stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, could this lead to a feeling of being hypothyroid if those hormones were previously compensating for an underlying issue?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. All sorts of things. The last 40... years have tremendously increased in the environment. The use of polyunsaturated fats is one anti-energy exposure. The use of nanoparticles in foods and clothing, for example, and skin preparations are another major change tending to promote inflammation. And then vaccinations are intended, the aluminum or lipid adjuvant is put in there to create systemic inflammation and experimentally you can create allergies in an animal by exposing them in that way and injecting antigens into the muscle. It is completely irrational as far as our immune functioning works, but it reaches that the nerves transport the inflammation producing substance to the brain and the brain activates a system-wide inflammatory state which, among other things, increases production of... antibodies, but at the same time it's depleting your general resistance, and the vaccine increase corresponds very closely to the rise of allergies and inflammatory diseases like autoimmune. But I think it's also behind this... accumulation Kawasaki disease being very rare and things being added to a systemic inflammatory syndrome, which is reaching its peak now.

**CONTEXT:** You've identified several environmental factors contributing to population frailty, particularly in the last 40 years. Can you elaborate on the role of polyunsaturated fats, nanoparticles, and vaccine adjuvants in promoting inflammation and systemic issues?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Do these environmental factors also contribute to the activation of heat shock proteins?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it would probably be best to start with... everything people can do that is not guided by that death culture. Just looking at the practical outcome of what you're doing. And gradually, if you can shift your attention to the practical moment, then... the ideal thing would be to shift your attention to improving not just the practice of things, but our understanding that makes practical living and problem-solving possible. Overcoming death and death's variations by discovering... the cause of death and its variations, and developing curiosity as well as practicality. And the curiosity is, I think, the pro-life essence of living behavior, including animals and bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** If a society has a "death culture" embedded in its holy book, how can a functioning society be formed or maintained by focusing on practical, life-affirming actions and understanding?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, that has been a historical trend to treat those ideas as metaphors and not follow rules slavishly. And then those... cutting out people's eyes or cutting off their hands as punishment. Some of the literal things advocated in holy books are now recognized as barbarians, even though some countries still apply something.

**CONTEXT:** If a society is healthy, do you think individuals are more likely to interpret religious texts metaphorically rather than literally, and how does this contrast with historical punishments for literal interpretations?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, people who want to survive and improve their lives can just go on about their business.

**CONTEXT:** If a functioning, healthy society is resistant to fanatical factions, can individuals simply continue their business and focus on survival and improvement?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can find, like Wilhelm Reich in his book, The Murder of Christ, made great use of. One of the books of the New Testament to connect his thinking with what's in the Christian Bible. It was a very convincing use of those old ideas in a life-affirming way.

**CONTEXT:** Can a holistic view of science serve as a foundation for a functional society, similar to how Wilhelm Reich used the New Testament in a life-affirming way?

**RAY PEAT:** Mostly it's authoritarian versus authoritarian. But behind authoritarianism is a doctrine of atomistic individualism that sort of defines everyone else as a potential enemy. And starting with, it could come from… ideas in the Christian culture. Marx, for example, adopted largely Christian ethics in designing his new approach to reality. But you can find lots of good ideas in our tradition. You don't have to start from a vacuum.

**CONTEXT:** How would you categorize the long-term struggle between humans, and is it primarily authoritarian versus anti-authoritarian, or authoritarian versus authoritarian, as seen in ideologies like Marxism?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the authoritarians have placed themselves, the individual human against nature, and so they refuse to see intelligence, it starts with denying full human qualities to women and children, because it's only the male patriarch that is truly fully human. Then that extends animals are materials, not living intelligent beings. And obviously the same for, for plants and microbes. They are defined as a material world, and women and children are mired in the material world to some extent. And so getting away from that idea of a material world is an essential thing. You can't objectify it and say it's a material world. Life is the dominant male and all the rest is tending to be inert and unwholesome matter. If you see the consciousness that is visible in the material world, you can't objectify it and say it's a material world. plants, animals, and bacteria, all the way down to their smallest units. The co-acervation approach is just one way of seeing that every atom and molecule has an actual active role. There's no random junk operating anywhere in the system. Everything is participating and guided by intelligence, except when authoritarian beliefs intervene to become blind to the intelligence that's there.

**CONTEXT:** How does the authoritarian worldview, which often objectifies nature and devalues certain groups, relate to the concept of intelligence and the active role of every atom and molecule in the coacervation approach?

**RAY PEAT:** J.D. Unwin was a professor in England who said that the repressive authoritarian society was necessary for civilization itself, that the nature of the world is that it needs the authoritarian. dictator to keep the material degeneration process from happening where everyone would would just enjoy what they're doing. It has to be organized so it has good armies and can conquer the world and expand as an empire. And that was in the 30s. He was writing about the process of creating an ideology of repression. It began at the beginning of the century with neo-Darwinism and then people like J.D. Unwin and Conrad Lorentz in Germany, Charles Davenport, the eugenics, and then people like J.D. Unwin and Conrad. professor in the U.S., and then those were primarily subsidized by the big corporations and banks. It was after the Second World War that they really got organized when the CIA became the primary agent of these corporations and banks. Which had been doing it on a private basis, taking over governments by their own private armies. But the CIA now got things organized and made a program to take over the media, the universities, the publishing houses, and set the world on fire. On the strictly authoritarian course, so these things have been there all along, but first the corporations establishing relative monopolies, and then the CIA acting as the agent of monopolies, a given of power that became sort of totalitarian. I did it from 1950 because that's when the CIA started the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which even abstract expressionism was promoted in the art world over any kind of meaningful image, painting, or sculpture. It was totalitarian in the sense that... it penetrated religious publications, art museums, concerts, everything in the culture was being redesigned under the guidance of the CIA.

**CONTEXT:** How do you respond to the argument that patriarchal, WASP-controlled societies of the past, like the 1950s, were the peak of civilization, and how does this relate to the historical development of repressive ideologies and corporate/CIA influence?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Norbert Wiener, who was one of the most important people in designing our artificial intelligence and control and communication system, he immediately at the end of World War II, rejected any military research support, and that knocked him out of... out of the official line of intellectual development because the whole policy was to militarize our world and culture. And he is a good person to investigate for the conflict between the technology that he himself greatly contributed to and the way it should be used. under the guidance and control of the intelligent human beings.

**CONTEXT:** Does technology, particularly artificial intelligence and control systems, have an inherent tendency to degenerate and become a tool for oppression, as Norbert Wiener suggested by rejecting military research?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've often mentioned that Bertrand Russell, coming from the ruling class, saw... what it was doing and worked out the logic that justified it, but as he learned more about it, he saw that his logic was ideological, built into it, and he did that just before the computer thinking, the computability of mathematics and logic. Took over in the 1930s and 40s, specifically designed around that ideology that Russell had identified, that logic became a matter of authoritarian reductionism, atoms and logical atoms have to be precisely defined before they will work in a computer. Or a digital control system. And it's exactly the openness to new connections that the human use of language and consciousness is the proper way of human functioning. And when you design a computable language, you've designed out the human properties that leave it open to innovation. And Norbert Wiener was one of the people who saw that on a technical level.

**CONTEXT:** How did Bertrand Russell's critique of logic and the subsequent development of computability in mathematics and logic, particularly in relation to digital control systems, lead to the exclusion of human properties like openness to innovation?

**RAY PEAT:** No. No, not the irrational aggression. When I was in graduate school, the archaeological anthropologists who were identifying ape-like skeletons in Africa and claiming that humanity originated with the use of weapons to bash each other's skulls, the hunter-murderer-warrior idea of human beings. That idea of aggression is closely tied to the genetic theory of survival of the fittest, and survival of the fittest was converted to suit the idea of rule by the elite. through military power. But aggression seems to be a natural response in an animal world when the animal is threatened and is not allowed to retreat. So something similar must be happening in people too and that would be a, I don't want to call it a good response, but it would be a natural response, right?

**CONTEXT:** Is aggression in animals, particularly when threatened and unable to retreat, a natural response that might also be occurring in humans, and how does this relate to the "hunter-murderer-warrior" theory of human origins and the concept of survival of the fittest?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, self-defense. When you're pushed too far, you might lose rationality. in the way you defend yourself, but it's a matter of survival. People will choose survival at that point, but when their survival is assured to any extent, then cooperation becomes the rule as the early biological work of survival. Peter Kropotkin worked out and some of his followers in the later 20th century showed that cooperation all across the evolutionary spectrum, cooperation within species and even across species is the basic property of life, like bacteria will give to. life-saving genetic material, even the strange unrelated bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** When survival is threatened, aggression can be a natural response. However, when survival is assured, cooperation becomes the rule. Can you elaborate on Peter Kropotkin's work on cooperation as a fundamental property of life across the evolutionary spectrum?

**RAY PEAT:** No, no, I think you have to stop the slapper and then you can forgive them once. When she's powerless over you, that's what will and Blake said that, right?

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the religious idea of turning the other cheek, is this an adaptive response, or is it more effective to neutralize the aggressor before offering forgiveness?

**RAY PEAT:** They've built in privileges for banks, for example, to rip off the general public. And so just changing the rules, getting an even playing field, as they used to say, that would give a powerful opportunity to develop the constructive. Interactions, but but now the government have deeply and powerfully enforced the exploitation systems.

**CONTEXT:** How do built-in privileges for institutions like banks, and government enforcement of exploitation systems, hinder the development of constructive interactions and an even playing field?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think the old story, the creative nature of the so-called material world, that's where we should be putting our energy, how it is that life has got this far and what are the processes that will get us out of this. A current dying condition and people hate it when I ask you to speculate about things, but this dollar inflation type of thing that that's on purpose to yeah, they invest in stocks, for example, and then to increase the value of stocks means they're taking power from anyone who doesn't own shares in the big corporations. And so inflating dollar value is ruining anyone who doesn't own one of the systems which is going to survive. And in the process, they are deliberately killing the small businesses that aren't on the stock exchanges. So that all economic activity is being funneled through the big monopolies that they're invested in. And as part of killing independent business, they are inflating the dollar so that it makes it harder for them, with their worthless dollars, to... ever buy into the monopoly system that is going to take over everything.

**CONTEXT:** What is the most important topic to focus on right now, and how does dollar inflation, as a deliberate tool to consolidate power in large corporations, impact small businesses and economic activity?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they don't know the rules. The giant corporations have computer systems set up so that they can always beat the individual to do.

**CONTEXT:** If banks and giant corporations have sophisticated computer systems that give them an advantage, is investing in the stock market a viable strategy for the average person?

**RAY PEAT:** Just being in that dependent condition, it's already increased. It's already increased. Mortality greatly. And so just keeping them in an insecure state of relative misery, they'll just die off sooner rather than later.

**CONTEXT:** How does dependency on the government, and living in a state of insecurity and misery, contribute to increased mortality rates?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, definitely. Like the Occupy Wall Street movement, they had corporate control, but authorized by the FBI, snipers ready to kill the leaders. So they're ahead of us in every way. They brought-

**CONTEXT:** When movements like Occupy Wall Street are suppressed by authorities, does this indicate that those in power are prepared to use military-style tactics to maintain control?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm sure that's true. It doesn't matter if they're a majority, the military has the biggest weapons. The spectacle is too big at this point, right?

**CONTEXT:** If a significant portion of the population desires to break away from the current system, will the military's superior weaponry and the overwhelming nature of the "spectacle" prevent any meaningful change?

**RAY PEAT:** They've wanted to polarize. People to get the so-called right and the so-called left to polarize and think of each other as the enemy. But now it looks like much of the Republican Party is standing for what the traditional Democratic Party stood for, and the Democrats have appropriated the worst elitism of the old Republican Party. So the polarization is largely imaginary, but they're still hoping to capitalize on that to make the people fight each other instead of who they should be fighting.

**CONTEXT:** How has the political polarization between the "right" and "left" been manufactured, and is the current alignment of parties, with Republicans adopting traditional Democratic stances and Democrats embracing elitism, part of a strategy to divide the populace?

**RAY PEAT:** Very, very often, like in the Vietnam War, I think it was the fragging that finally brought the war to an end. The soldiers... Started killing their commanders. Yeah, the commanders were their worst enemies. Absolutely.

**CONTEXT:** In situations like the Vietnam War, where soldiers began killing their commanders ("fragging"), does this indicate a potential breakdown in military obedience when orders are perceived as detrimental to the soldiers themselves?

**RAY PEAT:** His enemies were the Christian state and the various people who opposed Marx were the most radical anti-Semites. And so his article on the Jewish question was to oppose the anti-Semites and to call for... a general, not just emancipation of Jews, but for a general emancipation of humanity, from the world of finance. And I don't know that maybe when he worked for the New York Times, if the Rothschilds were invested in the Times, you could say they were paying his salary. But I don't know of any actual support from... the bankers to Marx.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding Karl Marx's "On the Jewish Question," how did his article oppose anti-Semitism and advocate for the emancipation of humanity from the world of finance, and what is the evidence for or against Rothschild involvement in his work?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I've read for years on the issue and The soviet government was really a mishmash that was steered very intelligently by Lenin ignoring ideology to a great extent but trying to do something that would end czarism forever and while keeping the european and american invaders from taking over the country and the politburo for example was made up of people with a bunch of very different ideologies and Lenin was just able to maneuver an anti czarist. Anti imperialist policy, where the provisional government that they took over was really just an opening to let czarism back in, or to let the West come in, the way they went in in 1991, a phony government acting as agents of the West. So, there were lots of very pro-Russian people who didn't like Marxism at all, but who wanted whatever it was, Orthodox Christianity, for example, was a big motive. All of these patriotic people saw the revolution. as a potential way to get out of starism and imperialism, but some extreme ideologists were operating at different times, and the fact that it did stay free of the West for 50 years or so, 70 years, I guess. Except that Khrushchev was in many ways strongly conceding and influenced by the West, and then Gorbachev made further moves that opened it to tie it into international commerce and banking.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the claim that the 1917 Russian Revolution was a Zionist project, and how do you view the Soviet government's steering by Lenin, its diverse ideologies, and its eventual integration into international commerce and banking?
