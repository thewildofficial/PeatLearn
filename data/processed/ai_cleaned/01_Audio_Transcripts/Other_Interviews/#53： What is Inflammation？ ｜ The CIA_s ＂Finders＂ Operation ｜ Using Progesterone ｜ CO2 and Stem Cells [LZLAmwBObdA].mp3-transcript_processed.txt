**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the interest-free money that has been saving the economy for a few years, I think last, at the end of fall of 2019, it was reaching the point where just free money loans wasn't enough, they had to figure out some way to radically change things, bringing on the pandemic or more wars or something was needed. And I think the basic universal income is going to be phased in gradually with these. I think the checks to the public are going to get more often until finally it's like everyone is on a pension and that won't make savings worthless. And I see that as once you have everyone basically on a pension plus inflation that has destroyed any kind of savings. Then you have people under control because then you can just change their pension at will.
**CONTEXT:** Ray discusses the economic situation and the potential for universal basic income.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, there won't be enough gold. It's already tending to disappear like the U.S. won't give back national gold that they were supposedly storing because it just isn't there. People have been investing in paper gold and I think there just isn't enough real gold to work as money anymore.
**CONTEXT:** Ray explains the scarcity of real gold and its implications for its role as currency.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. And we talked about it a little bit, but the idea behind Bitcoin is that it's like finite. There's a limited amount and then some people are saying it's like, uh, it's a lot better than gold and it seems to be getting some institutional support. But you think this is just some kind of misdirection? I think so. Actually, there is nothing existing. It's a belief system and right now the, the changing beliefs about it have made some people very rich, but buying a small amount skyrocketed in price. But since it's basically a psychological currency, I think it couldn't be manipulated out of existence whenever the world powers decide to.
**CONTEXT:** Ray expresses skepticism about Bitcoin's long-term viability as a currency, viewing it as a belief system susceptible to manipulation.

**RAY PEAT:** No, not really. If you have some land in a place that is survivable, enough water to support yourself, and some goats and chickens, and to grow some vegetables, then everything is good until some mobsters or governments decided to confiscate your land.
**CONTEXT:** Ray outlines a survivalist approach to hedging against economic instability, emphasizing self-sufficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there is a way out and that is for everyone or at least half of the population to wake up and actually think about things instead of the prejudices that they have been taught since childhood. If they just start questioning basically every word in their language and thinking, why do I think this? And then looking at what the absence of facts in their belief system implies. That could lead to people asking questions, what can we do about the situation in which a few thousand people are deliberately destroying everyone's livelihood, making them rapidly more dependent and threatening bigger and bigger wars to keep people fearful? If millions of people start thinking about what can be done, then naturally basic intelligence is going to come up with some ideas.
**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that critical thinking and questioning ingrained beliefs are essential for societal change.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, at some point, if there are enough people.
**CONTEXT:** Ray agrees that widespread non-cooperation could cripple a system.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just absolute withdrawal from all of the stupid, imposed digital systems. Don't buy anything from Amazon, don't express your opinions on Facebook, which would require you meeting people physically, which would, you know, quickly end the pandemic restrictions because if everybody decides to meet others, you just can't lock them all up.
**CONTEXT:** Ray advocates for a complete withdrawal from digital systems and a return to physical interaction to counter control measures.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's why people are ordered not to meet in groups bigger than 5 or 10. That used to be called sedition if you had 5 or 6 people gathering together on the street to talk about politics.
**CONTEXT:** Ray draws a parallel between current restrictions on gatherings and historical laws against political assembly.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it's a step to the next one, which will be how our purpose and intentionality relate to development and inflammation and aging. And this is just making the connections between our heredity, adaptation, aging and inflammation and disease resistance, bringing in the fact that the perfect environment is intrauterine and then various things can go wrong after birth. If you're in a hospital especially, they can intensify everything that ordinarily would take 50 or 60 years to go wrong, they can do it in a couple of weeks. But it's showing the historical continuity between stress adaptation and the immune system or developmental system that goes wrong in aging.
**CONTEXT:** Ray introduces his newsletter's focus on the interconnectedness of heredity, adaptation, aging, inflammation, and disease resistance, highlighting the detrimental effects of the postnatal environment.

**RAY PEAT:** It's what a healthy person who catches, for example, the COVID virus does not experience. Their immune system makes them totally unaware that there has been a virus in their body because the body is so multiplied complexly designed not to go wrong, not to experience inflammation. And it has to be a sick and dying person to get in trouble from such a thing as a minor virus or bacteria. Once you're sick, then you're already in an inflamed state, and in that inflamed state, one or more viruses is just another pro-inflammatory degenerative factor, but a healthy person handles resistance and immunity without even noticing it, so the degree of inflammation that you experience with a wound is a sign that you're already in an inflamed state. Or exposure to irritants and so on corresponds to your state of health.
**CONTEXT:** Ray defines inflammation as a state of sickness, contrasting it with the resilience of a healthy, non-inflamed individual.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the experiments with just rats on a PUFA-free diet, a so-called essential fatty acid-free diet. All kinds of tests, poisoned, physical trauma, disease, infectious agents, they're just tremendously resistant to inflammation and dying. Something as crude as holding them by the tail and flacking them on furniture if they've been eating a standard fatty acid PUFA rich diet, they go into shock and inflammation and die. If they don't have a noticeable amount of PUFA in their tissues, they are very tough.
**CONTEXT:** Ray cites experiments demonstrating that a PUFA-free diet confers significant resistance to inflammation and death.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, right. The PUFA form many things leading to inflammation. Just the prostaglandins are a very powerful amplifier of inflammation. Some little thing like hyperglycemia. It can start the formation of prostaglandins and then once it starts, all kinds of things, cytokines and circulatory changes and such get involved.
**CONTEXT:** Ray explains how PUFAs contribute to inflammation by initiating prostaglandin production.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a shift away from oxidation. The PUFA will inhibit the ability to oxidize glucose. And at that moment, you're experiencing reductive stress, or pseudo hypoxia, some people call it. The oxygen is there, but you aren't using it, and that turns on lactic acid, which represents a reductive state, an excess of electrons, and that transmits the reductive stress wherever it goes tends to convert other cells to that same stress state.
**CONTEXT:** Ray links PUFA consumption to a shift away from oxidation, leading to reductive stress and lactic acid buildup.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when you stop oxidizing glucose because of either low thyroid or some poison like nitric oxide or PUFA or carbon monoxide, the enzymes simply stop reacting glucose and its derivatives with oxygen and so the oxygen is still diffusing in from your bloodstream but it's not being consumed and so the animal that is failing its respiration is actually becoming hyperoxic in the vicinity of those poison cells. And so hyperoxia is toxic to the mitochondria and changes the functions of the stem cells. It's one of the things that brings stem cells out of their quiescent state and starts some dividing so that in an injury situation where the cell is going to die because it isn't oxidizing glucose, the stem cells can take over and replace the dead, poisoned cell. But if the cell doesn't get out of the way, then the hyperoxia that has activated the stem cells is going to keep the multiplication going and produce a tumor, but if it is continuously in great excess then you start depleting the stem cells and then you have no renewability of that tissue. So hyperoxia is an outcome of blocking the use of oxygen.
**CONTEXT:** Ray explains how impaired glucose oxidation leads to hyperoxia, which can disrupt stem cell function and potentially lead to tumors or stem cell depletion.

**RAY PEAT:** The failure to produce carbon dioxide, yeah. Right, so that's the presence of it. We're allowed the aberrant cell to commit suicide, basically, to have a pop-up test. Yep, yep. Its pH goes up, activating its own tendency to undergo cell division. And then if there's no glucose available because it's being wasted, then that would be the normal thing that kills the cell.
**CONTEXT:** Ray clarifies that the failure to produce carbon dioxide, leading to increased pH, signals an aberrant cell to undergo apoptosis.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I don't think the idea of taking them out of one place and putting them in another is going to do much if anything.
**CONTEXT:** Ray expresses skepticism about the efficacy of traditional stem cell therapies.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and on a high mountain with a supply of good fruit for example, your oxygen tension is lower at high altitude, closer to the fetal oxygen availability and if you're healthy enough to adapt to high altitude and your CO2 level internally goes up and prevents the hyperventilation increase of pH inside cells that kills them or ages them.
**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that high altitude living, with its lower oxygen tension and increased CO2, can mimic beneficial intrauterine conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. 12,000 feet. I think it's good.
**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests an optimal altitude for beneficial effects.

**RAY PEAT:** No, they usually talk about oxidative stress as making free radicals, but the thing that turns that on is often a block to the ability to use oxygen, and so the traditional use of oxidative stress has been pretty confused, defining it as just pretty much equivalent to lipid peroxidation and free radical damage.
**CONTEXT:** Ray clarifies that oxidative stress is often a consequence of impaired oxygen utilization, not just free radical production.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it goes back to Raymond Pearl and Johns Hopkins, a bunch of reductionists, basically. The anti-life thing, that the slower you live, the longer you live. Cooling off and being half-dead, according to that view, is the way to live longer. And Leonard Hayflick was in that line of thinking, just the most absurd and mechanical view of what life is. Even though he worked for a big cell culture company, he didn't have the faintest idea about how to do proper cell culture. Their goal was just to produce cells to sell them. And he didn't realize that growing 50 generations in a dish is not at all comparable to the living state in an organism. People fell for that shortening telomere idea that sells necessarily. Every division shortened their telomere and have a maximum division capability of 50 cell divisions. Back in the 60s, people tested that and showed that our skin and intestine, for example, would use up those 50 cell divisions of our stem cells in just a few weeks or months, and that grafting experiments found that different organs, like mammary glands, could undergo essentially an infinite number of cell divisions when they're in an organism, supporting the Rockefeller University experiments of growing chicken heart cells, keeping them alive for more than 20 years, just by renewing their environmental solution properly, not letting lactic acid accumulate.
**CONTEXT:** Ray critiques the reductionist "rate-of-living" theory and the telomere shortening hypothesis, citing evidence of unlimited cell division in vivo and successful long-term cell culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly, it's all mechanical thinking and that mechanical thinking like in a COSURF thinking. The history of these physical ideas showed that it was a belief, basically in a big bang of creationist universe that those ideas, if you believe there was a creation of the universe in one moment, then you can deduce that one-directional running down of the universe. The cosmic, or the idea of, what do they call it, a watchmaker. A god who set the universe clock in motion, all a clock can do if god wound it up at one point is run until it loses the wind up energy. And so the universe, from that religious viewpoint, can do nothing but run down. And N.A. Kozirev showed that if you don't make those religious assumptions, then you can explain the stellar energy source, the fact that all of the planets have an internal energy source, and that's what we're going production of energy, even the giant gaseous planets turn out to be producing internal energy like an incipient star developing.
**CONTEXT:** Ray connects the mechanical, reductionist view of life to a creationist, "running down" model of the universe, contrasting it with Kozirev's concept of continuous energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** Right. Right. And even Fred Soddy, the inventor of the isotope interpretation of atoms, even he, in one of his later books, described his thinking for continuous creation. He believed cosmic rays were the atoms just coming into existence.
**CONTEXT:** Ray mentions Fred Soddy's support for the concept of continuous creation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I'm in this newsletter, suggesting the probability that the so-called viruses are little packets of nuclear material being exchanged throughout the world by every organism. Bacteria do it visibly transmitting the information that they invented themselves to their friends and every organism you look at is actually circulating exosomes packets of information within themselves in a repair and regenerative process but all of their body fluids contain the same exosomes and are being released in the environment constantly. And so every organism is emitting these packets that are virus-like in structure.
**CONTEXT:** Ray proposes that viruses may be naturally occurring packets of genetic material exchanged between organisms for repair and regeneration.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when the system is working well, I think that's going on all the time. You can transmit actual mitochondria in those packets.
**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that the exchange of exosomes, potentially including mitochondria, is a normal biological process.

**RAY PEAT:** The purpose of the adjuvant, which had always been aluminum hydroxide, was to create systemic inflammation to stir up excitement so that your body would start making antibodies to anything novel that was present. And they talk about the lipids in these RNA vaccines as transport or mediators of cellular uptake for the RNA, but actually they're the same lipids that have been promoted for use as adjuvant. So they're just a lipid version of an adjuvant intended to create systemic inflammation big enough to get you to produce antibodies and the antibody producing system is, I don't think it's properly considered to be part of the immune system. The whole process should be maintenance of our immune system. We have a structural functional system and the antibodies are part of a cleanup system. You have, for example, natural killer cells that will damage, remove damaged cells, killing them so the parts can be removed. When you have a tissue that isn't quite ready to have the natural killer cells destroy the damaged substance, you have antibodies that are helping to mop up and control and prepare, clean up the area so that phagocytes can remove the debris and restore some of the cells to normal functioning without having to kill them.
**CONTEXT:** Ray explains the role of adjuvants in vaccines, suggesting they induce inflammation to stimulate antibody production, which he views as a cleanup system rather than a primary immune response.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, being around sick people, inflamed people, I think always has more risk. In the winter, people going indoors. You are staying indoors and breathing the same air. Once one person is under stress, they're going to be putting out more exosomes. And if their exosomes happen to be coming out of stressed cells rather than the normal low oxygen stem cell sources, then their exosomes can be irritating and spread to inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that proximity to stressed or inflamed individuals increases the risk of exposure to irritating exosomes, potentially spreading inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** I think everything the Medical system is doing tends to do degrade the whole population a little.
**CONTEXT:** Ray believes that the medical system's practices contribute to a general decline in population health.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. The possibility is there. And when you look at the lying, deliberate, deliberate breaking of the law of high government officials, World Health Organization, CDC, and the top levels, foundations like the Gates Foundation, you see them deliberately misleading the population. I think it's odd to assume that they wouldn't be trying to execute what they've expressed as their long-range goals, population reduction. Since they have the means now, and since they're they've demonstrated that they are morally corrupt and basically profiting from misleading the public, to assume that they're not criminal on multiple levels, I think would be a mistake.
**CONTEXT:** Ray asserts that the possibility of depopulation through vaccines is real, given the perceived corruption and deception of public health institutions and foundations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that attitude is exactly what you need to keep them as not believing that it's possible while it's going on.
**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that public disbelief is a crucial element in the execution of such plans.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that policy was basically decided when Roosevelt died. Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie had a meeting and decided on a post-war policy of bringing the Third World up to the rest of society, making them independent and affluent and prosperous. And right after the meeting, Willkie died unexpectedly of a cold. And in the following Allen Dulles' treason, before, within just a few days of the revelation that Dulles and the whole organization were working with the Nazis, Roosevelt died in a very timely way. And immediately the policies towards the Third World changed radically from giving the equivalent of a Marshall Plan, to bring up all of the Third World countries to a good standard of living, that immediately changed back to the empire of exploiting them to death.
**CONTEXT:** Ray alleges a shift in post-WWII policy towards the Third World from development to exploitation following the deaths of Roosevelt and Willkie, hinting at a conspiracy.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. And you and you describe like maybe a person being around you, but what happens when a population it's like, I guess we're already in a sick population. So can it be that much worse if everybody is vaccinated and I don't know spreading and exchanging with these inflammatory materials?
**CONTEXT:** Ray considers the implications of a vaccinated population on the overall health of society.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he's a willing conspirator by bringing in Schmidt as an advisor. I don't think he's a fair-minded, good person. But now, like, he was at the forefront of the pandemic, right? He was the biggest proponent of the lockdowns, he was on CNN and all the media 24-7, and now it seems like they're trying to, like, me too him. In other words, all of these accusers came out of nowhere. I mean, I don't doubt their stories, but it seems like the establishment is trying to throw him under the bus. And the story is that apparently other states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota had, like, much worse geriatric genocide at the elderly care homes. And now they're trying to throw Cuomo under the bus to, like, sort of, like, put a lid on the story, or at least give the public a scapegoat, because if the full story becomes known and how many elderly people were massacred by basically introducing sick people into their homes, the people will just revolt.
**CONTEXT:** Ray suggests that the accusations against Governor Cuomo are a deliberate attempt to divert attention from potentially larger-scale "geriatric genocide" in other states and to prevent public revolt.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they should get rid of him for his actual crimes, but if they can shift the attention to whatever womanizing he was doing, that's a way to cover up what he was actually doing.
**CONTEXT:** Ray believes that focusing on Cuomo's personal scandals is a tactic to conceal his more significant alleged crimes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and my friend, who I met because I became his surveillance subjects many years later, after his wife being very drunk after what work he was doing. And she said, the same as always. And I said, oh, what was that? And she said, surveillance. He had never mentioned that. So later I asked him what group he was working for, CIA or NSA or Naval Intelligence, I think I mentioned. He said, none of those. I'll tell you when I retire.
**CONTEXT:** Ray recounts an experience where a friend revealed he was under surveillance by an unnamed intelligence agency.

**RAY PEAT:** As soon as we met, basically. What was the, what was the tip off? It is a sort of greasy manner, obviously no character, just an absolute ball of sleaze.
**CONTEXT:** Ray describes the immediate impression of untrustworthiness he received from a man he suspected of being involved with the CIA.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, colds and influenza have always affected the sense of taste and smell, sometimes for longer than others, but that type of respiratory infection, a very common symptom was loss of those senses. And stress, one of the things that happens in stress is that the metallothionine protein is increased and it binds necessary essential metals like zinc and copper as well as antitoxic metals that you're exposed to. And I think the loss of zinc is one of the things affecting the sensory apparatus. An essential component of carbonic anhydrase enzyme and I think that in nerve endings and sensory organs, carbonic anhydrase is important for regulating sensitivity. Zinc deficiency has been associated closely with the loss of taste. Several human studies show that when you give anti-serotonin drugs, there is a remarkable increase in both visual and odor acuity. One of the very most frequent symptoms of the COVID infection is diarrhea and anti-serotonin agents such as ciproheptadine. They have been very helpful for preventing COVID diarrhea, which is undoubtedly a part of the serotonin excess problem and the hyperventilation syndrome disturbed regulation of oxygen-carbon-dioxide balance leads to the inability of the platelets to transport serotonin and so they they leak serotonin and it increases the systemic activity of serotonin. And that poisons all kinds of systems.
**CONTEXT:** Ray explains that loss of smell and taste, common in respiratory infections like COVID-19, can be linked to stress-induced zinc deficiency and elevated serotonin levels, which impair sensory function and carbonic anhydrase activity.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. And it increases the tendency to have blood clots and inflammation of blood vessels. Yeah, the reason I'm asking is because it's a very common side effect for people taking SSRI drugs to lose a significant portion of their sense of smell or taste. So it seems serotonin does have that direct effect. And you mentioned suppressing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with vitamin D, but doesn't zinc also have a part in that in some way, shape, or form? Doesn't the RAS, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system? I think the stress reaction is a by deranging your carbonic anhydrase that's going to be a basic pro-inflammatory thing.
**CONTEXT:** Ray confirms that elevated serotonin can contribute to blood clots and vascular inflammation, and suggests zinc's role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he's just talking about the standard thing that if you make a vaccine and the viruses everywhere in the pandemic, a lot of the viruses are going to mutate, as they would anyway, but the ones that have the greatest opportunity to keep replicating are the ones that have mutated. And so using the vaccine, any vaccine, in the midst of a pandemic naturally is going to favor the mutant versions of the virus, some of which could be more damaging than when the vaccine is working against. So he's talking just about standard understanding of virology. And people have attacked him as trying to promote his own vaccine. But I think his vaccine work was for protecting chickens from tumor viruses, something like that. So he doesn't have a financial stake in this, but he just understands virology enough that he says, why doesn't someone talk about why we don't start applying standard virological principles to the use of these vaccines and stop using them basically.
**CONTEXT:** Ray explains Geert van den Bosch's theory, which posits that using vaccines during a pandemic favors the replication of mutant viral strains, a standard virological principle.

**RAY PEAT:** I think there are resistant individuals to any virus, but there are some viruses that like plant and animal viruses, both, some of them are, have a greater impact on more individuals. So what would be the carcinogenic effect from, let's say, like one of the sarcoma viruses that the rumor is they used to kill Hugo Chavez? I think that was a gene transmitted by a bacterium and it just creates a very intense inflammation and I think the proper approach always is to use all of the anti-inflammatory tools that you have. High sugar, aspirin, progesterone, vitamin D. Anti-histamines, anti-serotonin agents, I think if you flood the system with those, you have a chance to overcome whatever pro-inflammatory thing you've introduced.
**CONTEXT:** Ray discusses carcinogenic viruses, suggesting they induce intense inflammation and that anti-inflammatory measures are crucial for combating them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, very likely, when you have tens of millions of people subjected to it. And already, the reporting system for vaccine injury studies have shown that fewer than one in a hundred injuries has been reported historically. And already, there are reports of more than 2,000 deaths, several thousand major debilitating injuries and tens of thousands of other reactions. So if you multiply those numbers by a hundred, you see that lots of damage is being done. This one seems to turn us into machines for producing this inflammatory spike protein and this will be ongoing. The ACE2 protein is our major anti-inflammatory system right at the heart of the anthrotensin system. It destroys anthrotensin and as important as anthrotensin is in all of the inflammatory degenerative diseases, if you destroy the enzyme that destroys anthrotensin, that's just about the most dangerous thing you can do to knock out our anti-inflammatory basic system.
**CONTEXT:** Ray states that mRNA vaccines are likely to cause cancer due to the continuous production of inflammatory spike protein, which disrupts the body's anti-inflammatory ACE2 system.

**RAY PEAT:** All kinds of degenerative things. If people keep producing the spike protein that will keep knocking out the anti-inflammatory system as long as the DNA and RNA are in their system.
**CONTEXT:** Ray reiterates that the ongoing production of spike protein from mRNA vaccines can lead to widespread degenerative conditions by compromising the anti-inflammatory system.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the studies of going around and looking at doctors and hospitals and looking up actual injuries, they found that not one in a hundred of the vaccine-related injuries. Had been reported. Even though they've paid out billions in damages, it could have been hundreds of billions if people had been informed that they could and should report their death and injury.
**CONTEXT:** Ray highlights the underreporting of vaccine injuries, citing studies that found less than 1% of injuries are officially reported, despite significant payouts for damages.
