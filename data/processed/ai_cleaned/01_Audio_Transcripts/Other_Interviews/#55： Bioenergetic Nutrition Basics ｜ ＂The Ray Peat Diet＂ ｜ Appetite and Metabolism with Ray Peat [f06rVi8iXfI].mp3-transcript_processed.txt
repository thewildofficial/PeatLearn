**RAY PEAT:** Texas has lots of places with really good climate up in the hills at a higher altitude very livable. I don't know any place in Florida that I would consider livable because of the humidity and heat.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat is asked about the climate in Florida and Texas.

**RAY PEAT:** Humans are not designed to live in a climate like that. You have to turn down your metabolic rate tremendously because of the humidity. High temperature and humidity do that.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat to elaborate on the problem with high humidity and heat.

**RAY PEAT:** Super hypothyroid people just love it; it's making up entirely for their cold metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if this is why retirees move to these places.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the things that happened to me, even though I adjusted my heat production somewhat downward, the humidity and my metabolism caused me to grow mold like a fungus sprouting out of me. And when I got back to Oregon under moderate temperature and humidity, they shriveled and fell off.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat describes a personal experience related to humidity and metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's a very natural, sane reaction. The way the climate change doctrine was promoting change gradually, but it had a time frame of something like 10 or 20 years. They jumped on the pandemic idea and realized that the time frame for a complete takeover would be reduced to two or three years. With resistance, there's talk that they're going to have a so-called cyber attack justifying a takeover by the governments of the banks to save everyone's money by confiscating it, basically, and turning to a cyber currency and rationing out your own money to you.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the public's reaction to pandemic measures and a potential cyber attack scenario.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it depends on how sane the population is. If half the population gets fully aware of the horrors planned for them, then the ruling class is going to have to do something desperate, like war or confiscation of the banks. I'm betting on war. I think that, you know, it's their favorite tool to start with; they're the most experienced with it, and it's, you know, if they start a major war like with Iran or God forbid China or Russia, even the same population will be kind of forced to get on board and support it because it'll be a matter of survival.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat speculates on the ruling class's potential desperate measures.

**RAY PEAT:** Their goal is to have Russia and China completely subdued because Russia has such a tremendous area of natural resources, everyone wants to control their resources. And so the Russian government has been a nuisance now for hundreds and hundreds of years, and the West is still trying to think of ways to take total control of their resources. And meanwhile, keeping a mild war hysteria going is necessary to keep the Western Europe and especially American economies running.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the geopolitical motivations behind potential conflicts.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, they're hoping that Putin will just give up if the England and the U.S., if they give the impression that they will totally back whatever the Ukraine does. Turkey is getting into it, training Ukrainian soldiers and urging them on to invade Crimea and eastern Ukraine, which has declared its independence. So the surface pressure looks like they're dedicated to having Ukraine start those invasions. And assuming that Putin is just going to let them take the Ukraine, Crimea, and the east of the Ukraine under control of the Kiev neo-fascists, and Putin said he won't allow that and has already lots of land and craft available. And so, the Kiev government has withdrawn its forces from the Russian border, recognizing that Russia isn't going to invade the Ukraine and is putting them along the border, the boundary between East and West Ukraine, hoping that threatening to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine will get full support from the West and the battle force Putin to back down. But I think Biden realized that Putin isn't going to back down. And that's why he telephoned him and proposed a summit meeting somewhere, but with no definite date. So I think Biden just hopes to prolong it so he won't be embarrassed, but he doesn't want to see Russia exercise its existing potential to totally knock out the Kiev government.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat elaborates on the situation in Ukraine and potential Russian responses.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because the present bunch in Kiev, they honor Bandera, who was the leader under the Nazi invasion, so they are literally neo-Nazis who are in control. And no one really wants them in control; it's only because they created the war threat.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the political leanings of the Ukrainian government.

**RAY PEAT:** Under the Minsk agreements, part of the UN Security Council agreement, which the West signed on to, Putin has the power to enforce the Minsk agreements, and that could involve protecting the Russian-speaking population of the East from the Kiev people who outlawed Russian-speaking. And so he could evacuate all four or five million population of the Eastern Ukraine, move them into Russia, and just leave that half of the Ukraine as a vacant territory as long as the Kiev people want to keep up their irredentism.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the implications of the Minsk agreements.

**RAY PEAT:** For many years, I've seen talking about food and understanding what food is doing as an extension of discussing philosophy and politics. It's a very powerful way of getting at the nature of existence and working on improving existence.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the philosophical and political implications of nutrition.

**RAY PEAT:** Raising your body temperature makes it easier to create new levels of being. And when you have expanded your understanding, that makes everything you do easier. Things that you don't understand, like opening a door that's latched. If you don't understand the latch, you can't open the door. But once you understand it, then you can open all the doors with a similar latch. And so it makes your range of meaningful activity much, much greater every time you have a general increase in meaningful understanding.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how raising body temperature and expanding understanding improve one's capabilities.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it comes down to the question of our relationship to ourselves and our molecules that make us up. And I think eventually we have to start thinking of ourselves as having appetites and judgment and purpose. And that has been demonstrated in unicellular organisms all the way down to bacteria that they have a planning and judgment and purpose. And if we deny that to our own internal cells, that just seems silly when you can demonstrate it in free living single cells that don't have nervous systems, but our nervous systems are intimately connected to ourselves, and we get our motives essentially by listening to ourselves. The unconditioned reflexes, it's a message. It's sort of a voting of the intelligent population of cells that we listen to and then execute with things like appetite.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the concept of appetite as a reflection of cellular intelligence and purpose.

**RAY PEAT:** Basically, the better your appetite, the more you want to live, more or less? Because you're in touch with and listening to your life process all the way down to molecules.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if appetite can be equated with the desire for life.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. Variety is a real thing you're wanting to discover more about the nature of the universe, and the desire for variety is I think part of that natural curiosity of ourselves.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the role of variety in diet and its connection to curiosity.

**RAY PEAT:** McConnell in the 1950s with the Worm Runners Digest was one version of his publication, and he describes first training plenarians to respond in a certain way to light or dark and then chopping them, the trained plenarian, up and feeding it to an untrained plenarian, and they gained the knowledge that was intended by the first plenarian. So basically memories that I remember a study that came out about three or four years ago, they said that the memories are actually stored throughout the entire organism; they're not located in the brain. The different parts of the worm contain the energy. George Unger followed up McConnell's work with different organisms. And he found that the nucleic acid, especially RNA composition of a catfish, for example, was changed according to what it was smelling in the water. And so the sensed material or the learned material causes molecular changes. And those molecular changes extracted from that organism can produce the same knowledge and patterned reactions to an ignorant organism that had been created in the first experiment.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses experiments on memory transfer in organisms.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, but something is going wrong, and they have to sit back. Like when bacteria, in James Shapiro's experiments, when he gives them an unmetabolizable sugar, they just sit back and wait for two days, and then institute a gene change. They don't want to do anything prematurely that isn't necessary, so they sit back and judge the coming future before they change themselves.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how bacteria adapt to unmetabolizable substances.

**RAY PEAT:** I think both. One of the things that turned out with experiments by Beatrice Gelber, for example, in the 50s and 60s, was that the plenarian can see what's happening. They have purposive behavior and looking at the source. They can do some things when light is present for interpreting chemical signals that they can't do in the dark, showing that they are looking around, taking things into account. The anatomy of a single-celled organism for a long time has been known to include the equivalent of a focusing eyeball and brain. A professor of mine described meeting a specialist in amoebas who showed him some photographs, asked him to identify the organism he thought they came from, and my professor judged a primitive chordate organism and said, "That's clearly a chordate eyeball and nerve fibers and so on." And it turned out that his scale, a size scale, was off about a hundredfold, and the pictures were actually of the photosensitive spot of an amoeba. Well, what people thought was just sort of a reflex reaction when light hit that spot, it was actually shining a light in the eyeball of the amoeba, and the fibers from that eyeball connected to a coordination center were also grossly recognized. In the case of the planarian, they were studied for a long time to look at epigenetics or the inheritance of acquired learned characteristics. They were discarded as an experimental organism by about 1950 because it was too clear that they were totally knocking out all of the genetic doctrines and the idea that learning is nothing but an unconscious chemical reflex. Their purpose and judgment and evaluation of the situation was becoming clear, and the mechanistic idea of how a gene controls mechanistic reflexes just wouldn't work.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the sophisticated capabilities of single-celled organisms and early research on learning.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've been thinking about the interactions of our normal internal infrared wavelength emissions with an infrared-sensitive camera. You can see warm organisms as luminous areas in the dark. And that tremendous emission of energy in the more or less infrared wavelengths. Calculations and experiments have shown about three quarters of our metabolic energy is going out in that form of radiant energy. And the temperature maintained that makes that emission possible is also governing the rate of energy metabolism. And the whole signaling system is very responsive to the emissions from other warm parts of the organism, so that, for example, if you grow a layer of fibroblasts, I think they were using, they tend to line up parallel to each other. And when the experimenter grew another on the opposite side of the glass, they plated another bunch of the same kind of cells and found that they tended to align themselves perpendicularly to what was on the other side of the glass. So they were receiving obvious signals transmitted through the glass that told them what the orientation that they should take would be. And that was the end of the experiment. The person doing this, Gunter Albrecht Buehler, did many things clearly showing that cells have, with regard to infrared energy at least, they have a directional eye equivalent that can see what direction the infrared is coming from, and this is just a simple component cell of an organism such as a fibroblast or an epithelial cell, something that cultures easily. And he showed that under the microscope, focusing a very narrow beam of infrared light, he could get these human cells to chase it, to move with reference to a spot of infrared emissions. So definitely the infrared spectrum is part of our internal maintenance of organization. And so you don't want to mess with beaming those frequencies through the organism because they'll be taken as a signal for reorganization. And part of it involves decompacting the compacted nucleic acids of the nucleus and increasing the expression of RNA and proteins. And so you can disrupt basically every level of cell organization and just with electromagnetic energy.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the role of infrared energy in cellular organization and the potential disruption by external electromagnetic fields.

**RAY PEAT:** So basically, since depending on the frequency, a specific electromagnetic radiation will probably randomly heat an organ whose cells are of the right size so that they start acting like an antenna. You don't want that because you're randomly heating up a portion of the body. And you don't know how those cells and the other cells that are communicated with them, how they would react to this random warming up that doesn't seem to be coming from a coherent activity inside of the organism.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the mechanism by which electromagnetic radiation can disrupt cellular function.

**RAY PEAT:** Right. When they were studying the damage done by radar beam exposure, they had experienced a few sailors having their brains cooked when they walked in front of a certain wavelength of radar antenna, but other wavelengths didn't mess up their brains, and so they experimented and found that the size of the organ resonates with the wavelength so that a monkey with a small brain could be killed by a higher frequency that wouldn't severely damage a human with a big brain. So the higher the frequency, not only we're getting closer to ionizing radiation, but there's a higher chance that some cells in the organism would be of the quote-unquote right size and then react negatively?

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how organ size and wavelength resonance can determine the impact of electromagnetic radiation.

**RAY PEAT:** A cell or part of the cell. Part of the cell, okay. So, well, if it's part of the cell, is it possible that even non-ionizing radiation, if it's of the right frequency, can cause DNA damage even though it's non-ionizing?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if non-ionizing radiation can cause DNA damage.

**RAY PEAT:** Um... Yeah, blue light, for example, does damage DNA.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms that blue light can damage DNA.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, daylight, I think, is perfectly safe if you don't overexpose the ultraviolet and the blue part of the spectrum.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the safety of daylight exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** Probably if they had the data that led them to submit it for publication, I would suspect that the editors just didn't like it. Yeah, it was sitting published for about a month, and then there was this huge outcry on social media, of course, where else would it be coming from? The cancel culture. And then they forced the National Library of Medicine, the PubMed people, to retract it. It's still there, but it just has this big retraction notice written all over it.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat comments on the retraction of a study linking 5G to viral particle production.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, one of the things that vitamin D and calcium in the diet accomplish is to reduce parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone under the influence of any kind of inflammation promoting signal, it turns down energy production, reduces oxidative phosphorylation, and so eating calcium and vitamin D will tend to restore mitochondrial energy production, helping the cell to keep calcium out of the cells.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how vitamin D and calcium help regulate parathyroid hormone and energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** If we had a source of pure palmitic and stearic acid, especially stearic acid, or higher saturated fats, I think they would be safe. We could produce our own M-minus-9. Polyunsaturated fats, which are the ones normally produced extensively in the brain and are substituted through time and eating by the M-minus-6 and M-minus-3 unstable polyunsaturated fats. So with oleic acid, palmitic, and stearic acid, the M-minus-9 and M-minus-6, which are the ones normally produced extensively in the brain and eating by the M-minus-6 and M-minus-3 unstable polyunsaturated fats, are substituted through time and eating by the M-minus-6 and fats, are pretty safe and a compact form of energy availability and storage. And some experiments show that, like Hans Selye showed, that cocoa butter rich in stearic acid protected hearts against the damage caused by linoleic dietary PUFA. Just adding the extra stearic acid had a protective anti-heart necrosis action. And more recent experiments show that the visceral fat percentage can be reduced by increasing stearic acid in the diet. And to some extent, an excess of stearic acid tends to support subcutaneous fat, which is the appearance that a very healthy child has, for example, giving their skin smoothness and shapeliness and so on. It's the gaunt look of the older, very sick people due to the fact that they're rapidly losing subcutaneous fat, but gaining visceral one. Decreases under the skin of work as actual purpose insulation and elasticity and so on and and that creates the organ defending the internal abdominal sort of fat.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the safety and benefits of saturated fats, particularly stearic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, sugar is my current understanding of what is most protective. Stress tends to increase your circulating free fatty acids, activating the the Randall effect, blocking the ability to use sugar for energy and increasing the sugar in your diet tends to lower the lipolytic activity, keeps the fat where it belongs, and prevents the Randall shift to fat oxidation, and so it maximizes your carbon dioxide production, which keeps your stress-producing lactic acid inhibited.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how sugar protects against stress and fat oxidation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you include oleic acid and stearic and palmitic, I think something around an ounce would probably be ideal, but I don't think there would be any harm up to even a thousand calories per day.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat provides a guideline for saturated fat intake.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And the PUFA is a promoter of estrogenic effects in many different ways. It activates the estrogen process.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how PUFAs promote estrogenic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** The liver, when it's well nourished and activated by thyroid rather than estrogen effects, the liver can harmlessly excrete PUFA. Any PUFA that appears in your bloodstream, it can be recognized by the liver as a toxin and inactivated by attaching glucuronic acid to it, for example, and causing it to be excreted in urine. So the androgens are basically protecting the liver and allowing it to be able to excrete more and more PUFA.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how androgens protect the liver and facilitate PUFA excretion.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the thyroid and the progesterone and aspirin, such things, worked in that direction. Seems reasonable. I've known a couple of people who, one, had a very big valley that his doctor said was a totally cirrhotic hard liver from 50 years of using heroin and alcohol constantly every day and a period of about five or six months of using T3 and progesterone every day in fairly large amounts. His doctor said he couldn't find any sign of cirrhosis. At the end of about five or six months, he came to my house on Christmas Eve and brought a few quarts of wine and beer with him in case we didn't have enough. So he finished that by bedtime as he went to bed. I gave him a bottle of progesterone and told him to use whatever felt right. And in the morning I came out, he was already in the kitchen, sitting at the table smiling. He said he never came off a drunk without a hangover in 50 years or 40 years of being addicted.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat shares a story about the regenerative effects of T3 and progesterone on a cirrhotic liver.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's the same effect as the stearic acid, only more concentrated, super saturated, a longer chain, super saturated, long chain alcohol in that case, which is converted to a fatty acid.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the potential benefits of polycosanols, comparing them to stearic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** Taking thyroid clears it up very quickly and predictably. And that's, you would know that if you were passing kind of lightly clay-colored stool, is that right? Would that indicate a specific problem with the gallbladder?

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses gallbladder issues and the role of thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a very serious, deep problem which goes with high estrogen very often. But getting liver back to metabolizing properly, the gallbladder responds quickly, and you can, within just a few days, you can start tolerating fats in your diet and lose all of the gallbladder symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how improving liver function can resolve gallbladder symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** It probably depends on the balance of amino acids. But when your body senses a protein deficiency, it turns on the proteolytic. So that it takes down your thymus gland, lymph nodes, muscles, skin, all of the expandable, momentarily expandable proteins are converted to the essential amino acids which your brain and essential organs, lung and heart, need to keep working. So the sensed protein deficiency is essentially a proteolytic state which takes your whole body down.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the consequences of protein deficiency and the body's proteolytic response.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure, but combined with thyroid function. Right, right, because some people would say like, hey, well, what's the problem with not eating enough protein? Obviously, you know, you can, because you have protein on yourself, the body can use it to, you know, shred it and then, and then converting to albumin. But human studies have shown that if you, that in starving people, despite their blood levels of amino acids going really high from the high cortisol, cortisol actually suppresses the synthesis of albumin. So all of these amino acids end up getting oxidized as fuel, which is really bad because it generates all this ammonia.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the importance of dietary protein for albumin synthesis and the negative effects of cortisol and estrogen on this process.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that in the military study that was for even little people working at a desk job, that was required for efficiency, and they didn't say what a better, that was just a minimum for work efficiency.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat clarifies the context of protein recommendations from military studies.

**RAY PEAT:** Bruno Barnes experimented eating a lot more meat in this diet. He found he had to double his thyroid dose. So it's very easy to overdo the protein displacing carbohydrate, I imagine, is what was happening and liberating the thyroid suppressing tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. So as far as I know, experiments using natural gelatin as a protein slashing those anti-thyroid amino acids, they could tolerate a fairly higher dose of protein.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the potential thyroid-suppressing effects of certain amino acids found in protein and the benefits of gelatin.

**RAY PEAT:** So for an adult, is there any role physiologically needed for tryptophan aside from producing niacin, which people can take as a supplement?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the physiological need for tryptophan beyond niacin production.

**RAY PEAT:** A little bit for tissue replacement. So there is a minimum amount of tryptophan that everybody needs?

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms the need for tryptophan for tissue replacement.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, making hair and skin and gut cells that have to be shed.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat specifies the tissues that require tryptophan for replacement.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. It's pretty much the same. When you reduce any of those three amino acids to a minimum, life expectancy in the animal experiments goes up tremendously.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the impact of reducing specific amino acids on lifespan.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, digestion is usually the first thing to go wrong. They'll start getting gas or some digestive symptom, which could be that they're not replacing the lining of the intestine fast enough to make digestion work smoothly. Gelatin abuse. Gelatin junkie.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat describes potential digestive issues from excessive gelatin consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** I've experimented on people with a 100 gram carbohydrate diet, and I don't think that was even close to a good health level. It helped them lose weight, but it was partly protein weight. I think it's probably around that range of 200 or 300 that's minimum.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the inadequacy of a 100-gram carbohydrate diet and suggests a higher minimum.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know. I don't know. Or they just have a very intense metabolic rate. If you're consuming oxygen at twice the rate of normal, then it would be reasonable to expect that you need closer to a pound of carbohydrate per day.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat speculates on reasons for higher carbohydrate needs.

**RAY PEAT:** I think increasing it is helpful.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests increasing carbohydrate intake with age.

**RAY PEAT:** If it works as a laxative, you're going to absorb very little of it. But just the cellulose fibers. So I'm actually asking specifically as a laxative. Some people are saying it's very convenient to carry around, you know, a bottle of prune juice and you can find in almost any store. You know, if you're traveling or something like that, and most of the sorbitol is not getting absorbed is from what I understand. So would there be a problem using that as a natural laxative remedy?

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the use of prune juice and sorbitol as a laxative.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, as long as it's having the effect of emptying your bowel, that means it's mostly not being absorbed. But if it doesn't work as a laxative, then it would tend to get pushed into your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the implications of sorbitol absorption.

**RAY PEAT:** None that I am aware of, but it's a definite possibility.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat comments on other fruits with potential laxative effects beyond fiber.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the main activity is an emollient-like substance that it also contains. Is that why it's red? Because it maybe contains emollient?

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the properties of rhubarb root.

**RAY PEAT:** Probably. I'm not sure what the main red pigment is, but it could be that the emollient is part of the color. The root which contains a lot of emollient-like chemical. I don't know what the color is.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat speculates on the source of rhubarb's red color.

**RAY PEAT:** Some people react badly to it, and I don't know whether it's the xylitol itself or impurities from its manufacturing origin.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses potential adverse reactions to xylitol.

**RAY PEAT:** Mixed amalized corn is my favorite safe starch or carbohydrate equivalent because the lime process or lime treatment degrades so many of the toxic factors.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat identifies masa harina (mixed amalized corn) as a preferred safe starch.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the uncooked or undercooked starch grains, persorption is one of the risks, and having it with fat decreases the ability of it to cross the lining of the intestine.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how fat can mitigate the risks associated with uncooked starch.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, especially if it's from sweet oranges.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms the safety of orange juice concentrate from sweet oranges.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Okay, so I've never seen that here in Mexico. Did you ever see it when you were here?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the availability of orange juice concentrate in Mexico.

**RAY PEAT:** No, there's many good oranges that would be silly.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat notes the abundance of good oranges in Mexico.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Maybe they think sour oranges are preferred by gringos. Or gringos are the only ones not smart enough to buy them.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat speculates on why sour oranges might be preferred by tourists.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm really glad you mentioned that. So the sour orange juice is higher in citric acid, and that is why it causes irritation? Is that why?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sour orange juice causes irritation due to its higher citric acid content.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Okay, and people say that we produce citric acid normally, but it's a compartment thing. It's very, very isolated, and in the wrong place, it has very bad effects. And I hate to be redundant, but maybe we can emphasize how critical that is, maybe especially for somebody with bad digestion, you know, I think people kind of laugh at that idea that it's that important, but some of those, some of the emails you know that I get that are like, oh my god, this changed my life are not drinking sour or tart orange juice. And so, maybe, I don't know, your thoughts on if that's important to emphasize or not.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat emphasizes the importance of avoiding sour orange juice, especially for those with digestive issues.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know, more study would bring out more dangers of eating it, but many of the medical calcium supplements were taken in the form of calcium citrate, and I think those were doing more harm than good even though they were getting extra calcium.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses concern about calcium citrate supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** Nope, I haven't heard anything about it.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat has no information on changes to the Mexican Coke recipe.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. The for years the corn syrup was made with a metal catalyst that was some of it was left in the syrup, and so people were being...

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the potential for heavy metal contamination in corn syrup.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the ones that have two or three acid groups, citric acid is the most effective chelator, but the double acid molecules can have a chelating action, succinic, for example. But acetic acid is toxic in its own right in excess.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the chelating properties of acids and the toxicity of acetic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I hadn't heard about that, but I've often seen people promoting it for one reason or another. It is a potentially disruptive, toxic, short-chain saturated fatty acid.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat comments on the promotion of succinic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the impression was very herbal, and that was decreased sometime in the late 40s, I think.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat recalls the herbal taste of early Coca-Cola.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I haven't tried any of the alternatives.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat has not tried alternative cola drinks.

**RAY PEAT:** Certain things you do need more. But the higher energy metabolism makes you need less if anything. For example, when your thyroid level is proper and your vitamin D, your cells are able to hang on to magnesium. So a low thyroid person, even supplementing large amounts of magnesium, they will quickly, in a week or so, become deficient in magnesium on a normal, average diet. But when your thyroid is up, your cells need very little replenishment of magnesium because it's stuck in the cells. But other things, the turnover of carbohydrate and protein, have to go up directly with your metabolic rate. And so liver, you know, a rundown of that is like the vitamin A, the selenium, the copper, the B vitamins, and then oysters is the zinc, the selenium, the copper, and together those foods fortify a person's nutrition, ameliorating possibly many different dietary deficiencies in two foods. Is that right?

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how higher metabolism affects nutrient needs, using magnesium as an example, and discusses the nutritional benefits of liver and oysters.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the idea basically is that it's too complicated to calculate in terms of individual things. It's very satisfying and sort of spectacular when you can bring someone out of a dying state with one nutritional supplement, but most of the time that can't be. You don't have that much luck, so the shotgun effect of eggs and liver and shellfish. It's very important to fill in what you don't know.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat advocates for a "shotgun approach" to nutrition with nutrient-dense foods.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's the low-fat content of the liver, especially the high-protein. It gives you strong signals and requires a lot of extra sugar and preferably some saturated fat to go with it to slow down the absorption and make the digestion happen without stress.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains why liver can be difficult to digest and how to mitigate this.

**RAY PEAT:** I just make sure to have lots of butter or other fat and sugar, ice cream, for example, after eating some liver. Otherwise, I've noticed it disturbs my sleep with hypoglycemia or something.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat shares his method for consuming liver without negative side effects.

**RAY PEAT:** For copper and selenium, once a week is enough. And how much would you eat, like a dozen? Just probably two or three ounces once a week is enough for those.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat provides a guideline for consuming oysters for copper and selenium.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it wouldn't hurt to have a big bowl of them, but that's the minimal.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat clarifies that a larger portion of oysters is also acceptable.

**RAY PEAT:** No, considering that the iron content is also very high. You just have to take that into account.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat notes the high iron content in oysters.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what I'm eating the last two or three years.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms his use of Crown Prince oysters in olive oil.

**RAY PEAT:** I just open the can and crack and drain it thoroughly.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how he prepares canned oysters.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, just having it with cheese. Cheese and orange juice makes a really nice meal.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat shares a preferred way to eat oysters.

**RAY PEAT:** Out of the can, cold.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat eats oysters cold, directly from the can.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, salt and gelatin are both very helpful for good sleep.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat highlights the sleep-promoting properties of salt and gelatin.

**RAY PEAT:** No. You can adapt, you can adapt very well. When I worked in the woods, our cook was obsessed with the fact that sweating people needed extra salt because of what they lost, and so he put a heaping spoonful in our porridge every morning and then wouldn't give us our ham and eggs and pancakes if we didn't finish our porridge. That was, I found that I was, had so much salt in my sweat that it was crystallizing on my glasses, abjuring my vision and making my arm hairs crystalline and white. And that seemed, besides the awful taste, I decided over one weekend to tell him that my doctor had put me on a low salt diet. So after that, I was the only one who got good porridge in the morning. And immediately just over the weekend, I had been having to eat salt tablets in the afternoon. After pouring out such concentrated salt water, I would start feigning if I didn't eat salt tablets. And just over the weekend, I didn't need salt tablets in the afternoon. And my sweat was like distilled water.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat recounts an experience with excessive salt intake and its effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, for sure. A tiny amount brings up your anxiety and inflammation. So salt is definitely anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory. And a population in Mongolia, for example, the people don't have any problem with hypertension, and they eat an average of about 30 grams of salt per day.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory properties of salt and its consumption in Mongolia.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I always get at least 2500 and sometimes 5000 of calcium. So like three quarts of milk, milk. Right. They often get more than that. That'd be what, a gallon of milk and then some cheese as well.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat states his high calcium intake.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it works with sodium to do that.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how sodium and calcium work together to activate uncoupling mitochondrial proteins.

**RAY PEAT:** I used to call it super sodium from some of its effects that the body senses a smaller amount of that as a larger amount of sodium, but its effects on serotonin, I think, are a drawback to having much of it in your diet.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses lithium's effects and potential drawbacks.

**RAY PEAT:** It's effect, I think, partly from affecting the retention of it in platelets.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains lithium's mechanism of action on serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what has been studied most, calcium in the diet tending to offset the effect of phosphate and magnesium. It has very parallel effects. I think the combination of a moderate amount of magnesium with calcium, assuming your thyroid is responding properly, is the most effective.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the interplay of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate in relation to parathyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and you lose it. Whatever gets into your cells stays there a very short time and is lost quickly.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the poor retention of magnesium in hypothyroid individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and to some extent, calcium goes out as your stress hormones go up. So some people have reported, especially you know on various online places, that their blood calcium is at their at the upper end of the normal range or slightly above, and their doctor is basically telling them, oh, it's nothing. We don't know what's causing it. If it's too high, the doctor starts worrying that it's that it's some kind of a tumor. But if it's like slightly elevated, the doctor says, I don't know what's causing it, but I wouldn't worry about it.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses elevated blood calcium levels and medical interpretations.

**RAY PEAT:** That you should worry about it, and you should worry about it because it's probably decreasing in your bones and increasing in your brain and arteries.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat advises concern regarding slightly elevated blood calcium.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and prolactin probably too, right?

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat includes prolactin in the list of hormones that can affect calcium levels.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but the basic thing is the failure of energy or the shift from oxidative to glycolytic energy, and that predisposes you to all of the cytokine problems. And those are just messengers, like the TNF alpha and the NFKB, what is it called? Nuclear factor kappa B.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how energy metabolism failure leads to cytokine issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're like an amplifying system. It's saying that the cells are in a bad state.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat describes cytokines as signaling molecules indicating cellular distress.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm still still working on the adaptation based on cell learning, epigenetics as learning, not as a euphemism for non-genetic. But epigenetics is a continuous process of learning and adaptation, and following that, I think it's going to be how the estrogen system works, especially in breast and prostate cancer, and so what can be done to intervene in those deteriorating inflammatory estrogenic processes.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses his current research on epigenetics, cell learning, and estrogen's role in cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** The progesterone is inducing the lactase enzyme. Is that right?

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if progesterone induces the lactase enzyme.

**RAY PEAT:** It does what? It's inducing the lactase among other things. Yeah, like thyroid, it helps to bring up the digestive enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms that progesterone, like thyroid, helps induce digestive enzymes.
