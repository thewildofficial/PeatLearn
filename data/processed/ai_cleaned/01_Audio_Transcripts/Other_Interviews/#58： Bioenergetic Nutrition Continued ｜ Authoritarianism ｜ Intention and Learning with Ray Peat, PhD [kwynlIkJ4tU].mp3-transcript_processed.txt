**RAY PEAT:** Nutrition is as complex and open and undefined as metaphysics or cosmology or anything. It's a process of exploring and learning and figuring things out, and so it's never a closed book, never a finished subject.

**CONTEXT:** What is the problem with authoritarianism in nutrition?

**RAY PEAT:** Everything is always changing and always individual and always changed by context. And so what's true for one person today, where they are, will necessarily be somewhat different when they're in a different place doing different things. It's always looking at your problems immediately in your context, and to understand those, it helps to look at your history, how you got to where you are and what you want to do to get beyond the present. So all the dimensions have to be flexible and so your digestive system reflects the things you've done in the past. Your whole being is taking form, assimilating things you've experienced and intend to experience. So you have to think of yourself as an inventive participant in everything, including your choices of foods.

**CONTEXT:** If someone is writing you an email and saying, "Hey Ray, I have a low pulse rate, a low temperature, a high cholesterol, constipation," is that what makes the suggestions in context with what the person is explaining?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of those things point to hypometabolism, low thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** And then, if you're saying something like, protein, carbohydrate, calcium, etc., you're giving those facts to that person, and then it's up to them, like we talked about last time, the creative act of conversation, and then that person assimilating the info and trying to extract something out of it that means something to them and their life.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because their digestive system is going to have its unique oddities. It might turn out that the high protein diet that would quickly cure someone if they already have a sensitivity to serotonin and tryptophan, for example, that they might have to work into that very carefully with a diet emphasizing more gelatin than the highest quality proteins.

**CONTEXT:** And then when somebody says, emails you and says, "I'm doing the Ray Peat diet," what, what do you think of that?

**RAY PEAT:** First, ask them what they're eating.

**CONTEXT:** So, just to be completely honest here, so I told you that I don't like that term. And I used to edit it out of podcasts, but it has gained a lot of traction. But you think even using that term, it's probably kind of, to really reduce your work into silly territory, saying something like "Ray Peat diet"?

**RAY PEAT:** Pretty much. From what I hear, people on the "Ray Peat diets" at least usually exclude eating a lot of bread and green salads and beans, but those are, I think, a few of the things that people generally realize can be harmful.

**CONTEXT:** Maybe you could critique my approach, but I feel like when I chat with a lot of people, there's always diet stuff. But it almost seems like if they're talking to me, it's like past the point of no return with dietary intervention. Is that a bad orientation to have? Because usually they'll have labs as well, and I think the person will generally be kind of at the end of the road. They'll have tried veganism or low carb or carnivore, etc., etc., etc. And I'm almost inclined to suggest the vitamin D, to read hypothyroidism, to unsuspected illness, to get into thyroid and stuff because, and of course, doing the dietary interventions. But I don't know, could you say after 20 or 25 that a person is like, I mean, I'm sure you could say earlier, but that it's very hard to get the metabolic rate going just with food alone?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, almost everyone benefits from adding a little bit of thyroid. The human diet historically, probably always included some supplemental animal thyroid, whether it came from a chicken stew or a fish soup or sausages or even blood. There was always some supplement coming from their food. Since 1940, that has been legally banned from the American food supply, and pretty much other industrialized countries imitated the U.S., requiring slaughterhouses to take out the thyroid glands, and people generally just don't eat the blood. It's sort of a taboo. Well, countries that save the blood and make tacos out of it or something are getting a little bit of extra hormones of various types.

**CONTEXT:** Something I've noticed, and I don't know if you feel the same, but there's something about thyroid that a lot of people don't feel comfortable with. Like they'll take progesterone or DHEA or pregnenolone, or they'll even be taking other supplements like ashwagandha or rhodiola or just, you name it, but thyroid is like a lot, a crossing the line to a lot of people.

**RAY PEAT:** Is there... I think the drug companies and the doctors that have been educated under their influence are responsible for that. The same thing that caused the agriculture department to order slaughterhouses to remove it from the food supply. Broder Barnes tells some of the stories, for example, in the 1930s. He observed that thyroid deficiency, among other things, caused an extremely high rate of heart attacks and circulatory disease. Infectious diseases, circulatory diseases, and cancer were the main killers of the hypothyroid population. But when he started popularizing that, there was a reaction. And JAMA published a story about a doctor who had given a patient who had just suffered a massive heart attack a supplement of, I think, two grains of Armour thyroid, starting right off on a full standard dose rather than working into it over a period of weeks, and the patient died. And so that created the propaganda that natural thyroid could kill you with a heart attack. That sort of thing was amplified when the Synthroid, I think, was the first one on the market with a synthetic thyroxine product. I was in junior high around that time, and there were several fat kids, and most of the kids already at that time were seeing doctors regularly, and almost simultaneously two or three of my fat friends said that they didn't have a hormone problem, they were just gluttons. That had been taught to the doctors who taught it to their overweight patients, and that went with doctors ordering their patients to stop taking thyroid, if an old empirical doctor had recognized it. People with chronic infections or obesity or any of the 30 or so classical symptoms of hypothyroid, if people had been doing well taking Armour thyroid, they went to the modern update. The well-trained doctors told them to stop taking it because it was dangerous.

**CONTEXT:** As I say, in obesity, is part of the look of obesity just that accumulation of mucopolysaccharides?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, usually it is. It's a mixture of Cushing's symptoms, high stress hormones of various sorts, and they can go in the direction of high estrogen or high serotonin or high histamine, high cortisol, high aldosterone, an imbalance of the androgens, many different hormonal directions, just because your thyroid is not giving you the energy to contextualize your physiology, to round everything off.

**CONTEXT:** I'm searching for it right now, I'm sure I will not be able to find it. But I feel like one of the most important things you've ever said that really helped me clarify my extremely blurry picture of physiology is, you said when your thyroid is low, your pituitary doesn't have much to do and your ovaries don't have much to do either, and all the glands in your body have an easy job when your thyroid is high. And so I appreciated that so much because if you listen to other people in the health world, it's like so ridiculously complicated to figure out like, okay, where does LH and growth hormone and prolactin and FSH? Like it's it's it's it's like incomprehensible without a model like that you put together of the energy stress when the energy is low, the activation of the stress systems happens.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's helpful to have in mind a mental image of a libertarian world or an anarchist society in which everyone knows what to do and how to take care of themselves. That's when energy is abundant and your thyroid is good. And when the well-distributed energy availability isn't there, then you have to look to be pushed to do what you're supposed to be doing. And that's where the thyroid, the pituitary comes in. The pituitary is roused in proportion to how everything is failing. And so it pushes you this way and that way to make up for what you should be doing it just on the basis of your cellular needs and cellular knowledge.

**CONTEXT:** And good old W.D. Denkla, I mean, you weren't kidding. I feel like you've integrated his work so well. Like all the papers were perfectly in sync with what you were saying. I was really shocked when I got a hold of a couple of them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's funny how he just disappeared from the world of knowledge. He was sent to the backwoods, maybe?

**CONTEXT:** What was it, Dave McCarron? The calcium hypertension dude?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** So, I think people shouldn't eat things that damage them and should eat things that taste good and that provide the essential nutrients while making them feel good and function well. Is that a diet? And so is there anything left to speak about that in such an authoritarian nutrition world? Even your stupid apprentice is kind of misinterpreting things as well, and so any room to clarify?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm okay with that as a statement that what tastes good is very important. Your impulses, your needs are very often are responsible for what you're eating. But if you're supplied with something not quite like what you need, then you might, your taste might cause you to do something like overeating on sugar or salt, where your cravings are biologically logical, but if the way you are led to satisfy your cravings is abnormal, then your body might be tricked into malfunctioning, even though it's following its impulses. When your thyroid function is low, your blood sugar becomes unstable. And so you tend to crave sweets and alternatively salt, which helps you to use the glucose efficiently. But if you're mixed foods that would supply those needs, if they're very distorted, then you might not correct the problem by following your instincts, so you have to use your other perceptions and thought processes to figure out just what it is your body is telling you to do.

**CONTEXT:** What was that H.G. Wells quote? It's like, nature never appeals to intellect unless intuition fails, or something else fails?

**RAY PEAT:** Your instincts. Instincts fail.

**CONTEXT:** Could somebody be in such a bad place that their orienting reflex and intuition is just so jaded and blurry that, for lack of a better word, or suggesting something to them, would that still be kind of a bad situation? How would you approach something like that?

**RAY PEAT:** Immersed in the forces of their authoritarian surroundings, the culture that they have integrated is telling them to do certain things, like go to the doctor if you feel sick, and if your body doesn't play a role in those cultural instructions, then you'll go to the doctor, go to your job, maybe go to church, do whatever the culture prescribes, and ignore what your body is telling you. But anyone can start to listen to themselves, and when they are mentally hearing instructions, a conscience telling them what they should be doing, if they listen carefully, they'll be able to detect the source of where that instruction is coming from. And the guru, I don't know what he was officially called, but George Gurdjieff... his basic principle was, remember yourself, and that really meant looking at what your body impulses are doing, and put that into conjunction with what your environment is ordering you to do, and like you call up an image of who is speaking the instructions to you, and then check how that image and set of instructions goes with your heart plexus and your solar plexus, and check out what it does to your body, and usually you feel a shrinking, oppressed feeling in your body when you hear those conscience voices speaking to you.

**CONTEXT:** I feel the opposite when I eat a cherimoya. You said G.I. Gurdjieff, right? Is that the guru? He has a quote, "Without self-knowledge, without understanding the working and functions of his machine, man cannot be free, and he cannot govern himself, and he will always remain a slave." That sounds pretty solid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what the cosmic clock... Michel Gouclin.

**CONTEXT:** Where does that idea go off the rails, though? I'm so stupid. What's the thing that people read? They're horoscopes. Is there some point at which it becomes total nonsense?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but that's just a literary genre. It can be interesting, but it's just a person creating a cultural artifact that, to some extent, recognizes that we are in the cosmos together.

**CONTEXT:** Well, here's a question. If you were going to spend your life with somebody, would the month that they were born in matter to you?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know. I think the clash of frequencies might make it more interesting than too much harmony of frequencies.

**CONTEXT:** So there's an optimal antagonism, so to speak, contrarianism that a lifetime partner should provide, otherwise it becomes boring if they're too harmonized?

**RAY PEAT:** That is sort of my impression that you want to be able to go off independently and come back and keep renewing others with your odd and idiosyncratic learnings.

**CONTEXT:** The Chinese have a proverb that love is not so much gazing harmoniously into each other's eyes but it's about two people looking together in a similar direction.

**RAY PEAT:** I thought I had said that.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, then it's a resonance, I guess, for across across time, like somebody may have plagiarized it off of your website and then presented as a Taoist saying from like the 6th century or something.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, well, let's how about this? How about we talk about progesterone and then we'll get into some questions because we have some really excellent questions, I think.

**CONTEXT:** I have one more question to the collective consciousness and Rupert Sheldrake. I don't know if you saw he did a famous experiment with another person who was a contrarian and said it's impossible to have a collective learning experience and extracting collective knowledge from the ether and then they did these experiments with, I think, with chicks, like they were training them and then like each successive generation of little chicks was able to learn faster and faster a new task. So is there anything special that's required in order to be able to tune in into that collective consciousness and knowledge, like a fast metabolism, or are things that interfere with that process? In other words, making you more and more isolated from the collective consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think everything metabolic and neurological affects it. Do you know who Andrea Pujaric was? Henry or Andrea was his first name, but Pujaric wrote a couple of books exploring what it is that opens the consciousness to remote viewing, for example. He got the Pentagon involved and interested in it. He was seeing it in terms of a balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic system in the context that I think Michael Persinger comes the closest to explaining how these nervous system balances could be operating. I saw when people were asleep or extremely relaxed. He imagined that their nervous system is able to sort of extend its feelers out without regard to distance, for example, tuning into the Earth's resonance. But during anxiety, there's a contraction and everything tends to fall towards the anxious center. And so, if a person is in the sleep or relaxed parasympathetic state, their feelers are out and if someone related to them is in a crisis, anxiety state of adrenergic dominance, the relaxed feelers will be drawn to tune in and focus on that center of crisis or anxiety or despair. And I think that might be where Michael Persinger took up his basic orientation of Adria Pujaric was writing in the 50s and 60s.

**CONTEXT:** So, do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people have been vicious in contacts with people that were they've been dead for a long time basically, they're like completely materializing that a portion of the collective consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's important not to rule out anything that not to assume limits to awareness that aren't based on some kind of real evidence. So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from it.

**CONTEXT:** And Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the Earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain to brain by way of the Earth's resonant chamber.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

**CONTEXT:** Ray, you're always extremely, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time and that, but in the cosmic clocks book, like if something, if he's right, and the seasons are imbuing people with kind of essence or something, isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things. The absolute meaning of a certain frequency of vibratory energy. Each thing has its intrinsic qualities. Every substance has its unique identity. And so the surroundings are part of your identity at any moment. The de-abstraction of consciousness means that our being in its concreteness takes into account and assimilates everything around us, including the state of the sun and the planets and the earth and other people in that system.

**CONTEXT:** So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration, is that right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means, but that's a lot.

**CONTEXT:** You think that may explain part of astrology?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what the cosmic clock... Michel Gouclin.

**CONTEXT:** So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration, is that right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means, but that's a lot.

**CONTEXT:** You think that may explain part of astrology?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what the cosmic clock... Michel Gouclin.

**CONTEXT:** So, do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people have been vicious in contacts with people that were they've been dead for a long time basically, they're like completely materializing that a portion of the collective consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's important not to rule out anything that not to assume limits to awareness that aren't based on some kind of real evidence. So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from it.

**CONTEXT:** And Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the Earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain to brain by way of the Earth's resonant chamber.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

**CONTEXT:** Ray, you're always extremely, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time and that, but in the cosmic clocks book, like if something, if he's right, and the seasons are imbuing people with kind of essence or something, isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things. The absolute meaning of a certain frequency of vibratory energy. Each thing has its intrinsic qualities.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means, but that's a lot.

**CONTEXT:** You think that may explain part of astrology?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what the cosmic clock... Michel Gouclin.

**CONTEXT:** So, do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people have been vicious in contacts with people that were they've been dead for a long time basically, they're like completely materializing that a portion of the collective consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's important not to rule out anything that not to assume limits to awareness that aren't based on some kind of real evidence. So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from it.

**CONTEXT:** And Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the Earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain to brain by way of the Earth's resonant chamber.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

**CONTEXT:** Ray, you're always extremely, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time and that, but in the cosmic clocks book, like if something, if he's right, and the seasons are imbuing people with kind of essence or something, isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things. The absolute meaning of a certain frequency of vibratory energy. Each thing has its intrinsic qualities.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what the cosmic clock... Michel Gouclin.

**CONTEXT:** So, do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people have been vicious in contacts with people that were they've been dead for a long time basically, they're like completely materializing that a portion of the collective consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's important not to rule out anything that not to assume limits to awareness that aren't based on some kind of real evidence. So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from it.

**CONTEXT:** And Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the Earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain to brain by way of the Earth's resonant chamber.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

**CONTEXT:** Ray, you're always extremely, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time and that, but in the cosmic clocks book, like if something, if he's right, and the seasons are imbuing people with kind of essence or something, isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things. The absolute meaning of a certain frequency of vibratory energy. Each thing has its intrinsic qualities. Every substance has its unique identity. And so the surroundings are part of your identity at any moment. The de-abstraction of consciousness means that our being in its concreteness takes into account and assimilates everything around us, including the state of the sun and the planets and the earth and other people in that system.

**CONTEXT:** So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration, is that right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means, but that's a lot.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's important not to rule out anything that not to assume limits to awareness that aren't based on some kind of real evidence. So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from it.

**CONTEXT:** And Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the Earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain to brain by way of the Earth's resonant chamber.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

**CONTEXT:** Ray, you're always extremely, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time and that, but in the cosmic clocks book, like if something, if he's right, and the seasons are imbuing people with kind of essence or something, isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things. The absolute meaning of a certain frequency of vibratory energy. Each thing has its intrinsic qualities. Every substance has its unique identity. And so the surroundings are part of your identity at any moment. The de-abstraction of consciousness means that our being in its concreteness takes into account and assimilates everything around us, including the state of the sun and the planets and the earth and other people in that system.

**CONTEXT:** So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration, is that right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means, but that's a lot.

**CONTEXT:** You think that may explain part of astrology?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what the cosmic clock... Michel Gouclin.
