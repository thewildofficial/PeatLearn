**RAY PEAT:** "It is a much stronger androgen than testosterone."
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the steroid Trestosterone/MENT, the question is posed whether androgen receptor agonism is a likely explanation for its effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it just sends it off on unknown pathways. The liver never had to deal with such things, and so I think it's extremely unpredictable and dangerous."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat clarifies the risks associated with adding a methyl group to a steroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "I always assume, I guess I'm just asking you and then Georgie can chime in at any point. Pretty much what I do anyway, assume the intestine is my contact with the world and I have to protect it and so I don't want to offend it in any way. And Crohn's disease is a seriously offended intestine."
**CONTEXT:** When asked about a protocol for Crohn's disease, Ray Peat emphasizes protecting the intestine from offense.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, starting as a baby it was migraines which recurred. Every time I would do certain things wrong, up until my mid-40s, I would still, the last one, for example, was when I was visiting in San Francisco and didn't realize that they had fluoridated water and I would occasionally drink some of that water and I was taking Xenoplus or Xenomel. Orally, and within two or three days I had a tremendous migraine and that started me thinking about it and fluoride can totally wipe out the activity of T3 if it happens to be present in your stomach and the T3 is exposed to it."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat shares his personal experience with migraines, linking them to fluoridated water and its interference with T3.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but the inflammation and poor digestion are set up to conditions. For such things to accumulate and multiply. You can find a mycoplasm in just about any sick person. It's sort of opportunistic and looks for a sort of place to live."
**CONTEXT:** In response to a question about mycobacteria causing Crohn's disease, Ray Peat explains that inflammation and poor digestion create conditions for opportunistic organisms.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, just taking a series of penicillin doses. Or eating raw carrots, for example, can have very similar effects and in both rats and people, it turns out that anything that cleans up your intestine will lower your cortisol and estrogen and increase your progesterone, just because the intestine is such a chronic drain and source of stress."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses how cleaning up the intestine, through methods like penicillin or raw carrots, can lower cortisol and estrogen while increasing progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "It would be interesting. They used to sell basically a cellulose tablet for weight loss. I never tried one, but it seemed like a good idea because cellulose doesn't have the estrogen promoting symptoms. A lot of other fibers to."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat comments on the potential benefits of pure cellulose for weight loss, noting its lack of estrogen-promoting symptoms compared to other fibers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone and Pregnenolone are the best ones I know of. But working at the pituitary level, a lot of things, sugar, aspirin, probably sodium, anything that stabilizes your blood sugar and metabolism, reduces inflammation, will... defend you against cortisol."
**CONTEXT:** When asked about cortisol blockers for weight loss, Ray Peat identifies progesterone and pregnenolone as effective, along with stabilizing blood sugar and reducing inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so. Did you ever read Carl Pfeiffer's books? I think he caused himself to lose pigment by being so obsessive about keeping copper down. But he was very concentrated on the risk of too much copper, probably having seen some people with a seruloplasm deficiency."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the potential risks of high copper intake, referencing Carl Pfeiffer's work and the role of ceruloplasmin.

**RAY PEAT:** "I'm afraid there is quite a bit of overlap, and the initial, as soon as nitric oxide was discovered to be produced in the body, they were seeing its involvement in everything degenerative and harmful. So, then, when... the Viagra came on the market, suddenly, for about five or six years, everything published was how great nitric oxide is that prevents hypertension and protective against everything. Thousands of articles came out suddenly reversing it from a dangerous free radical to a cure-all. And then, about ten or fifteen years ago, there was a gradual... return to sanity and realizing that it's one of very central things to degeneration, aging, the follow-up of trauma, estrogen interactions. Everything stress-related and degeneration-related involves the pro-inflammatory effect of ethanol."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the shift in understanding nitric oxide, from being seen as harmful to beneficial and back to its association with degeneration and stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, when I had a good supply, I was taking it every day very consistently, but sometimes I forget to take it when it isn't in a convenient form, like some of it is powdered so fine it's choking when you try to take it just on your tongue."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms the safety of daily aspirin use, provided it's in a convenient form.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think you can get a safer inhibition of aromatase using aspirin, progesterone, are completely safe things. Thyroid is very important, but just with aspirin, progesterone, and thyroid, you can get your ratio back, testosterone, pregnenolone, up, and estrogen down, and supplementing pregnenolone and thyroxine, historically, was very effective. Correcting infertility and enlivening inactive sperms."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests aspirin, progesterone, and thyroid as safer alternatives for aromatase inhibition, effective for correcting infertility.

**RAY PEAT:** "Prophylaxis suggests you would be taking some every day for an indefinite time until you didn't get the infection. The normal use of it is a very short course and about one person in the thousands in the studies of using it to treat parasites will show signs of brain damage. I don't think it's a good idea to take maybe thousands of daily doses even of a moderate amount of something. once in a while is known to cause brain damage."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses caution regarding the daily use of ivermectin for prophylaxis, citing potential brain damage from prolonged use.

**RAY PEAT:** "Instead of hydroxychloroquine, you can try plain old quinine. My personal favorite, hydroxychloroquine is just the patented more liver toxic version of quinine. Neuroengineering, also a few good studies. So drinking orange juice should have similar effect than taking the isolated version. And aspirin, vitamin C and vitamin D. I mean, all of these of these now have quite a few studies behind them, unfortunately everything is being censored by mainstream media so you have to go to PubMed to find them but I wouldn't say Ivermectin would be one of the last things I would try considering all the other safer alternatives that are out there."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests quinine, neuroengineering, orange juice, aspirin, vitamin C, and vitamin D as safer alternatives to hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Cyproheptadiene, famotidiene which is an acid blocker but apparently is also potent anti-serotonin agent as well. Really I don't know where the Ivermectin craze is coming from, maybe that's the only thing that hit the mainstream news, but uh... uh... tons of other chemicals safer and cheaper and available over-the-counter that can do just as well if not better than ivermectin with fewer side effects. And vitamin D is very effective."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat highlights cyproheptadiene and famotidine as safer and potentially more effective alternatives to ivermectin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Very important to get to TSH down. The TSH at that level itself is causing symptoms, pro-inflammatory symptoms, and it's going to disturb her puberty development, all kinds of development. The history of that bizarre attitude towards TSH, I don't know if you've heard of it, but I think it's on my website, 50 Years of Fraud, this part of the title, that there's just no scientific basis for relying on TSH, especially at such very high levels as ________."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat emphasizes the importance of lowering TSH in children with hypothyroidism, criticizing the reliance on TSH as a sole diagnostic marker.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, not at all. Sometimes it has to start at a very young age, but it's increasingly important around seven or eight or nine when ________. The first signs of puberty are coming on because the estrogen is going to slow down the thyroid function."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat states that it is not unusual to consider thyroid supplementation for children, especially as puberty approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, very low thyroid people will have, especially during the night, high cortisol and adrenaline usually. You should check your pulse at the same time when you wake up, along with the temperature. And then after having breakfast with, for example, a lot of orange juice, the stress hormones are going to. Be decreased when you get your glucose level up so the adrenaline goes down the cortisol will go down both of those have kept your temperature kept up by the both of them and pulse rate kept up by high adrenaline during the night and so by which of those changes the most you can tell. What might night stress was responsible for them and when you get your thyroid gradually improving your carbon dioxide production and stabilizing your glycogen stores and your nocturnal stress goes down and so you're revealing the hypothyroid condition that was hidden under the stress hormones."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that a dip in waking temperature when starting thyroid medication can indicate a reduction in stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, revealing an underlying hypothyroid state.

**RAY PEAT:** "During daytime testing, people who were very hypothyroid, such as a 5 or 6 on the TSH level, have been very hyper and normal-seeming, not fat or edematous or sluggish or anything. But they were found to have 30 to 40 times the daily output of adrenaline making up for the low thyroid production. So it's pretty common to have extreme slowdown when you start on your thyroid. That's why it's so important to keep a chart marked off. For at least two or three weeks, showing your temperature and pulse rate both on the same chart so that you can draw a line where it should, with an ideal starting dose of thyroid, you should see the lines rising steadily towards the goal of pulse rate and temperature at the end of two or three weeks. But if at first you see the numbers going down, that's the evidence that you're getting out of the stress."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat elaborates on how individuals with severe hypothyroidism might appear hyper due to adrenaline, and how starting thyroid treatment can initially reveal the underlying hypothyroid state.

**RAY PEAT:** "The purpose of any vaccine is to create a systemic inflammation, and in general, that weakens your overall immune system. Even though it pumps up your specific antibodies, the general inflammation is a weakness, at least during the time you're having symptoms, and unfortunately, sometimes for a much longer time, such as the year after people had an influenza vaccination, their rate of... Coronavirus infection was greatly increased, 50 or 60% more likely to get infected by a different virus because they were protected against influenza virus. So the idea, the officials actually say stupid things like, get vaccinated, it'll make you healthy."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that vaccines create systemic inflammation, weakening overall immunity and increasing susceptibility to other infections.

**RAY PEAT:** "They also mentioned influenza and corona, but I think this applies to any virus, right? If you shift the immune response, protecting from only one virus, you're exposing yourself, becoming more compromisable to all the other viruses."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms that the principle of shifting immune response to protect against one virus, thereby increasing vulnerability to others, applies to any virus.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the whole doctrine, going back to Ehrlich's time, it's a drug-industry-centered virus. The theory of what immunity amounts to, Paul Ehrlich was selling his patent drugs and he shared the Nobel Prize with Metzhnikov, who was an embryologist, who saw immunity as the whole organism maintaining itself, a total......inclusive concept of what immunity or resistance is, where Ehrlich proposed a theory that was ideal for selling magic bullet drugs. The concept of magic bullet was converted to the antibody theory of immunity that your B-cells produced a specific... immunity. So logically if you don't have a specific drug for every conceivable disease then you're going to need a vaccine for every existing or possible disease, because the antibody theory of immunity is really just a... a silver bullet, one drug to sell for one disease."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat critiques the "antibody theory of immunity" as a drug-industry-driven concept that necessitates vaccines for every disease, contrasting it with Metzhnikov's holistic view of immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Even with natural testosterone, I think people are generally getting overdosed. It's a very healthy... A very young man might produce four or five milligrams of testosterone per day. And so one or two milligrams, well assimilated, should give you a tremendous boost of virility and muscle strength. And with DHEA, the teenage production is 12 to 15 milligrams. It goes steadily down with aging, similar to testosterone, but by the time a person is 30 or 40, 5 milligrams will still bring them up to a normal level of DHEA. And the other is that the overdose is. Apparently, the desired state."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that natural testosterone production is much lower than commonly assumed, and that overdosing is a prevalent issue.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, a younger, a young virile man will produce 45 milligrams of testosterone, but they also clear estrogen much more effectively than an older person. So their testosterone to estrogen ratio or testosterone to cortisol ratio is pretty high. An older person basically tends to be overloaded with both estrogen and cortisol. while having their testosterone levels drop. So the four to five milligrams, yes, they will potentially bring up the testosterone levels up to the levels of a young virile man, but they won't necessarily fix the issue with the high estrogen and high cortisol. So that person may not be necessarily feeling the same, you know, anabolic or mood boosting or whatnot effects that a younger person would get from such a dosage simply because their stress hormones are too high. And I think that may be why older people and bodybuilders in general, they're overdosing these steroids, simply because they're not addressing the thyroid angle, and they're trying to shut down their stress hormones by simply over flooding them and overcrowding them with these androgens. That may be one reason why they're using such high doses."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains why older individuals might not experience the same benefits from testosterone supplementation as younger men, due to higher estrogen and cortisol levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "For several reasons, a thyroid is our basic anabolic hormone. It directly activates protein synthesis, lowers cortisol and the breakdown of protein, and inhibits the effect of cortisol and inflammatory things on aromatase. So it's an aromatase and cortisol antagonist. So basically an thyroid. An anabolic approach with steroids should always take into account thyroid, right? Or at least some other option of blocking cortisol in a safe manner."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat highlights thyroid as a fundamental anabolic hormone that lowers cortisol, inhibits protein breakdown, and acts as an antagonist to aromatase and cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, as the basic anabolic substance, the muscles, if they're under stress or idle, and forced idleness will cause the muscle to actually produce and secrete cortisol and estrogen. And when they're properly activated with thyroid and activity, they will be a source of testosterone and a sink for cortisol."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that muscles, when properly activated with thyroid and activity, can become a source of testosterone and a sink for cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** "People who are using that CPAP are almost always hypothyroid and low in progesterone. For many years, they've been curing sleep apnea with procyroid things and progesterone. Progesterone lowers the stress hormones, improves the depth of sleep, and maintains regular breathing and prevents hyperventilation. That's what progesterone does. The real problem in sleep apnea is cyclic hyperventilation followed by cessation. When you go deficient in carbon dioxide, your breathing stops and you could even die from respiratory arrest if you are producing so little carbon dioxide. So, thyroid and progesterone directly correct the problem."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat states that hypothyroidism and low progesterone are common in CPAP users, and that thyroid and progesterone can effectively treat sleep apnea by lowering stress hormones and improving breathing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Acetazolamide has been used, I think, for 50 or 60 years to treat sleep apnea, and it indirectly raises your carbon dioxide level and keeps stimulating your breathing through the night."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat mentions acetazolamide as a drug used for sleep apnea that indirectly increases carbon dioxide levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "The doctors likely prescribe thyroxine, and in women, thyroxine fails to be activated properly because of estrogen interfering with liver function, which should account for about two thirds of your active thyroid function. For most women, thyroxine fails to be activated thyroxine being what doctors like to prescribe just isn't correcting the problem and so getting on real thyroid supplement is essential when you've had the gland removed."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that thyroxine is often ineffective in women due to estrogen interference with liver function, emphasizing the need for real thyroid supplements after gland removal.

**RAY PEAT:** "I haven't tried any armor in recent years, but I haven't heard any. I knew bad things about it for several years, they were going back and forth failing FDA tests and so on, but for several years now, I haven't heard bad things about it, so it's the only glandular right now that I would trust, but during the time that armor was being reformulated in the early 90s, I shifted to the synthetics. First, thyrolar formulated by armor to exactly imitate natural armor thyroid, and then Xenoplus, which exactly imitated the thyrolar formula and made by the same company that makes Xenomal or pure T3, and so those have been very reliable now for... at least 30 years."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses his trust in Armour Thyroid, noting a period of concern but current reliability, and mentions his shift to synthetic thyroid medications like Thyrolar and Xenoplus.

**RAY PEAT:** "The brain is a major source and goal of progesterone, and men have just as much in their brain or should as women, and it's involved in the cell division process all the way up to nerve and muscle function, every conceivable. Everything in higher animals depends on progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat emphasizes the crucial role of progesterone in brain function, cell division, and overall health in both men and women.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it has to do with cosmic entropy actually. That's why the whole energy concept of existence. It involves the stabilization process in all animate beings and you can trace those processes of increasing consciousness and brain development through the physics of the universe. It all has to do with... creating order, maintaining order, and it happens that milk and fruits are the simplest and most order-preserving way to integrate your life with the cosmos."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains his "cosmic diet" of milk and fruits as a way to integrate life with the cosmos through order-preserving processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "If it's quiescent, not inflamed or growing. No, it doesn't have the cancer metabolism. It's just a structural defect, but any inflammation according to the degree of the inflammation is going to start having the cancer metabolism."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat clarifies that a benign tumor, if quiescent, does not share the metabolism of a cancerous one, but inflammation can alter this.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the anti-fibrotic effect, I've seen examples of hundreds of times. I think the reason they stopped talking about that effect is that the mechanism involves interfering with estrogen's pro-fibrotic effect, activating nitric oxides and serotonin, that group of things, estrogen, nitric oxide, and serotonin, are all blocked by progesterone, and those are the pro-degenerative, pro-fibrotic substances."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that progesterone's anti-fibrotic effect stems from its ability to block estrogen, nitric oxide, and serotonin, which are pro-fibrotic and pro-degenerative.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just today, I got an email saying that his chest fat and anechomastia regressed thoroughly from taking quite a bit of progesterone, but I think it's essential to use vitamin D and thyroid and all of the anti-aromatase substances, including some aspirin."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat mentions a report of chest fat and gynecomastia regression with progesterone, emphasizing the importance of vitamin D, thyroid, and aspirin as anti-aromatase agents.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the spreading from the colonies across the continent, taking Western United States away from Britain. From Mexico and then following that up with war against Spain to take the Philippines and Cuba, the imperial mentality goes back right almost to the beginning. But the 20th century has been... standing imperialism with the banana republics being kept in line with sending battleships every year or so, they would threaten another country in the hemisphere. And there was a temporary let up with FDR's good neighbor policy. We're as good as we are at some point. It has just grown in its intensity, starting right at FDR's death. Policies were absolutely 180 degrees reversed where he had planned a post-war anti-imperialist policy. He had a conference with Wendell Willkie. They agreed that whichever party won after his term was up would follow the decolonization of the American anti-imperialist party. World policy, but it happens that Wilkie got a cold and died at a very young age and then just before Roosevelt could find out that Alan Dulles was committing treason and lying himself with the German intelligence, Galen system, to take over the world. Roosevelt died just before he could learn that fact, and so immediately with his death, the Dulles faction took over with a single-minded imperialism that had been followed steadily."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat traces the origins of American imperialism from its early expansionist policies to the post-WWII era, highlighting the influence of figures like Alan Dulles.

**RAY PEAT:** "Having blood tests would be very useful to see what your cortisol and estrogen, DHEA, progesterone and thyroid and testosterone are doing."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat advises blood tests to assess hormone levels (cortisol, estrogen, DHEA, progesterone, testosterone) for issues like erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I want to add to that that sometimes doctors will just test the testosterone, but several large human studies show that you can have erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems and fertility problems. Even in men with normal levels of testosterone and DHA, as long as either prolactin or estradiol are either elevated or in the top 25th percentile of the quote-unquote normal range, which we know it's not really normal."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat emphasizes that normal testosterone levels don't always preclude erectile dysfunction or fertility issues, pointing to prolactin and estradiol as potential culprits.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it should be higher than that unless there's some reason. If you have a really big heart, it can pump a lot of blood with a pulse as slow as 50, but ordinarily you aren't pumping enough blood to keep things going. And very good health if it's running that slow."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that a resting heart rate in the low 50s might indicate insufficient blood circulation for optimal health, unless there's a specific reason like a large heart.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so. Great stuff. Okay, Space99Yak says, Is the herb Boutia Superba root good for DHT? I've never heard of it. Any thoughts, George? I have to look it up. I mean, I don't know. I've heard of the herb, but I don't know. To what mechanism it would be good for DHT. I know nettle root is actually a drug in Germany, and they're using it to treat prostate problems. And they kept saying for years that, oh, it's because it lowers the androgens. And then it turned out it actually, it contains aromatase inhibitors and is raising DHT instead of lowering it."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses unfamiliarity with Boutia Superba root's effect on DHT and shares that nettle root, contrary to popular belief, contains aromatase inhibitors and raises DHT.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you get as much thyroid function as you need, the gland should adjust itself. Always responsive to signals such as adrenaline and TSH. You can shut the TSH down completely and then if you stop shutting it down with the large doses, it pops back very quickly. I've seen my own thyroid gland when I was taking 50 micrograms of T3 per day. I developed holes about as big as my index finger on each side of my Adam's apple between that and the muscles. So I stopped taking the T3 for just a day or two and immediately, within 24 hours, my neck had leveled out. The gland swells and shrinks according to nd, so a lot of doctors will talk about suppressing or damaging your thyroid gland by supplementing because they're reasoning from what happens to your adrenals or testicles if you overdose. One of the hormones, high cortisol or glucocorticoid use, can cause your adrenals to shrink to the point that if you suddenly stop the supplement, you might die from the absence of adrenal production. But the adrenals will gradually, over about a month, recover. If you are well-nourished after you've totally suppressed them with too much cortisol, a thyroid gland only takes a day or so to completely recover."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that the thyroid gland is responsive and can recover quickly from suppression, unlike adrenal glands, and that doctors' concerns about thyroid suppression are often based on misapplied reasoning from adrenal gland responses.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's supplying whatever function they were producing so they aren't needed. In the study of rats, they... measured their cortisol production and other hormones, and found a normal variation. Most of them were normal. A few were hyper producers of cortisol, but they gave them, I think, was 10 grams of injected stomach full of powdered pregnenolone. And then studied their hormones. There were no endocrine changes that they could detect except in those which had been under stress with high cortisol production. Their cortisol went down to normal receiving those gigantic doses of pregnenolone. So the person basically that's under a lot of stress, pregnenolone. It doesn't just have an anti-cortisol effect, but it also gives the adrenals what they need, gives the adrenals a break, I guess, for lack of a better word."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that pregnenolone, especially in high doses, can reduce cortisol production in stressed individuals by supplying the body's needs and giving the adrenals a break.

**RAY PEAT:** "The adrenals and gonads are potentially self-regulating. The pituitary is just there for an additional boost. And Hensley was experimenting with it. Removing adrenals, he found that after the tissue-stored steroids had dissipated, just a moderate amount of stress would kill the animals because they didn't have the adrenal resilience to meet the stress. But where the ordinary... rat would die from a little bit of a stressful situation, he noticed that the pregnant rats didn't even notice, had no ill effects from an increased adaptive stress. And so he experimented removing the adrenals and supplementing progesterone. They lived a normal lifespan with no adrenal hormones at all. Progesterone supplement totally replaced all of the adrenal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol in particular."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses how progesterone supplementation can fully replace adrenal hormones, allowing animals to survive without adrenal glands.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the same way that any anti-stress substance, progesterone or sugar or aspirin, for example, stop the exaggerated pituitary activity."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that pregnenolone, like progesterone, sugar, and aspirin, can reduce exaggerated pituitary activity by acting as an anti-stress substance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Generally, thyroid is the thing, but you have to check the whole nutritional pattern, not getting enough calcium and vitamin D. It interferes with your mitochondrial energy production, regardless of your thyroid status. So drinking milk, taking vitamin D, drinking orange juice, and maybe supplementing thyroid would be the usual thing to do."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat recommends thyroid, calcium, vitamin D, milk, and orange juice for restoring libido and energy in women.

**RAY PEAT:** "Carbon dioxide. Very important for stopping the stress and degenerative processes and vitamin D, calcium and thyroid and progesterone are part of their function is to normalize, optimize the balance between carbon dioxide and lactic acid."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat identifies carbon dioxide, vitamin D, calcium, thyroid, and progesterone as key for reversing aging and increasing healthspan by balancing carbon dioxide and lactic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "The inductive effect, wherever it's attracted to an electron-rich area, those electrons sort of bulge towards the Lewis acid that has an electron attracting effect. The bulging of those electrons by induction through the carbon chain reduces the electron availability two or three carbons down the line. So the whole electronic quality of the whole protein molecule is affected. A shift towards positivity or relative electron deficiency and when you're full of CO2, all of your proteins have that shift and the flavonoids from orange juice and milk and lots of fruits and vegetables, they can by partial oxidation. Like vitamin C inside the cell becomes oxidized and then becomes an electron recipient. The flavonoids become similar electron tractors and shift the whole structure of the cell into that relatively partial electron deficient state. And that affects, through the inductive effect, one protein has its influence on surrounding proteins. So the whole system is a cooperative electron slightly deficient condition, an acidic condition. In other words, the whole cell turns into an acid."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how carbon dioxide, through inductive effects, shifts the electronic quality of proteins, creating a state of relative electron deficiency and acidity within the cell.

**RAY PEAT:** "Indirect, shifting the whole system, activating the electron transport chain, turning off NADH. Lactic acid production, shifting the balances everywhere, towards reducing lactic acid and NADH and glutathione, shifting it towards the oxidized balance."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat clarifies that carbon dioxide's effect on NADH is indirect, involving the activation of the electron transport chain and shifting metabolic balances.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that seems to be why things like phycetan have an anti-aging effect. They turn off the inflammation and stress excess of electron production. And it isn't. One of the ways you have to think about it is that this isn't a static condition, it's a pressure of electrons flowing. They're electrons in motion between the energy source and the electron consuming cytochrome oxidase. So, if you think of the Venturi effect... in gas or water, the pressure goes down as the speed of flow increases. And so what thyroid and these substances, pro-oxidative substances, do is to accelerate the flow of electrons, decreasing the risk of random lipid peroxidation by escaped electrons, because... as the flow increases, the pressure, electronic pressure, decreases, so the whole cell becomes shifted away from electrons towards oxidation."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that substances like thyroid and phycocyanin accelerate electron flow, reducing the risk of lipid peroxidation and shifting the cell towards oxidation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's more than that. I think it can actually correct the inflammatory process and not have to kill the cells."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that phycocyanin may have a broader effect than just being a senolytic, potentially correcting inflammatory processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a lot of them have been tested, for example, for preventing or treating radiation sickness. They're the ultimate in electron excess disease, and they're very powerful in protecting against or curing radiation injury. So it sounds like a glass of orange juice and a little bit of vitamin B1 would be a great combination as an anti-aging agent. Yeah, probably every few minutes a glass of orange juice."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat notes that flavonoids, like those in orange juice, are effective in preventing and treating radiation sickness due to their electron-withdrawing properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "You're I don't know if that connection between ivermectin and and the ivermectin receptors by we said earlier that was a risky substance and so it's like combining two risky substances together basically... I think a safer method would be trying to raise the levels of the ace two enzyme because that's what the spike protein binds to if if i'm not mistaken and reasons yeah right that's the the medical establishment was got it exactly backward and the things that it increased the ace to substance and the one to seven and retention fragment which is the result of ace to action those are increasingly recognized as the therapeutic and curative agents and so everything that we know of as protective against COVID involves the increase of the 1 to 7 antitensin and the ACE2 enzyme that produces it."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that increasing ACE2 enzyme levels is a safer approach than using ivermectin, as ACE2 is the binding site for spike proteins and its related enzyme fragments are recognized as therapeutic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it's safe to use all the time. Profoundly."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat confirms the safety of progesterone for continuous use.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it actually has some anti. Viral or anti replication effects stabilizing the cell that makes the virus not have any any support for replicating."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat states that progesterone has antiviral effects by stabilizing cells and hindering viral replication.

**RAY PEAT:** "Depends on what the scar is like. If it's still inflamed, sort of like a. A slight keloid vitamin E and and progesterone applied to it can shut off the production of inflammatory things like estrogen and nitric oxide and restore the the tissue to more or less normal so it loses the inflamed appearance."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests applying vitamin E and progesterone to inflamed scars, like keloids, to reduce inflammation and restore normal tissue appearance.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's sometimes the problem. If you try to correct the problem in just a few days or a week, that can cause the gland to shrink so much that you get discomfort in your throat."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that rapid correction of thyroid issues can lead to throat discomfort due to gland shrinkage.

**RAY PEAT:** "With a meal, 10 micrograms is probably the maximum that you want. Otherwise, it shouldn't be over 5. micrograms at a time. The meal will spread it out quite a bit and make it a steadier supply."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat advises a maximum of 10 micrograms of T3 per meal, and no more than 5 micrograms at a time otherwise, to ensure a steadier supply.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think as it suggests, it's going to distribute itself. The amino acids that are more hydrophobic might get taken up in the chylomicrons."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that thyroid medication, when taken with fat, will distribute itself, with hydrophobic amino acids potentially being absorbed via chylomicrons.

**RAY PEAT:** "I would question the quality of the supplement used first, because their biological functions are just the opposite. I've seen horribly bulging veins normalize in an hour with a big dose of progesterone, and more slowly with a big dose of, or many big doses of, pregnenolone. I think someone who got bad products reported that and started people. Thinking about it and then if they don't get immediate improvement, they think they might be getting worse."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat attributes reports of varicose veins from progesterone/pregnenolone use to poor quality supplements, as these hormones should have the opposite effect.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the effect when you get enough is exactly the opposite. For example, a big vein known to be so bulging that it can't possibly have any valve action. With a very big dose of progesterone, the muscle can be activated to the point that the vein narrows and the flaps of valve on each side of the vein can then reach each other and close off the flow."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how sufficient progesterone can activate vein muscles, narrowing them and restoring valve function, thus reversing bulging veins.

**RAY PEAT:** "Depends on how high you're... estrogen is, if a person has very high estrogen that might take 400 milligrams of progesterone, but that amount would knock some people out."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat states that high estrogen levels might necessitate up to 400mg of progesterone, but this dosage can be sedating.

**RAY PEAT:** "There was a study showing eating a ton of French croissants which basically were baked with almost fully saturated fat but also of course a lot of starch in them led to a drastic weight loss and improvement in health. The sucrose itself, some experiments show that you can increase the metabolic rate by 20 percent just with sucrose. And so when you do it just right, sugar is a very powerful weight loss instrument."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat cites a study on French croissants and the metabolic effects of sucrose, suggesting sugar can be a powerful tool for weight loss when used correctly.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin E is known to be fairly effective at clearing up lipofuscin. Progesterone is effective and the amount of alcohol that can clear it up is very small. Something like a gram or two a day is enough to have a helpful effect on lipofuscin."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat identifies vitamin E and progesterone as effective for clearing lipofuscin, with even small amounts of alcohol having a beneficial effect.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pregnenolone and progesterone both help to protect the adrenal so they can regenerate. What I meant by that comment was that with aging, the layer that produces DHEA and pregnenolone tends to atrophy and the only one that remains is the cortisol producing one."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that pregnenolone and progesterone aid adrenal regeneration, and that with aging, the DHEA and pregnenolone-producing layers atrophy, leaving only the cortisol-producing layer.

**RAY PEAT:** "The checking, checking for anything pro-inflammatory in the diet would be a first step to see if inflammation was interfering with their function."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests checking the diet for pro-inflammatory factors as a first step when experiencing hypothyroid symptoms despite normal temperature and pulse.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the stress hormones generally rise when your thyroid is low and it takes quite a while when you're in under stress to, to adapt fully to the thyroid supplements. So, uh, Bruno Barnes, uh, uh, over his career, uh, learns that it was... uh, best to, uh, aim for three or four months, uh, for full, uh, correction with thyroid, uh, and people, uh, get so impatient, they, they think of, uh, uh, correcting an deficiency, uh, uh, as, uh, uh, sort of a, a matter of a day or two, but, uh, it really, uh, uh, uh, since the whole system, uh, has to evolve, uh, in a different direction, uh, under the... the better energy supply, uh, you should look at the time scale of, uh, something like three months."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat advises that it takes approximately three to four months for the body to fully adapt to thyroid supplements, as the entire system needs to adjust to improved energy supply.

**RAY PEAT:** "More and more kids are dying right after. Getting vaccinated, so I think more people are starting to think in terms of murder rather than coincidental deaths when they get sudden swelling of the heart that kills them. I sense the public is slowly starting to wake up."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat observes an increase in child deaths following vaccination, suggesting a growing public suspicion of foul play rather than coincidence.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they said that very openly and then the reaction from the press was such that they erased it from their website. Someone who mentioned the original statement that kids don't need the vaccination. His comment was censored as contrary to Facebook's policy. So, in effect, the World Health Organization was censored by Facebook."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the CDC's retraction of a statement about children not needing vaccination and the subsequent censorship of related comments.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everyone is fine with 80 or 100 percent of the people in the nursing home. And I write after getting vaccinated, but when a 13 year old kid dies suddenly three days after a second vaccination, people are starting to question authority."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat notes that public questioning of authority regarding vaccinations increases when young children die after vaccination, compared to deaths in nursing homes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and people should keep remembering that that there was, um, uh, uh, uh, sorry. Uh, was effectively wiped out, uh, by the surge in so-called COVID deaths, uh, uh, mean, meaning that the total pneumonia deaths, uh, didn't change."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat points out that reported COVID deaths did not significantly alter the overall pneumonia death rate, suggesting a potential misclassification.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's hard to imagine that person surviving a breakup of the computer industry and Facebook and Amazon. Uh, uh, uh, uh, that's such a, uh, uh, uh. Totalitarian system, uh, uh, I doubt that she's going to be able to accomplish anything. So basically the empire really depends on for his survival on, on the, on the big tech complex. So any attempt to support that will probably be met with brutality. I would guess so."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses skepticism about efforts to break up big tech companies, viewing them as integral to a totalitarian system that would resist such changes.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, not at all. It may be a blessing in disguise, you'll simply go back to pen and paper and calling people on the phone and meeting them in person? Yeah, sort of hoping that that will happen actually."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat believes that a disruption of the internet could be a blessing in disguise, leading to a return to more personal forms of communication.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. No? Interesting. Unless you define psychotic as contact or reality. There may be a withdrawal period, a period of like abstinence or something, but I also agree. I think people will quickly discover how much they've been duped and how much they don't want their internet connection back."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat dismisses the idea that people would go psychotic without the internet, suggesting they might instead realize how they've been misled and reject its return.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, just using it cyclically is the important thing so that your liver doesn't get in the habit of squeezing it too fast. So you have to lay off for one or two weeks every month and stay on cycle with it. I've mentioned before that. I met a gynecologist who was in the 70s and he had this very young looking wife. He said that I've been giving her a progesterone every month for 20 years and she's still menstruating at the age of 63. That's amazing."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that cyclical progesterone use, with a break of one to two weeks per month, is key to postponing menopause and maintaining menstruation.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's mostly what progesterone does. It's one of the important conversion products in the brain, a neuro steroid. And so everything we think of, progesterone doing to mood perception, stability, stopping seizures, helping with psychosis. It's really partly the effect of the allopregnenolone."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat states that allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid derived from progesterone, is responsible for many of progesterone's effects on mood, stability, and neurological function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Check his thyroid. It's responsible for both sebum and sweat production in the skin. If your thyroid is low, your skin. Almost invariably gets dry. You feel very good. You might feel panic and anxiety. To the extent that it's turning to lactic acid."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests checking thyroid function for excessively dry and cracked skin, as low thyroid can impair sebum and sweat production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it isn't good for your health. If you have to lose weight, keeping the minerals up is very important. Calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium are very protective against too much of the stress reaction."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat advises that while a very low-calorie diet (1000 calories) can lead to short-term weight loss, it's detrimental to health, emphasizing the importance of minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium for stress protection.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, carefully adjusting your thyroid and progesterone and DHEA, pregnenolone. Those can sustain a very high metabolic rate, increased body temperature so that you burn calories much faster. And Pyotr Bagnusky basically said, how to burn fat while eating the rape heat inspired diet, I gained 10 pounds and so it kind of intersects with what we were just talking about. What should be the focus if a person is gaining weight? Not to eat so many calories first and then to gradually shift towards a lower fat intake, whatever keeps your temperature up. Without having an excess of calories, then as your temperature stays higher, you'll be burning more calories and be able to eat more and more up to maybe 3,000 calories a day for a sedentary person without getting fat."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that adjusting thyroid, progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone can increase metabolic rate and body temperature, leading to faster calorie burning and potential weight loss without extreme calorie restriction. He also notes that focusing on maintaining temperature while managing calorie intake, and gradually shifting towards lower fat intake, is key.
