**RAY PEAT:** I've still been thinking about the topic for... the July newsletter. And it's going to be something related to iron and calcification of tissues, stress, and aging. And these are themes that I got involved with more than 50 years ago, but I see that... There are just little glimmers of change and interest in the culture that these are again timely topics.

**CONTEXT:** What is the focus of your upcoming newsletter?

**RAY PEAT:** I see that in I think was 20 years ago that newsletter was concentrating on the connective tissue response to estrogen and stress, a lot about the collagen surroundings of cells, which is one of the basic harms that stresses and estrogen activate and that people were really doing definitive research in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. And then that pretty much disappeared. Because it impinged on industrial profit motives, the food oil industry, the estrogen industry, and various branches of the drug and medical industries.

**CONTEXT:** How has your past work on connective tissue and its response to stress and estrogen influenced your current thinking?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the reason for all of the differences is that they are thinking in terms of the classical cell chemicals and enzymes enclosed in a barrier membrane, and the signals as being reductionist. So that 50 or 60 years ago, someone named Schwabta, I think it was C-H-V-A-T-A was his name, found that hypoxia and estrogen created the conditions to produce fibrosis by collagen synthesis. Start following his... perceptions, I've tended to think in terms of global stresses and the functions, where the standard medical thing is to think in terms of a concrete signal like an irritant or a pathogen that is creating the irritation and fibrosis.

**CONTEXT:** What is the typical medical view of fibrosis, and how does your view differ?

**RAY PEAT:** What really shaped my dissertation in 1970-72 was seeing that hypoxia, radiation, estrogen, and excessive PUFA, all of these things, created the same biochemical reactions. On the cellular level, it was analogous to... on cell use, general adaptation syndrome on the level of the organism. Here's the local adaptation syndrome on the level of cells and tissues.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the cellular mechanisms you observed that led to your understanding of these stressors?

**RAY PEAT:** On a more basic level, can we say that fibrosis is basically the... the connective tissue equivalent of the lipid pathway for getting rid of excess electrons, unpaired electrons? Except it doesn't get rid of them. It's a bad solution. It gets rid of them in the sense of killing off that part of the organism, walling it off, making it... detoxifying it, but cutting it off from......of function.

**CONTEXT:** How would you describe the fundamental process of fibrosis in relation to electron management?

**RAY PEAT:** So it's like a storage, like a dead storage for electrons, basically? Separating the area of damage, like a lizard throwing off its tail.

**CONTEXT:** So, is fibrosis essentially a way of storing excess electrons?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah. So would fatty acid synthesis proceed fibrosis, basically? Like a less suboptimal way of getting rid of these excess electrons?

**CONTEXT:** Is fatty acid synthesis a less harmful way of dealing with excess electrons compared to fibrosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, I guess that's a more physiological way. You just blow up with fat instead of calcifying and cut off a part.

**CONTEXT:** So, is accumulating fat a more physiological way to handle excess electrons than calcification?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's doing on the systemic, organic, whole organism level what the local fibrosis does. It's preserving the organism at the expense of losing its functional tissues, such as... muscle, replacing it with fat. And exactly the same processes are involved. Intense calcification will cut off an area, turn it to stone. And the process of aging is a very, very slow turning to stone. It involves... calcification, but in a diffused way that increases inflammation as it lowers function, but the whole organism goes down more or less in a coordinated way rather than calcifying your ears or your pituitary or some particular tissue.

**CONTEXT:** How does the process of aging relate to calcification and the loss of functional tissue?

**RAY PEAT:** And the calcium initially gets there with the intent to help because the cells need it as an anti-inflammatory but if the cells are de-energized then calcium starts to accumulate too much and then I guess under the influence of parathyroid hormone starts to form this, starts to become part of the fibrotic tissue, is that correct?

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of calcium and parathyroid hormone in the development of fibrotic tissue?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the parathyroid hormone is working by amplifying the de-energized situation that starts it all. And something I noticed... in the 60s, it turns up over and over in the old microscope literature is that calcium deposits generally involve, when you're staining the tissue, if you use stains for iron, you'll see an association of iron with all of these little calcium deposits. And the... that's where... It really gets interesting how the whole organism is organized to protect against calcification and excess iron, uncontrolled iron behavior. But you get a diffused iron activity along with diffused calcification. In a gradual slow aging or in a local area, you get both of them very intensely involved in essentially killing off and protecting against that damaged tissue.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between calcium deposits, iron, and the body's protective mechanisms?

**RAY PEAT:** Adolf Warburg talked about that and he pointed out that there's always a progression from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification and then somewhere along that line some cells managed to survive in a damaged condition, that the tumor is a revolt of certain cells in the area that's being isolated and killed off. Those cells decided to survive and since the organism didn't have the resources to prevent the loss of that calcifying area. They are also likely to lack what it is that the escaping cells need. And so although they escaped, they don't have the support from the organism to continue functioning as part of the organism. So they were just an alternative, deterioration alternative to the calcified.

**CONTEXT:** What is the progression from inflammation to tumor formation according to Adolf Warburg?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the common things is that a tumor itself will be turned off by calcification. The body will wall it off and not let it go farther.

**CONTEXT:** How does calcification relate to the containment of tumors?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it can do the same with invasive bacteria or parasites.

**CONTEXT:** Can calcification also serve to wall off pathogens?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the better choice is to hope you can provide the energy and the vitamin D. Yeah. I was suppressed the anti metabolic parathyroid hormone.

**CONTEXT:** When considering the body's need to wall off tumors, is it ever advisable to suppress parathyroid hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** Prolactin is one of the next involved Serotonin and Prolactin and Aldosterone eventually growth hormone that tends to be brought in as part of the failing tissue. So like we talked about last time. Pituitary being roused in proportion to how bad the situation is. Yeah. And Serotonin generally activates too much pituitary activity and then the pituitary hormones intensified the inflammation. First they create... intensified inflammation in the organ they're tuned to like gonadotropins create inflammation and eventually cancer. The gonads TSH which activates the thyroid eventually leads to all of these inflammatory hardening a fibrotic processes and cancer of the thyroid gland so the pituitary hormones rouse the tissue but without the resources to function they lead to the same excitatory damage.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond estrogen and parathyroid hormone, what other hormones are involved in this low-energy shift leading to inflammation and fibrosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and since I don't believe. In such a thing as essential fatty acids I see the whole doctrine of the ideology that has built up around the prostaglandins and other pristine the derivatives of arachidonic acid I think shouldn't be there at all. An Australian guy found. The series of prostaglandin-like substances that are made from the mead acid of omega minus nine fatty acids, which we make if we aren't poisoned by external linolenic acid and that series of N minus three and N minus six fats. Uh, we, we make, uh, basically, uh, uh, the, uh, uh, uh, singly, uh, uh, uh, uh, the, the, um, uh, uh, uh, monounsaturated, uh, uh, N minus nine fatty acids produce. Uh, that mead acid series of, uh, prostaglandin like things. And this Australian, I think his name was Cleland, I've found that they are without exception, that they're anti-inflammatory and constructive for where all of your academic acid derivatives are, uh, end up being harmful.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on essential fatty acids and their role in inflammation, particularly concerning prostaglandins?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, yeah, but they, the derivatives of linoleic and arachidonic acid are amplifiers of the little bit of inflammation that should trigger replication and repair. If you had only the mead acid derivatives, they would take care of limiting the inflammation response. As it is on our present environmental foods, instead the prostaglandins amplify the inflammation and can derange the healing process and make scar tissue or keloids or cancers.

**CONTEXT:** How do linoleic and arachidonic acid derivatives amplify inflammation compared to mead acid derivatives?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it's... in fish, for example, it's a fluid regulating... When a salmon comes from the ocean and confronts the absence of salt in the river water, they have a kind of shock reaction, an estrogenic reaction, and put out a burst of prolactin, which like parathyroid hormone dissolves their bones, gives them an immediate old person... humpback, even though gravity doesn't bend their spine like a human bending over with old age and osteoporosis. The fish get an equivalent humpback as their skeletal deterioration is the prolactin, which is handling this estrogenic excess of water. It's at the same time pulling calcium out of their bones. And that happens under, for example, estrogen increases our water retention and imitates the condition of a salmon hitting freshwater. The shock of that hypotonic condition. That turns on prolactin.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of prolactin, particularly in relation to estrogen and its effects on bone and fluid regulation, as seen in salmon?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, like parathyroid hormone that turns off oxidative energy Production and shifts over to lactic acid production so the a substitution of protective carbon dioxide which hardens the bone tissue and keeps soft tissue soft instead you get lactate which softens the bone tissue and tends to calcify your arteries and other tissues.

**CONTEXT:** How does prolactin, similar to parathyroid hormone, affect energy production and tissue composition?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so.

**CONTEXT:** Do estrogen and prolactin activate stem cells, and is carbon dioxide crucial for their differentiation into normal organs, with a lack of it leading to cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Is it produced by the liver mostly? A fibrinogen is produced in the liver and there's normally there's a constant balance a whole system of enzymes that produce a fibrin and tend to form clots but this fibrin that is constantly. Being produced from the background of fibrinogen, a very thin layer of it is normally deposited on the inside of capillaries, giving them a little extra strength, like just a reinforcing film, and on the outside of red blood cells. And one of the factors that governs... the balance between this constant formation of a small amount of fibrin and the constant breakdown, thinning of that layer so it doesn't get too thick, one of the main factors governing this balance is estrogen. So a high estrogen person gradually gets thicker. Capillary linings and thicker coating on the red blood cells making oxygen take longer to get out of the red cell and through the capillary into the tissue and probably just about every hormone we have is contributing to that balance but estrogen has been studied as a regulator and just recently people are starting to see the d-dimer breakdown fraction of fibrin that indicates how much stress there is or in the case of estrogen it indicates how excessive your estrogen is because you have the enzymes proteolytic enzymes breaking down the coating so it doesn't get too thick. And that has seemed to be happening in a stress disease or a viral disease like COVID-19. And so just checking the blood for the D-dimer is a way of seeing how much stress your system is under.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of fibrin in the body, and how does estrogen regulate its balance, particularly in relation to capillary linings and red blood cells?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the regulators, several of the regulators of iron, for example, high ferritin and high hepcidin, which is sort of a blocker of iron uptake. And the hepcidin levels are increased in COVID, and that was with the defect in the red blood cell iron physiology.

**CONTEXT:** How do regulators of iron, such as ferritin and hepcidin, relate to conditions like COVID-19 and red blood cell iron physiology?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, have you read the Shute family's works, Evans, Shute was one of the… The sons, the father and two sons, they started out showing that vitamin E promotes fertility by blocking the anti-fertility effects of estrogen and one of the effects of estrogen was exaggerated clotting of the blood and vitamin E in protecting against all of the effects of estrogen. They followed up and showed that it would accelerate the removal of established blood clots in various circulatory diseases and protect the heart from forming new clots. And it turns out that estrogen is a basic pro-inflammatory activator. Vitamin E is very essential. Anti-estrogen factor is also a very fundamental anti-inflammatory agent. It works at several levels to prevent prostaglandin toxic effects.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between vitamin E, estrogen, blood clotting, and inflammation, based on the work of the Shute family?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. So that's why aspirin, vitamin E, progesterone, things like that, aside from any direct antiviral effects, they're simply stopping the inflammatory cascade. Which is really what eventually kills people if the condition is really severe.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond direct antiviral effects, how do substances like aspirin, vitamin E, and progesterone combat severe illness?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, basically, we wouldn't be bothered by viruses getting churned out and produced and eliminated. It's the inflammation that some of them produce.

**CONTEXT:** So, is the primary danger from viruses the inflammation they induce rather than the viruses themselves?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's the same with our exosomes, the particles that we make as part of our repair, maintenance and development processes, communication. of genetic material and proteins and hormones between cells for regulation and development. The viruses are almost identical to our own exosomes. They're made by the same machinery, are roughly the same size and structure and so on. So when you're in a......a weakened state, where you are susceptible to viruses and get exaggeratedly sick from a cold virus like COVID, you're also likely to be having poor reactions to your own exosomes. And a sick cell can put out sickness communicating exosomes. A tumor can produce tumors by sending bad exosomes around the body. I think that's a way of thinking of why viruses vary in their harmfulness.

**CONTEXT:** How do viruses compare to exosomes, and how does a weakened state make us susceptible to exaggerated reactions to both?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the case of cancer, for example. Okay. A cancer cell is a profoundly stressed cell, and it sends out crazy alarm signals as exosomes.

**CONTEXT:** Can exosomes released by stressed cells, such as cancer cells, cause harm?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in one of his simple experiments on rabbits he showed that gestro allows the heart muscle and by implication other smooth muscles allows the heart muscle to build structure so that the more the heart functions the better the structure is permitting a more adequate pumping action seeing a concrete version of what you just quoted from him that progesterone facilitates that energy and function build structure and structure enables better function.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone facilitate the building of structure in the heart muscle and other smooth muscles?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and you know, the Michelson-Morley experiment didn't show a null effect. It showed something like a 20 percent drag effect of the ether. And then, I think it was Morley and... Mitchell, I think, did the follow-up work for many years, over and over, doing the original experiment, but in more and more refined ways, in basements and on higher mountains and so on, showing that the Earth does drag an aether with it, affecting the velocity of light according to the direction that Earth is moving.

**CONTEXT:** What were the findings of the Michelson-Morley experiment regarding the ether, and how did subsequent experiments refine these findings?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and those follow-ups to the Michelson-Morley experiment carefully controlled for temperature, because that had been brought out as a defense of the space-time thing, and they absolutely showed the temperature.

**CONTEXT:** How did follow-up experiments to the Michelson-Morley experiment address the issue of temperature?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's important to get pleasure from looking at the world. In intrinsically, the process of being involved and learning from the world gives pleasure. Insight is pleasurable, and the attitude towards the world, that it's a place to be dutiful and do your work, that is a less healthy approach to reality. Everything should be more or less spontaneous and fun and intrinsically motivating to continue in that direction.

**CONTEXT:** What is a healthy way to approach the world and find pleasure in life?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, not force, but to find the route. To get to the different state where you aren't being oppressed by the world. trying to to make them crack a smile. And the children are you can see that they're suffering, they're struggling to smile and they don't want to. They don't want to be entertained. It's not entertaining. They're in pain. So in situations like that, it's more natural. I don't know. I mean, I guess you can find other ways to improve their lives instead of forcing them to be happy. That would be pathological, right?

**CONTEXT:** If one's environment is oppressive, is it healthy to force a positive attitude, or is it more natural to seek ways to improve the situation?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, my experience of the world right from the beginning was that it was a process that I was involved in, the nature of my being and the nature of other beings. Everything was obviously an ongoing process in which all of the entities were actually processes rather than having any fixed points of reference other than as part of... a general picture that you're putting together and then reading William Blake when I was 18 I saw that his orientation was essentially similar and then Alfred North Whitehead right around the same time went into details and he gave that name a process and reality which that orientation is now called either process philosophy or process theology and it's in place of all of the theological apparatus it sees universe as processes at every point.

**CONTEXT:** How did your understanding of the world evolve into what is now known as process philosophy or process theology?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah Griffin he was in a Bible school. A couple blocks from the University of Oregon when I was in graduate school there and he studied his way out of fundamentalism and found his way to that same viewpoint by studying whitehead.

**CONTEXT:** How did Griffin arrive at a similar viewpoint to process theology?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I could call it Blakian consciousness as easily.

**CONTEXT:** Is your philosophical orientation closer to process theology or Blakian consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it depends on your definition of phenomenology, Husserl himself. He sketched it out as something that sounded just right, to be aware of your awareness and essentially to feel yourself as a process within processes. But then Husserl, for some reason, tried to reduce it to Platonic reductionism. Very weird. It became idealistic.

**CONTEXT:** How does phenomenology, as described by Husserl, relate to your philosophical outlook, and what were the limitations of his approach?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because your thoughts are best when they extend and incorporate a large span of time. Only by suspending judgment can you......fill up your consciousness with what it takes to support that perception and understand it.

**CONTEXT:** How does suspending judgment contribute to better thought processes and understanding?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's trying to implant its doctrines and ways of reasoning. And Ray, you maintain that like, I don't know how to say this, but like a pure type of intuition and animal intuition is altruistic in nature?

**CONTEXT:** Does the external environment attempt to impose its doctrines and reasoning, and is pure intuition, including animal intuition, inherently altruistic?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, that's one of the properties of the either liberation theology or process theology or Marx's approach to understanding Marxism. That you have to recognize that there is a reality to good and justice. And evil and injustice that the nature of the world is that we are able to appreciate those differences where the artificial intelligence type of rationalism makes no difference between good and bad, better and worse.

**CONTEXT:** How do process theology, liberation theology, and Marxism recognize the reality of good and justice, and how does this differ from artificial intelligence-based rationalism?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, by injuring the person or the animal. Yeah, you've seen that study with the locust and the grasshopper, right? Where basically they simply injecting a grasshopper with a little bit of serotonin turns them, you know, usually they're gregarious. They're playful. They're curious. They're altruistic. You inject a little bit of serotonin and then turn into cannibalistic homicidal beasts that devour everything on their path, including each other.

**CONTEXT:** Can basic needs or physiological changes, like serotonin levels, override natural altruism, as seen in the locust and grasshopper study?

**RAY PEAT:** Your wholeness, it's a mental process of understanding why a person would injure you and incorporating that. You can have thoughts of revenge as part of the process of how to interpret that and go on without actually having to. Do destructive retaliatory things. It's been there. There's been there was a study with people who were present prisoners of war in Vietnam and they found out that the ones who psychiatrically slash psychologically did the best. Were the ones who fantasized about either escape or getting back at their captors, but without acting upon it because the ones that did act upon it either got killed or or for some reason. Even when they were liberated or managed to escape, they did not do well health wise, they ended up with a post-traumatic stress disorder or something else, but the ones that didn't revenge but had vivid imagery of how they're going to pay back to the captors or escape, they seem to do okay.

**CONTEXT:** Can the desire for revenge be a healthy psychological process, and what does research on prisoners of war suggest about managing such desires?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that kind of mental imagery is part of a healing process, I think, activating your creative ability in a bad situation. It can involve some bad images, but when you do it, you can reconstruct yourself as a constructive, ongoing person with responsibility for improving things.

**CONTEXT:** How can mental imagery, even if it involves negative themes, contribute to a healing process and personal reconstruction?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, once I, a cop was extremely unjust, and I... thought intensely about that and what a miserable person he was. But then, in the process of mulling it over for a few hours, I was able to put him in the context and to see him as a victim who suffered. From various pressures that caused him to become such a miserable thing.

**CONTEXT:** How can understanding the context and potential suffering of an aggressor alleviate personal frustration and anger?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are cases where. A very bad cop or a war criminal has got out of that situation and sought forgiveness and realized what he had been doing and changed. So that's a very Christian ethic, right? As long as you're willing to ask for forgiveness and willing to work to improve your life, then God will grant you forgiveness.

**CONTEXT:** Does the Christian ethic of seeking forgiveness and working for improvement apply even to individuals who have committed severe wrongdoings?

**RAY PEAT:** Sounds right. Yeah, and I think you replied to somebody about the development of these types of authoritarian automatons and you suggested reading Alice Miller and Wilhelm Reich on how those people develop.

**CONTEXT:** Is contempt a weapon of the weak, and what insights can Alice Miller and Wilhelm Reich offer on the development of authoritarian personalities?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it was already... incorporated at the time of Christianity. A few chapters in the Bible talk about that. Reich, in his book, The Murder of Christ, quotes a lot from the Bible and creates a very different orientation from what you hear in a lot of sermons....... biological, very Christian and ethical approach towards the world.

**CONTEXT:** How does the Bible, and specifically Wilhelm Reich's interpretation in "The Murder of Christ," present a biological and ethical approach to Christianity?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, yeah. Yeah, the primitive Christianity was historically for a couple of hundred years. That seemed to be the central theme. Love thy neighbor in a practical way.

**CONTEXT:** What was the central theme of primitive Christianity, and how was "love thy neighbor" expressed practically?

**RAY PEAT:** The way we think about the body and its organs, we've been indoctrinated to think in terms of substance and energy as different things. Energy is what pushes matter around in space. But it isn't a factual description of matter and energy. The body we experience is a unitary process. So the organs and tissues and cells and conscious experience are really all one substantial phenomenon. One substance in which energy is moving you as a whole, you don't have to think about the way your life is specifically working on cells and organs.

**CONTEXT:** How should we understand the relationship between the mind, body, and energy, moving beyond the conventional separation of substance and energy?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and you can't really do anything twice, like Heraclitus said. You're always changing, and if you're trapped in that kind of repetitive behavior, you either have to escape or go to sleep, and people tend to put themselves to sleep rather than escaping from pointless work.

**CONTEXT:** How does the concept of constant change, as described by Heraclitus, relate to repetitive behavior and the tendency to seek escape or sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. Okay, that's very interesting. Would it be therapeutic if somebody's stuck at a job? I know what the best thing is to leave, right? But if somebody's stuck at a job that they consider repetitive or routine or generally unfulfilling... Would it be therapeutic to think to remind ourselves of what Chiara Clary said that you may think you're doing the exact same thing but it's really not. Every moment of your life is different from one second to the other.

**CONTEXT:** If someone is stuck in a repetitive or unfulfilling job, can reminding themselves of the uniqueness of each moment be therapeutic?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, that's the process that should be happening. I have to say when I worked at Apple Retail every moment seemed exactly the same, unfortunately, Georgi. So I don't know about that.

**CONTEXT:** Is the perception of each moment being unique a process that should be happening, even if it doesn't always feel that way in practice?

**RAY PEAT:** I think lots of personal interaction. Perceiving what he is experiencing and giving him rub downs and body pleasure, good massages, warming his head and neck and ears a lot while paying close attention. Trying to draw out little bits of pleasure that are there.

**CONTEXT:** How can one help an animal that has experienced severe trauma to reset and live a normal life?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think there is any elsewhere and part of those categories derive from thinking about matter as an inert substance. If you have a very metaphysical idea about what matter is, then you have to have an idea of what animates matter, and so you get involved in separate energy and planes and so on. But there are all different levels of subtle interactions. It isn't just the... powerful energy that runs through us metabolically to maintain our structure. But given that complex structure, our sensitivities increase in proportion to how well-structured we are. And insects and probably dogs, for example, can detect... At a distance, a single vibrating molecule, for example, a pheromone molecule can be at a distance and very spread out, but the infrared oscillations emitted by the molecule just sitting there are strong enough to be sensed by... insects. So the environment is constantly offering us information about itself and those levels of subtle energy interactions depend on our sensitivity to them. And by tuning in you can find out that our world is full of lots of... information and messages that are ignored if you believe in inert matter and separate energy and so on.

**CONTEXT:** How does the concept of inert matter and separate energy influence our understanding of planes of existence and subtle energy interactions?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that line of reasoning is because we have been taught that a certain doctrine about reasoning of Rene Descartes' idea of inert matter and consciousness activating it and so on, putting dualism or worse into the very definitions that you're working with. You have to start looking at language. As something that you can work with, you don't have to accept what people tell you is built into reality of language.

**CONTEXT:** How does the Cartesian idea of inert matter and consciousness contribute to dualism, and how can language be used to challenge these ingrained definitions?

**RAY PEAT:** I think everyone is... open to that sort of communication. It's just that the animals are always willing, but people live in their dream world of word consciousness.

**CONTEXT:** Is communication with animals, like talking to a cat, possible, and why do humans often struggle with this form of communication?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it adds practicality to......make remote things something you can talk about, rather than having to stay with the surrounding immediate reality that animals and people can talk about. And maybe potentially pass down through the generations like abstract information? Yeah. Remote in time or space.

**CONTEXT:** What is the evolutionary purpose of the second signal system, and how does it enable abstract communication and the transmission of information across time and space?

**RAY PEAT:** Too much analytical thought, too much deductionism. Very easily pathological, inferring people from about the age of five or six on... participates in slowing mental perceptions.

**CONTEXT:** Can excessive analytical thought and deductionism lead to pathological states and a slowing of mental perception, particularly in children?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. That was what I was starting my linguistics thesis on. There's a... In the economics world, they're saying that you can measure a country's freedom by the sheer number of laws it has on the books. Do you think that's a good surrogate, too? Basically, the more laws, the less free a country is?

**CONTEXT:** Do cultures with fewer grammatical rules in their language tend to be more open-minded, and is the number of laws a good indicator of a country's freedom?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's a reflection of how many laws are built into your language. You don't have to have written language, but that helps to......turn it into a distracting concreteness, but if you have a language that is more fluid, flexible, that lets you have better perceptions.

**CONTEXT:** How does the structure of language, particularly its fluidity and flexibility, influence our perceptions and the number of laws within a society?
