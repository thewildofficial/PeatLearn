**RAY PEAT:** Oh just the traditions in painting had accumulated lots of knowledge from the time of Michelangelo and the older older so-called classical paintings they had been learning actual physical principles about light and geometry and and teaching their art students a sort of an aspect of physics to use in representing the world and then the first world war the Dada surrealist reaction and Freudianism rejected the whole so-called rational system that created such terrible things as the world war. And that went with a lot of experimentation in both the arts and sciences and humanities. Trying out different things, and Hitler closed all of the experimental art schools and descending science programs and such, but right during and after the Second World War, the CIA created the thing they called the O. Congress for Cultural Freedom, in which they imposed that revolutionary attitude towards painting, destroying the old because of its connection to the corrupt system, but they put it out as the glory of Western culture, cultural freedom. And Siqueiros, the Mexican painter, called it ghost art, imposed by the Rockefellers to destroy consciousness, abstract expressionism, for example, all of the abstract approaches to art. Activities of the CIA through the Cultural Freedom Foundation shamed and expelled from the universities the traditional people who preserved the great tradition in painting so that a whole generation of painters in the universities didn't learn how to paint at all. And we're just now beginning to come out of that phase where the whole culture was deliberately being destroyed and rerouted down the Rockefeller ghost art route to destroy actual understanding.
**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the CIA's role in shaping modern art and its connection to a broader cultural agenda?

**RAY PEAT:** I see Noam Chomsky's linguistics, so-called, as being one of the most powerful examples of that. Real linguistics had developed with Franz Boas and his students. And they had created descriptions of understanding. of a great variety of language and culture. That sort of a peak idea was the Horfian hypothesis, showing the absolute interaction between conceptual understanding of the world and how the language is structured. And that was the way. Understanding the role of language behind science and art and culture. The way that language can propagandistically destroy understanding of reality. That was part of the real tradition of linguistics. At MIT, with Pentagon funding. The trend under Noam Chomsky was to throw out everything that was real in the linguistics tradition and substitute a mysticism-based view of consciousness in which words are essentially determined by genes. It's a long story that many historians of language have looked back on and pointed out that his so-called generative linguistics, generative grammar, couldn't generate anything and wasn't a grammar. It was a total fraud, but school textbooks, high school books incorporated his ideas supposedly since it described language production in terms of a language apparatus which is genetically determined as supposedly learning is. So-called linguistics would make it easier to understand the English language or whatever language you're studying, and they actually sold those books to school boards across the country. Absolutely destructive, not only useless, but destroying a consciousness of how language really works. When he got famous for his anti-imperialism, the world just sort of politely forgot how fraudulent his linguistics work had been. Fraudulent in the direction of opening the philosophical world to accept whatever the Pentagon and CIA wanted to. substitute for consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** How does Noam Chomsky's linguistic theory relate to the broader cultural manipulation you've described, and what was the nature of his "fraudulent" work?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think he was one of the originators, having grown up studying mysticism. It blended right into, I think he believed in that mystical idea. That there is no consciousness other than words, which in a fairly recent video he was explaining that dogs can't think, animals can't think because they don't have words. But he said the, I forget, a canine or dog, he spelled out, he said if they heard me say dogs, they would... I got excited and think we were going somewhere. So he was saying dogs don't have consciousness because they don't have words, but then he had to spell out the word because he didn't want to get the dogs excited.
**CONTEXT:** Do you suspect Chomsky was working under specific direction, or was his ideology a personal development?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, exactly. So they, I mean, these people had no language, right? They were born deaf and mute and all they could do basically is like, I mean, they had sign language, which eventually they learned, but initially they had no language and all they had is perception and visual perception and tactile perception. And when when psychiatrists did IQ tests on them turned out that these Some of them were like slightly behind but most of them had normal intelligence. So It's difficult to argue that chomsky was right because this directly proves even in humans People with no language are perfectly capable of conscious experience
**CONTEXT:** Given the case of deaf and mute individuals with normal intelligence despite lacking language, how does this invalidate Chomsky's theory that consciousness is dependent on words?

**RAY PEAT:** Um It will at the same time he was creating his anti-linguistics, anti-science doctrine of generative grammar. One of his students said that even though the press all through the US was saying Chomsky has explained how the brain creates language, he— in person said, when he says generate, he means it in the mathematical sense of account for. He was knowing that the people were being misled, that he was aware that it wouldn't actually generate anything that was useful—useless for that purpose. But at the same time, he was doing that. Norbert Wiener, with his more holistic approach to cybernetics, a non-digital analog approach, he was present at MIT, but because he criticized war wouldn't take money from the Pentagon. He was ostracized. Chomsky was glad to receive funding from the Pentagon. He was a supporter of a Pentagon rocket man to be chancellor of MIT, very close to the Pentagon, powered and taking their money. And being, in a way, the Pentagon's pet anti-imperialist.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Chomsky was aware his work was misleading. Can you elaborate on his relationship with the Pentagon and how it contrasts with Norbert Wiener's approach?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what Chomsky led the public to believe he had. But a couple of times when I was teaching linguistics, nationally known linguists would go around basically propagandizing. And when they would come to my class to talk, I would have a chance to explain what was wrong with Chomsky's thing. I pointed out that you can create a sentence if you pick out the right system, right series of his rules, you can create a sentence. A sentence in any language in the world, but only if you know what sentences you want to produce, to know what series to choose your rules in. You can't make a sentence that you don't know already applying his rules. The choice of the rules, it has to be guided by the finished sentence. A couple of them actually understood the concept, you can see that they only took them a couple of minutes to forget it.
**CONTEXT:** How does the practical application of Chomsky's generative grammar rules fail to actually generate novel sentences without prior knowledge of the desired output?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the brain structure as formed by interaction with the world. So in other words, metabolic rate, which greatly influences changes in brain structure, it may be the ultimate determinant in the evolution of language?
**CONTEXT:** You've stated that the real structure of language is based on images, and that language comes after perception. Does this mean that the fundamental structure of language is rooted in physical brain structure, which is influenced by metabolic rate and experience?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can analyze language. Someone looked at letters, at nuns. They had written in their 20s, and then they knew the outcome. And those who developed Alzheimer's at a relatively young age, they could see that their language structure in their 20s was simplified, and at a young age with a lot of mental energy, you can see that their language structure was simplified. Language structure is extremely complex and unique. Every situation demands a fundamental rethinking of the whole thing. And so there is real uniqueness in everything a healthy person says. And when the mental energy is lower......what you get is strings of cliches. So basically the ability to turn experiences into language depends on the metabolic rate, vitally.
**CONTEXT:** How does the complexity and uniqueness of language structure relate to mental energy and metabolic rate, and what happens to language when mental energy is low?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm just... Joking. Didn't Epstein work at MIT? Oh, not that I heard of. Oh yeah, late, just a little while before he was notorious, he was funding one of their programs, and the guy who accepted his funding was embarrassed and quit. I think that Kim and Minsky collaborated on a few things, or at least Epstein sponsored some of Minsky's research. At least that's what I saw recently on the global research site and some of the other more peripheral ones, which seem to be speaking more truth than mainstream media has cumulatively done over the century.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the funding of research at MIT, did Jeffrey Epstein have any connection to the institution or its researchers?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm just noticing that people weren't putting two and two together over the years. Stuff that people could have been actually doing serious work on 50 years ago. No one really has the motivation or energy to draw the conclusions. Incidentally, some people probably still don't have their copy of it because the gmail is limiting it to a certain number every 24 hours and so I think about half of them still haven't gone through.
**CONTEXT:** What was the motivation behind your latest newsletter, "Estrogen, Iron, Degenerative, Aging, and Progesterone," and why do you feel people haven't connected these concepts before?

**RAY PEAT:** That working on one part of it, like taking an aromatase inhibitor, isn't going to solve very much. And at the same time, it's improving one thing that is likely to be making something else worse. And so to look at the whole process as far as you can, and think of how you can remedy things with the least risk of doing more damage.
**CONTEXT:** What are some of the major misconceptions your newsletter addresses, particularly regarding the approach to hormonal balance and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** You know anemia, low blood, low hematocrit and low hemoglobin, and... About 50 years ago someone was studying the health of California migrant workers and found that the kids running around somewhat hungry and dirty were healthier than the local middle class Anglo kids and that one of their... features the immigrant very poor kids had I think a hemoglobin of 10 or 10 and a half something like that and it isn't just malaria in Africa that flares up and kills people when they give them an iron supplement but... right in the US they can see that so-called anemic kids are healthier than the ones with the so-called normal levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin so by our iron overload you mean the accumulation of unusable iron in the forms of lipofuscin and other iron complexes?
**CONTEXT:** Regarding osteoporosis and dementia being associated with iron overload but also with anemia, what is your understanding of anemia in this context, and how does it relate to iron overload?

**RAY PEAT:** estrogen is one of the things that causes you to retain iron but protectively lowers your hemoglobin and hematocrit and for a hundred years doctors have looked at the women sometimes with very low hematocrit or hemoglobin and prescribed. Iron fields and kept prescribing it, even if their hemoglobin got lower, not understanding that the same thing that makes them overload on the iron is blocking their bone marrow formation of red blood cells.
**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen contribute to iron retention and lower hemoglobin/hematocrit, and why did doctors historically misinterpret this in anemic women?

**RAY PEAT:** The well-known effects of increasing hematocrit and hemoglobin under the effect of androgens, is that due to the opposition of androgens to estrogen or a direct effect of androgens? Both direct on the bone marrow, in particular, stabilizes it and helps it get warmer. More productive estrogen tends to lower the temperature and that goes, among other things, with a tendency to inflammation and iron toxicity.
**CONTEXT:** Is the increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin under the influence of androgens due to their opposition to estrogen or a direct effect on the bone marrow?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it reduces all sorts of cytokines. Chilling creates inflammation, secreting inflammatory cytokines, and causes cells to take up water, and the falling temperature is not only a sign of that. It's one of the mechanisms by which estrogen changes the body physiology.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that fever helps deplete serum iron and tryptophan and reduces cytokines. How does chilling relate to inflammation and estrogen's physiological effects?

**RAY PEAT:** The way parathyroid works, for example, under stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, that system activates the parathyroid hormone. The keratonin proinflammatory activates the parathyroid to provide more calcium. to the bloodstream by taking it out of the bone. The way it takes it out of the bone is to suppress the formation of carbon dioxide because carbon dioxide helps the present calcium to crystallize into the bone as calcium carbonate. And when the CO2 production is lowered, it's replaced by glycolytic production of lactic acid and the lactic acid in itself helps to dissolve the bone. The pH isn't the thing because you can have... a low pH with CO2 forming bone and the same pH with lactic acid disassembling the bone. And in all the rest of your tissues, including the cells in your bone making the lactic acid, all of the intracellular processes of blood vessels in particular suffer. When they shift from producing carbon dioxide to producing lactate, the intracellular pH rises, increasing the negative ionization of the cell proteins, increasing their affinity for metals with a positive charge. Ionized calcium with two positive charges, iron, aluminum, lead and any other metal that is present will be stuck inside your soft tissue cells along with the calcium, especially if the calcium is deficient in your diet. You will be taking up more iron, aluminum. Lead, whatever is present in your intestine. So the more calcium deficient you are, the more parathyroid hormone you make, and the more other metals will be present under the influence of parathyroid hormone to crystallize, poisoning your... blood vessels, and brain cells, and kidney cells, and pretty much everywhere.
**CONTEXT:** How does parathyroid hormone, particularly when stimulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lead to calcium metabolism issues and iron overload?

**RAY PEAT:** The carbon dioxide......causes its affinity for electrons as an acidic Lewis acid molecule. As it associates with the proteins, the electrons are retracted, making the electron cloud holding the potassium proton. Holding the potassium alternatively with protons, making it experience a lower attractive concentration of electrons, and since the water polarization of the big potassium atom doesn't interfere with that lower electronic attractive field, the potassium is strongly attracted even to an electron retracted protein, but as the carbon dioxide is decreased and the pH rises under the influence of forming lactic acid, then the electron cloud on the protein is no longer retracted towards the CO2, but it forms a more intense concentration of negative charge, which will overcome the highly polarized water layers around sodium, for example, but also around other highly concentrated positive charges. Once the sodium starts displacing the potassium, then the calcium and mercury and iron will have a chance to get in at the same time as the calcium.
**CONTEXT:** In Gilbert Link's theory, potassium has a high affinity for intracellular proteins. How do metals like sodium, calcium, and iron displace potassium and disrupt protein structure, especially during elevated lactic acid production?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, but the lactic acid quickly moves out of the cell and acidifies the environment, creating other problems, activating... inflammatory signals and so on, but what happens inside when the lactic acid leaves is an increased pH because of the way the NADH handles its protons.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that during lactic acid production, intracellular pH rises because the cell expels lactic acid. Does this expulsion of lactic acid also contribute to the problem by acidifying the external environment?

**RAY PEAT:** The CO2 is known to have an inactivating effect on iron. Uh, uh, h-helping to, uh, k-keep it in a relatively oxidized, uh, state because of that acid property of CO2, uh, and, uh, just by displacing CO2, then, uh, lactic acid is, uh, in effect, uh, uh, l-likely to make iron more reactive, uh, when, when you reduce, uh, uh, the, uh, cripply. Uh, ionized ferric iron, uh, uh, you get the highly reactive ferric iron, uh, so the reducing property of, of, uh, lactic acid, uh, i-it is, uh, uh, for sure going to, uh, create iron damage.
**CONTEXT:** How do lactic acid and carbon dioxide interact with iron, and how does lactic acid's reducing property contribute to iron damage?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a whole flowing system that changes the nature of the cytoplasmic substance. It's a process that isn't just an adding of... a lot of little events, but the way Gilbert Ling saw it was that the nature of the substance of the cell has these different ways of existing.
**CONTEXT:** You've described a complex cellular process involving metabolic rate, reactive oxygen species, and iron. How does this system function as a whole, and what is the fundamental nature of cellular change as described by Gilbert Ling?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the CO2 is the most pervasive and powerful and immediate causer. It simultaneously goes with your consciousness, your level of motivation and sensitivity and all of those things. All of the life properties correspond to basically the level of CO2 in your tissue.
**CONTEXT:** Considering the interconnectedness of cellular processes, is carbon dioxide the direct conductor of these beneficial changes, and is thyroid hormone simply the cause of CO2 creation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, as I presently understand it. So all things being equal, if you were to be injected with estrogen or serotonin or PTH, PTH would be the worst out of all of those? Yeah, except that estrogen ends up increasing your PTH.
**CONTEXT:** If injected with estrogen, serotonin, or parathyroid hormone (PTH), would PTH be the most detrimental, considering estrogen also increases PTH?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, yeah, yeah, the, uh, antortensin system is very close to it, but I think that's the right way of seeing it. But the reverse is also true, isn't it? The parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of all of these other mitigators as well. Uh, yeah, yeah, because it creates the degenerative alarm condition, and the short-term recuperative stress hormones all exacerbate the long-range degenerative processes.
**CONTEXT:** Is it true that parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of other "mitigators" like angiotensin, and does this create a feedback loop that exacerbates degenerative processes?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that's its functional, most known action, but it can't help doing it everywhere in the body. And then to do that to other tissues, it just has to be in the blood, is that right?
**CONTEXT:** Does parathyroid hormone stimulate lactic acid production specifically from bone, or does it affect other tissues as well?

**RAY PEAT:** Nothing that I know of. Wow. So really, the only way to protect is limit its synthesis. Yeah, and vitamin D and calcium and magnesium are the things that are best known to do that. But at the same time, reducing endotension and serotonin and aldosterone, for example.
**CONTEXT:** Is there a way to make a cell more resistant to parathyroid hormone, or is the only protective measure to limit its synthesis through factors like vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not familiar with it. There may be steroids that compete with it, but I guess the receptor hasn't been found yet. Or at least medicine is not interested in looking at it, because they think parathyroid hormone is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's given to osteoporotic people to increase their bone growth.
**CONTEXT:** Does medicine claim a specific parathyroid hormone receptor as the primary mechanism of action, and if so, why might this receptor not be widely recognized or studied?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it does increase with age. One of the interesting things that they don't like to talk about either is that the bone with aging and osteoporosis forms lots of aromatase. It becomes a powerful source of estrogen at the same time that it's degenerating. I think that's one of the interesting things that they don't like to talk about either is that
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a paper suggesting parathyroid hormone increases with age. What is the connection between aging bone, osteoporosis, and aromatase production?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, getting your calcium and vitamin D and magnesium high enough that you turn off your parathyroid hormone. That's necessarily going to reduce the the local stress and. All of these signals that increase aromatase.
**CONTEXT:** How does increasing calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium intake help to reverse the functional aspect of bone that increases aromatase production?

**RAY PEAT:** And if once you recognize that stressed bones produce estrogen but by their local aromatase then you see one of the reasons that progesterone is going to strengthen the bones because it knocks out, it inhibits aromatase and knocks out the estrogen. receptors.
**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone strengthen bones, particularly in relation to estrogen production by stressed bone and aromatase inhibition?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything good helps your bones.
**CONTEXT:** In addition to progesterone, are there other beneficial substances for bone health, such as thyroid hormone and vitamin K, that complement good nutrition, calcium, and vitamin D?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think. Everything really is overlapping, but the receptor idea is just a way of trying to introduce order kind of artificially.
**CONTEXT:** Would you agree that serotonin antagonists have a direct, independent effect on bone health, separate from their influence on parathyroid hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's just... blocking the promotion. For example, one of the powerful promoters of aromatase is Prastaglandin E. And the enzyme cyclooxygenase that makes Prastaglandin is activated under almost exactly the same circumstances. that activate aromatase and so the there's almost always a prostaglandin e present pushing for the formation of estrogen and the progesterone is known to in multiple overlapping ways to block the formation of prostaglandin e by creating destructive metabolites of it, blocking its formation and probably several parallel mechanisms that prevent the activation opposing cortisol's activating effect on aromatase.
**CONTEXT:** Does progesterone have a disintegrating effect on aromatase, or does it simply inhibit its effects, and how does it relate to prostaglandin E and cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of those things overlap for more than 50 years you radiation, hypoxia, vitamin E deficiency, progesterone deficiency, all of these have been known to activate the formation of more aromatase. And that's a, you have to then look at what each one of these things is doing, each one of those factors, radiation, hypoxia, and so on, is also activating many other parts of the cell, which lead to activation of aromatase. So it's like a holistic switch mechanism in which everything gathers up a summation of forces to either turn aromatase on or off.
**CONTEXT:** What is the main mechanism behind the synthesis of the aromatase protein, and how do factors like radiation, hypoxia, and deficiencies in vitamin E or progesterone act as a "holistic switch mechanism" to activate it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because at the same time it's keeping the energy state of the cell up which maintains the hydrophobic condition. The stabilizing of the hydrophobicity is also the stabilizing of the energy level and that suppresses all of the things that would call for raising the amount of estrogen or cortisol in the blood. So very, very well energized. lipophilic cell would be resistant to estrogen, even though it may be expressing the estrogen receptor at a normal level. So it may look like an estrogen sensitive cell, but estrogen can't really do much because it cannot get inside. Yeah, and it's probably keeping the estrogen receptors on the verge of disintegration to keep the hydrophobicity high.
**CONTEXT:** If a cell is highly lipophilic and energized, would this decrease the entry of hydrophilic steroids like glucocorticoids and estrogen, making the cell resistant to estrogen even if receptors are present?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so, a group of. I think it's generally led by Pasqualini has identified the processes of increasing estrogen in the cell or decreasing it and in about 10 different ways, progesterone's effect is to get estrogen. Out of the cell and inactivated made water soluble so that it travels through the blood quickly and is excreted and so the deficiency of progesterone will leave your cells highly activated by estrogen, for example in the uterus or breast tissue that is deficient. In progesterone, it's internally, it begins making its own estrogen so it doesn't depend on the ovaries or adrenals to, you know, they used to cut those out to prevent or cure breast cancer, but if you take out the ovaries and adrenals, you're also taking out progesterone and that activates the process of forming estrogen locally, starting with the uterus and breasts, but eventually going to every tissue that has been studied.
**CONTEXT:** Could the increase of estradiol in urine or blood observed with high saturated fat intake be due to the body excreting unused estradiol because cells are impervious to it, and how does progesterone facilitate estrogen excretion?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The glucuronic acid is related to the vitamin C producing system and that... requires the normal flow of carbohydrate through the system.
**CONTEXT:** Given that glucuronidation is the main method of deactivating estrogen and depends on glucose availability, is sufficient dietary carbohydrate vital for proper estrogen excretion and deactivation?

**RAY PEAT:** My basic idea is that it's consuming the oxygen and the electrons that should be available to the mitochondria. And it's directly turning them into hydrogen peroxide and superoxide and water. But in order for that process to happen means that basically the accumulation of reactive oxygen species needs to occur, which suggests that a block of oxide phosphoration is already happening, right?
**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism through which lipo-phosphin inhibits the electron transport chain, and does it directly bind to complexes or impede electron flow by accumulating reactive oxygen species?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but it's like an amplifier once the process... starts, you're making more heme oxygenase, releasing more iron, getting a more reduced environment that makes the iron more toxic, consuming oxygen, lowering oxygen tension, accelerating the process. Once a person in old age reaches a point further, visibly......developing massive accumulation of dark pigment, it is extremely quick that they will go on to die.
**CONTEXT:** How does lipo-phosphin act as an amplifier in the process of cellular damage, and what is the significance of the accumulation of dark pigment in old age?

**RAY PEAT:** The ruling class knows very well how to herd people, scare them with something, get a lemming conformist trend going, and then keep them scared and inform them that everyone is going to do it, and you'll be a freak if you don't. Go along with them. And so I think they're even inflating the number of people who are really getting the vaccines. The propaganda has reached a point, I think, that it is triggering the irritation, self-defense reflects, in more and more people who are... as they start communicating, finding ways around the censorship that frightens the ruling class more and so they panic and get more absurd in the lies they're putting out through the media.
**CONTEXT:** How does the ruling class use fear and propaganda to create conformity, and what is the role of censorship in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that like people with two vaccines becoming suddenly unvaxxed because they don't have a third one, I mean, should shake anybody to their core that this is insane. And of course, I mean, that's if I were to hypothesize, given the things I've seen, that's just to normalize constant vaccination. And that's part of the agenda for whatever reason. Yeah, three. Vaccines in a year and that's not counting the the influence and and shingles and chicken pox and all of the other vaccines they they haven't revised anything so it says now adults are going to need multiple many. Annual vaccinations. Even though the the information has been coming out for several years that the influenza vaccine for example makes you much more likely several times more likely than the unvaccinated to develop a respiratory pneumonia like problem. So there was a huge campaign. The previous year 2018 into 2019 to get Italians vaccinated with the influenza and according to everything that's known that would multiply several fold their risk of developing some other respiratory disease. Very likely it was a factor in the high mortality in Italy that they had been so obedient in getting their influenza vaccine.
**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the shifting definitions of vaccination status (e.g., two vaccines making someone "unvaxxed" without a third), and how does the normalization of annual vaccinations, including the influenza vaccine, potentially increase the risk of respiratory diseases?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, uh, um He saw education and medicine as the two basic evils of our society that were destroying humanity.
**CONTEXT:** Ivan Illich viewed education and medicine as fundamental evils. How did he see them as destructive to humanity?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, I'm, I'm well, yeah, the way technology is used in indoctrination, the existence of the technical knowledge itself needn't be harm harmful, but they create this ideology of the digital view of consciousness, for example, that's separate from a technical understanding. If Norbert Wiener had been followed, there wouldn't have been this digitized reality quantization of everything as part of the philosophical reductionism. That reality is discrete instead of continuous?
**CONTEXT:** Do you agree with the Unabomber that technology is the core agent of destruction, or do you see its use in indoctrination as the primary problem, especially concerning the digital view of consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, I think the antitension would be pretty high. That's an accurate blood test? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** If someone is skeptical about the harm of vaccines, could a blood test reveal physiological imbalances, such as elevated aldosterone, that might indicate a negative reaction to the spike protein?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think China keeps in mind the history of germ warfare of the United States. And that's probably part of their thinking. But they also collaborated with the United States in that Wuhan Institute of Virology on this gain of function research. So is that a case of keep your friends close, your enemies closer? That China just wanted to get an idea of what the Americans are thinking of unleashing? Or do you think China is on board with this whole globalization plan?
**CONTEXT:** What might be China's motivations behind its massive vaccination campaign, considering its history with US germ warfare and collaboration on gain-of-function research?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's a fact in China. I think the president, Xi intervened and......sort of cut down the Fauci faction. Oh, I see.
**CONTEXT:** Do you believe President Xi's intervention in China, potentially cutting down the "Fauci faction," is linked to his announcement about wealth redistribution and making China more equitable?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't know how it would be used for counting calories. Didn't you mention that if you discard the morning urine, then you collect the urine the rest of the day, couldn't you do some kind of math and then figure out how many calories you're burning? If you measure your water, total water intake, and urine. Then you know how much water you're evaporating. And that goes up as you burn calories. So you have to know the water balance. So you basically perspire about a liter of water for every thousand calories burned, right?
**CONTEXT:** Can you clarify the at-home urine collection test and how it might be used to quantify calorie expenditure, specifically regarding water balance and evaporation?

**RAY PEAT:** That's just the equivalent of the old standard two grains of armor. It's partly just an arbitrary number because it varies so much with individuals. Roughly 25 micrograms of T3 sums up about the same as one grain of armor. And since the average replacement dose used to be two grains of armor, that's where that 50 micrograms came from.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding your 2012 quote about 50 micrograms of T3 normalizing hypothyroid metabolism, do you still hold that view, and how does it compare to the historical dosage of Armour thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Either way, but for sure split up so it comes in gradually.
**CONTEXT:** If someone is taking 50 micrograms of T3, should they split it into smaller doses, such as 10 micrograms five times a day, or is any split dosage acceptable?

**RAY PEAT:** The objective evidence is that I guess it was about 20 years ago, Cuauhtémoc Cardenas really won the popular vote, but lost the election by fraud. And the fact that. In actual votes, as well as electoral success, AMLO had national support, the fact that the great bulk of the population supports those two individuals shows a lot about the quality of the country, very, very different from European American consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** What is your positive view of Mexico, and what evidence supports your assessment of its population's consciousness compared to European American consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the use of digital voting machines operated through computers. It's the perfect way to hide the fraud to some extent. Black Box voting, when it was pointing out fraud by the Republicans, was a very popular website. I think they're still in operation, but no one wants to investigate. Fraud by the Democrats. Comparatively, you know, do you think the the court system has been completely compromised or this compromised to the point where even if evidence is unearthed, it will simply go nowhere.
**CONTEXT:** Considering the potential for election fraud in Mexico, do you believe similar sophisticated methods could be employed in the US, and has the court system become compromised to the point where evidence of fraud would be ignored?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the courts are well, well packed with state-supporting uh no matter which party it doesn't really matter that much which fascist party you're keeping in power uh
**CONTEXT:** Do you believe the court system is compromised to the point where it consistently supports the state, regardless of which political party is in power?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, uh, the I i think I there was a possible positive interpretation for biden wanting to do what trump wanted to do get get the army out of some of the wars and i i think the today's bombing probably was the factions that uh can't afford to have uh any decrease in uh war expending expenditure uh the trillions that have gone through the military uh industry in iraq syria and afghanistan they don't want to see the tap turned off to their endless money supply
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and do you believe the recent bombing indicates factions that benefit from war expenditure are trying to prevent a decrease in military spending?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that interpretation of natural positive action by biden is reasonable but uh, this action doesn't want to stop the war uh, will kill lots of people to try to get the the reoccupation going
**CONTEXT:** Is it reasonable to interpret Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan as a positive action, or is it more likely a political move to please the public, with the underlying intention to continue military spending elsewhere?

**RAY PEAT:** i i don't think so it's just what they interpret as food it doesn't isn't compatible with our well-being i noticed someone who asked the question i think had the name sandwich yeah yeah it's a matter of perspective the mosquito and hyena see lunch when they smell a person it's just in conflict with human preferences you have a good memory for remembering that
**CONTEXT:** Do you consider any animals, such as mosquitoes or hyenas, to be evil or malevolent, or is it simply a matter of their natural behavior and dietary needs conflicting with human preferences?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if there's actually a reason to hunt for food if they really need food. It's like a hyena, you can't say that they're having evil thoughts just because they have a different idea of what lunch is. That's exactly the context I was asking out. I mean, if a person is hungry... and if, let's say, food supply becomes a problem or it becomes too compromised, right, and all you have is a gun and you're in the wilderness, then I guess it's a matter of perspective. Yes, it's a living creature you're destroying, but really, you're not doing it for fun. You're doing it because you saw food.
**CONTEXT:** Is hunting for food, rather than for sport or pleasure, considered an immoral activity for humans, especially if food supply becomes compromised?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I'm convinced that ants, for example, have lived around people enough that they've learned... English or whatever language they're around. A couple of times when ants were bothering a roommate who was going to get some ant poison, I just firmly and clearly said, if you don't leave. That person is going to poison you. And they just disappeared.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that ants might have learned human languages. Can you elaborate on your experience with ants disappearing after you warned them about ant poison?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. It's obviously a very efficient language that can take a new, totally novel situation like that and size up. The nature of the problem and so the second and arriving got the idea in just a brief conversation.
**CONTEXT:** Could ants communicate through a form of sign language, and is their language efficient enough to convey complex information about novel situations, as seen in your ant example?

**RAY PEAT:** At a relatively low body temperature, they can be so quick withered. As they get very cold, then they slow down, but they think and calculate. Just with amazing efficiency, basically as smart as anyone.
**CONTEXT:** What makes ants so amazing to you, particularly their ability to think and calculate with amazing efficiency at relatively low body temperatures?

**RAY PEAT:** That would be the outcome of living in a high CO2 environment, I think. I'll find a substitute or a replacement.
**CONTEXT:** Do you believe that ants not aging, and only dying from predators or trauma, is a result of living in a high CO2 environment?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. That's really funny. Okay, there's a philosopher, you may have heard the expression, I'm blanking on the name, was a European philosopher. He said that, and pardon if this is too stereotypical, he said that love is the illusion that one woman is more special than another. I guess this can be extended to both sexes. In other words, you can fall in love many many times and you'll be just as good if it's with the right person.
**CONTEXT:** Do you believe the concept of a "soulmate" is a fairy tale, and can love be experienced with multiple individuals, similar to the idea that "love is the illusion that one woman is more special than another"?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the ontologists have usually been confused, getting mental processes confused with thinking about the nature of. Okay. reality itself and the idea of continuity and of interaction constantly. Everything is impressing its aspects on everything else. And so the nature of being is constantly changing as the world evolves. The substance itself is changing in the ontological sense, the same way a cell changes with experience.
**CONTEXT:** How do ontologists typically err in their understanding of being, and how does the concept of continuous interaction and change relate to the ontological nature of reality and the evolution of substance?

**RAY PEAT:** Nope. Like, I was reading a book and it was talking about Hans Selye and then it mentioned canon and it talked about, like, early concepts of stress. And then it mentioned William James. And I was like, what the heck? I thought he was a philosophical person. And then I found a few mentions of something called reservoirs of power. And he was basically talking about. How, if you use basically talking about what I interpreted to be like an extreme stress state, bringing on like another level of accomplishment, but it was just interesting because he's clearly talking about.
**CONTEXT:** Have you encountered William James' concept of "reservoirs of power," which suggests that extreme stress can unlock higher levels of accomplishment?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it involves things like getting up your pregnant alone basic level. And DHEA that strengthens the substance at all levels.
**CONTEXT:** What physiological mechanisms might be behind the extraordinary strength displayed by mothers saving their children, and can this "reservoir of power" be trained or improved through means like increasing pregnenolone and DHEA levels?

**RAY PEAT:** I try not to use my fingers too much, but I'm always tempted to smear the paint with my fingers. That's not a good idea generally, and to have a very good ventilation is the other essential thing.
**CONTEXT:** What are your recommendations for a safe and pro-thyroid approach to oil painting, including substances and habits to avoid, and what is your personal painting practice?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, very random in a sense because I got tired of doing it one way and so innovate constantly. The common themes though are milk, orange juice, eggs, cheeses, occasional cheese tacos. Various soups and so on. And orange juice seems to be one of the most difficult things to find.
**CONTEXT:** Could you describe a typical day of eating for you, highlighting common themes and any challenges you face in sourcing specific foods like orange juice?

**RAY PEAT:** No, bottled pasteurized orange juice. Oh, interesting. And do you have a brand? Because I know a lot of people, I get that question all the time and I haven't been in the U.S. for a long time and I'm not sure what's good or not. No, it was just trial and error. I don't remember the brand.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding orange juice, are you using concentrate or bottled pasteurized juice, and do you have a preferred brand?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, the i i think I there was a possible positive interpretation for biden wanting to do what trump wanted to do get get the army out of some of the wars and i i think the today's bombing probably was the factions that uh can't afford to have uh any decrease in uh war expending expenditure uh the trillions that have gone through the military uh industry in iraq syria and afghanistan they don't want to see the tap turned off to their endless money supply
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and do you believe the recent bombing indicates factions that benefit from war expenditure are trying to prevent a decrease in military spending?

**RAY PEAT:** The people getting conscious is the essential thing and it has to advance at a faster rate to prevent the death of the whole system.
**CONTEXT:** In the face of global challenges and the potential for a technocratic nightmare, what is the most crucial factor for preventing the collapse of the current system, and how can people contribute to this?
