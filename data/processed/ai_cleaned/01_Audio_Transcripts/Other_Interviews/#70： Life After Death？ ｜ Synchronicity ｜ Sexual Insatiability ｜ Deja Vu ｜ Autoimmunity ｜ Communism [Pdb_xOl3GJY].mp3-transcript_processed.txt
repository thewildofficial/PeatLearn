**RAY PEAT:** For several decades, it has seemed that they've been heavily manipulated by the CIA or whoever is it. The world manipulators are, and so I see their extreme reactions as being a test case for how fast they can get away with imposing stuff on different parts of the world, but I think the reaction there is strong enough that... Maybe they're going to hold back and think of something a little less crude for the US and Europe.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the possibility that the citizenry of the US are the last remaining threat to the power elite, and once subdued, the elite could pursue their agendas without interruption.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in one of her recent videos, Lee Merritt, an anti-vaxx physician, she said that in her state, the number of people who own guns would be the equivalent of, I forgot what it was, the fifth largest army in the world. They don't simply own guns, they also regularly shoot them. Well, maybe they're not on par with an active military, but they can put up probably a pretty decent resistance if things really start getting ugly.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the potential for armed resistance against government overreach.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even though the... firepower is like a million to one in favor of the Pentagon. The actual ground level situation, if you have a thousand people with little guns and a hundred soldiers with bazookas and tanks, it becomes a better balance.

**CONTEXT:** The host is questioning the Pentagon's ability to ensure the loyalty of its soldiers.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's the purpose of Biden's talking about dishonorable discharge for people who don't get vaccinated. He doesn't want any ambiguous people, ambivalent. about following orders. Once he gets the vaccine resistors out, then he's got a nice robot army.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the implications of soldiers being vaccinated.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they're really giving them the same vaccine that is causing the CDC's deaths and disability numbers to rise. Astronomically, then it's going to weaken the army, but I would suppose that they know better than than to give the regular vaccines to anyone they want to rely on.

**CONTEXT:** The host is referencing a situation where an advisory committee's recommendations were overruled.

**RAY PEAT:** Did you see that the CDC chief Wolensky, whatever her name is, she overruled her own advisory committee and basically......went against the recommendations. The advisory committee said, no, most people don't need a booster as corrupt as we are. That's too much even for us. And she said, nope, I'm going to overrule you.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the legality of an agency head overruling an advisory committee.

**RAY PEAT:** Some agencies that just really didn't take their own regulations seriously. So what I'm hearing is that these advisory committees are larger ceremonial. Basically, they're just sitting there and making mood decisions, but ultimately it's the agency head. Yeah, yeah, just for giving it a little prestige.

**CONTEXT:** The host is recalling an article about different vaccines being issued to government officials versus the general population.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm scrolling through looking for an article, but it was talking about during H1N1, the government class was issued different vaccines than the population. And so what you're saying is like, rooted in the mainstream article that I had come across at some point. Several people have been talking about the evidence that several different vaccines or non-vaccines have been issued. And you need to get the non-vaccines.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about a method for holding people accountable for forcing vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just a week after it emerged that German armed forces were getting a different kind of H1N1 vaccine to the general population, Der Spiegel magazine reports that the government will also get special treatment. What, you sent me Dolores Cahill's video and she was talking about an interesting way of kind of holding people accountable that were forcing vaccines on people. Is there, what? Can you talk a little bit more about it?

**RAY PEAT:** an experimental medical treatment that is worse than simple undefined coercion. But coercion is a felony in some states and a serious misdemeanor in all the rest. Federal law allows up to three years in prison for coercion. But these lawsuits, they would only apply to the actual doctors, the private industry doctors because the government officials have qualified immunity, right? Just like the cops. They cannot be sued for doing bad things to us.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the employer's role in enforcing regulations and the potential for employees to sue.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but your employer who is administering the illegal regulation, they would undoubtedly say it was just following orders. That has not been working very well. So even though OSHA can mandate the employer and say, look, we're going to fine you if you don't vaccinate your employees, and the employer does, then the employer is kind of caught between a rock and a hard place because both places can attack, right? Yeah, and if the employees make it expensive by suing their employers for damages. If they get fired, then the company has to start thinking which side they'll take. Many of the small ones will probably just simply fold and close shop, which I'm starting to think that may be one of the desired side effects, even if it's not planned.

**CONTEXT:** The host is referencing a plan to destroy the existing US economy.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the plan as expressed by Eric Schmidt more than two years ago. It was in line with Rockefeller Foundation and other long-range plans, but the Pentagon Committee that Eric Schmidt was the chairman of outlined the need to destroy the existing economy of the United States so that it could be quickly replaced by a digital artificial intelligence economy. That was expressed in 2019 before there was a pandemic.

**CONTEXT:** The host is describing the envisioned future economy.

**RAY PEAT:** So basically we all shop from Amazon, we all get our ID from Google and we all get our healthcare from a single mandatory provider. We don't even get our healthcare, we are administered healthcare against our wishes.

**CONTEXT:** The host is noting the impact of small businesses closing and large corporations growing.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and as the small businesses went broke. The Amazon and other giant corporations just about doubled their wealth.

**CONTEXT:** The host is mentioning a personal experience with real estate ownership changes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the office building where my office is basically the company that was renting it out to small companies like me. They went bankrupt and BlackRock, the large, the massive financial company moved in and bought all the real estate in DC.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the influence of large investment firms like Vanguard and BlackRock.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I saw someone analyzing the tentacles of Vanguard. They're everywhere with 5% or 6% ownership where they can have a strong influence. You know who I think did? They're just about identical with the World Economic Forum in their policies and reach. And guess who owns the private funds behind Vanguard? It's basically a who's who of the neocons. The Bush family, the Rumsfeld family, the Clintons, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So no surprises here. I guess how this thing is unfolding.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if there are any weaknesses in the plan or ways to escape it.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's going according to plan. You don't see any glitches in their, you know, push for the vaccine for everybody and for the lockdowns. I mean, I can tell as liberal and woke as D.C. is if another lockdown is attempted here. Even the liberals will revolt and probably hang the mayor if she tries something like that. That wouldn't be good to see. Right. I'm saying that even those people who were convinced initially that this is a good thing and they're trying to save the world and, you know, everybody should be vaccinated, they've had enough of basically being stuck at home with the screaming children and doing the work of both teachers and doctors and everything and doing their own work. So. Even the, I don't know, the coastal cities, I think the population has had enough. So I just don't see another lockdown unless there's a false flag operation with another virus or something militarily happens domestically.

**CONTEXT:** The host is mentioning potential alternative panic-inducing events.

**RAY PEAT:** They keep talking about alternative panic producers, like a sudden breakdown of food supply or banking. Trashes, internet shutdowns, and so on. They've been talking about that for so long. I think it means they have something in mind, not necessarily those.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the Appalachian region's low breast cancer death rate despite higher incidence, and whether it's a viable place to live.

**RAY PEAT:** In one of your articles, you talked about how the Appalachian region has the lowest death rate from breast cancer, even though the rates of breast cancer are higher than the rest of the country. And you also mentioned how extremely rural areas and poor areas will probably not notice whenever the collapse of the world economy arrives. So the question to me is like, is there any reason why you wouldn't consider going to the Appalachian region? Or you don't think it's high enough altitude? Or you think the culture there is not very, I don't know, friendly? Just curious.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are. Pockets of culture that could be acceptable, but other places, the xenophobia, basically, not just according to skin color, but just having the wrong accent of an outsider can be difficult. I would choose a completely different... country where they're used to tourists and Anglo people don't have such a xenophobia.

**CONTEXT:** The host is sharing an anecdote about a journalist's experience in Welch, West Virginia.

**RAY PEAT:** Ron Oones has an article on his website recently about a journalist who went to Welch. It's a town in southern West Virginia. It's the poorest town in the poorest county in the entire country. And he basically chronicled the decline of the area, which used to be booming in the 50s due to coal and kind of coincided with the peak of America, from what I'm understanding, you said that the 50s was really the time where people had everything they needed and nothing they didn't. And just the way he described the area is that because it's so poor, they've really opened up to tourists and they're really friendly. And there's basically very little internet and very little cell phone service and everything is dirt cheap there. So I don't know, it sounds very attractive to me. If I have to make a move from out of D.C., that will probably be the first place I would try.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the concept of poverty and its relation to internet culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think poverty in terms of the internet culture is a very creative, highly progressive thing.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about Monterrey, Mexico, and its perceived westernization.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it seems like people from Monterrey are, like, very westernized, and that's something that... Oh, Monterrey, Mexico? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, buildings there, I've seen slogans, Hitler was right. And the cops there are the nastiest I've ever seen in Mexico. It's not just Americanized, but it's... the worst industrialization can do to a government.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing how confusion can be used to inactivate people.

**RAY PEAT:** like to make people so confused that like it inactivates them because they don't know what to do because nothing makes sense. Yeah, I think it's natural for them to just talk through their hat and it turns out that that also is producing confusion and working in the direction they want people to go. Panic and confusion. That's basically what they do in the U.S.

**CONTEXT:** The host is noting the alignment of some radicals with major financial institutions.

**RAY PEAT:** You know, like the people that consider themselves radicals are aligned with Citibank and Wells Fargo with like the exact things they believe.

**CONTEXT:** The host is referencing the 2016 election and the Communist Party's support for Hillary Clinton.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, four years or 2016 election, I guess it was. I noticed that the Communist Party of the U.S. was supporting Hillary Clinton. I don't know if that's true, but I think it's true. That's a perfect example of confusing people to be utterly useless. Or it shows how little communist there is in the Communist Party of the United States.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about Ray's current work and if he wants to discuss it or move to questions.

**RAY PEAT:** OK, well, we can take this show in really any direction we want. Ray, did you want to you? You are working on something. Did you want to talk about that? Or we could go into questions. It really we have a free for all here. Questions are OK. I'm right in the middle of thinking about what to write about.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the complexity of discussing the immune system and vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** Something to do with development and immunity and health of all. The system has been warped so much that it's almost impossible to talk about how the immune system works, and so it's a perfect background for people saying ridiculous things about vaccines, for example, because there's no solid ground. For making a decisive and final argument about any issue in the immune system, you have to see the history going back more than 100 years to see why the situation is so muddled around the vaccine issue.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the scientific reception of Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger's ideas on immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** Did Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger, did anybody take them seriously? Was that morphostatic view of immunity ever a real contender against the traditional view? Jamie Cunliffe and his danger hypothesis, I think he got right to the center of the issue, but he hasn't been keeping up with his studies. In the last 15 or 20 years, he has hardly refined his thinking, what he did was very good and the Polly Matzinger ideas have been to some extent adopted by the mainstream, but in the process, their meaning has been lost, where the potential of the Polly Matzinger ideas have been lost. Polly Matzinger's system or perspective was to go the Cunliffe direction, that has instead gone the clonal selection right down the mainstream, everything staying the same.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for a simplified explanation of Polly Matzinger's perspective.

**RAY PEAT:** And if I could butcher that point of view, it's that tissue injury. It comes before any kind of bacteria or fungi or anything like that, right? And so if you're worried about immunity, you should be worrying about limiting tissue injury.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the body's primary concerns.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and our body is concerned with coming into existence and maintaining that existence and improving it if possible. The Cunliffe idea is that when something goes wrong, whether it's a mechanical, radiation or chemical damage, or an organism that somehow created damage in our system, that it's the damage that our body is concerned with. And in the process of fixing that damage, it takes out the pathogen, whether it's part of an organism or a toxin or even radiation damage, the body takes the measures necessary to maintain its integrity, and not really... thinking or designed for, or evolved to attack enemies or other than self. It's the process of optimizing the self that has a sideline. It happens that sometimes we develop the antibodies and so on for taking out viruses and bacteria and parasites.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the connection between chronic tissue injury and autoimmune conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** There are some studies showing that depending on the occupation, specific occupations had a much higher rate of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, like boxers, since they continuously damage their knuckles and various other joints, they're much more likely to develop this autoimmune condition. Hasn't this ever attracted attention of the mainstream medicine saying, well, there is a connection between chronic tissue injury and autoimmune conditions? Very little. 25 or 30 years ago I saw a single article in which they took a piece of cow cartilage and I forget who they injected it into, maybe rabbits. And when it was in a fresh condition, it didn't elicit antibodies. But if they just twisted the cartilage... gave it a little bit of mechanical stress, then it elicited antibodies. And that was like an image of how easy it is to induce the antibody reactions you see in autoimmune conditions.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about recent studies confirming endotoxin's role in rheumatoid arthritis flares.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you seen the recent studies, I know you've said this many times, but recently they confirmed that endotoxin is directly responsible for the flares of rheumatoid arthritis? Yeah, I've been following that general line that any injury to the tissue will bring up the so-called autoimmune system. The virus infections in some of the experiments were lethal if the organism wasn't allowed to produce antibodies, the virus that would bring up the antibodies. In itself, not produce the disease, but the antibody itself was there mostly to clear out the damaged tissue rather than to attack the virus.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if chronic low-grade endotoxemia can contribute to autoimmune conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** Do you think chronic low-grade endotoxemia, as they call it, can be a factor in many of these autoimmune conditions constantly causing this? Small level of injury, and then eventually, I guess, if the organism is energetically depleted severely, then sort of like a chronic autoimmune condition sets in? Yeah, and things like lupus and the famous named autoimmune diseases, including Sjogren's syndrome and thyroid. In some of these, such as lupus, I've seen very clear diagnoses of everything confirming that it was the so-called lupus condition causing the arthritis and other symptoms. But just by correcting... their vitamin D, calcium intake, progesterone, and thyroid. Those... all of the symptoms disappeared and they gradually started having a regression of the antibodies.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if a carnivore diet is necessary for autoimmune diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** Ray, so you're saying you don't need to go on the carnivore diet if you have an autoimmune disease? No, the... Yeah, keeping your... blood glucose up and your carbon dioxide high from oxidizing glucose. I think those are the basic anti-inflammatory things that will correct all of the autoimmune diseases.

**CONTEXT:** The host is making a joke about the carnivore diet and its potential benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** I was making a joke, but actually like when a person does eat an all meat diet and they do experience like a improvement in their symptoms, it probably would be a reduction in endotoxin, right? Yeah, so many people are eating indigestible stuff that causes inflammation of their intestine, and a meat diet will simply represent the absence of toxic indigestible foods, but that gives you very quick relief, like a fast, a week of fast, has... very often completely relieved the spondylitis types of arthritis and inflammation. But after you are on that diet for a while, the excitatory inflammatory effect of the unbalanced phosphate and iron intake. A very unbalanced diet eventually brings up other problems just as serious.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the role of endotoxin in the context of stress substances and parathyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** One last question about this, and then we can move on. In the complex biochemical web of all the stress substances, we were talking last time about PTH being like all roads lead to parathyroid hormone. Where would you put endotoxin in that whole mix? It's a constant threat everywhere. And the bad diet traces will make it take over and become dominant, but even with the best diet, just something like a physical shock or an emotional shock can reduce the barrier function of the intestine enough and slow the digestion. So that you absorb more endotoxin, so it's very controllable, but it's always a present danger.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the role of estrogen in increased gut permeability during stress.

**RAY PEAT:** I saw some old studies in the 50s and 60s showing that the main, they suggested that the main mechanism of the increased barrier permeability in the gut during stress was estrogen. Because when they basically gave an estrogen blocker, the effects of stress on the increased endotoxin in the blood disappeared. Do you share that view? Oh yeah, the capillaries are where the intestine barrier is most important. And everywhere in the body estrogen weakens the capillary barrier.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about regaining fertility with high-dose progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing stuff, thanks for that, or maybe should we do a little advertisement using air quotes here for your newsletter. Okay, the newsletter is available by email now and it's $28 US which can be paid through PayPal at RayPete'snewsletter at gmail.com. You can also order all of Ray's books from PMS to menopause, progesterone and orthomolecular medicine, generative energy, my favorite, mind and tissue, nutrition for when. And then Progeste from Keenogen. So you can email Katherine to purchase Progeste Keenogen at gmail.com and each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone. And while we're on the topic of progesterone, I'm going to kick questions off here with Marcelo's question. And he says, Hey, Danny, can you ask Ray if he had ever seen or heard of a woman regaining her fertility taking high dose progesterone? We're talking to someone who has been infertile. Infertile for a decade or more.

**RAY PEAT:** When I was teaching nutrition classes there were several women who said they had been infertile for more than 10 years and it was a three months class and usually there were two or three people during that class who would suddenly get pregnant just with a... almost all of them just with the diet changes, but it was to increase their progesterone and thyroid and to get their estrogen under control. And one woman, a medical doctor, who hadn't had... she had a diagnosed ovarian failure when she was... I think about 35, and by carefully taking a blood test about every week or two, she imitated the natural hormones of the cycle with small amounts, generally, of both thyroid and progesterone. That doesn't take a huge amount when it's at the right time, and I think... I forget her exact age, but she was in her 40s and had been perfectly infertile for over 10 years. And had a baby very quickly as soon as she got her blood test showing the hormones in the right range.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the importance of posture and health, and whether good posture comes from good health or vice versa.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing. Thanks for that. Okay. Okay, first question. Ray's thoughts on the importance of posture and health. Does good posture come from good health or vice versa? I think good health makes you feel springy and energetic and so you take on the aspect of a springy, energetic person. If everything hurts and you're tired, naturally everything is going to slump.

**CONTEXT:** The host is referencing a past discussion about DHEA and testosterone affecting posture.

**RAY PEAT:** I think a long time ago, you wrote to somebody I knew and you were specifically talking about maybe DHEA and testosterone, like causing a lot of the slumping. I mean, of course, those are energetic types of therapies. Yeah, and the pregnenolone and progesterone work with them. The fascia that hold up your skin are... even though they're basically fibroblast-type cells, in the absence of those protective steroids, they go limp. And given just pregnenolone, for example, but the others all have a similar effect, just a dose of pregnenolone will cause the fascia to contract. showing that they have the properties of smooth muscle cells besides being the tough connective tissue that holds your whole body organs in place. For example, if the fascia get loose, the tendons and capsules around tissues all get slack. And it can lead to the prolapse of the uterus, for example.

**CONTEXT:** The host is sharing an anecdote about a woman whose uterus normalized without surgery.

**RAY PEAT:** Several months ago, a woman told me that her doctor had planned to do surgery to pin her uterus back where it should be. But she was using a mixture of DAGA and progesterone, both topically and orally. And her uterus normalized, no surgery needed to hold it in place. That same thing, where it happens throughout your body, undoubtedly it's going to affect your posture and the feeling of strength in your joints.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if apes are devolved human beings.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing, thanks for that. Okay. Does Ray think it's possible that apes are actually devolved human beings? Thank you. Yeah, I've talked about that a lot, but if the vegetarians found a very congenial environment where they could eat all the vegetables, they wanted their intestine would get bigger and bigger and their brain would get smaller. Cortex and so on. The parts of this have all been demonstrated. The more fibrous your diet is, the bigger your colon gets. And you can cause radical changes in a growing monkey, for example, just by the amount of fiber in the food. And a poorer diet. Very powerfully limits the growth of your brain. And I don't know about the distribution of body hair, but the length of the arms and legs is also something that's very responsive to gestational conditions.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the possibility of evolution working in reverse and devolving into lower-level species.

**RAY PEAT:** Georgi, I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but do you want to ask Ray that question you talked about last time about the divergence of people that are following the rules versus, well maybe I can just ask him. You'd probably do a better job. Do you know what I'm talking about? Which one? What do you mean by following the rules? I mean, I thought that evolution can work backwards too. Basically, if the environment is not... energetically conducive to higher... to maintaining higher complexity of species, it's not just that apes are devolved humans, we may devolve into a lower-level species.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the nutritional value of leaves and fruits for monkeys.

**RAY PEAT:** My question is related to this, ladies, is that, well, if the monkeys eat mostly leaves and fruit, aren't the leaves very rich? um in the keto acids so why would that be a poor diet i mean seems like they can get plenty of protein because they're full of toxins and lately i've been talking more about the the causes of human development with a big brain and the areas where the biggest brains uh of fossils have been found and uh I think if you look at the uh idea of evolving in reverse when you eat too many leaves uh if you instead of leaves if you have a very good climate that produces huge amounts of various fruits the extreme concentration of calories uh you can you either get the necessary proteins from the right selection of fruits or you could occasionally add eggs and bugs and so on but the an abundance of fruit would provide the high calorie guarantee you that is needed for maintaining the very expensive brain the hunting diet if you eat lots of meat which some evolutionists have suggested the meat even though it provides the essential proteins doesn't necessarily provide the very high. Concentration of of glucose and the materials for metabolizing glucose. It tends to cause hypoglycemia. In fact, the more meat you eat, the more insulin you secrete to handle the disposition of the protein. And if you aren't taking in carbohydrate, then the meat will give you chronically increased cortisol and a tendency towards hypoglycemia from the maintained high insulin.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about Klaus Schwab's advocacy for eating bugs.

**RAY PEAT:** You're telling me Klaus Schwab warning us all to eat bugs? He's on the right track? What was that? Klaus Schwab from the World Economic Forum. You know he's all about us eating bugs. As soon as possible. Oh, damn. Yeah, they're I suppose adequate protein. Once I had some very nice things that seemed to be like little fish patties, but after I'd eaten them, they turned out to be mosquito larvae.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about locust tacos in Mexico.

**RAY PEAT:** There's a Mexican restaurant in DC and they serve tacos made from locusts. Is this like a common thing in Mexico or is this some kind of a...素材 monstrosity that they concocted here. I never heard of the locusts but around the lakes you've seen the butterfly net fishermen on Lake Potsquare probably. Yeah. I don't know if they still do it but they used to have these big nets that they would skim the mosquito larvae. So they could collect them in really nutritious quantities and they had a pleasant, mildly fishy taste.

**CONTEXT:** The host is commenting on the "bug agenda."

**RAY PEAT:** That has to be just pure punishment, like the bug, bug agenda. The oligarchs are just like mad and they want to abuse the citizens. And everybody eats bugs in Thailand, that's what I remember.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about life after death.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing stuff, thanks for that, Ray. What does Dr. Pete, what Dr. Pete thinks about life after death? I never really think about it. I have read lots of discussion and more or less evidence. A physics professor, one of the most famous physical chemists in the world. I always have trouble remembering his last name, but he became notorious at the University of Texas or Texas A&M maybe for doing experiments that showed transmutation of heavy metals into gold. After he retired, having experienced the powers that come to bear on anyone who thinks outside of the system, such as believing that transmutation can happen at non-nuclear energy levels, cold fusion, for example, he wrote about... the history of communicating with the dead and his book, The New Paradigm, I think it's called, has lots of interesting historical discussions of fairly convincing interesting information transfer from... post-living people to presently living people. I wish I had saved it.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the concept of the living state as a degree of electronic desaturation.

**RAY PEAT:** There was actually a great response to this question on the YouTube comments section, but they started with St. Georgie's... The living state is the degree of electronic desaturation, if that's correct, and they were saying like when you die, you go down to a lower level of energy metabolism and a lower level of consciousness. Do you... does that sound right to you?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's on a completely different level. The neutrino-C idea as the ether for interaction of all substance, physical things like gravity and electricity, the common medium. Neutrino C actually has pretty good evidence and the Neutrino C can resonate for a very low energy of the appropriate frequency, very low energy patterns. That can influence this ether or neutrino-c, and I think that's where the telepathic and transgenerational communication, how it's working.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if the soul could be a standing wave in the neutrino-c.

**RAY PEAT:** So do you think what we call the soul may be something like a standing wave in the neutrino-c? Yeah, exactly. Thank you for your question.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for a layman's explanation of the physical body disappearing into the neutrino-c.

**RAY PEAT:** OK, for a layman, so the physical body disappears and we melt into this neutrino-c, something like that? Yeah, I'm not sure if it's still on the internet, but there was a very good video doing the physical energy calculations called No More Secrets, a Canadian......psychologist who died. Persinger? Yeah. That just shows the physical energy possibilities for these externalized patterns that people can tune into.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if déjà vu is a resonance with past life brain states.

**RAY PEAT:** So do you think the principle of déjà vu that people experience, like they have seen that before, is basically resonating with a... past, with the brain state of not even their own, basically, of a previous life, so to speak, or a person that, I don't know, a very similar energetically wise, if we can say that their soul maybe still being in the in the neutrality. So what we experience as ancestral memories could be just resonating with those standing waves that are still there.

**RAY PEAT:** But the déjà vu where you are... experiencing something that you can actually see it coming at you, so you know, in some sense, you've already seen it. But our ordinary consciousness, we are constantly foreseeing a little bit of the future. And we ordinarily only project it two or three years. Maybe four or five seconds into the future. But when you're listening to someone sing a tune or make a sentence, you can anticipate what's coming and there's no simple dividing line between what's immediately past and what's immediately to come. The brain is, in ordinary things like talking and singing, the brain is very oriented towards forming an image of what's about to come. And that can vary just a well-stimulated brain. I can go much farther into hearing what's coming and interpreting what has just passed. If you aren't attending to someone in a lecture and suddenly at the end of a sentence, they say a word that is important to you, you can wake up. Replay, get back to the beginning of that sentence, even though you weren't consciously recording it. So you can make your brain back up and deliver something that you missed.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the lack of a clear dividing line between past and future.

**RAY PEAT:** I was just going to say that the lack of clear dividing line between the immediate past and the incoming immediate future, I think that line actually seems to extend way further out because there are studies... published showing that people that have learned something as little kids completely forgot it and they went through some kind of a trauma where they basically usually an electric shock of sorts suddenly remember everything in vivid detail from things that happened decades ago and were and managed to basically reconstruct through a story that was later verified because I guess that event was recorded somewhere that they basically had an incredibly detailed memory. that they were able to connect with. It was a very distant past. We're talking several decades.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and if you think of the incredible detail in that kind of memory that we're ordinarily completely unconscious of, that kind of extreme detail I think can extend into the future. Even though you're not attending to it, sometimes the déjà vu experience is when something slips in your brain and you forget to ignore enough of what's coming in and suddenly you see what's to come for maybe 10 or 15 seconds ahead.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about synchronicity and its relation to energetic states.

**RAY PEAT:** What do you think of synchronicity? Do you think it's a sign of us resonating well with the environment? It seems to occur when people are in particularly good energetic state and attentive to their environments. Yeah, there are a couple of very good books on synchronicity. One by F. David Peet is a good one. It's pretty much the history of... stories about it, but I think that's true that things are, again, the ether or the neutrino sea, I think, is guiding causality enough that sometimes things will choose to happen because you're ready to perceive them.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about people speaking foreign languages after brain surgery.

**RAY PEAT:** I see and one last question related to the I guess ancestral memories that there have been several published cases of people undergoing brain surgery and then when they wake up suddenly start speaking fluently a foreign language that they had never heard before in their lives. What do you think could explain that? Would it be a resonance with a I guess with a dead soul or a previous brain state or what could it be because they've never learned that language in their lifetime?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the cases I read about many years ago was a woman who had been a cleaning lady in some academic organization. She had spent years scrubbing floors and emptying wastebaskets for professors who spoke different languages. But just... being present. When she had a brain accident, suddenly she could speak the languages that she had been around, but not knowingly attending to.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the brain's ability to resonate with past events.

**RAY PEAT:** I see. So the brain is capable of resonating with past events, though not always on demand. Some kind of a trigger is needed. Yeah, the... Aldous Huxley took up one of the ideas that was introduced, I think, at the end of the 19th century, and thought of the cortex of the brain as a filtering device, and when something damages the cortex enough to get it out of the way, the... full complexity of reality can break through. And then depending on the intellectual or consciousness state of the person practicing yoga, they can tune into that and basically have access to all of the events that have already happened.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the development of the "new paradigm" and tuning into knowledge.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that sort of thing, the new paradigm has really been developing for thousands of years. In pretty much all of the cultures around the world, there's this idea that under certain circumstances you can tune in and know much more than ordinary knowing could produce. Like the George Wesson's story of the magic mushroom, he was a... Eventually it turned out that he was working with the government, but he was at the time just a hobbyist, a rich person wanting to investigate the magic mushroom culture of Mexico. was to, because the people talked about the ceremonies as their mail service, just so he could be there watching their procedures. He asked what was happening with his son in New York, and the shaman told him that something very serious was going on. When he got back to Mexico City, he called his son and found that he had got a draft notice that day and was in an emotional state. There are lots of stories like that where the mushroom takers can focus in on something in very, very remote places.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if learning is a change in the frequency of a standing wave in the neutrino sea.

**RAY PEAT:** So the process of learning, would it be fair to say that it's basically the change of the structure or even the frequency of that standing wave in the neutrino sea as we observe and interact with new events? Is that how we learn? I think so. Since very, very early, I don't really know when I concretized it. I began seeing consciousness as something electronic or finer, either the neutrino-C or a sort of coherence of electrons, sort of like the conductive electrons in the metal. I've visualized the process of consciousness in the brain. As being this sort of jelly-like ethereal material that we push around with our biological activity in the nerves. But what's really happening is that we are the resonance process in this conductive electronic or sub-electronic. And so knowing, if that's what our everyday knowing is, is doing at spaces, then those exceptional experiences of knowing things we shouldn't know would fit in with the idea that we are found. Adopted a way of using our cortex to filter out those ultra fine details of reality.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the safety of dental implants.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing stuff, thanks for that, guys. Please ask Dr. Repeat about the safety of dental implants. Are there issues in terms of inflammation / autoimmune response or toxicity? Thank you. The stories I've read about the... failures have made such an impression on me that all of the successes don't seem very important when you hear about someone's jaw falling off, basically. The bone disappearing, the jawbone disintegrating to the point that they have to put a metal jawbone in.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the health implications of a plastic retainer.

**RAY PEAT:** I kind of forget about this, but I have a I got my tooth knocked out and like a long time ago in 2009 I have a plastic retainer like what kind of devastating things is that doing to my health do you think? Just a plastic over your tooth, I don't think hurts anything especially well It's like a it's one that covers basic. It's like the front left tooth so it covers all the teeth on the top It's kind of ruining a lot of the back teeth because it's constantly there.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I don't think it does any deep harm, but the idea of putting a foreign object, the teeth are separated from the bone by very special barriers, but to dig right into the bone and put a foreign object inside the bone, that just doesn't make biological sense. Sometimes the body can handle it and you won't lose your job bone, but when it does, there's hardly any repair that's satisfactory.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if dentures are safer than dental implants.

**RAY PEAT:** So would you say dentures will be safer? Basically they can do the exact same thing without the implantation risks? Yeah, all kinds of restoration are preferable. Crowns can often be done on a basically destroyed tooth.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the purpose of booster shots and their relation to variants.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing. This one's from our friend Dodie. She says, we know the purpose of the vaccine, if that's what you want to call it, but what is the purpose of the booster shot for COVID and how does it relate to the variant? Oh, the increasing insights into the appearance. of the variant so-called. It increasingly looks clear that the variants are nothing but the side effects of the various nucleic acid treatments. The first reaction of people like Luc Montagnier was that the. Variants were caused by the immunity to the first one and so that the virus would mutate and become maybe more and more infectious. But usually that kind of resistance of the host generally leads to it becoming less deadly while being more infectious. But. As the information has come in, it looks like there might not be any such thing as a Gamma, Delta, whatever variant, but simply that it's a name that's being given to the symptoms produced by the original vaccine. And so if that's the case, then the booster shot is going to be a Gamma, Delta, whatever variant, but simply that it's a name that's being given to the symptoms produced by the original vaccine. If it's the real vaccine material, it's just going to produce more so-called variants, more vaccine symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if Ray identifies as a social anarchist.

**RAY PEAT:** Great stuff. Thanks, Dodie. Thanks, Ray. Okay. Does Ray identify himself as a social anarchist in the sense of excluding rent sinking, forming worker cooperatives, freeing the individual from authority, collectivism, direct democracy, mutual aid, et cetera? No, I think organization, if it's allowed to develop the systems, have been very quick to kill any incipient organization. But to the extent that they can spontaneously come into existence, you'll have consumers who can control them. Cooperatives and producers, cooperatives, and the organization will be what suits the people on the ground level, but if that's allowed to develop, it will develop, and they will find the best way for these ground level. Co-operative organizations to cooperate on a larger and larger scale. I think that's a natural course of development. If some of these spontaneous cooperative groups could somehow take over the state, then you'd have the problem of... maybe the consumers having more control than the producers. But if it goes up from the ground up, you're going to have to solve the problems of each level of organization as they come about. So I don't think there's any problem with evolving even a world-level state. As long as it's based on these spontaneous surface level.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if the social and political structure is a metabolite of the people's health.

**RAY PEAT:** Is there any truth to, I mean, the way at least looks to me is that the social structure and the political structure are in a sense a metabolite of the health of the people that are building them. So if the people are relatively healthy, they can thrive under a variety of systems without them being. Exploitatory and degenerating into the worst that a particular system has to offer. So instead of worrying about a specific political system, wouldn't be the most prudent thing would be to just sort of like optimize or maximize individual health and then see what kind of structure emerges from there?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because different cultures, for example, military. oriented cultures are, there's evidence that they are very tightly connected with child abuse and body mutilation and repression of sexuality in children. Those things are closely tied with sadistic group policies and sadistic war-making, head-chopping and so on, and you don't want one of those societies to take over a larger government. It has to be basically an indulgent social organization that doesn't oppress its own children. But in a group of healthy people, that sort of society wouldn't form to start with. My concern is that as soon as we say, oh, we should prevent that sort of culture taking over and then establishing itself, then the only way to fight such a vicious thing is through basically other kinds of violence, which ultimately tends to be kind of self-defeating because if you continue this conflict long enough, that's just not happened. Even the good, peaceful culture will eventually militarize itself through this constant conflict that has been going on. So it seems to me that the only way to ensure a sort of like semi-stable existence of a large group of people is to make sure that as many of them are as healthy as possible, and then natural or non-exploitative order should arise.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the problem is that an urge to conquer tends to... lead to conquest, and that involves such things as being hostile, outlying good food, for example. Conquest can take the form of establishing a medical system that doesn't allow... preventive methods says everything has to be focused on killing the pathogens, cutting out the defects and so on. So the society that asserts the importance of being healthy is itself in danger of offending the sadistic cultures. Stimulating oppression from them.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.

**RAY PEAT:** So I guess there is some truth to the saying that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom, even for healthy people? I think so, until two or three generations you might outgrow the sadistic tendencies that have been inculcated for so long.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the role of estrogenic predominance in sexual orientation and paraphilic disorders.

**RAY PEAT:** 164 people watching right now. Thank you guys so much. Sincerely appreciate you giving this episode a like. All donations here will be sent to Ray. I don't think I sent you the last donation. I've been very busy. But I will send them to you, I promise. Georgi Dinkov, thank you so much for being here. Obviously, Ray, thank you so much for doing this so regularly. Such a pleasure to have you on. Okay, this next question. What does Ray think? What does he think is the role of estrogenic predominance in sexual orientation and paraphilic disorders? So sexual fetishes, nymphomania, excessive masturbation, and porn addiction. What do you think about that, Ray?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, one of the problems with high estrogen is that it doesn't allow sexual satisfaction. It's the......trod to seek satisfaction, but it requires a good balance of thyroid and progesterone and androgens to achieve satisfaction. And so it can lead to such things as lymphomania or insatiability. At the same time, it has this toxic excitatory effect on the brain, so it can contribute energy and vitality is tending to keep estrogen subdued.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if celibacy is dangerous in long-term relationships.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing. So a similar track. Is celibacy dangerous in a relationship that will be long-term for the foreseeable future? I think it's always a result of an imposition. Like these sadistic cultures suppress. Women's sexuality in particular and they start very early by often mutilations including circumcising both girls and boys to remove the satisfaction of sexual interest. I think it's always a result of an imposition.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about Ray's thoughts on homosexuality.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing, thank you for that Ray. Okay. Last sex question here. Not to put him in the public ire, but does Ray, what does Ray think of homosexuality, oh, but does Ray think homosexuality is optimal normalcy? If it's optimal or what? I don't really know what they meant by that, but I guess your take on homosexuality.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the gist of the question is the person thinks that homosexuality is driven by hormonal imbalances and it's not in an optimal healthy sexual state. Yeah, the evidence from history as well as animal experiments are that you can produce it by stress during gestation. Everyone is abnormal in some way, so it isn't something that I think law should be involved in regulating in any way. But I think the evidence is clear that it's a particular product of both prenatal and early life stresses.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about studies showing finasteride can induce homosexuality in animals.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you seen the more recent studies demonstrating that finasteride can pretty reliably induce homosexuality in animals? No, I haven't seen that.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, well, I mean, I guess you can never know if an animal is homosexual or not, but they started displaying the male animals started behaving like females and started courting the other normal males and assumed like a mating position and, you know, basically started behaving like females. And when they stop administering the finasteride. Basically, they were they became asexual they stopped behaving like females, but they didn't revert back to behaving like males either and only when they were administered very high doses of testosterone. Did they sort of not completely sort of revert back to acting like normal male sexually?

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the timing of the study.

**RAY PEAT:** How long ago was that done? That study is well, it's not that all I think it was from the late 90s.

**CONTEXT:** The host is linking cultural stress to homosexuality.

**RAY PEAT:** What it did. Tag along with what you said, if a culture is promoting stress in every way, shape or form, and then stress promotes homosexuality, it's not like a moral judgment on a person. They're just expressing what the signals from the environment are telling them to do, right?

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about Ray's thoughts on Adolf Hitler and his policies.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Thanks for that, Ray. Sincerely appreciate it. Okay, let me... Okay, I get this question a lot, so this is why I'm asking. What are Ray's thoughts on Adolf Hitler? And his expulsion of banking cartels and masons from Nazi Germany. And then the other part of this question was a little too hot for YouTube. He had many right perceptions, but in a very crooked way. He convinced the voters that Germany had been close to revolution. And the fear was that the voters would gradually support a Bolshevik type of government. And so all of the money and bank powers of Germany and England and the U.S. concentrated on supporting him as the barrier against Bolshevism. And he developed a language that would convince the voters who wanted social welfare, guaranteed employment, health care and so on, good transportation and so on. He talked to them and said he would give them socialism. And that was the end of it. But he told the bankers there would be a national socialism that wouldn't threaten to benefit anyone outside of German society. And so he had lots of progressive pro-worker things for German citizens. But at the same time, he was... following the instructions of the money system, and his anti-Semitism was partly just to convince the working people that he had an awareness of the manipulators of money and the banks. He really was working with some of the top Zionists and they wanted pressure on European Jews so that they would move to Israel and set up a new country. So there was a collaboration between the Zionists and Hitler for a while, but it finally turned into the murderers. They were anti-Semitism, but the things such as the anti-masonry, that was part of the German culture at the time. He used those things to keep his mass support, along with giving them cheap little cars and high-speed highways. Things that simply made the Germans able to be distracted from what he was doing elsewhere.

**CONTEXT:** The host is drawing a parallel between ants and national socialists.

**RAY PEAT:** Same with bees. I wasn't joking when I said acts were observed ants were observable national socialists their organism also their Their organism also strategy is clearly designed around a collective effort to provide for reproduction of the tribes genetic material And they have a rigid deterministic cast system Where sterile ants are sterile their whole lives and will readily give up their lives to protect the productive Queens But at the same time, individual ants can be intelligently altruistic one ant to another. So it's not, I mean, it's a hierarchical structure, but they're also altruistic to each other at the same case when they actually should be competitive if this is truly a national socialistic system, right?

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if Ray is a communist.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and there are lots of good people doing good things in the United States for example even though the system is definitely not designed to have good people doing good things. Let me ask the question which Danny didn't but it's right there. Somebody asked it. Is Ray Pete a communist? And I know it's a very loaded word. Well I thought you answered it already that's why I didn't answer it. But no there was another one where he's a social anarchist but somebody asked directly is Ray Pete a communist? There you go.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure what the difference is if you define either of them very thoughtfully. There's not really any difference. You want to get rid of tyranny, and you want to have cooperation, and the idea of communism essentially goes back to Christianity as the main source of those ideas. has developed a lot of historical confusion around it, but the Christian beliefs are at base, you could say, that they're predominantly communistic.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about William James's view on Christ and communism.

**RAY PEAT:** Didn't William James say that Christ was a communist or something along those lines? A lot of people have, yeah, because of the... his attitude towards money changers and the common person, even the outcasts of the system, he was definitely a bottom-up person. And you can call that anarchism or communism either way.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about Christianity without the involvement of the church.

**RAY PEAT:** Do you think it's possible to have Christianity without the involvement of the church, and by the church I specifically mean corrupt structures like the Vatican with their history of child abuse and financial machinations and supporting the Nazis and everything else? Yeah, I think one of the most interesting books on Christianity was Wilhelm Reich's book The Murder of Christ. And he gets much of his guidance from the New Testament.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the first steps for morbidly obese individuals to tackle their weight.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing. Okay, let me search real fast for, I skipped this question. Okay, in regards to an extremely morbidly obese person in their 40s and 50s, what are the first steps they should do to tackle their weight? Would some fasting regimen like Alternative Day or OMAD be feasible in this situation simply because of the danger posed by their weight? If they're 300 plus pounds and they simply might not live long enough to take the slower PUFA depleting bioenergetic route? And what were the alternatives? Well, they were saying, should I fast or should I do one meal a day? Or I guess another possibility with liposuction. If somebody is extremely obese, what do you think? And they don't have a lot of time, what do you think they should do?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the alternatives are extremely harmful and I've wondered whether there might not be a type of surgery to remove... Hello? Oh, yeah. Do we just lose Ray? Yeah, we did. Okay. I thought it had froze. Okay. Let's... Ray, are you there? Yeah. Oh, sorry. You just dropped out for a second. I think we can just start that question over if you remember.

**RAY PEAT:** The amount of damage is something that can be investigated. The way liposuction is usually done... just sort of stirring a suction tube around in the fat causes lots of nerve damage as well as liberation of free fats into the system. And there might be surgical ways of removing a large mass such as abdominal fat while doing less systemic damage. A good local anesthesia, for example, I think it might be possible to unload 40 or 50 pounds of fat without doing terrible damage. But a fast, especially if you're fat, that fat is going to travel through your brain and liver. and other organs on its way out of the body. And so you're exposing yourself to a great prolonged toxicity. Even though I've seen someone fast steadily for two months to get over extreme obesity, I'm not sure that you're... lifetime effect on your health is going to be worth it.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about chemical interventions like dinitrophenol for obesity.

**RAY PEAT:** What about chemical interventions? I mean, there is a tremendous track record of things like dinitrophenol being able to cure, effectively, even extremely morbidly obese people, of course, under medical observation because it can easily kill you if you overheat. Would something like that be considerable? Overdosing on thyroid does the same thing. At the right level, it can increase your safe oxidation of fats while helping to suppress the toxic random oxidation. Both DNP and thyroid, carefully controlled, can reduce the toxicity of getting rid of the fat. I think a diet high in calcium and vitamin D should be part of the program because they will support safe oxidation and provide the nutrients that, for example, a high milk diet will keep your metabolic rate higher and suppress the... the toxic effects.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about other practices for positive brain effects besides painting.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing. Thank you for that. Okay, about 10-15 more minutes here and then we'll let you go, Ray. Thank you so much. Thank you, Georgie Dinkov. Appreciate it. Okay, let me define this question. Aside from painting, does Mr. Pete recommend any other practice for positive brain effects such as knitting, sculpting, etc? Oh, whistling, singing, playing a French horn. Playing a recorder whistle, playing the cello or violin, all kinds of things that are very structured and stimulating.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if gardening and tending to animals also have positive brain effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Wouldn't things like gardening and tending to animals also work? Oh, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking how to meet the need for belonging and connection in the current culture.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing. Okay. James says, as a social animal, humans seem to have a need to belong and experience connection with other people. How can we meet this need in the current authoritarian anti-life culture and avoid a life of atomized loneliness? I don't know, but I keep looking around for what people can do. Just the simplest. For personal contact, if you can get three or four or more people together with a similar interest, such as little music groups, something that is harmless looking to the society, but getting people together, they're going to talk about. Their fate under the present system, so anything you can think of to put people into personal contact, I think is going to eventually lead to a political progression organization.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about pheromones and their changes during menopause.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, this person says, on the most recent radio network interview, Ray talked a little about pheromones. He said a woman's emitted pheromones can change the way she is on birth control and again when she stops. Does Ray know whether what a woman emits and what she responds to changes in the lead up to menopause? And can a man's pheromones change as well, making him less attractive to his partner? Can a woman's lack of interest in her long-term partner be due to pheromones? And last thing, can anything be done to restore the pheromones to attractiveness again?

**RAY PEAT:** A good diet and hormone activity is the best thing to optimize the pheromones. But it's true that... Both men and women have less of the attractive pheromones and probably gradually increase some repellent pheromones. I think little kids emit anti-sexual pheromones that I think they induce parental... attitudes towards them, and then around puberty, the chemistry changes towards sexual attraction. And to a great extent, I think the same attractants are emitted by both men and women, but with some subtle variations that I don't think anyone has a very clear... idea of what a woman's attraction chemistry is, but I'm sure it contains some of the steroids that many met.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for a definition of pheromones.

**RAY PEAT:** Super simple question, but what is a pheromone? Like what, it's released by hair follicle? It can be any chemical that is volatile enough that you can......detect it at some distance from the emitter. Fatty acids of different sorts work for insects and other animals. But the most clearly defined human pheromones are derivatives of androgenic steroids.

**CONTEXT:** The host is promoting Progesti and the newsletter.

**RAY PEAT:** Amazing. Let's do one last break here real fast for talk about... Progesti, and then I'll ask you one or two more questions. Let you go, Ray. OK, so Progesti from Kinogen emailed Catherine to purchase a bottle. A bottle she ships very quickly. She packs it in this like mylar or something that protects it during shipping. It's Kinogen at Gmail dot com. Each bottle Progesti contains thirty four hundred milligrams. I have a photo here. This is DHEA in this little thing here. And then I have a little tiny $15 scale and then I mix it in this glass thing I got from Japan, which I'll never go back to again. Glass of Japan, Japan, unfortunately, because I will never travel again, unfortunately, and then you can, the newsletter is available by email now is $28, which can be paid through PayPal. And I mean, best deal on the internet for raised by monthly newsletter and you can also purchase his books, and those are basically collectors items and I'd recommend everybody obtain them.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about supplements or diets to counteract mRNA vaccine side effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, so, so again, I think we've talked about this many, many times but I do I guess we can't talk about it enough so this person says, if forced to be inoculated, are there any supplements or diet that will counteract the harmful side effects of the mRNA vaccine? The first thing is to consider your defenses and resistances, how you can avoid getting it put into and if you are you can find alternatives such as a certificate of pre-existing immunity or maybe a form of a vaccine that doesn't contain the nucleic acids because the present ignorance the reason the experiment is being done is because it has never been studied in humans before and so you don't know what the outcome is and as long as it's experimental it's on its surface meaning we don't know what the long-range outcome is going to be and the animal evidence is that there could be terrible long-range effects. Such as increased susceptibility to all kinds of infectious diseases or to cancer or to brain degeneration or sterility. So, if you allow yourself to be vaccinated, you're taking a big experimental gamble.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the disease effects of the virus and vaccine.

**RAY PEAT:** The outcome is what you want. Well, no, as long as you're alive. Are you disturbed? Good. The fact that the so-called variants are tremendously increased in the people who had the vaccine suggests that the disease effects of the virus and vaccine are essentially identical. And that is primarily through the toxic effects of the spike protein. And that is a fundamental and total promotion of inflammation in every system. Hypertension, development of autoimmune diseases. Everything you can think of is promoted, which is promoted by androtensin, is going to be a possible outcome of a vaccine. The androtensin receptor blockers and antihistamines and aspirin were known way back 10 or 15 years ago. To protect against the toxic effects of the spike protein, the toxicity of that protein has been studied now for a long time and so the Chinese were among the first to realize that androtensin receptor blockers, antihistamines and aspirin simply by being anti-inflammatory. were the first things to resort to.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if mRNA in the vaccine uses the same mechanism as the virus to enter cells.

**RAY PEAT:** So does the mRNA that's in the vaccine, does it use the same mechanism through the ACE2 enzyme to get inside of the cell? Well, once you get the RNA in, it doesn't matter whether it's free RNA that comes into you after being shared by someone. Who is vaccinated most likely is either in an exosome form or as free RNA coming out of their breath and skin and saliva and getting into your system. So what I'm getting at is there is no way to prevent the mRNA present in the vaccine from getting inside of the cell, similar to how we can prevent the virus from getting inside of the cell, the wild virus. By giving something like Losartan or anything that blocks that specific entry pathway? Nothing I know of. They're using a lipid for getting the RNA quickly into the cells, but other studies show that you don't really need the lipid. It will be taken up even in a naked RNA form. That's just a tendency of cells is to take up circulating molecules and sometimes they can be either assimilated or destroyed. This particular fat happens to take the highest concentration in the ovaries but distributes it in every kind of cell in the body.

**CONTEXT:** The host is sharing a personal anecdote about a housing situation related to vaccine status.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm moving a house in November and I found a place that I really liked and we were doing all the paperwork and the owner was like, can you send me your vaccine papers? And I was like, yeah, there's no, no way that's going to happen. And they're like, oh yeah, you can't move in there. I was like, okay. In Mexico? A gringo owned the house. And so it's not a, but it's just a sign of times, a sign of the future, I guess, or things that come. There's a very, very. interesting, entertaining situation.

**CONTEXT:** The host is thanking Ray and asking for parting words.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, we're going to say something, right? No, OK, OK, repeat, thank you so much. Stay on the line for just one minute, right? Georgi Dinkov, thank you so much. Is there any parting words, right? Nope.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking Georgi Dinkov for parting words.

**RAY PEAT:** And Georgi Dinkov, any parting words? Well, I guess to me, the Appalachians start looking more and more attractive if it's extremely rural and poor, it has no Internet and no cell phone service. I think it should be considered guys. We have an amazing audience of Cecilia. Appreciate it. I get so many positive messages about these. These shows are so fun to do. Took a lot of work. Thank you so much, Ray, for making these so special whenever you're on. Thank you so much, Georgie, my partner in crime. And thank you for the amazing audience. Give this episode a like, subscribe to the substack or follow the show in some way, shape or form, and then also send all those donations to Ray. Guys, thank you so much. Have an amazing, amazing weekend and we'll see you some time next month. Okay, bye everyone.
