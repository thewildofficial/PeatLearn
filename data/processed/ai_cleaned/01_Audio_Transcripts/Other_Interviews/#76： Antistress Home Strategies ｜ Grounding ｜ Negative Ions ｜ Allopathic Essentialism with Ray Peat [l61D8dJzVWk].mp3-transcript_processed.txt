**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a lot of people are getting silver, and gold doesn't work too well for daily exchanges, because you'd have to chop it up into such tiny pieces. But silver is convenient as a practical currency.

**CONTEXT:** How would alternative currency work in a future where people are excluded from the financial system?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but with gold it involves a certain amount of trust that the person doesn't have. Some strange alloy that he's pounding off, but silver is very practical in the sense that you can carry enough in your pocket to feed yourself for quite a few days and it's identifiable as silver rather than other things.

**CONTEXT:** What are the practicalities of using precious metals as currency?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably 70-80% of the people will just do whatever the government tells them to but if 10 or 20% of the people set up an outside economy, it'll work.

**CONTEXT:** What percentage of the population would need to participate in an alternative economy for it to function?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just everything that happened. Just horrifying in general? Yeah, and the solutions are being hidden from......all ends of the political spectrum, everyone is being taught that the other end of the spectrum is out to get them, and it's really only the one-hundredth of one percent which is out to get everyone else, the people that Hillary and Obama called the deplorables. They are just as much ready for an actual solution and radical change as the people who think of themselves as the vanguard and most progressive.

**CONTEXT:** What is your assessment of the current political and societal landscape?

**RAY PEAT:** The English are more obedient than Americans.

**CONTEXT:** What is the difference in obedience between English and Americans?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that really is People should just start looking at some of the facts. Have you heard any of Norman Fenton's? No. Fenton talks about the statistics. He's a professor at the Queen's University in London. Statistical practical questions and all of his papers used to be published until he decided to look at the actual figures for mortality and what the virus is doing. And anytime you look at the actual deaths from the so-called pandemic, what they did was simply rename influenza and several other major causes of seasonal deaths, simply renamed them COVID, and it had to. miraculous effect of ending death from influenza around the world for a couple of years. But essentially, just looking at those one or two weeks figures for when there's a gigantic surge in deaths from COVID, there's a gigantic disappearance of deaths from influenza. Just looking at that one fact coming out of the CDC and other government agencies, the only thing you can conclude is that there never was a COVID pandemic. People have had coronavirus colds for hundreds of years and that's all it is, it's renaming. Any respiratory related sickness and even all sorts of other things as COVID just to create panic.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic and its statistical basis?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just a few years ago people asked that question. And the CDC said, well, it might not have really been 60,000 deaths this year, but it was at least 1,200 caused by the influenza virus. Well, how about we call them iatrogenic deaths, because one thing is certain, these people died in the hospitals, right? Yeah. So maybe that's all it is. Every year we have at least 60,000 to 80,000 people dying in the hospital. showing up with respiratory symptoms, but ultimately they died in the care of these doctors. I mean, I don't know of many people who died from the flu at home.

**CONTEXT:** How should we interpret hospital deaths attributed to influenza in the past?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the vaccine cured the named paralysis but didn't cure the incidence of paralytic disease.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between polio vaccines and paralytic diseases?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the polio virus and all of the related things are essentially gastrointestinal. Way back in the 1920s or 30s, a gastroenterologist was experimenting with... distemper in dogs, and he could give them an infection and then cut them open and see what was happening. In the early stages of the distemper sickness, where they classified it as a respiratory disease, all that was happening was virus infection of the intestine. And reflexes from the intestine were causing the respiratory symptoms. But the respiratory tissues were absolutely free of virus at the peak of the disease. It was all intestinal infection causing reflex inflammation of the lungs and respiratory system. And that seems to be... how a lot of the viruses work, they first make your intestine permeable to bacteria and toxins and then it's the sepsis that triggers the inflammatory cytokine storm sort of thing.

**CONTEXT:** What is the gastrointestinal origin of polio and related viruses?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's the... There have been some very clear studies in which people who recover slowly from surgery or who die following complications after surgery, what's happening is that the stress of the surgery made their intestine permeable to the toxins that are not being suppressed by active digestion. And if they clean their intestine for two or three days early with antibiotics before going into surgery, just about 100% of them had no surgical stress complications following the cutting.

**CONTEXT:** How does surgical stress affect intestinal permeability and post-operative complications?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even if the doctors aren't, if they don't read the literature, the person should take laxatives and have, make sure their hormones are good, have a very fibrous diet for several days before surgery, get a clean flow going through.

**CONTEXT:** What pre-surgical intestinal preparation is recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** The oat bran, I read that a cup of the cooked stuff, it's fairly filling. And so a cup is a big serving. But it has only 88 calories for a regular oatmeal, has maybe 250 or so for the same thing. So it does provide some carbohydrate, but it's strongly buffered by the presence of a higher fiber content. And studies in animals showed that over a long run, oat bran is a good source of carbohydrate. You might have to worry about some of the breakdown products of the soluble fibers that can have an estrogenic effect. But in the short run, up to a year or so, its effect is a matter of the bulk and acceleration of the intestines. So it has an anti... estrogen effect for people who have been reabsorbing the estrogen that their liver tries to excrete.

**CONTEXT:** What are the nutritional and hormonal effects of oat bran?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and for someone, occasionally someone has an oversensitive intestine and the carrot is too powerfully... stimulating and can cause a headache or diarrhea or other intestinal reaction. So, the oat bran is milder, mushrooms are sort of in between, it depends on how you, if you grind them or chop them fairly fine. They are an effective but fairly mild fiber. Bamboo shoots are very, very high fiber content, so a little of it has a strong effect in helping to clean up your intestine.

**CONTEXT:** How does oat bran compare to other fibrous foods for intestinal health?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and if you put the right amount of butter and salt in it when you're cooking, it's really extremely pleasant. With milk. Exactly. Yeah, milk, butter, and... Sugar, and then, but you did mention, and the whole internet knows this, but it contains phytic acid, so you'd want to have more calcium? Or if you made it with milk, do you think that would balance it out? Some studies say that it just about negates the value of the milk you have with it, so you probably have to eat extra milk more than you would think. Two quarts of milk will take care of just about anything. And then I think even a fourth a cup might have had like 500 milligrams of phosphorus in it, so that it's just adding to kind of the daily phosphorus intake. Yeah, so you really need a lot of milk to balance it.

**CONTEXT:** How does the phytic acid in oat bran interact with calcium and phosphorus, and what is the role of milk in balancing this?

**RAY PEAT:** If it has computer stuff, I would get wired, they call it ethernet cable. Connections between all of the parts instead of Wi-Fi.

**CONTEXT:** What are the primary concerns regarding new technologies in a living environment?

**RAY PEAT:** Check it if you have a field meter. Check whether your monitor is putting out a big field. My Macintosh monitor had a huge field and was very hot so I just bought a different monitor and I have a grounding pad but it didn't affect the Macintosh. monitor enough to

**CONTEXT:** How can one assess and mitigate electromagnetic field exposure from electronic devices?

**RAY PEAT:** Only if it has a big field you're sure is reaching out two or three feet beyond the monitor or your keyboard but when you have things connected by the wires your general environment is as much reduced.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of a device's electromagnetic field projection distance?

**RAY PEAT:** Probably the daytime contact with the earth, I think is enough to get you through the night without grounding. But you can get......sheets and bedding that have copper wires woven into the fabric and a connection to put a wire to ground. Theoretically that protects you considerably from the......if you have 60 cycle or 50 cycle electricity in your environment.

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits and methods of grounding oneself, particularly during sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** They talk about it as a sort of a buffer to the electrons that are being produced metabolically. And if you take a piece of skin... People vary according to their metabolic rate and thyroid function, but you can put a piece of skin in the culture dish and it will keep projecting a static field into the surrounding space. With cyanide in the culture dish stopping respiration, the electrical field collapses. Washing the cyanide out, the field comes back, and so people are in fact bristling with their own, it's like a static field, an electret is what you call it when it's established in wax or plastic. For a long time they had electret. needles for phonograph pickups, and instead of electromagnetic, it was a piece of ceramic or plastic that had a static electrical field implanted in the plastic or ceramic as it was hardening, and that polarized system of electrons projects. The field permanently so that you if you vibrate that piece of plastic It creates an electric electrical current So it's just a variation on electromagnetic pickups but it's a very powerful Phenomenon that if you're handling plastic bottles, for example, sometimes it will mess up the ability to control the fluid that you want to get out of the bottle because the plastic has such a strong electrical field built into it. And we are being a soft, flexible material. We have to generate that structure and field momentarily by respiring. And that... in an isolated environment that could lead to influences backwards from our environment to our metabolism. And supposedly if you ground yourself, that keeps the extraneous charges from interfering with your own biological generation of that electorate-like. uh static field.

**CONTEXT:** What is the bioenergetic perspective on grounding and its effect on the body's electrical fields?

**RAY PEAT:** That keeps you oxidizing it that that's protective internally but the grounding uh people emphasize that it's protective at least in some circumstances too. uh make sure you aren't being uh surrounded by uh the wrong kind of electrical charge oh this is from like if you're if you're submerged in a static field because of electric devices or things like that that's that that's what the grounding protects from yeah

**CONTEXT:** How does grounding protect the body from environmental electrical charges?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so it's probably way worse now Yeah, before I ever supplemented thyroid I think it was 1976 that I first decided to... go ahead with my intuition because before that, I knew that I had the hypothyroid signs, the classical things, except that my metabolic rate was very high. Just at rest, I was burning about 4,000 calories, and in a BMR test, I was at 200% or 300%. above normal oxygen consumption, and that delayed me for several years from believing that I could be hypothyroid. But anyway, when I took thyroid, suddenly my metabolic energy went down towards normal. But in the few years before I took thyroid, being around lab instruments, of various sorts, I was able to see that that high internal metabolism was causing me to have extremely exaggerated projection of charge fields around me. So that in lab where we had to use an electronic stimulator to produce a certain voltage to stimulate cells. If I reached towards it, got within a foot of it to adjust a knob, the machine would just suddenly run off scale and go full force. And as I pulled my hand away, it would go back sort of like the theremin music instrument that you adjust the pitch according to your position of your hand. But I always have my lab partner operate the machine because my hand made it malfunction. And anything electrical tended to be disturbed, even a cosmic ray cloud chamber. The ionization behavior of the humid atmosphere. It was cleared up by this field that extended about a foot to a foot and a half beyond my body.

**CONTEXT:** How did your personal experience with high metabolism and lab equipment reveal the effects of bioenergetic fields?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. So when you are taking thyroid... I've seen it in three or four other men about the same age, in their 30s usually, who, no matter how much they ate, couldn't put on weight. They would often be 120 or 30 pounds. But if they took thyroid, suddenly their ability to build muscle and fat with a normal amount of food was restored.

**CONTEXT:** What happens to metabolic rate and body composition when thyroid is supplemented in individuals with high metabolism and difficulty gaining weight?

**RAY PEAT:** So these people basically have upper-glycolysis to produce the necessary ATP through the less efficient means if thyroid is not available? Yeah, and that's where the symptoms and deterioration come in. So it's... it's very wasteful of food to... have that happen, but it keeps things working very nicely.

**CONTEXT:** What is the metabolic consequence of insufficient thyroid function, leading to reliance on glycolysis for ATP production?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just low thyroid is not running the machine fast enough.

**CONTEXT:** What is the explanation for individuals who gain weight too easily?

**RAY PEAT:** The people I've known. Well, like myself, we're very energetic and healthy, but they just couldn't put on weight no matter how much they ate.

**CONTEXT:** Who is in a worse position: someone who gains weight easily or someone who cannot gain weight?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it was as long as we were able to use the energy and make ATP. It didn't have to resort to other sources to make ATP. So, in those hypermetabolic states, there's not necessarily any glycolysis going on. And what was keeping your metabolic rate so high if thyroid wasn't optimal? I think a diet that was heavy on... unphosphate, not enough calcium and magnesium. People who have experimented with allergy patients found that the active thyroid hormone let you retain magnesium if you were given it, but without the T3 you could put the magnesium in. And they would work perfectly for a few days, and then they would lose the magnesium. So taking a supplement of magnesium can temporarily moderate your metabolism so you don't have that hyper metabolic reaction to low thyroid. But you have to keep taking it over and over because you lose it quickly without the ATP.

**CONTEXT:** What factors contribute to a high metabolic rate when thyroid function is suboptimal?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the body, when it's efficient, can suck up and retain a fairly modest amount from your food supply. But if your thyroid is low, then you have to worry about taste. A constant supply of generous magnesium.

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence the body's ability to retain magnesium?

**RAY PEAT:** The majority of the careful studies have found that the serotonin disposition is increased immediately by negative ions in the air in particular because the lungs are the main source of serotonin in the air. You have the first access to the circulating platelets carrying serotonin produced by stress and irritation, inflammation. So if your lungs need a boost of energy to detoxify that circulating stress-related serotonin, the electrons. Delivered on error ions participate directly in the monoamino oxidase reaction to eliminate it. And some of the studies show that the blood level of serotonin is decreased as you have more ionized negative error. So just having that around you, especially in the evening time, like maybe next to your bed, would be a good way to not go extremely hypermetabolic during the nighttime?

**CONTEXT:** How do negative ions in the air affect serotonin levels and metabolic activity, particularly at night?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, generally the health is worse as your altitude is lower. Every thousand feet of altitude where you live decreases heart disease mortality, cancer mortality and dementia.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between altitude and health outcomes like heart disease, cancer, and dementia?

**RAY PEAT:** All the figures I've seen show that cancer and heart disease are consistently. A lower, the higher you live and osteoporosis is something very directly connected. Your bones get stronger and teeth stay in longer.

**CONTEXT:** How does living at higher altitudes affect the incidence of cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that area, the dairy area, they got plenty of milk and cheese. He got married at the age of 140 and had children, apparently.

**CONTEXT:** What is the diet of people living in high-altitude dairy regions known for longevity?

**RAY PEAT:** I think a little bit of the realism of Franz Hals, the perceiving interesting things in people, anything that is a worthwhile insight about the nature of people and their interactions. Franz Hals was a… very confident at capturing such things.

**CONTEXT:** What themes, styles, or subjects would you like to see captured in a contemporary counterculture painting movement?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he could perceive intensely enough that he could capture instantaneous things that could not bepering.

**CONTEXT:** How did Franz Hals's paintings capture personality and instantaneous moments?

**RAY PEAT:** I think a little bit of the high starch diets end up tending to be deficient in some of the essential nutrients, high phosphate, stress-inducing things that make people irritable and authoritarian, high serotonin outcome of the inflammatory diet.

**CONTEXT:** What are the metabolic and psychological effects of high-starch diets?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's very stressful to lose your consciousness. Maybe you told somebody in email a long time ago that it like. Greatly depletes your liver glycogen and it would take multiple days to recover. That's that's my experience like Drinking is never worth it because I'll feel so awful the next few days. And so it Just affects some people More than others based on their ability to store liver glycogen.

**CONTEXT:** What are the health and longevity costs of occasional heavy drinking?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh It increases your ability to store glycogen so it doesn't have any long-term negative effects. But when I accidentally overdosed on it and the coordination of my hands and feet was impossible for a while. But when I deliberately took a very large amount because I had a bad migraine. I went with the euphoria, simply went to sleep in about two minutes and had no more headache. But when it comes on accidentally or where you should be able to use your hands and feet, it's embarrassing.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone affect glycogen storage and coordination, and what are its effects when taken for migraines?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the resistors are going to put up more and more resistance, but Bill Gates has already said that the people are working on the vaccine for the Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus which is similar to the Ebola virus and kills up to 90 percent of the people it infects and he says that is likely to be the next epidemic and since they are about ready to have a vaccine for it I think he might be right as soon as a vaccine is able to come to market at a profit of half a trillion dollars, then we can have the Marburg epidemic. But I think the resistance is gaining faster than the clever world economic forum schemers can dream up. Catastrophes to happen to us, but if this Warburg virus, if it's so deadly, just like Ebola, then it can't really be a pandemic because it's going to kill most of the host before he has a chance to spread, right? How would you have a pandemic with that? It's just scarier and that's all that's needed is to have a vaccine that is going to save everyone and all it has to do is is kill a few dozen people that they didn't want anyway and then they can sell a trillion dollars worth of vaccines and probably be much more easy to mandate because there'll be look this is truly deadly uh don't resist because COVID is nothing compared to this

**CONTEXT:** What are your predictions for 2022, considering potential future epidemics and societal resistance?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, since so many people have caught on that don't want the vaccine and realize that the vaccine mortality goes up the first month after being vaccinated higher than not receiving the vaccine. That awareness is getting out and so they need something really to scare people. Show people bleeding out of their eyes and ears and a real horror show. Wow. Yeah, that would do it. And so this second act, you think it was strategic in making it even more gruesome?

**CONTEXT:** Why might a more gruesome epidemic be strategically promoted in the future?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's why they're interested in it.

**CONTEXT:** What is the strategic interest in a more gruesome epidemic?

**RAY PEAT:** I think of them as little personalities. What what like how do you how do you explain the discrepancy but of thinking of there are like these round things and then those new photos of them being kind of these scatter things or are both of those incorrect interpretations? Yeah, each cell has its field and like or take a gasset set of a person that. I am I am my circumstance the cell is in the same situation as a person itself and its circumstance are identical. So as soon as the circumstance changes, the cell is no longer what it was.

**CONTEXT:** What is your mental image of a cell, and how does its environment influence its identity?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah. Temperature hormones, stress hormones in particular, in fish and reptiles and birds even. The temperature is very essential to developing the eggs ratio. It entirely depends on temperature, right? Like alligators, when they lay eggs, if it's hot, it's mostly males that they catch? Yeah, and chickens are the same thing. Early in the season, I forget which way it is, but it's a balance that's beneficial. To have lots of females relative to males when conditions are going to be optimal.

**CONTEXT:** How do temperature and hormones influence sex determination in embryonic development across different species?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. Interesting.

**CONTEXT:** Is a higher ratio of females to males a protective mechanism for a species in unfavorable environments?

**RAY PEAT:** That sounds very reasonable. You just reminded me of something. Uh, yeah, there was a... Have you read Ernest Sternglass's books or articles? He studied the effects of radiation on miscarriages and the ratio of boys surviving and so on. He shows that at the peak atmospheric contamination from the 1963 bomb competition, the atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs. 18 years later, the academic scores of all sorts, the, what's the standard exam, the high school, anyway, the average score went down, and the genetic people said that's because... that more poor people are taking the test. But he showed very clearly that looking at just the highest-scoring portion of the population, that the greatest decrease 18 years after the radiation peak, the greatest decrease was in the highest-scoring category. So, it lowered the average, but it even more drastically knocked out the exceptionally competent kids of that age.

**CONTEXT:** Could the recent increase in female births worldwide be an indicator of environmental deterioration and a survival mechanism for the human race?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even those. Some countries show lately that the ratio of the brain to the body weight and height has decreased in several countries. Would these develop countries? Yeah, Germany was one of them. Not even accounting for the indefinite mRNA vaccines these kids are going to have to deal with.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the observed decrease in brain-to-body weight and height ratios in some developed countries, especially in light of potential vaccine effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they could be. It's the general optimistic view of reality is connecting them and behind them that the universe itself is conscious in some intentional way that Vernadsky said in the midst of the ending of the Second World War, he was surrounded by destruction and and death, but he said he was confident that the world would find a way out of it by increasing its metabolic rate, accumulating carbon dioxide, warming things up, making brains get bigger and making plants grow faster, everything working more intensely. The Noosphere idea is the basic thing that we're all headed in that direction just because of the nature of the universe.

**CONTEXT:** Are Sheldrake's morphic fields and Vernadsky's noosphere related concepts, and what is the underlying optimistic view of reality they suggest?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a large part of the establishment did. Do you think he's... oh, sorry, go ahead. There were the dogmatic... I think of them as the Hegelian Marxists, the ones that thought the dialectic was some mysterious thing, but the average intelligent, well-read... Russian biologists and scientists, in general, had that sort of an emergent orientation that it's part of the Marxist meaning of the dialectic, but it goes with an optimistic view of what the cosmos is all about.

**CONTEXT:** Did Russian science incorporate Vernadsky's geocosmic realism into its thinking, and what was the nature of the scientific establishment's perspective?

**RAY PEAT:** I think a little bit of the realism of Franz Hals, the perceiving interesting things in people, anything that is a worthwhile insight about the nature of people and their interactions. Franz Hals was a… very confident at capturing such things.

**CONTEXT:** If a counterculture painting movement were to start today, what themes, styles, or subjects would you like to see captured or communicated?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he could perceive intensely enough that he could capture instantaneous things that could not bepering.
