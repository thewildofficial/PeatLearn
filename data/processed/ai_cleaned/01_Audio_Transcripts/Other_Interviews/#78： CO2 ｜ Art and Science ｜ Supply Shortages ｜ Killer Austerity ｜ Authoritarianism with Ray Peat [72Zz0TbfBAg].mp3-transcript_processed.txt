**RAY PEAT:** Oh, uh, there are... uh, so many undeniable things now that, uh, the CDC just has to, uh, recognize some of them, uh, just to not seem totally crazy and crooked, but still, they're basically crazy and crooked, and, and the, the government policy on, on Ukraine is, uh, uh, some, some... weird combination of very crazy, uh, and very stupid, uh, because they're alienating so much of the world, which, uh, can perceive what, what is going on, uh, with Russia being the peacemaker and, uh, U, U.S. being just, uh, aggressive to an insane degree.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat for his perspective on current events, including the CDC's changing stance on masks and PCR tests, and the Russia-Ukraine situation, questioning if these are diversions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's connected. But, like, as a diversion to, like, I mean, is there a purpose to it or it's a complete phony story? Like, I have been reading that people in Russia, or maybe it was the Ukraine, were, like, completely unworried by the whole situation. It was just people in America that were getting all riled up.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the shift from COVID narratives to the Ukraine situation is a deliberate diversion.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even the president of the Ukraine uh, uh, you know, phony. Conversation with Biden told him to calm down. You can't tell a person with dementia to calm down. They're agitated all the time.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the perceived disconnect between the Ukraine situation as presented in American media and the reality on the ground, referencing a conversation between the Ukrainian and US presidents.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think they're hoping to create enough fear and excitement around Ukraine provoking Russia into occupying the eastern part of the country, for example, so they have something more permanent to focus on.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the ending of COVID restrictions is a precursor to something worse, like a new pandemic, and Ray Peat explains the potential strategic purpose of the Ukraine situation.

**RAY PEAT:** I think just being a crazed people stirring up excitement, recognizing that war presidents always are powerful. The people get in line behind a war president.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the Ukraine situation fits into a "Great Reset" agenda or is an anomaly, and Ray Peat suggests it's about creating excitement and empowering a war president.

**RAY PEAT:** I would suppose that's what he has in mind.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the current geopolitical situation is intended to improve the US president's re-election prospects.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know. No, I don't know about that program. I should have read the name of it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about concerns regarding Putin's participation in a World Economic Forum program for students and its implications for his leadership.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I hadn't heard anything about the mandatories. I had heard only 30% or so were. We're vaccinated there and that there wasn't a big push to go farther.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about reports of Russia making vaccines mandatory, questioning its truthfulness and potential motives.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I don't think there's a big push. It's just just a waste. And Europe operates. Basically, nobody trusts the government. Me being originally from Bulgaria, the vaccination rate there is even lower than 30%. But several of the governors of Putin's of the Russian of the republics that make up the Russian Federation. Have made the vaccine certificate mandatory for for quote-unquote participating in public life Unfortunately, there's you know, the only thing that we know of what is actually going on in Russia is to Western media And I cannot assert them whether that's really true or not the Russian people that I know in Russia are saying Yeah, they may they may exist something on the books, but nobody's really enforcing it So that would be my suspicion that everything I've read or heard Putin saying seems like he's a perfectly conscious person.
**CONTEXT:** The host elaborates on reports of vaccine mandates in Russia, and Ray Peat expresses skepticism based on his understanding of the situation and general distrust of government narratives.

**RAY PEAT:** I would assume a lot of them are gonna be arrested
**CONTEXT:** The host lists several world leaders who were part of the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders program and asks if this connects to a "Great Reset" agenda.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. I think it's mostly just a phrase that catches attention. The culture is a mass psychosis. Already nothing dramatic has changed. It's a chronic manipulation of the mass psychosis.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat for his opinion on the concept of "mass formation psychosis" as it relates to current societal events.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but our society specializes in trauma and threat.
**CONTEXT:** The host suggests that "mass formation psychosis" doesn't fully capture the traumatic aspect of the situation, and Ray Peat agrees, highlighting society's tendency towards trauma.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's a matter of degree. I've considered the public to be... a very high percentage of complete insanity now for six years, 70 years, 80 years.
**CONTEXT:** The host posits that continued manipulation could lead to a majority of the population losing their grip on reality, making them unreceptive to solutions, and Ray Peat agrees, stating his long-held view of widespread public insanity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they've got their people, like Noam Chomsky, saying that the unvaccinated have to separate themselves and getting food is going to be their problem. What about the people living in the big cities, let's say in the States or in Canada, who's going to feed them? I mean, they depend entirely on supplies from the countryside.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a critical mass of sanity is needed for social organization or if elites are fine with a largely "berserk" population, and Ray Peat points to figures like Noam Chomsky advocating for the separation of the unvaccinated and questions the viability of feeding large urban populations.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it would be advantageous if a higher percentage of the people thought like individual, intelligent animals. There's a sort of lemming consciousness that has been, it was really developed powerfully after the... First World War that started in with the government propaganda ministry and that faded out for a while but was restored after the Second World War and really became a powerful shaper of society.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the elite's potential preference for a "berserk" population and the implications for societal stability, and Ray Peat discusses the concept of "lemming consciousness" and its historical development through government propaganda.

**RAY PEAT:** Eric Schmidt's speeches and committee work for the Pentagon and such indicated as early as early... 2019 that their intention, primary intention was to wreck the economy, that you can't make a new digital alternative reality until you've created a desperation and wrecked the old economy thoroughly.
**CONTEXT:** The host questions whether supply chain issues and shortages were unforeseen by the elite or part of a plan, and Ray Peat cites Eric Schmidt's statements about intentionally wrecking the economy to create a new digital reality.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's to be graded carefully enough that they can... weaker and sichter, without outright starvation of masses of them, like the evidence coming out that 5% of the vaccines according to their lot number were quoted to be either lethal or non-lethal, and according to the lot numbers you can see a very concentrated mortality from loads of the 5% early in each lot sequence. So they weren't intending to cause massive sickness and die off, but only 5% per period of time.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential for widespread starvation in cities and its implications, and Ray Peat discusses the possibility of a carefully managed weakening of the population, referencing data on vaccine lot numbers and mortality.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think so. That would probably be the preference of a lot of the people controlling the distribution. But I think they have to make it look even-handed to some blue state deaths just to make it look fair. Um, that was probably a consideration, but I think some of the people are in a bigger herd than others.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if vaccine-induced mortality was concentrated in "red states," and Ray Peat suggests that while it might be a preference, it would need to appear even-handed to avoid suspicion.

**RAY PEAT:** Not extensively, but I've seen his name around many places. I think in some countries they actually banned doing autopsies specifically on the vaccinated in order to prevent these discoveries.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Bakhty's pathology studies linking vaccines to deaths, and Ray Peat acknowledges familiarity with the name and mentions reports of autopsy bans.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the policy of don't treat the sickness other than by vaccines or oxygen and don't do autopsies is highly organized. Don't publicize the actual.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the practice of not performing autopsies on vaccinated individuals, and Ray Peat describes this as a highly organized policy to avoid publicizing actual causes of death.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, still very rare in hospitals. I've had people check around and I think there were only two or three hospitals that had it on hand out of thousands of hospitals.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the prevalence of Carbogen in hospitals, and Ray Peat states it is very rare.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think it's all the phony way of calculating pH and bicarbonate base excess and so on, rather than focusing on... carbon dioxide and the availability of oxygen.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if medical curricula discuss mixing carbon dioxide with oxygen to improve uptake, and Ray Peat criticizes current acid-base calculations and the neglect of carbon dioxide's role.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's following the UK committee 1955 that just declared that it was irrational to be concerned with keeping some CO2 in the blood. Absolutely no evidence in their support, but for some reason sounds right to them.
**CONTEXT:** The host shares an anecdote about doctors' resistance to administering CO2, and Ray Peat explains this stems from a 1955 UK committee's declaration that maintaining CO2 levels was irrational.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but the way they teach acid-base regulation... becomes so hard to conceive and calculate that the doctors seem to be boggled by the effort and so they get things exactly backwards.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if concepts like the Bohr effect are considered clinically irrelevant in medical education, and Ray Peat explains that the complexity of acid-base regulation teaching leads to doctors misunderstanding and misapplying these principles.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are two or three studies that show you can turn off lactic acidosis just by giving some carbon dioxide. It just goes right to the source and turns off lactate production.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the significance of high anion gap and lactic acidosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and Ray Peat confirms that studies show CO2 administration can resolve lactic acidosis.

**RAY PEAT:** The Indian experiment in digital currency starved basically everyone that didn't have a bank account when they outlawed currency. And that, I think, was sort of a trial of how to do it and do it under more control than gradually they'll. Tighten up the availability of real currency, get people more dependent on their banks and then gradually squeeze the money supply to the point that the poorest people die at the highest rate. So they'll create this. Problem of the starvation and things and you think that is obviously a lot of this is leading to the digital identification and the seat the seat the central bank digital currencies and things like that and then that is it has been created and deliberately going back to the green revolution that whole thing was was a fraud intended to centralize the control of food giving monsanto and the fertilizer companies absolute control over food production in the world not to increase the food supply for the world in general but to make it cheaper for the industrialized countries and out of reach of more and more of the farmers who are producing it
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat to elaborate on the potential for starvation and its connection to digital currencies and identification, and Ray Peat uses the Indian digital currency experiment as an example of how to control and starve populations, linking it to the green revolution's purported goal of centralizing food control.

**RAY PEAT:** I find it quite ironic that Monsanto and Bayer and other large chemical companies that the green movement used to be their arch nemesis and they were protesting against them and even bombing them in the 70s in the 80s in the 60s now they're actually on the same team because they're part of this agenda that you know of sustainable development and for some reason it's lost the air and is lost on the people that are protesting that their arch enemies are being put in charge of creating their food for the foreseeable future.
**CONTEXT:** The host expresses irony about the green movement's current alliance with chemical companies like Monsanto and Bayer, and Ray Peat agrees, highlighting the shift in their agendas towards sustainable development.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh definitely. The Congress for Cultural Freedom supported the right-wing socialists throughout the year, European and other cultures, and the Students for a Democratic Society and the New Left, so-called, those were all CIA progressive movements.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks when the CIA began using progressive and liberal movements to their advantage, referencing Gloria Steinem's account of meeting with the CIA, and Ray Peat confirms this, citing the Congress for Cultural Freedom and the New Left as CIA-backed progressive movements.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I didn't recognize the M.K.Wolk. I was making a bad joke about like M.K.Ultra, like a project name or something like that.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there might be future revelations about CIA projects like "MK Woke" funding cultural influence, and Ray Peat clarifies he was making a joke referencing MKUltra.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think there needs to be a coordinate. All they have to do is bump them full of SSRIs and unleash them on society, and they'll take care of the rest.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the possibility of a project like MKUltra influencing culture, and Ray Peat suggests that SSRIs can achieve similar effects by altering behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** The Congress for Cultural Freedom supported the right-wing socialists throughout the year, European and other cultures, and the Students for a Democratic Society and the New Left, so-called, those were all CIA progressive movements.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the CIA's use of progressive movements, and Ray Peat identifies the Congress for Cultural Freedom and the New Left as CIA-backed progressive movements.

**RAY PEAT:** The Nazis were equating his sexual political movement with communism. Uh huh. They were killing pretty indiscriminately anyone with descending political ideas. So he didn't like being associated with the communists and that's why he writes negatively about it?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Wilhelm Reich disliked communists, and Ray Peat clarifies that the Nazis associated Reich's sexual politics movement with communism and persecuted anyone with dissenting ideas.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he was put under stress by the attack on sexual politics and being lumped in with socialists. Maybe into the surreal is like understandable given what a target he was, it sounded like he had a pretty rough life.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Reich's negative portrayal of communism stemmed from being associated with socialists, and Ray Peat suggests the stress of being targeted and miscategorized contributed to his writings.

**RAY PEAT:** His interactions with Freud exposed Freud as the cultural fraud that he was that he wasn't. He wasn't really wanting to change anything, to take advantage of the way oppression works. Using Freud's whole theory of psychoanalysis is just a very elaborate way of concealing what the real source of mental health problems in the population were at the time?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Reich's critique of Freud, and Ray Peat explains that Reich saw Freud's psychoanalysis as a way to conceal the true causes of mental health problems and maintain oppression.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Reich goes into that in detail. He chose to be on the side of the superego against the revolutionary truth of the organismic perceptions. And it's also like the key to dissolving your problems is always in the hands of this person with esoteric knowledge. And only this person can open the door to your psyche. You can never help yourself, right? You're basically entirely dependent on that person with... master knowledge.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Freud's approach was about maintaining the status quo and creating dependency, and Ray Peat confirms this, stating Reich identified Freud as siding with the superego and promoting authoritarianism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, basically authoritarianism. And Reich was essentially anti-authoritarian, and he really had an accurate understanding of... at first he respected Freud, but then realized he was fraudulent in choosing authoritarianism rather than liberation.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Freud's methods were authoritarian, and Ray Peat confirms that Reich saw Freud as promoting authoritarianism instead of liberation.

**RAY PEAT:** Not directly I think he saw for his Income was coming from It was the middle class and And not shaking things up too much. I mean some of the stuff that CIA psychologists developed as part of Project MKUltra and how to break the terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, it sounds like it was heavily based on a lot of these Freud ideas. I mean they were deliberately making people stay naked, shaming them all the time, right? All of these things have a very heavy Freudian underpinning when I read about what they did to these people.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Freud had deep state connections or worked for specific interests, and Ray Peat suggests Freud's income came from the middle class, and his ideas influenced CIA projects like MKUltra, which involved shaming and control tactics.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, amazing. Thank you so much for that, Ray. Okay, we'll get through a few more of these. Ray has almost sounded like he was against monogamy and pro-polygamy from previous comments. What does Ray think of gender relations today? What does he view as the problem? What does he view as a healthy gender relations and solution? Being in a healthy, economic, social environment is... First step, the marriage has evolved from a matter of property rights of men over women and children, and as those literal ownership......properties were questioned, then the new problems have developed. So, first you have to think about what society and economics is doing. Are you really wanting an equal partnership? Or is there still some kind of a financial interest involved? Rich people marry rich people, and middle-class people marry middle-class people, and they don't like to talk about the property values of marriage, but that's still the main... driving force behind the gender interactions.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about his views on gender relations today, the problems, and potential solutions, and Ray Peat emphasizes the importance of a healthy economic and social environment, noting that marriage has evolved from property rights and that financial interests still drive gender interactions.

**RAY PEAT:** The same forces that create a doctrine of randomness, that the holistic understanding, the natural animal understanding of gender. And interactions and who we are, that can be displaced and social rules can be imposed to the extent that you deny the reality of biology. The denying reality of biology fits right in with all of the other. authoritarian, randomness-based thing. If you can choose your gender, it's the same thing as having the random determination of all of your properties. It isn't growing out of your interior nature.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how the "disappearing woman as a protected class" and surgeries on minors serve particular interests, and Ray Peat links this to the same forces promoting a doctrine of randomness, denying biological reality, and imposing social rules.

**RAY PEAT:** I think some of the rise of transgenderism that we're seeing is basically a desperate attempt by the ruling class to conceal the radically declining quality of life of all genders. I mean, the rates of homosexuality, transgenderism, cross dressing, whatever you want to call it, have been steadily rising since the 60s. And a lot of it has to do with extreme stress in the environment, poor diet, all of these serotonergic estrogenic drugs, etc. So now that the public is becoming aware of these rapidly rising rates, the elite is throwing a diversion by saying, oh, this is all completely normal, instead of having to explain how come suddenly we have these drastically increasing rates of what used to be pathology.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if blurring gender lines prepares people for a transhumanist agenda, and Ray Peat suggests that the rise of transgenderism is a diversion to conceal declining quality of life, attributing the increase to environmental stress, poor diet, and drugs, and the elite's framing of it as normal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's true. is it just like ludicrous, like merging man and machine? Like that just doesn't sound like it would work just on its face, you know?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the transhumanist agenda of merging man and machine is inherently flawed, and Ray Peat agrees, finding the concept ludicrous.

**RAY PEAT:** No, all of this talk about finding biological compatible materials and so on. It's all all funniness. you Essentially everything that's the latest news in biology and medicine, it's essentially fraudulent. And Ray Kurzweil, who used to be the patron saint of transhumanism, is nowhere to be found. He refuses to be interviewed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the latest news in biology and medicine, and Ray Peat dismisses it as fraudulent, mentioning Ray Kurzweil's disappearance from public discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** By optimizing the degree of excitation of cells, the same fence methods that cause... brain damage, excitotoxic glutamate, for example, will cause excitatory damage to any other cells such as the liver. And estrogen and PUFA and the glutamic acid range of excitants, those are all... depended against by progesterone. And progesterone favors thyroid hormone production and so the energy increase adds to the stabilizing effect. Thyroid deficient people have all kinds of liver malfunctions including gallbladder disease. And that goes with elevated excitability of the ducts and the gallbladder itself and progesterone relaxes those spastic reactions to low thyroid and high estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how progesterone is specifically helpful for the liver, and Ray Peat explains that progesterone optimizes cellular excitation, counteracting excitotoxic damage from glutamate, estrogen, and PUFAs, and supports thyroid hormone production, which is crucial for liver function.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the liver's energy is a large part of it is used to regulate uh both environmental toxins and the to balance the hormones and so when your thyroid is low or if you're exposed to pesticides or high estrogen, for example, your liver doesn't have the ability to inactivate and excrete those toxins and so they accumulate and so if you are fasting and failing to energize your liver, you accumulate those harmful substances that tend to... be stored in the fat or are constantly being produced by stress tissues such as estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the basic pathology of liver dysfunction with low thyroid is the inability of hepatocytes to function without thyroid energy, and Ray Peat confirms that the liver uses significant energy to detoxify and balance hormones, and low thyroid function impairs this process, leading to toxin accumulation.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think whatever tastes best for you is good. I like to add a little bit of Masa to it, it gives it a rounder flavor, sort of like tamales.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Ray Peat's special process for making oat bran, and Ray Peat suggests preparing it to taste best, mentioning his preference for adding Masa.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the diet for a small planet was popularizing that, making it a political issue that you should economize by making the foods overlap and so on. It's a possible diet but they neglect the toxic aspects of focusing only on the exact nutrient content of food. You have to look at the social aspects of it and especially the toxic components of a high vegetable diet.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the political aspect of food choices, referencing "Diet for a Small Planet," and Ray Peat critiques the focus on nutrient content while neglecting the toxic aspects of high-vegetable diets and social factors.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Spanish enslaving the Mexican Indians and South American Indians or put them on a minimal diet of... basically beans and tortillas, saved money that way, and weakened them, and prevented rebellion because they were too weak and depressed to defend themselves.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if food has been used as a form of political control historically, referencing Plato, and Ray Peat provides an example of the Spanish using minimal diets of beans and tortillas to weaken indigenous populations and prevent rebellion.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the political wings of the Spanish Empire.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Christian missionaries used poor food as a tool for subjugation, and Ray Peat confirms this was part of the political strategy of the Spanish Empire.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the oil companies......want to maximize everything they can squeeze out of the public in the process of selling their oil, by making them fear that it's running out. So they can charge higher price?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a political motive behind the fossil fuel origin theory of oil, and Ray Peat suggests oil companies promote scarcity to maximize profits.

**RAY PEAT:** That's a general principle that the companies aren't responsible for anything. They're just serving the public.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Shell popularizing the "carbon footprint" concept, shifting responsibility to the public, and Ray Peat comments on the general principle of corporate non-responsibility.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it's the alertness factor. When it's used to point out truth, that... can only be perceived easily that way. I think that's the real value of painting. It shows up occasionally in very different styles. But you can tell that the person was... experiencing reality in a very complex and constructive way. And the viewer gains something from seeing that complexity that someone else perceives and represented. It's like a subtle historian noticing things and writing about them. Allowing a new perspective on what's going on in the world.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about artistic movements he considers positive, and Ray Peat emphasizes the value of art that demonstrates alertness and reveals truth, allowing viewers to perceive reality in a complex and constructive way.

**RAY PEAT:** The special place in our universe is a doctrine of everything being random. It has been used to control whatever it is you want to control. The science doctrine wants to say that all change is random. Otherwise that would mean that something in nature itself is intelligent. And that idea of an anti-authoritarian......respect for the intelligence of the way nature operates. They have to find some way to get people not to trust the intelligence of life and of physics and so on. And so they argue that randomness is the basis of everything in the universe. That mutations are only random, that nuclear decay is only random, and so for hundreds of years people have been showing non-random evidence that has sorted science and culture into the mechanistic based on the doctrine of randomness. Versus the holistic, more or less trusting in the intelligence of how things are working.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if randomness has a place in the universe or if everything is interdependent and explainable, and Ray Peat argues that the doctrine of randomness is used for control, suppressing the idea of natural intelligence and promoting a mechanistic view over a holistic one.

**RAY PEAT:** I think he was obsessed with the misconception.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat's opinion on Wilhelm Reich's cloudbuster.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Nazis were equating his sexual political movement with communism. Uh huh. They were killing pretty indiscriminately anyone with descending political ideas. So he didn't like being associated with the communists and that's why he writes negatively about it?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Wilhelm Reich's negative writings on communism and if it was due to his association with socialists, and Ray Peat clarifies that the Nazis associated Reich's movement with communism and persecuted dissenters.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he was put under stress by the attack on sexual politics and being lumped in with socialists. Maybe into the surreal is like understandable given what a target he was, it sounded like he had a pretty rough life.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Reich's negative portrayal of communism stemmed from being associated with socialists, and Ray Peat suggests the stress of being targeted and miscategorized contributed to his writings.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the latest news in biology and medicine, and Ray Peat dismisses it as fraudulent, mentioning Ray Kurzweil's disappearance from public discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything is orderly. So complex ordering exists everywhere, it's just a matter of whether we perceive and accept it or not, but I don't think it implies what we think of as consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if orderly signals from stars might indicate intelligent activity in space, and Ray Peat agrees that everything is orderly but doesn't equate it with consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the uh awareness of what you're doing, the culture doesn't encourage that sort of thing. But the person with excess energy is going to maintain a high degree of healthy animal coherence, and that includes a big control of what, what take in. Mentally and physically, they will be opinionated by their needs and preferences, rather than by learned principles.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lying and dishonesty have anti-metabolic effects and if physiological coherence requires radical honesty, and Ray Peat suggests that individuals with excess energy maintain healthy coherence, including mental and physical intake, driven by their needs and preferences rather than learned principles.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably. A hypothyroid tired person has a very limited repertoire of thought processes. When your energy is high, you will cycle through different states. Deep sleep, deep relaxation, and high intensity conscious activity. And those cyclings will take you through a variety of attitudes and experiences. And going from one to the next gives you... a broader perspective, and out of that bread you can put together things that would never occur to someone who is staying on a level, an energy level.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a higher metabolic rate improves intuition, and Ray Peat explains that hypothyroid individuals have limited thought processes, while higher energy allows for cycling through states, leading to broader perspectives and novel intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, open-mindedness in the sense of... a certain amount of going out of yourself curiosity, looking for things to perceive, a sort of desire to perceive, leads to novel perceptions and novel intuitions.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is a measure of open-mindedness, which is a surrogate for metabolism, and Ray Peat agrees, defining open-mindedness as curiosity and a desire to perceive, leading to new intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is more part of animal consciousness, and Ray Peat agrees.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, um, the, um, Mendeleev was the first one to notice it, I think. I think, uh, uh, um, he d-dissolved... uh, iron in, uh, I think it was sulfuric acid, and noticed a film, an oily film appeared, uh, on the surface, uh, and it smelled like petroleum. Uh, and he gave samples to, uh, people, uh, w-w-who were experienced with actual petroleum, uh, chemistry. Uh, uh, and, uh, they... uh, identified it as, uh, re... resembling particular, uh, uh, natural, uh, uh, exudations of, of petroleum from the earth. Uh, uh, and, uh, so the idea that, uh, uh, iron is, uh, uh, r... rich, uh, it, it dissolves, uh, carbon, uh, at a high level, uh, uh, and, uh, when uh, it spontaneously synthesizes that carbon, uh, into, uh, uh, that was around, uh, uh, the 1850s, if you noticed that, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, it was a long time before, uh, uh, anyone else, uh, started following up on it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about abiotic oil, and Ray Peat explains Mendeleev's initial observation of oil formation from iron and sulfuric acid, suggesting a geological origin for petroleum.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the geologist consensus is still that the center of the Earth has a very high concentration of a fairly heavy metal like iron. And the capacity of that iron to dissolve carbon amounts to vast amounts of potential petroleum. And so you would expect it to constantly, as the iron reaches new conditions, have volcanic acid. action pushing it in the chemical reactions, then you would expect that vast amount of iron to be releasing more or less steadily a huge supply of petroleum-like molecules according to what Mendeleev observed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the theory of abiotic oil suggests the Earth is creating oil and that powers that be claim it's running out, and Ray Peat explains the geological consensus of iron dissolving carbon and releasing petroleum-like molecules.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I ran into the Russian research following up decades after Mendeleev made his observation, and they were doing calculations showing that the fossil fuel idea of petroleum really has no basis. And that it's extremely probable that it's a natural geological consequence of this gigantic mass of iron or other heavy metals.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions finding oceans of oil on a Saturn moon and its implications for the dead dinosaur theory versus the abiotic oil theory, and Ray Peat confirms Russian research supporting the abiotic origin of petroleum based on geological processes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the oil companies......want to maximize everything they can squeeze out of the public in the process of selling their oil, by making them fear that it's running out. So they can charge higher price?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a political motive behind the fossil fuel origin theory of oil, and Ray Peat suggests oil companies promote scarcity to maximize profits.

**RAY PEAT:** By optimizing the degree of excitation of cells, the same fence methods that cause... brain damage, excitotoxic glutamate, for example, will cause excitatory damage to any other cells such as the liver. And estrogen and PUFA and the glutamic acid range of excitants, those are all... depended against by progesterone. And progesterone favors thyroid hormone production and so the energy increase adds to the stabilizing effect. Thyroid deficient people have all kinds of liver malfunctions including gallbladder disease. And that goes with elevated excitability of the ducts and the gallbladder itself and progesterone relaxes those spastic reactions to low thyroid and high estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how progesterone is specifically helpful for the liver, and Ray Peat explains that progesterone optimizes cellular excitation, counteracting excitotoxic damage from glutamate, estrogen, and PUFAs, and supports thyroid hormone production, which is crucial for liver function.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the liver's energy is a large part of it is used to regulate uh both environmental toxins and the to balance the hormones and so when your thyroid is low or if you're exposed to pesticides or high estrogen, for example, your liver doesn't have the ability to inactivate and excrete those toxins and so they accumulate and so if you are fasting and failing to energize your liver, you accumulate those harmful substances that tend to... be stored in the fat or are constantly being produced by stress tissues such as estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the basic pathology of liver dysfunction with low thyroid is the inability of hepatocytes to function without thyroid energy, and Ray Peat confirms that the liver uses significant energy to detoxify and balance hormones, and low thyroid function impairs this process, leading to toxin accumulation.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think whatever tastes best for you is good. I like to add a little bit of Masa to it, it gives it a rounder flavor, sort of like tamales.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Ray Peat's special process for making oat bran, and Ray Peat suggests preparing it to taste best, mentioning his preference for adding Masa.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the diet for a small planet was popularizing that, making it a political issue that you should economize by making the foods overlap and so on. It's a possible diet but they neglect the toxic aspects of focusing only on the exact nutrient content of food. You have to look at the social aspects of it and especially the toxic components of a high vegetable diet.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the political aspect of food choices, referencing "Diet for a Small Planet," and Ray Peat critiques the focus on nutrient content while neglecting the toxic aspects of high-vegetable diets and social factors.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Spanish enslaving the Mexican Indians and South American Indians or put them on a minimal diet of... basically beans and tortillas, saved money that way, and weakened them, and prevented rebellion because they were too weak and depressed to defend themselves.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if food has been used as a form of political control historically, referencing Plato, and Ray Peat provides an example of the Spanish using minimal diets of beans and tortillas to weaken indigenous populations and prevent rebellion.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the political wings of the Spanish Empire.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Christian missionaries used poor food as a tool for subjugation, and Ray Peat confirms this was part of the political strategy of the Spanish Empire.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the uh awareness of what you're doing, the culture doesn't encourage that sort of thing. But the person with excess energy is going to maintain a high degree of healthy animal coherence, and that includes a big control of what, what take in. Mentally and physically, they will be opinionated by their needs and preferences, rather than by learned principles.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lying and dishonesty have anti-metabolic effects and if physiological coherence requires radical honesty, and Ray Peat suggests that individuals with excess energy maintain healthy coherence, including mental and physical intake, driven by their needs and preferences rather than learned principles.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably. A hypothyroid tired person has a very limited repertoire of thought processes. When your energy is high, you will cycle through different states. Deep sleep, deep relaxation, and high intensity conscious activity. And those cyclings will take you through a variety of attitudes and experiences. And going from one to the next gives you... a broader perspective, and out of that bread you can put together things that would never occur to someone who is staying on a level, an energy level.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a higher metabolic rate improves intuition, and Ray Peat explains that hypothyroid individuals have limited thought processes, while higher energy allows for cycling through states, leading to broader perspectives and novel intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, open-mindedness in the sense of... a certain amount of going out of yourself curiosity, looking for things to perceive, a sort of desire to perceive, leads to novel perceptions and novel intuitions.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is a measure of open-mindedness, which is a surrogate for metabolism, and Ray Peat agrees, defining open-mindedness as curiosity and a desire to perceive, leading to new intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is more part of animal consciousness, and Ray Peat agrees.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, um, the, um, Mendeleev was the first one to notice it, I think. I think, uh, uh, um, he d-dissolved... uh, iron in, uh, I think it was sulfuric acid, and noticed a film, an oily film appeared, uh, on the surface, uh, and it smelled like petroleum. Uh, and he gave samples to, uh, people, uh, w-w-who were experienced with actual petroleum, uh, chemistry. Uh, uh, and, uh, they... uh, identified it as, uh, re... resembling particular, uh, uh, natural, uh, uh, exudations of, of petroleum from the earth. Uh, uh, and, uh, so the idea that, uh, uh, iron is, uh, uh, r... rich, uh, it, it dissolves, uh, carbon, uh, at a high level, uh, uh, and, uh, when uh, it spontaneously synthesizes that carbon, uh, into, uh, uh, that was around, uh, uh, the 1850s, if you noticed that, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, it was a long time before, uh, uh, anyone else, uh, started following up on it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a political motive behind the fossil fuel origin theory of oil, and Ray Peat suggests oil companies promote scarcity to maximize profits.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the same forces that create a doctrine of randomness, that the holistic understanding, the natural animal understanding of gender. And interactions and who we are, that can be displaced and social rules can be imposed to the extent that you deny the reality of biology. The denying reality of biology fits right in with all of the other. authoritarian, randomness-based thing. If you can choose your gender, it's the same thing as having the random determination of all of your properties. It isn't growing out of your interior nature.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how the "disappearing woman as a protected class" and surgeries on minors serve particular interests, and Ray Peat links this to the same forces promoting a doctrine of randomness, denying biological reality, and imposing social rules.

**RAY PEAT:** I think some of the rise of transgenderism that we're seeing is basically a desperate attempt by the ruling class to conceal the radically declining quality of life of all genders. I mean, the rates of homosexuality, transgenderism, cross dressing, whatever you want to call it, have been steadily rising since the 60s. And a lot of it has to do with extreme stress in the environment, poor diet, all of these serotonergic estrogenic drugs, etc. So now that the public is becoming aware of these rapidly rising rates, the elite is throwing a diversion by saying, oh, this is all completely normal, instead of having to explain how come suddenly we have these drastically increasing rates of what used to be pathology.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if blurring gender lines prepares people for a transhumanist agenda, and Ray Peat suggests that the rise of transgenderism is a diversion to conceal declining quality of life, attributing the increase to environmental stress, poor diet, and drugs, and the elite's framing of it as normal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's true. is it just like ludicrous, like merging man and machine? Like that just doesn't sound like it would work just on its face, you know?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the transhumanist agenda of merging man and machine is inherently flawed, and Ray Peat agrees, finding the concept ludicrous.

**RAY PEAT:** No, all of this talk about finding biological compatible materials and so on. It's all all funniness. you Essentially everything that's the latest news in biology and medicine, it's essentially fraudulent. And Ray Kurzweil, who used to be the patron saint of transhumanism, is nowhere to be found. He refuses to be interviewed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the latest news in biology and medicine, and Ray Peat dismisses it as fraudulent, mentioning Ray Kurzweil's disappearance from public discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything is orderly. So complex ordering exists everywhere, it's just a matter of whether we perceive and accept it or not, but I don't think it implies what we think of as consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if orderly signals from stars might indicate intelligent activity in space, and Ray Peat agrees that everything is orderly but doesn't equate it with consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the theory of abiotic oil suggests the Earth is creating oil and that powers that be claim it's running out, and Ray Peat explains the geological consensus of iron dissolving carbon and releasing petroleum-like molecules.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I ran into the Russian research following up decades after Mendeleev made his observation, and they were doing calculations showing that the fossil fuel idea of petroleum really has no basis. And that it's extremely probable that it's a natural geological consequence of this gigantic mass of iron or other heavy metals.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions finding oceans of oil on a Saturn moon and its implications for the dead dinosaur theory versus the abiotic oil theory, and Ray Peat confirms Russian research supporting the abiotic origin of petroleum based on geological processes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the oil companies......want to maximize everything they can squeeze out of the public in the process of selling their oil, by making them fear that it's running out. So they can charge higher price?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a political motive behind the fossil fuel origin theory of oil, and Ray Peat suggests oil companies promote scarcity to maximize profits.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the same forces that create a doctrine of randomness, that the holistic understanding, the natural animal understanding of gender. And interactions and who we are, that can be displaced and social rules can be imposed to the extent that you deny the reality of biology. The denying reality of biology fits right in with all of the other. authoritarian, randomness-based thing. If you can choose your gender, it's the same thing as having the random determination of all of your properties. It isn't growing out of your interior nature.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how the "disappearing woman as a protected class" and surgeries on minors serve particular interests, and Ray Peat links this to the same forces promoting a doctrine of randomness, denying biological reality, and imposing social rules.

**RAY PEAT:** I think some of the rise of transgenderism that we're seeing is basically a desperate attempt by the ruling class to conceal the radically declining quality of life of all genders. I mean, the rates of homosexuality, transgenderism, cross dressing, whatever you want to call it, have been steadily rising since the 60s. And a lot of it has to do with extreme stress in the environment, poor diet, all of these serotonergic estrogenic drugs, etc. So now that the public is becoming aware of these rapidly rising rates, the elite is throwing a diversion by saying, oh, this is all completely normal, instead of having to explain how come suddenly we have these drastically increasing rates of what used to be pathology.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if blurring gender lines prepares people for a transhumanist agenda, and Ray Peat suggests that the rise of transgenderism is a diversion to conceal declining quality of life, attributing the increase to environmental stress, poor diet, and drugs, and the elite's framing of it as normal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's true. is it just like ludicrous, like merging man and machine? Like that just doesn't sound like it would work just on its face, you know?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the transhumanist agenda of merging man and machine is inherently flawed, and Ray Peat agrees, finding the concept ludicrous.

**RAY PEAT:** No, all of this talk about finding biological compatible materials and so on. It's all all funniness. you Essentially everything that's the latest news in biology and medicine, it's essentially fraudulent. And Ray Kurzweil, who used to be the patron saint of transhumanism, is nowhere to be found. He refuses to be interviewed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the latest news in biology and medicine, and Ray Peat dismisses it as fraudulent, mentioning Ray Kurzweil's disappearance from public discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything is orderly. So complex ordering exists everywhere, it's just a matter of whether we perceive and accept it or not, but I don't think it implies what we think of as consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if orderly signals from stars might indicate intelligent activity in space, and Ray Peat agrees that everything is orderly but doesn't equate it with consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the uh awareness of what you're doing, the culture doesn't encourage that sort of thing. But the person with excess energy is going to maintain a high degree of healthy animal coherence, and that includes a big control of what, what take in. Mentally and physically, they will be opinionated by their needs and preferences, rather than by learned principles.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lying and dishonesty have anti-metabolic effects and if physiological coherence requires radical honesty, and Ray Peat suggests that individuals with excess energy maintain healthy coherence, including mental and physical intake, driven by their needs and preferences rather than learned principles.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably. A hypothyroid tired person has a very limited repertoire of thought processes. When your energy is high, you will cycle through different states. Deep sleep, deep relaxation, and high intensity conscious activity. And those cyclings will take you through a variety of attitudes and experiences. And going from one to the next gives you... a broader perspective, and out of that bread you can put together things that would never occur to someone who is staying on a level, an energy level.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a higher metabolic rate improves intuition, and Ray Peat explains that hypothyroid individuals have limited thought processes, while higher energy allows for cycling through states, leading to broader perspectives and novel intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, open-mindedness in the sense of... a certain amount of going out of yourself curiosity, looking for things to perceive, a sort of desire to perceive, leads to novel perceptions and novel intuitions.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is a measure of open-mindedness, which is a surrogate for metabolism, and Ray Peat agrees, defining open-mindedness as curiosity and a desire to perceive, leading to new intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is more part of animal consciousness, and Ray Peat agrees.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, um, the, um, Mendeleev was the first one to notice it, I think. I think, uh, uh, um, he d-dissolved... uh, iron in, uh, I think it was sulfuric acid, and noticed a film, an oily film appeared, uh, on the surface, uh, and it smelled like petroleum. Uh, and he gave samples to, uh, people, uh, w-w-who were experienced with actual petroleum, uh, chemistry. Uh, uh, and, uh, they... uh, identified it as, uh, re... resembling particular, uh, uh, natural, uh, uh, exudations of, of petroleum from the earth. Uh, uh, and, uh, so the idea that, uh, uh, iron is, uh, uh, r... rich, uh, it, it dissolves, uh, carbon, uh, at a high level, uh, uh, and, uh, when uh, it spontaneously synthesizes that carbon, uh, into, uh, uh, that was around, uh, uh, the 1850s, if you noticed that, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, it was a long time before, uh, uh, anyone else, uh, started following up on it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about abiotic oil, and Ray Peat explains Mendeleev's initial observation of oil formation from iron and sulfuric acid, suggesting a geological origin for petroleum.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the geologist consensus is still that the center of the Earth has a very high concentration of a fairly heavy metal like iron. And the capacity of that iron to dissolve carbon amounts to vast amounts of potential petroleum. And so you would expect it to constantly, as the iron reaches new conditions, have volcanic acid. action pushing it in the chemical reactions, then you would expect that vast amount of iron to be releasing more or less steadily a huge supply of petroleum-like molecules according to what Mendeleev observed.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a political motive behind the fossil fuel origin theory of oil, and Ray Peat suggests oil companies promote scarcity to maximize profits.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the same forces that create a doctrine of randomness, that the holistic understanding, the natural animal understanding of gender. And interactions and who we are, that can be displaced and social rules can be imposed to the extent that you deny the reality of biology. The denying reality of biology fits right in with all of the other. authoritarian, randomness-based thing. If you can choose your gender, it's the same thing as having the random determination of all of your properties. It isn't growing out of your interior nature.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how the "disappearing woman as a protected class" and surgeries on minors serve particular interests, and Ray Peat links this to the same forces promoting a doctrine of randomness, denying biological reality, and imposing social rules.

**RAY PEAT:** I think some of the rise of transgenderism that we're seeing is basically a desperate attempt by the ruling class to conceal the radically declining quality of life of all genders. I mean, the rates of homosexuality, transgenderism, cross dressing, whatever you want to call it, have been steadily rising since the 60s. And a lot of it has to do with extreme stress in the environment, poor diet, all of these serotonergic estrogenic drugs, etc. So now that the public is becoming aware of these rapidly rising rates, the elite is throwing a diversion by saying, oh, this is all completely normal, instead of having to explain how come suddenly we have these drastically increasing rates of what used to be pathology.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if blurring gender lines prepares people for a transhumanist agenda, and Ray Peat suggests that the rise of transgenderism is a diversion to conceal declining quality of life, attributing the increase to environmental stress, poor diet, and drugs, and the elite's framing of it as normal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's true. is it just like ludicrous, like merging man and machine? Like that just doesn't sound like it would work just on its face, you know?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the transhumanist agenda of merging man and machine is inherently flawed, and Ray Peat agrees, finding the concept ludicrous.

**RAY PEAT:** No, all of this talk about finding biological compatible materials and so on. It's all all funniness. you Essentially everything that's the latest news in biology and medicine, it's essentially fraudulent. And Ray Kurzweil, who used to be the patron saint of transhumanism, is nowhere to be found. He refuses to be interviewed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the latest news in biology and medicine, and Ray Peat dismisses it as fraudulent, mentioning Ray Kurzweil's disappearance from public discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything is orderly. So complex ordering exists everywhere, it's just a matter of whether we perceive and accept it or not, but I don't think it implies what we think of as consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if orderly signals from stars might indicate intelligent activity in space, and Ray Peat agrees that everything is orderly but doesn't equate it with consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the uh awareness of what you're doing, the culture doesn't encourage that sort of thing. But the person with excess energy is going to maintain a high degree of healthy animal coherence, and that includes a big control of what, what take in. Mentally and physically, they will be opinionated by their needs and preferences, rather than by learned principles.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lying and dishonesty have anti-metabolic effects and if physiological coherence requires radical honesty, and Ray Peat suggests that individuals with excess energy maintain healthy coherence, including mental and physical intake, driven by their needs and preferences rather than learned principles.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably. A hypothyroid tired person has a very limited repertoire of thought processes. When your energy is high, you will cycle through different states. Deep sleep, deep relaxation, and high intensity conscious activity. And those cyclings will take you through a variety of attitudes and experiences. And going from one to the next gives you... a broader perspective, and out of that bread you can put together things that would never occur to someone who is staying on a level, an energy level.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a higher metabolic rate improves intuition, and Ray Peat explains that hypothyroid individuals have limited thought processes, while higher energy allows for cycling through states, leading to broader perspectives and novel intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, open-mindedness in the sense of... a certain amount of going out of yourself curiosity, looking for things to perceive, a sort of desire to perceive, leads to novel perceptions and novel intuitions.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is a measure of open-mindedness, which is a surrogate for metabolism, and Ray Peat agrees, defining open-mindedness as curiosity and a desire to perceive, leading to new intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is more part of animal consciousness, and Ray Peat agrees.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, um, the, um, Mendeleev was the first one to notice it, I think. I think, uh, uh, um, he d-dissolved... uh, iron in, uh, I think it was sulfuric acid, and noticed a film, an oily film appeared, uh, on the surface, uh, and it smelled like petroleum. Uh, and he gave samples to, uh, people, uh, w-w-who were experienced with actual petroleum, uh, chemistry. Uh, uh, and, uh, they... uh, identified it as, uh, re... resembling particular, uh, uh, natural, uh, uh, exudations of, of petroleum from the earth. Uh, uh, and, uh, so the idea that, uh, uh, iron is, uh, uh, r... rich, uh, it, it dissolves, uh, carbon, uh, at a high level, uh, uh, and, uh, when uh, it spontaneously synthesizes that carbon, uh, into, uh, uh, that was around, uh, uh, the 1850s, if you noticed that, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, it was a long time before, uh, uh, anyone else, uh, started following up on it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about abiotic oil, and Ray Peat explains Mendeleev's initial observation of oil formation from iron and sulfuric acid, suggesting a geological origin for petroleum.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the geologist consensus is still that the center of the Earth has a very high concentration of a fairly heavy metal like iron. And the capacity of that iron to dissolve carbon amounts to vast amounts of potential petroleum. And so you would expect it to constantly, as the iron reaches new conditions, have volcanic acid. action pushing it in the chemical reactions, then you would expect that vast amount of iron to be releasing more or less steadily a huge supply of petroleum-like molecules according to what Mendeleev observed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the theory of abiotic oil suggests the Earth is creating oil and that powers that be claim it's running out, and Ray Peat explains the geological consensus of iron dissolving carbon and releasing petroleum-like molecules.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I ran into the Russian research following up decades after Mendeleev made his observation, and they were doing calculations showing that the fossil fuel idea of petroleum really has no basis. And that it's extremely probable that it's a natural geological consequence of this gigantic mass of iron or other heavy metals.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how the "disappearing woman as a protected class" and surgeries on minors serve particular interests, and Ray Peat links this to the same forces promoting a doctrine of randomness, denying biological reality, and imposing social rules.

**RAY PEAT:** I think some of the rise of transgenderism that we're seeing is basically a desperate attempt by the ruling class to conceal the radically declining quality of life of all genders. I mean, the rates of homosexuality, transgenderism, cross dressing, whatever you want to call it, have been steadily rising since the 60s. And a lot of it has to do with extreme stress in the environment, poor diet, all of these serotonergic estrogenic drugs, etc. So now that the public is becoming aware of these rapidly rising rates, the elite is throwing a diversion by saying, oh, this is all completely normal, instead of having to explain how come suddenly we have these drastically increasing rates of what used to be pathology.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if blurring gender lines prepares people for a transhumanist agenda, and Ray Peat suggests that the rise of transgenderism is a diversion to conceal declining quality of life, attributing the increase to environmental stress, poor diet, and drugs, and the elite's framing of it as normal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's true. is it just like ludicrous, like merging man and machine? Like that just doesn't sound like it would work just on its face, you know?
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the transhumanist agenda of merging man and machine is inherently flawed, and Ray Peat agrees, finding the concept ludicrous.

**RAY PEAT:** No, all of this talk about finding biological compatible materials and so on. It's all all funniness. you Essentially everything that's the latest news in biology and medicine, it's essentially fraudulent. And Ray Kurzweil, who used to be the patron saint of transhumanism, is nowhere to be found. He refuses to be interviewed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the latest news in biology and medicine, and Ray Peat dismisses it as fraudulent, mentioning Ray Kurzweil's disappearance from public discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything is orderly. So complex ordering exists everywhere, it's just a matter of whether we perceive and accept it or not, but I don't think it implies what we think of as consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if orderly signals from stars might indicate intelligent activity in space, and Ray Peat agrees that everything is orderly but doesn't equate it with consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cosmos could be considered a gigantic organism, referencing a past discussion, and Ray Peat agrees, referencing Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the uh awareness of what you're doing, the culture doesn't encourage that sort of thing. But the person with excess energy is going to maintain a high degree of healthy animal coherence, and that includes a big control of what, what take in. Mentally and physically, they will be opinionated by their needs and preferences, rather than by learned principles.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lying and dishonesty have anti-metabolic effects and if physiological coherence requires radical honesty, and Ray Peat suggests that individuals with excess energy maintain healthy coherence, including mental and physical intake, driven by their needs and preferences rather than learned principles.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably. A hypothyroid tired person has a very limited repertoire of thought processes. When your energy is high, you will cycle through different states. Deep sleep, deep relaxation, and high intensity conscious activity. And those cyclings will take you through a variety of attitudes and experiences. And going from one to the next gives you... a broader perspective, and out of that bread you can put together things that would never occur to someone who is staying on a level, an energy level.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a higher metabolic rate improves intuition, and Ray Peat explains that hypothyroid individuals have limited thought processes, while higher energy allows for cycling through states, leading to broader perspectives and novel intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, open-mindedness in the sense of... a certain amount of going out of yourself curiosity, looking for things to perceive, a sort of desire to perceive, leads to novel perceptions and novel intuitions.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is a measure of open-mindedness, which is a surrogate for metabolism, and Ray Peat agrees, defining open-mindedness as curiosity and a desire to perceive, leading to new intuitions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if intuition is more part of animal consciousness, and Ray Peat agrees.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, um, the, um, Mendeleev was the first one to notice it, I think. I think, uh, uh, um, he d-dissolved... uh, iron in, uh, I think it was sulfuric acid, and noticed a film, an oily film appeared, uh, on the surface, uh, and it smelled like petroleum. Uh, and he gave samples to, uh, people, uh, w-w-who were experienced with actual petroleum, uh, chemistry.
