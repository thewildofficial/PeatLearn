**RAY PEAT:** The Azov Battalion is an extremist group. They were involved in setting a union hall on fire with dozens of people inside, and most of them burned to death. They march under a swastika flag, and their hero is Bandera, who was a major genocidist under Hitler. They are about the nastiest people you can imagine. They were integrated into Ukraine's National Guard because the breakaway republics favored unions and are nominally favoring socialism. The oligarch-related Nazis control the government in Kiev, and they get along nicely together. The government in the Donetsk breakaway area, the Azov Battalion is leading an attempt to genocide the Russian-speaking population. Kiev assigned them that job after they outlawed speaking Russian and all rights for Russian national citizens, as well as Russian-speaking people and ethnic Russians. The Kiev government has been shelling them constantly for seven years. They crucified some people in the eastern republics.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the situation in Ukraine and its connection to larger geopolitical games?

**RAY PEAT:** The U.S. promoted a coup in 2014. Victoria Nuland openly talked about installing a puppet government and explained that they invested a lot of money in it. Crucial to the coup was having several snipers kill Ukrainian policemen as well as demonstrators to make people believe the government was killing demonstrators, but they were killing police and trying to turn them against the mob. That was when the elected president left. The nominal purpose, publicly, is that the U.S., under Clinton, decided that they should expand NATO right up to all of Russia's borders, after Bush had promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand another inch. But that was just to relax the Russians so they could move nuclear weapons right up to all of their borders. When Putin became active in saying that he couldn't tolerate any more of the advances after several of the former Russian republics had been assimilated by NATO, Russia fought back in Georgia. The U.S. and Britain's attitude has continued since World War I. Their purpose has been to keep Russia from cooperating closely with Germany, because Germany has always had the leading technology, and Russia has had unlimited resources and potential grain production, timber, and all sorts of essential and voluminous minerals. If Hitler's plan, for example, was to conquer Russia and take their resources, everyone realized that would give Germany absolute control of the world. That was in their minds at World War II, and it continues. Anything that would favor Germany doing business with Russia has been inactivated in various ways. Now, they are getting world opinion such that Germany is practically forced to cut off their main energy supplies, the cheap natural gas and oil from Russia, which is very essential to the German economy. By creating an embarrassing situation in world opinion, they are forcing their puppet government of Germany to turn off their energy supply and eventually bankrupt themselves. Meanwhile, the U.S. keeps buying vast amounts of Russian gas and oil. It's the Germans who don't want to have cheap gas and oil.

**CONTEXT:** How does the U.S. government's actions regarding international law and foreign policy play into this?

**RAY PEAT:** International law is a concept that came in with the United Nations. When the U.S. talks about the rules, they are throwing out the tradition of 70 years of international law. This is a law that is on the U.S. books. All treaties are technically the law in the U.S. When Congress ratifies a treaty, it makes it national law. If you look at the history of U.S. treaties, no one obeys the law. They follow whatever law suits them, but when it comes to restricting secret operations or things like that abroad, the law doesn't apply.

**CONTEXT:** How do these geopolitical maneuvers relate to the concept of a one-world government?

**RAY PEAT:** A one-world government has to be ruled by the U.S. There are actual extremists in the government. Since Kennedy's time, it's been very obvious that they seriously believed "better dead than red." The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was constantly maneuvering to get a world order using atomic weapons.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the differing narratives surrounding the conflict, particularly the idea of it being a staged event or theater?

**RAY PEAT:** Trump was a big interference with the American plan to keep Germany as a puppet state and to do everything to end up dissolving the Russian state. When Trump said he could do business with Russia and he didn't think wars were a good idea, they immediately said he was conspiring with Putin. That whole thing was a conspiratorial fabrication coming out of the Democrats' party organization, with Hillary leading the way, referring to Putin as Hitler.

**CONTEXT:** Where do you see this all leading, given the intensity and rapid escalation?

**RAY PEAT:** Russia is losing ground in their public relations because the story of "Satanic Putin" has been so efficiently propagated. Even sane people can't hear what they hear and can't see what they read. Someone e-mailed me that Putin, on the day he recognized the republics, said his purpose was to "decommunize" Ukraine, which is actually fascist. What I heard him say in that speech was his purpose was to "denazify" Ukraine, nothing about decommunizing them. So, his purpose in stopping the Azov Battalion from shelling civilians, his purpose really was to go in and commit genocide against the socialists.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the claims that Putin is trying to reestablish the USSR?

**RAY PEAT:** Under him, one of the critics' lines is to say that because Putin frequently uses the word "God" and spiritual values and traditional morality, that means he's not a secret fascist. But the communists got to the point where Stalin had stopped the active persecution of religion in the early 1940s because he saw that nearly everyone in Russia was an Orthodox true believer. So he said, "What's a socialist party doing persecuting their main supporters?" Putin is following Stalin to that degree. He's using the common concepts natural to his country of spiritual values, honoring traditional morality, and speaking in terms involving references to God. That really offends a lot of the so-called Marxists and communists in Russia; they hate him for that. They want to go back to the old-fashioned persecution of believers. So when he talks in a national, ethnic manner, they say that means he's a fascist and wants to, among other things, restore the kind of communism that existed under Stalin and others.

**CONTEXT:** Have you seen any polls in former Soviet republics regarding the desire to return to the Soviet Union?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, I've seen some polls in the former Soviet republics where the actual people on the ground, in numbers of two-thirds or more, favor the return of the Soviet Union simply because they say their lives were more stable, or at least more human, under the old system. Right now, you have 1% on top in everything and 99% living in basically abject poverty and fear. The average citizen lost everything: pensions, jobs, and so on, transferring state property to the oligarchs with the leadership of economists from Harvard.

**CONTEXT:** How would you estimate the risk of a Third World War, given the current trajectory?

**RAY PEAT:** If Russia wins the war in Ukraine, it basically throws a major wrench into the will of the plans that the West had for this part of the world. I think Biden is already showing that that would totally make Western rulers insane, and the way he talks is pretty insane. Also, the West kind of loses credibility if Russia achieves its goal in Ukraine; it basically shows the West and the entire world that it's still a great power and can pose a credible challenge to the empire. That's a great problem for the West. They see it as a potentially terminal condition for them, so they will resort to anything to resist that. I think they're going to start saying that even though Ukraine was easy to defeat, the Russians had to use massive genocidal methods, and they'll be claiming that Russia has committed atrocities all across the country. The shelling of the breakaway republics has killed at least 10,000 people over these last seven years.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of Russia and China being pushed together economically and politically, and its potential impact on the U.S. dollar?

**RAY PEAT:** Russia and China are being pushed together by basically no desire of their own, but now they have to cooperate in order to survive this. If they come up with an alternative payment system and start trading all these commodities in something other than the U.S. dollar, then that's pretty much game over for the dollar. That's what the West has seen coming for years. When the U.S. froze Russian assets and stopped financial transactions, the Russians had almost equivalent power; they could have frozen Western assets in Russia with great damage to people in the U.S. and could have turned off their cheap gas and several other things they could have retaliated with against the sanctions. But what they're doing is not trying to punish the West, but trying to shift their business by pro-U.S. sanctions. Economically united Russia and China are essentially a checkmate for the West, other than a major war to subjugate that union. The West doesn't really have any other cards. I think it's almost unavoidable that China and Russia are going to come out in a functional control position.

**CONTEXT:** If the elite wanted the U.S. dollar to go away to replace it with their digital currency, could the Russia-China alliance accelerate that plan?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure, but I think the dollar is already experiencing that movement away from the petroleum-supported dollar. Going away from the petroleum dollar was what got Iraq and Libya murdered. They were introducing a gold-backed finance system, so they had to be killed to save the value of the dollar. But now they can't do that to China and Russia. They are moving basically in that same direction. Libya interacted regarding oil prices.

**CONTEXT:** With the current situation and supply chain disruptions, do you see the potential for rapid inflation and civil unrest in the United States?

**RAY PEAT:** Inflation is already happening because of the actions they've taken for the pandemic, but I think it's blending right into the world moving away with China and Russia getting together. So I think there's nowhere to go for the dollar except losing value faster and faster.

**CONTEXT:** What financial moves might the elites make in response, such as introducing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) or controlling access to funds?

**RAY PEAT:** They can cancel bank access, simply the way Canada did. They can confiscate the money of people who take independent actions of all sorts and force people quickly into the digital credit card economy. Trudeau declared martial law or invoked a law that's essentially equivalent to martial law. It didn't take any law at all to do all of the illegal mandates. They knew that a state of emergency existed. They didn't talk about it. But I think we've had a continuing state of emergency now for many years, so they can get away with martial law behavior without having to declare anything.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential consequences of the conflict on the food chain, particularly regarding exports from Russia and Belarus?

**RAY PEAT:** Russia and Belarus together are responsible for two-thirds of the fertilizer used around the world to grow food. If they stop the exports of that, then nobody grows food, no matter where they are. They are in a position of tremendous leverage over Europe and the U.S., but they see such actions as leading to retaliation militarily, and they are very hesitant to retaliate for these.

**CONTEXT:** Could a cyber attack, potentially orchestrated by the CIA, be a catalyst for a wider war situation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, and it could happen anywhere as long as it is convincingly blameable on the Russians. That's their basic thing. It doesn't even have to be convincingly blameable. It's like the virus; it's whatever they say it is, and it's unconfirmable. They're right at the point of being able to declare a pandemic of Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus. That's one of the things that could haunt things in a crisis state. A huge false flag operation is very likely. The trauma of staying home and not seeing your loved ones might pale in comparison to not having water or food or turning on the power. That might be really bad.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the potential for new viruses and the public's attention span, do you see a scenario where a new threat is introduced to shift the narrative?

**RAY PEAT:** I think they are so in control of the media that they can let out little bits. When one thing slacks in the news, they can pep things up by letting out a new danger. So they're alternating between a new virus, cyber attacks, all kinds of possible threats.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the scientific findings regarding reverse transcription in human liver cells and its implications for mRNA technology?

**RAY PEAT:** Peter McCullough and some other people have been talking about proof, maybe in the liver, of reverse transcription for this. A group at MIT and Harvard more than a year ago demonstrated that the process really does happen in cells, but showing that it happens in human liver cells is very important. Just by having a feeling for how cells operate right from the start, the claims of people like Fauci that introducing RNA is going to almost instantly lead to the degradation of that RNA and it couldn't possibly be reverse transcribed, and the product of reverse transcription naturally couldn't get into the nucleus – so that was all like sophomoric molecular biology that Fauci had never studied. But anyone familiar with the actual workings of nucleic acids in the organism knows that those rules are made for the drug companies. Like the idea that you have to encapsulate RNA into some kind of a lipid membrane to get it into the cells – the lipid substance is actually designed to act as an adjuvant to stir up the immune system. It's been known for a long time that naked RNA and naked DNA are circulating in our blood system all the time. If you add a particular type of RNA or DNA strand, it shows up very powerfully inside cells. You don't need anything to target the nucleic acid to make it go into cells. It can go right through the surface of the cell and begin to be incorporated into the nucleus. So, the so-called principles that make such a thing impossible are nothing but the ignorant fantasy of the pharmaceutical people. Pharmaceutical people actually uncovered nucleic acid is going in and out of cells constantly, and it goes in and out of the organism through body fluids: sweat, saliva, tears, urine. These nucleic acids originating in the body are coming out all over our surfaces. So if you put a cold object under your nose so that the urine vapor condenses on it and amylates it, then you find big molecules like nucleic acids and proteins in that condensed vapor, and that was incorporated. When Pfizer was experimenting to develop the vaccine, they warned their people giving the vaccine not to let pregnant or nursing women be exposed to someone who is vaccinated. They were fully aware of this shedding process that is going on all the time.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the presence of graphene oxide in vaccines and its potential role in mind control or cell modification?

**RAY PEAT:** I listened to some of the early reports of the so-called discovery of graphene oxide. These guys said they would be presenting full detailed evidence of how they identified it as graphene oxide, but that has never been presented. It's just that there's junk in the vaccines, physical particles. Graphene oxide is compatible with what they see. There were some publications proposing that for mind control and modification of cells, graphene oxide, being able to pick up electromagnetic fields, could be designed to translate electromagnetic fields into particular nervous and chemical effects in the cell. But that's just a few articles proposing that. What they did was blow it up and said it has already been done.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the importance of the T3 to T4 ratio in thyroid function. Can you elaborate on why a lower ratio, like 1:1 or 1:2, might be beneficial for some individuals?

**RAY PEAT:** If you're, for example, under the influence of something like estrogen, which is interfering with liver function and cell function in general, especially interfering with oxygen as the energy basis, causing a shift to oxidation of fatty acids and this wasting of oxygen as an energy source, it prevents the conversion of T4 to T3. The conversion requires a certain level of oxygen and glucose as the energy source. So, high estrogen women, in particular, very, very frequently have a block between T4 and T3. That's been known for decades. T4 in a healthy young man works almost exactly like T3. In women, it's about 10 times less likely to be an adequate thyroid supplement for thyroxine alone or T4 because estrogen is such a deterrent to the conversion. And men under stress who have done too much aerobic exercise, for example, can't get their T3 to come back after the stress because factors such as aromatase have been activated by the stress and continue to interfere with glucose function. So, stress to men, and the average woman has a very low ability to convert thyroxine to the active hormone. So, if you give a ratio that has enough T3 to keep the oxidative system running, and then just enough T4 to fill in when there's a dip in energy availability, everyone has their optimal ratio. Some people do fine on just thyroxine, but they weren't really the bulk of the hypothyroid population; it's a failure to convert that causes most hypothyroidism.

**CONTEXT:** Is the optimal T3 to T4 ratio influenced by climate or season?

**RAY PEAT:** The need for thyroid is usually about four times as high in a northern winter as during the summer. For many years, I found that two grains of Armour Thyroid was just right for me in the winter. I'm only half a grain, and it was enough to warm me up in the summer.

**CONTEXT:** How do heavy metals interact with the body's redox balance, and what is your approach to mitigating their damage?

**RAY PEAT:** For example, if you're stressed for oxygen, that will bring up heme oxygenase, which turns heme into billy verdant, carbon monoxide, and free iron. And free iron, in the presence of a deficiency of oxygen, is reduced, producing hydroxyl radicals that cause oxidative damage. So, the oxygen deficiency leads to a sort of explosive, random type of oxidation, damaging proteins and nucleic acids and everything. The oxygen should be disposing of the excess electrons, lowering the reductive pressure of the cell. That should detoxify any free iron that's sitting there; it should stay in a harmless, oxidized state. But the stress activates by having electrons escape and reduce the iron, so that the iron then reduces, converts things to free radicals.

**CONTEXT:** Would supplementing with quinones or other oxidizing agents offer a protective effect against heavy metal toxicity, similar to their role with iron?

**RAY PEAT:** I haven't seen that demonstrated, but I'm sure it's happening. I think that could be demonstrated if you had the right quinones, the right oxidative potential.

**CONTEXT:** What is your generic approach to mitigating the damage from heavy metal toxicity and potentially removing them from the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Coffee can accelerate passage through the kidneys; heavy coffee drinkers were found to have less heavy metal load, especially in their kidneys. Things rich in flavonoid-type substances, such as orange juice and grape juice, have a huge impact. Direct chelation is potentially dangerous because it can spread all over the body. Their mechanism of action, if they're not chelators, and same for coffee, is by essentially inactivating the free radical conduction and regeneration. If somebody has a buildup of some heavy metal, as long as they're protecting from the free radical damage, over time the body should be able to excrete that excess by its own mechanisms; there's no need for chelation. Hans Selye did experiments with mercury that suggest that's how it works; with just the right amount of vitamin C, for example, you can put the mercury into a harmless valence that passes out of the body with various chelators.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on progesterone's role in hair loss and its potential as a treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone has to go with general health, especially the elimination of most of the factors that block hair follicles. That includes good thyroid function, good vitamin D function, and adequate calcium, among other things. But progesterone, with vitamin D and calcium and thyroid, not only for restoring hair growth but for everything in health and natural resistance, will be optimized. The estrogen industry has propagandized for decades against progesterone because if it was realized that everything good about female hormones, protection against heart disease for example, derives from progesterone, not from estrogen. If understanding progesterone goes too far, the estrogen industry suffers. After 2002, when they saw that synthetic progesterone with estrogen caused increased mortality from heart disease and breast cancer and strokes, there was a tremendous shift towards the use of progesterone, and along with that came the estrogen industry financing all kinds of campaigns against progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** Why might taking progesterone alone be an insufficient approach for hair loss?

**RAY PEAT:** The studies on cyproterone acetate and other synthetic progestins, if you look at the dosages used for hair regrowth, they were 600 to 800 milligrams daily. I don't know of many people who have tried using natural progesterone in those doses. So the reports are usually coming from people saying, "Why is my hair not coming back?"

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the connection between premature hair loss and the aging of the circulatory system, and its implications for overall health?

**RAY PEAT:** Bald people have increased aging of the circulatory system at a very high frequency, and it's an indication of the likelihood of heart disease developing. So it does show up in other aspects of health. The hair follicle has to produce energy vigorously, and if your systemic energy is being blocked in some way, the skin is one of the first places that can experience it. You can live with quite a bit of atrophy of your hair and skin and nails and still keep your lungs and brain working. The skin and the sinus and a lot of the muscular systems, the blood vessels are protected a lot more than the skeletal muscles against stress and aging.
