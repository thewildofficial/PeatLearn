**RAY PEAT:** I actually think it's all at peace with the pandemic. I think all of it was planned out years ahead to do anything to destroy the economy so the monopolies will have total power. And so like a planned out war do you think if they said if we do this then the Russia will do that It's like that that planned out to a tee. Yeah, I've read two or three articles different people predicting exactly what's happening now in Ukraine and Europe eight years ago. Oh, well.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's initial thoughts on the geopolitical situation and its planned nature.

**RAY PEAT:** The likely outcome if they don't resort to nuclear war will be for Russia and China to totally dominate the world economy and that's why the World Economic Forum. A class is in such a panic now for at least 10 years.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's prediction for the global economic shift if nuclear war is averted.

**RAY PEAT:** The chances within the next two hours are moderate and increasing from then unless... you know, unless there's a dramatic reason for settling and establishing peace in Ukraine.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's assessment of the immediate risk of nuclear war.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and remember when we talked about World War II and the outcome, why the Cold War started. And this is the delicious and bushes. And the banker class, in general, was working, creating Hitler for their basic purpose, since the First World War. The basic purpose of the ruling class is to get access to Russia's resources without the Russians. That's been on the record for a long time, that the Germans have the documents saying that the Russians who couldn't be slave labor would be sent off to starve in Siberia, so essentially eliminating the population so that Germany could have the resources. The United Kingdom and the U.S. weren't happy with that falling solely into Germany's control, so they worked with Hitler, supported his war against Russia to the extent that they figured they could destroy Russia and then take on Germany. And all of that was in place behind the scenes during Roosevelt's management of the war. Both England and the U.S. were stalling months after months, joining the war. Stalin said that. What was it raining to too much for you to invade the continent? Finally, when they saw that Russia was just driving straight through to the west, that was when they invaded to stop the Russians halfway. And just instantly when Roosevelt died, that faction represented by Harry Truman was in control, and so since Truman, the support of the Nazis and working with the Nazis everywhere, Ukrainians and Hungarian fascists, Polish fascists, everyone who lost their power temporarily in Europe moved to North America, mostly Canada and the U.S., and now those people are adding their weight to American policy.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's historical analysis of the ruling class's long-term strategy regarding Russia's resources, tracing it back to World War I and its continuation through World War II and the Cold War.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's just old. A scheme for the World Economic Forum type, the absolute ruling class, to control everything, not just genocide, it's just something along the way to make that happen and become stable. It's a… idea of ruling the world.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's explanation of Nazism as a tool of the ruling class for global control.

**RAY PEAT:** But yeah, at the same time without this war the Empire would have relentlessly continued subjugating and crushing everything in its path.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's perspective on the war's role in potentially disrupting the "Empire's" agenda.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if the, without the Asian and the Russian and the Indian economy, if they form a new center and if that's the new economic center, what is the Western world going to do with its collapsing slash non-existent economy? I mean, wouldn't that mean collapse and in that case the elite loses its power? I'm afraid it will turn into... something much less than a third world that the Shah of Iran might be a model for the government of the West. If there's a widespread economic collapse, in other words, where is this power of the elite? What is it going to be based on if all of their money suddenly is worthless? All of their possessions abroad will probably be confiscated. Russia has already started doing. Chinese will probably follow suit soon enough. And then if basically the world dumps the Western model, doesn't the power of the elite disappear as well? The only thing they have remaining is weapons. They'll declare the common people their enemy, like the Shah of Iran did. Oh, wow. So basically, they'll start cannibalizing each other. As a way of maintaining power.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's analysis of the potential consequences of a shift in global economic power, leading to a collapse of the Western elite's influence and a potential authoritarian response.

**RAY PEAT:** They are leaders insisting that there are no Nazis in Ukraine. Even though... The leaders of the Azov factions fly flasheekas and declare that they have all of the German Nazi symbols and salutes and phrases and so it's impossible to say that they're not Nazis but Israel is saying... aren't having Jewish genocide, at least not on a large scale. They can't be Nazis. That's the extent of Israel's reasoning about Nazism. But they are practicing genocide against Russians, so they, right now, aren't focusing on Jews. That's the extent of their reasoning. Probably will eventually.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's critique of Israel's stance on Nazism in Ukraine, highlighting the contradiction with observable symbols and actions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's the whole thing about the New Jerusalem. I haven't, I've been hearing about it for many decades, but I don't really, I haven't investigated what the theological side is.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's acknowledgment of the "New Jerusalem" concept in relation to Ukraine, noting his limited investigation into its theological underpinnings.

**RAY PEAT:** I think their plan is to use the military to control the basket of deplorables. Us, basically?
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's interpretation of the elite's strategy to maintain control through military means.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you're a well-behaving robot, then your bank account will show enough for food.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's bleak outlook on a future controlled by a technocratic elite, where access to basic necessities is conditional on compliance.

**RAY PEAT:** Potatoes, really on a moderate plot of land, some of the fairly high calorie root vegetables. And just, I know we've talked about it before, but to run through them like sugar, maybe buying gelatin, ghee, what else? Yeah, it's good to have a few years of that stuff start up. Maybe get a few beehives for them to produce honey? Yeah, if you have nearby vegetation that they can eat.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's practical recommendations for food self-sufficiency, emphasizing calorie-dense crops and preservation.

**RAY PEAT:** The weight of the evidence is that Bakhti and Yedin were essentially right that it isn't just a temporary thing. It's a very prolonged, maybe lifelong or transgenerational risk of degenerative disease and death.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's assessment of the long-term risks associated with vaccines, citing specific researchers.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, no organ is exempt and autopsies. Not very many, but extremely clear evidence, macroscopic evidence in the autopsies of continued presence of the spike protein months and up to a year after the vaccine and evidence that they died of the vaccine with remote organs. The blood vessels being infected by the spike RNA produced the antigen spike and the immune system kills. The lining of the blood vessels that are infected and so there's a prolonged maybe lifelong attack of the immune system against your own blood vessels leading to clots and having microscopic or macroscopic clots in the various vessels can create a wide variety of a very nasty diseases.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's detailed explanation of the mechanism by which vaccines can cause degenerative diseases, focusing on the persistent spike protein and its impact on blood vessels.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think any vaccine is capable of causing it. Just injecting aluminum hydroxide affects the brain. The particles travel not just into the bloodstream but up the nerve axons into the brain cells themselves, modifying the brain so that the brain ________________. ________________.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's assertion that vaccines, in general, can have detrimental effects on the brain, citing aluminum hydroxide as an example of a harmful component.

**RAY PEAT:** If you look at the newest information both from the UK and some coming out of the US, the more shots a person has, the more likely they are to die or be hospitalized or be infected. One group of studies showed that with the two shots and a booster, you were twice as likely to die or be hospitalized. The others in the UK show a threefold increase in those serious outcomes for having the booster shot.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's presentation of data indicating a dose-dependent increase in adverse outcomes with vaccination.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, yeah, chronic immune arousal is... at the same time causing deficient defective immunity. So the body will be busy attacking its own inflamed tissues instead of being capable of handling a new infection from an unknown virus? Yeah, autoimmune people are an example, a sort of mild example of what is probably happening to the mass of the vaccinated people.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's explanation of how vaccines can lead to chronic immune dysfunction, characterized by both over-activation and impaired response.

**RAY PEAT:** I would say people are becoming dumber. Let's just be blunt about it.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's blunt assessment of the intellectual decline he observes in the public.

**RAY PEAT:** I, yeah, as far as I can, I try to give them any available insight or support. But even when that insight is, like, immediately turned around and......posted on a forum and disregarded or something, I guess you could care less about what people are saying on the internet.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's perspective on engaging with the public, acknowledging the challenges and his detachment from online discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** I keep......working, to some extent, on things I've been interested in for many years, mainly in the idea of ordering principles, the physics of life and potential, and... I almost never talk about that because people don't often ask me, but I'm paying more and more attention to physical questions and what the possibilities are suggested by some of these eccentric physical ideas.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's description of his ongoing intellectual pursuits, focusing on fundamental physics and the ordering principles of life.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's all one piece, whether it's biology or physics or ideas about consciousness.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's view of his work as an integrated exploration of fundamental reality.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, an EFA deficient. And why do you think that? The experiments that have been done. The germ-free live longer, healthier, but they don't have the powerful stress resistance that the fatty acid deficient rats have.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's explanation of why EFA-deficient rats exhibit greater stress resistance than germ-free rats.

**RAY PEAT:** Not in the blood, I think. It has to be the liver and kidneys excreting them. So we cannot really saturate them on demand while they're floating around in the blood or binding them in a way that basically prevents them from doing their damage. This is only done in specific organs. So far it's only intestinal or rumen bacteria using vitamin E that can do that.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's explanation of the limitations in deactivating PUFAs in the bloodstream, highlighting the role of the liver, kidneys, and specific bacterial actions.

**RAY PEAT:** Some of those, a sense of freedom from social pain, a family that says they're worthless or a society that makes them. feel worthless. They can just go into a dreamy state under the influence of morphine, for example. But that is imitating, in some ways, the euphoria that good steroid hormones should be producing. And so the part of the predisposition to use the drugs is that the stressful social conditions they're in are turning up their harmful hormones and suppressing their own progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone. And that was how we found out that pregnenolone can help people withdraw pretty quickly from the opiates.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's perspective on addiction, viewing it as a response to social stress and a deficiency in natural steroid hormones, with pregnenolone offering a potential solution for withdrawal.

**RAY PEAT:** Was there ever an attempt earlier in the 20th century to do that, or they never tried it? In the early 1950s, there were studies showing that it's much better than cortisone or cortisol for the use of those that have anti-inflammatory and so on. role in the system makes it even worse than progesterone. Progesterone cures essentially everything, trauma, all of the degenerative and stress related diseases and it's hormonally more powerful. than Pregnenolone, but Pregnenolone has the same position in the system. When you take other hormones, the body's production of that hormone decreases, but in the case of progesterone and Pregnenolone, those substances support the body's production of more up to their... ability to make more. So if you're deficient in progesterone, sometimes a single dose or two can activate your body to return to normal production if you have the thyroid vitamin A and cholesterol needed. And to a degree, the same situation with......pregnenolone, it stabilizes the damaged mitochondria and makes it possible for your cells to organize energy production and more pregnenolone and progesterone production. The drug companies first realized that......the progesterone and DHEA were terrible drugs because they tend to cure diseases. And the effects of pregnant women, there are no recognized hormonal effects, but if you have enough of it... In experiments, a rat, for example, would be given 10 grams per rat per dose of pregnant alone with no harmful effects except to stop stress hormone production. And so, it's... Pregnenolone is a relatively expensive material if you supplement it adequately. And since it isn't patentable, those three steroids are something that it's just a matter of the cost of producing them and marketing them. They could essentially cure most of the current diseases if they were made available massively and cheaply. But that doesn't interest the drug companies because they don't have patents.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's detailed explanation of the therapeutic potential of pregnenolone and progesterone, their ability to support the body's own hormone production, and why they are not favored by the pharmaceutical industry due to their non-patentable nature.

**RAY PEAT:** No, there was a symposium in 1950 that revealed the curative effects of pregnenolone and progesterone butですね right in that same symposium following an article on how I think it was progesterone in massive amounts was causing cervical cancer to disappear. That same journal published an article on treating cancer with estrogen and their own data showed that estrogen caused the cancer to become worse and they concluded that estrogen has great promise as a cancer therapy. The data pharmacologists and the research community was intelligent enough to know that a drug that could cure a disease but not be patented was worthless.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's account of a 1950 symposium where the curative effects of pregnenolone and progesterone were presented, alongside a contradictory study promoting estrogen for cancer treatment, highlighting the industry's bias against non-patentable cures.

**RAY PEAT:** It was just sort of a. A vague suspicion 50 years ago, but that's what you infer from reading people like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and the psychologists, that they see a certain spiritual, psychological. cultural attitude as being necessary to save the world and then the west is like beyond rehabilitation it's just uh or maybe nothing is beyond rehabilitation but it seems extremely unlikely and so maybe russia is a chance for a future of humanity uh yeah exactly because they but through the way christianity reached russia they didn't make the fundamental mistakes about the nature of reality and the nature of human being and the west is so committed to a kind of uh individualistic uh random uh management of the physical world that the mental spiritual world as it doesn't rest on any kind of real cosmology.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's long-standing contemplation of Russia's potential role in global spiritual awakening, drawing insights from Russian literature and philosophy, and contrasting it with the West's perceived spiritual and cosmological deficiencies.

**RAY PEAT:** The last newsletter was on cancer. I'm going to fill in some of the background of that around some of the messenger substances that can be controlled to some extent. Do it in a highly supportive way, even sometimes regressed cancer.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat's announcement of his upcoming newsletter topic, focusing on cancer and the role of messenger substances in its regression.
