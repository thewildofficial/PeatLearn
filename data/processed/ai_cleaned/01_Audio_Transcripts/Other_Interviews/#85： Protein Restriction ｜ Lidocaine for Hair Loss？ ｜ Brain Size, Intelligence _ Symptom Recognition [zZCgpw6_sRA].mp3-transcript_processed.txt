**RAY PEAT:** It really started in the 1970s. I was volunteering for a free clinic in Eugene and at that time they were burning grass fields, producers of grass seeds for lawns, and everyone had respiratory disease because of the summer constant smoke. I had found that stopping certain supplements had greatly reduced my allergies, and so I just suggested that since everyone was taking every conceivable supplement with no benefit at all, I mention that to these allergy people at the clinic and all of them got over their symptoms despite the field burning continuing. Then they said, if that silly idea works, what other ideas do you have? I said, well, stop eating toxic junk like tofu and bean salad with lettuce and cucumbers and various seeds and indigestible material, all the stylish hippy stuff. Stop eating that and just eat it to try milk and cheese and eggs and meat and a more digestible diet. And so everyone did and they said, oh, the wonders of a high protein diet. It wasn't high protein, it was just low protein junk food basically, uncooked, indigestible. It wasn't intended as a specially high or low protein diet, but for years people were saying that the Peat diet, which I had never defined in terms of major nutrients, but that came to be called a Peat diet and was considered high protein. If you're an active person in your 20s, you're very likely to be burning 4,000 or 5,000 calories per day of whatever nutrients, and so 100 grams of protein in a 5,000 calorie diet with lots of carbohydrate isn't a bad ratio at all.

**CONTEXT:** How has your thinking on protein intake evolved over the years?

**RAY PEAT:** For many years now, I've been talking about restriction of essential amino acids. Methionine restriction in animals increased their lifespan by 40 percent, and you had an additional percent for restricting cysteine and tryptophan and other essential amino acids. So it's extremely life-extending to limit certain essential amino acids. And when you look at something Broda Barnes noticed about 50 years ago, I guess, he tried a high-protein diet. And for years he had been taking two grains of Armour [thyroid] every day, and on increasing the meat in his diet, he had to take four grains of Armour every day to maintain his functions. So those two things have been out there as items of interest: the restriction and longevity and the anti-thyroid effect of generally higher protein and the life-extending benefits of the immunosuppressive target of rapamycin inhibitors. The rapamycin type of antibiotic suppresses our growth, called mammalian rapamycin. So that explains a big part of the mechanism behind methionine restriction, longevity, and protein inhibition of energy production in a safe way.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the mTOR pathway and its relation to longevity. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it isn't actually calories, it's the anti-metabolic effect of those specific amino acids.

**CONTEXT:** So, the restriction of certain amino acids, like methionine, is what blocks the mTOR pathway, not necessarily caloric restriction itself?

**RAY PEAT:** Around the age of 30, everyone's mitochondria are being suppressed, so your metabolism is much slower after middle age, and that means that it's much more susceptible to being suppressed by those unnecessary amino acids.

**CONTEXT:** So, if you're young, you might need around 100 grams of protein, but as you age, you might need less, perhaps around 50 grams?

**RAY PEAT:** Right. And the carbohydrates go up as you, the ability to metabolize carbohydrates go up as you reduce your protein suppression and then what's the pressure of the metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** What about sick people or generally people that don't feel well? Should they reduce their protein intake or be conscious of it?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, for example, having fruit juice when you're sick, a very high carbohydrate diet, it is very protective. A lot of that is because the proteins, even though they're anti-inflammatory for your digestive system, if they're beyond that very low level, whatever, 50 grams a day maybe, they're going to slow your metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** Would trying different amounts of protein, including lower amounts, be a useful tool for a person to regain their health?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, but especially different amounts of carbohydrates and different types. And you just reminded me to talk about the grape juice because I think that's really...

**CONTEXT:** This reminds me of the experiment the Russians did showing that you can survive and in fact thrive on a diet of nothing but potatoes and butter. Considering that potatoes have all these keto acids and the rest of it is carbs, would you say that would be a decent kind of diet for an older person or a hypermetabolic person?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, everyone since Adele Davis, maybe before, have commented on how well so many old people do living on tea and toast for example or jello and toast. That's the real Peat diet.

**CONTEXT:** So, what can one do to limit the dangers of starch, even in well-cooked potatoes, if we want to use it just for energy, or with butter to prevent prescription?

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, so the butter is the main, like other saturated fats are basically the main protective factor when eating starch.

**CONTEXT:** Ray, for yourself, how did you arrive at the 50 grams of protein? Like, what was that calculation? How did that happen?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, just that it's hard to eat less. Even with the juices, as you reach a gallon of orange juice, your protein is going up considerably. And that's fairly difficult to do. You probably have to modulate your milk intake and meat and things like that.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, even though the calcium in milk helps to keep your thyroid function going, you have to, at first, somewhat limit your milk and cheese, and egg intake, and even well-cooked vegetables you can choose some that have a little methionine content. And then was the grape juice like kind of useful for this kind of new experiment? I don't know how new it is, but the things you're doing now because to maybe offset with the huge amount of carbohydrate you would need to increase it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it does have a huge amount of carbohydrate and you have to be careful because it can osmotically upset your digestion.

**CONTEXT:** The grape juice?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I can only tolerate two or three ounces at a time.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, interesting. And so, I guess, you're just... How many carbohydrates... Again, I'm not saying this so everybody should do it, I'm just curious of what you're doing. Maybe you're eating well over 500 grams or so?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, you're just about in that range, 500 or 600, I think. From just, mainly from orange juice? Oh, no. A lot of very well-cooked vegetables, just for taste variety. I just can't dig down that much grape juice and orange juice.

**CONTEXT:** And then I promise we'll move on. But how has this changed your liver consumption and your egg consumption? Like, do you eat less liver each week?

**RAY PEAT:** Very, very much less. Like one or two ounces? Currently, it's hard to get good organic liver, such as chicken liver. And so whenever that's available, we'll have some chicken livers with bacon, but that might be only once in two months.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, well. But maybe if the butcher in Oregon had liver, would your preference be to... ruminant liver, would your preference be for that? It's just not available given all the crazy things that are happening?

**RAY PEAT:** The little chicken livers with bacon are very pleasant.

**CONTEXT:** Fair enough. That's a good answer. I think that settles it. But why would the change in dietary, in the macro ratios, change the intake of liver for you as well? You feel like you need less or...?

**RAY PEAT:** You feel like you need less.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. But liver is a huge source of methionine, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah. And, you know, really early on, probably 10 years ago, you know, I think I ate eight ounces of liver and I felt real cold afterwards and then the next day felt especially hypothyroid, so it might be just good for posterity.

**CONTEXT:** What the methionine, like what is the specific mechanism that it's suppressing the thyroid function? Or is it doing lots of different things?

**RAY PEAT:** Lots of things. I don't know what the most important mechanism is.

**CONTEXT:** Fair enough and we can move on and Georgie interrupt me at any time here. Something I've noticed, maybe you had mentioned it a long time ago that people with like a physically larger brain might notice symptoms really quickly, like they have really high energy requirements and if those requirements weren't met they would notice it and like kind of nuance symptoms about their health and you know that idea I keep thinking about it because the people I talk to are all really interesting they're all interesting people with interesting ideas with different backgrounds and I I would bet that they're very I mean I mean I know they're intelligent and so but some of the smartest people will notice like the tiniest little defects in their body and so I was wondering if you could just speak about brain metabolism and then noticing symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the brain requires in an absolute sense a steady supply of glycogen and glucose. And so just excited thinking can consume really large amounts of sugar. And checking your blood pressure, it's called the pulse pressure or the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. If everything is running smoothly with enough blood sugar, you'll have a systolic that's at least 50 points, about 50 points higher than diastolic, very often lower. But if you're having a problem with your glucose, you're going to have increased difference with maybe 75 points higher systolic than diastolic. If you're having a problem with your glucose, you're going to have increased difference. Get in that condition from excitation or whatever cause, anything that depletes your systemic glycogen. And by checking your pulse pressure frequently and increasing your glucose and starch intake considerably, and every few hours checking it and having more glucose, you can tell when you have replenished the glycogen source because suddenly your difference between systolic and diastolic will come down to 40 or 45 points difference.

**CONTEXT:** Wow, that's useful to know and then in the same kind of line of questioning Would you expect somebody that had a real low rate of metabolism and maybe had I mean we all have imperfect development But somebody with like a physically smaller brain or something that had three vaccines and just taking finasteride and stuff and says they don't notice the difference but like Maybe somebody that's running at a really low level would not notice these like toxic insults that are happening at every moment of the day to them like a it could that equally be true as it is?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Um, and then people that take SRI drugs are basically very prone to not only self-harm but also like getting wounds that they sometimes they they sit there and fester because they ignored them, they never felt the pain and they couldn't disinfect them. So people with high serotonin, they tend to, I think they tend to experience higher emotional pain but they're numbed at the extremities. And I've noticed several people around me that are taking these drugs, they often have these wounds and scrapes on them that look pretty pretty ghastly and they only noticed them when I point them out. They they claimed it didn't hurt when they actually happened. Yeah, yeah, that sort of thing are eventually is corrected by keeping your thyroid chronically a lot higher.

**CONTEXT:** And then in line with the things I'm learning for the people I talk to, I'm probably talking like four people right now that can take 200 milligrams of progesterone and it has no effect whatsoever, but they all seem to uniformly benefit from antibiotics like the specifically the tetracyclines or the macrolides and so But they don't necessarily have digestive problems per se and so clearly they're or maybe they're benefiting from the antibiotics anti-inflammatory effect. And then again, I know this is kind of redundant because you've talked about this a lot but what like what do you think is a good approach or strategies for somebody that might have a nitric oxide problem? You know if that's what's going on and their liver is not maybe responding to the huge amount of progesterone. What would a small amount of T3 be useful like a one or two micrograms per hour?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. And it all works. Everything that you have to regulate with the nervous system, hormones, digestive enzyme balance, and so on, all of those are involved so that your cholinergic nervous system activity and your adrenergic system are activated in different ways. The helplessness, cholinergic reflexes interfere with everything good. You make more nitric oxide, for example, and slow things down and cause inflammatory damage.

**CONTEXT:** Is there something I'm not thinking of that would be useful for that situation? Like, oh, I have an experience with this person writing me that they overcame that situation with XYZ or is it like a... in most desperate need of. What about the tool in the toolbox of reducing protein? Would that be especially useful for somebody maybe with a... Do you think what I'm describing is liver disease, like a person not responding to the progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that can be a quickly repaired thing by getting the glycogen up. The liver turns off, just like the brain, if it hasn't stored enough glycogen, and that is a matter of two or three days often. So for liver disease, glycogen should be the top priority and glycogenesis can't happen without T3 and progesterone and enough carbohydrate.

**CONTEXT:** Nicotine, besides its many beneficial effects, the problem is that it is the direct activator of the acetylcholine receptors. Problem was using which? Well, I mean, several people have asked you about using nicotine from tobacco as a chewing gum or actually as a tincture or just as an isolated substance. And you've said several times that it may be beneficial, it's got a number of beneficial effects but you're wary of it and you don't recommend long-term use and do you think that the fact that nicotine is actually a direct ligand for that system, an activator of the cholinergic system, do you think that's the main risk associated with it?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's likely, it's part of your cholinergic system. You can't be sure how the nicotine is going to fit into the anti-inflammatory system. It has that potential but can do the opposite too and turn on cancer metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** Why do you think the tobacco consumption is so widespread among indigenous cultures, especially the ones that are in the Americas?

**RAY PEAT:** It has its stimulating value. It psychologically can turn things up and make you function.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so it's mostly as a stimulant, as widely available stimulant for...?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. I'm just going back to the glycogen for a second. Two things I know you've mentioned that can deplete the liver of its glycogen, the estrogen and maybe the serotonin, and maybe they're working on the same mechanism. Does the methionine, how does that relate to the estrogen and the serotonin? Does that tend to increase them?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. It has a demobilizing function, and the methyl groups are in a constant battle. There's been too much emphasis on people who don't have enough methyl groups and not enough on the danger of an excess methyl pressure. So in addition to the methionine and the insulinogenic effects of the protein, that's kind of that could be a slippery slope for a person with an underfunctioning liver.

**CONTEXT:** Mm-hmm. Okay, just a few more and then we can talk about cultural things. And Ray, I'm not gonna keep you too long. And so the other thing that's completely unrelated... Ray, lidocaine as a topical for hair loss. What do you think about that?

**RAY PEAT:** It's generally self-protective. I don't know anyone who has tried it, but since it works for all kinds of very serious conditions, even helping with cancer and brain injury, I think it's a great product. Almost always a good thing to try. It prevents energy waste, and so it's working at a simple level of available energy that makes everything better.

**CONTEXT:** And then I have at least one paper in regards to so-called pattern baldness, and they say investigation should be done on mast cell inhibitors for a pattern baldness. And so obviously the lidocaine would help with that, right? And the whole world wants me to ask you about the massage thing. And so what everybody is asking, what is he specifically talking about? What type of massage? So in my point of view, the massage ideas that were going around were like, don't do it, don't stop until your head is inflamed and red and has like obvious inflammation in it. So what type of massage were you thinking about that you thought could increase hair growth?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, just a very gentle massage such as gently rubbing oil into it. You don't want to cause inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** And that the mechanism there might be obviously it feels good, but maybe increasing the blood flow to the area. That is a problem with the hair loss.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, feeling good is a good way to increase blood flow. If you increase blood flow by irritation, that's because you're doing damage that causes lactic acid production and blocking good energy production. So they're a very soft, stimulating, pleasure-giving massage. It is the opposite of a rough, irritating massage.

**CONTEXT:** Thanks for that. And last question from me and then we can move on. Maybe you can concur, but the most common thing with thyroid dosing with Sinoplus and Sinomel is overdosing. Maybe once a week somebody tells me I started with a tablet of Sinoplus and a tablet of Sinomel just as a starting dose. So I have a few questions for you about this. So, one, we've talked many, many times about maybe 10 micrograms at T3 being kind of a limit for dosing thyroid, or maybe even an arbitrary limit, and using that with a meal. When you take 15 or 20, what, maybe you had said previously that the liver creates enzymes to destroy it really quickly? Maybe you can just expand on that a bit.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so that after a couple of weeks of doing that, you are maybe 10 or 12 hours after that overdose, you have plunged to a hypothyroid state. If you're dosing it only once or twice a day, those ups and downs become really extreme and can do things like stopping your heart rate when your thyroid dips sharply.

**CONTEXT:** And then just because we've been talking about so much, for a person with liver disease, in your experience and from what you've read, do they tend to do better on smaller doses of T3 or bigger doses?

**RAY PEAT:** Smaller. I think no one should supplement thyroid until they've read at least one of Broda Barnes' books. Maybe the, "It's Not Your Mind, It's Your Liver," "The Hope for Hypoglycemia." Yeah. I think they just started reprinting that as a side note.

**CONTEXT:** And shoot, I had another question about the teeth. Oh, do you think it's a good idea to, like, I've seen the overdosing stuff so often that I started recommending people buy $20 milligram scales. And as annoying as that is, I'm just worried about people taking too much. And so if they measure, tablet of Sinomel, which is usually about 100 milligrams, and then they do that cross-reference mass, and then they find the microgram dosage, do you think that's a good way to do it? Or is that too, is that crazy?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure whether they're actually going to be getting the right amount of T3. If it's well distributed in the tablet, I think powdering a Cytomel tablet and figuring that you're taking two or three micrograms at the time, you're in least danger of having a suppression.

**CONTEXT:** So that's good to know. I did not know that. So you think there could be a huge amount of T3 on one side of the pill and not enough on the other side?

**RAY PEAT:** It's just conceivable.

**CONTEXT:** Very interesting. I appreciate you pointing that out. And then, once it's powdered... If a person wants to go for accuracy, they could measure it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but I would tend to go by the label. If it's Sinomel or Cytomel, I think you can count on the amount per tablet being accurate, but none of the generics that I've tried has been reliably the potency that they claim.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, but once you powder a Sinomel tablet, like how would you, if somebody was in a precarious situation and they're like, okay, I'm going to try two micrograms, like how do you even go about doing that? You'd have to have a scale, right? Despite your visual judgment, you powder 20. A five microgram tablet and then divided into 10 apparently equal pieces.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, fair enough. But do you think, I know you're maybe resistant to recommending like a super complex type of thing, but like do you think that's a, if a person wanted to go for like very accurate doses, do you think that's a bad idea to do the scale? Is that like, would that not be as accurate as the person thinks it is?

**RAY PEAT:** It's misleading because your body isn't that accurate. The body responds very differently every time. There's no scale equivalent in the body. It's always a new experience for the body. It's basically impossible to get an accurate dose of thyroid and you just have to go off feeling, which I can accept.

**CONTEXT:** By the feeling, right? Temperature, pulse rate, and feeling.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, fair enough. Okay, I guess we'll let you go really soon here, Ray, but I just wanted to catch up on the cultural stuff. So maybe, I don't know, three, four months ago, we asked you, are things still going to plan? And I just wanted to get your update about that. Do you still think things are going to plan? Not our plan, the oligarch's insane psycho plan. Which things? Like the things you're seeing right now with the war and kind of the rallying about monkeypox and everything that's happening. And then the Fed starting to talk about the digital dollar and servers being online in February 2023. I guess sometimes a person will say, hey, I think their plan is failing. So do you think that is that your orientation that things are not going well for them?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, everything they're doing is becoming stupid and obvious, but they have rigged it so that our stupid and obvious aren't impediments to going ahead. The banks say that there is simply no alternative to digital money, and they're just going ahead with it according to plan. It takes time to write all of the programs to manage all of the money in the world on a mass, a stereotyped manner so that no one has actual money but everyone is on the retainer a certain amount of money as soon as they can write the programs to administer that. Intending it to come out in something like two or three years just to get the bank machinery set up to do it, but even though everyone who thinks about it realizes it's absolutely evil, deadly, going to ruin the whole ecosphere, they have created essentially a mass dementia, an epidemic of dementia in which people can't even begin to think about how to get out of that deadly fate.

**CONTEXT:** So the more direct question, as you now see, I mean, I'm sure you've seen Russia and China are basically have solidified their union. Russia has said, we're done with the West, it's over. They're about to start their own currency. The BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China, the organization, and now they've added more to that organization, is also about to, you know, launch kind of its own currency backed by commodities. What do you think is going to happen over the next six to 12 months in the West? Without food and potentially without raw materials for energy in Europe and maybe even in the United States, are we looking at a, I don't know, mass famine event here in the States in the next six to 12 months?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the production of grain by Ukraine and Russia is still there so that the worst of starvation in the southern world can be alleviated, but everything is going to be under maximum tension. And the only thing that is keeping away a sort of terminal starvation condition is the success of the Russian-Chinese Third World Axis. They are on the threshold of a successful world economy, and the main danger of that is that the West can't see any non-demanded solutions. And so they're increasingly likely to resort to nuclear weapons.

**CONTEXT:** So do you think that, I mean, basically that now with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and the economy formally, not that there was much of it remaining before, but even now the fake money is going to disappear or at least significantly be curtailed because of the higher interest rate, do you foresee things getting rougher over the next six, 12 months? Or do you think there's some kind of an opportunity for improvement?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think the West is just committed to everything getting worse.

**CONTEXT:** Wow. Okay. Ray, you echoed, I'm kicking myself because I can't remember this reporter's name, but he's in the Ukraine and he basically said that the Ukraine is getting slaughtered by Russia right now, then he thought the U.S. would then send in troops, they would also get slaughtered. And then the only thing the U.S. could do is, because they never apparently said they would not do a first strike, that they would use nuclear weapons. Do you think that is like a plausible scenario?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the state of dementia that they have created for themselves leads almost inexorably to that.

**CONTEXT:** Was that Gonzalo Lira? He's funny. Does your animal instinct, the first signal system, does it tell you right now that the West is done?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I never hear Lira saying anything wrong. He is extremely compelling and him being close to the action is also pretty useful. He had another one saying that, we've talked about this on the podcast before, but the Americans have such a strong normalcy bias that they can't see what's coming like right around the corner. And I feel like I experienced that day, like every day, like I feel like this is like wartime, but I don't think, I'm not saying people should have my crazy attitude or whatever, but people seem like they're kind of complacent or think because we're in a reprieve from this crazy, like, masks are disappearing and stuff, that things are going to get better, but, I mean, if he's right, you know, things are just going to get significantly worse fast, like, really quickly within the next six months or so.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but that's approximately the schedule that I think is inevitable.

**CONTEXT:** Have you bought any canned food that can last you a few months? I don't know if the cans are a nuisance, but getting a... I always have a barrel of coconut oil and some powdered milk and a lot of grains.

**RAY PEAT:** And sugar, right? Georgie said, and sugar, right? The low-protein stuff is actually pretty useful entering into a dystopian future. Also seeing less eggs, and we didn't really talk about that, but has your egg consumption also decreased?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the good thing about the carbohydrates is that they're cheap, will continue to be quickly produced, and are easy to preserve. So if you just avoided the methionine, the PUFA, the iron, all the food additives, even walking into a dystopian future, you could probably feel relatively okay. Possibly.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, I've talked to, I mean, cause I always try to see the, you know, the arguments of the other side. So I, over the years, ever since this whole thing, the craziness with the pandemic started, I tried to talk to some moderates and some people really, you know, the other extreme. And over the last two years, everybody that is, that was moderate, that was willing to consider that maybe, you know, there was some nefariousness, but you know, they're trying to kind of like buy their time and see how things go. Every single one of these people has been so-called red-pilled, have moved towards the side that says wow things are really bad and then the people who used to be simply optimistic now have become extreme to the point that they don't even want to be bothered and whenever you bring stuff up about like potential world war or anything like that they just refuse to listen which to me saying that we are living in very extreme times one last thing about the nuclear war there's nothing to do about that like if they i mean if they use nukes like there's no amount of i mean have you made any preparations whatsoever if that happens just to drive south as quickly as possible or towards the middle of the country where they probably wouldn't waste the nukes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but the clouds will concentrate over the northern hemisphere so the farther south you go the quicker the less likely you are to be quickly killed.

**CONTEXT:** So the closer to the equator the better?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. In Mexico would you have to go to Chiapas? Or would Michoacán be the best place to be for that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think for the present Michoacán is good. High altitude, moderate rainfall.

**CONTEXT:** What would be some remedies, potential for low-level radiation exposure, obviously if it doesn't kill immediately or cause cancer over the next year, what could be some things that could decrease the long-term damage?

**RAY PEAT:** Green fossil, if you have a greenhouse, heating it with fossil fuels so that you avoid such things as strontium fallout and get stable calcium and avoid the frequent the things that are very quick to absorb radiation, avoid vegetables that are growing right after the fallout.

**CONTEXT:** But that would include also animal food, right? Because the radiation will concentrate in their bones and brain and the fat tissue?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And so, old food, if you find old stories of dehydrated or canned foods, they're the first to use.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. Last thing for me, one of the common retorts, if I'm talking about Mexico with somebody, is that they don't want to go because of the cartels here. You know what? In a dystopian future with a nuclear radiation sea, what do you see the cartels function as when things get really bad? Do you think they would take over Mexico and it would be really bad? Or would you prefer that over some kind of digitized prison in the U.S., like you have to pick your poison? Or what do you think about that?

**RAY PEAT:** The cartels are just effectively capital, so there's not going to be anything particularly bad about what they do. I think they only exist because there's a huge market up north, right? And they're controlled by the CIA. If these things disappear, the cartels will have to find another job, which probably involves working the land and doing something productive.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, they've turned to things like avocados instead of drugs. You don't think it would turn into kind of an organized mafia type of thing, just like crying? I mean, that will probably just happen everywhere if things get really bad.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.
