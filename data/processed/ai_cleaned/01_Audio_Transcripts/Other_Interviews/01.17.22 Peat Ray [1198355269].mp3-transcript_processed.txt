**RAY PEAT:** "The actual history of the government being involved with the profit-making motives behind the so-called vaccines. David Martin going through the history of patents regarding vaccines shows that going back more than 15 years you can find that they were planning to do this sort of thing. The spike protein and the antibodies that are formed in response to the spike protein, both of these were shown to destroy lung tissue. Way back 15 years ago, so the craziest thing in the world would be to ignore that even the antibodies to the spike protein. kill lung tissue. So the whole concept of a an RNA based vaccine against the spike protein, there's everything wrong with it and nothing right with it except that you can create a vaccine so called in a few weeks were ordinarily to actually biologically. So that you've got an immune reaction, it takes years, on average about 10 years to make a vaccine that works at least against the virus you're starting with. But this one was never shown to work against any virus. No virus. It just, it really was meant to, can he prove that it was just meant to do something other than what's good for the body?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the historical context and potential motives behind certain vaccine development.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you look at the actual research around 2005, you see that they had explained why the spike protein is harmful and why the antibodies to it are harmful. At least. When we form an antibody to something outside the body, that gives us a mirror image, a protein that locks, like the lock and key, into the antigen, but having formed these antibodies, our body recognizes the novelty of this newly formed antibody and forms antibodies against that antibody and the second generation antibody is an exact copy, as close as biologically possible, to the original toxic antigen, so every time we react to any harmful antigen. Two steps away from that, we are creating a copy of the harmful antigen and these waves of antibodies against antibodies are expensive. They occupy our immune apparatus and so repeated exposure to different things. Good, even so-called good vaccines, if you give 50 different antigens to a person during development, you are occupying a huge amount of their immune system, but you're only doing it for the superficial level of antibodies. Every time you specialize in a new... kind of antibody, you're spending your potential, but only... you're investing in the possibility that you will confront that particular threat again, so you're investing in the past in a way, and that has to do with the accumulated damage of aging, and... in Africa, because of poor diet and exposure to lots of parasites and infections, a warm, humid climate, lots of fungal infections, these things are occupying their immune system over and over again, and that is a burden on the immune system, explaining why the incidence of acquired immune deficiency is so high when the environment is rich in diseases. So that is why this whole......age thing got so prevalent in the early 80s in Africa because of the environment."
**CONTEXT:** The host inquires about the mechanism by which antibodies to the spike protein can be harmful.

**RAY PEAT:** "But there wasn't really ever... Was there, Dr. Peeta, an age virus that was isolated and shown and really existed as advertised? In a sense, but in Africa, they didn't find that and so they redefined the existence of AIDS. As having the infections that typify people with AIDS, so tuberculosis is very common in AIDS infected people and you see lots of TB in Africa, every time you identify a new tuberculosis patient, by definition that has become an AIDS victim. Wow. It's just a matter of definition. So they actually changed the definition or categorization of people dying from AIDS, but not really because they couldn't find this virus. It never really..."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if an AIDS-causing virus was ever definitively isolated and proven to exist as advertised.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, Peter Duesberg has been writing about this. He was the world's leading virologist in the 1960s. But as soon as he questioned this idea that there is an AIDS-causing virus, as soon as he questioned that, he was... exiled scientifically, not invited to science meetings, not given any grants, ruined, just ended his career totally. And one of the stories that I hadn't heard before, I think it was in Kennedy's book, is that... a well-known medical researcher contacted him by phone and said he wanted to talk to him, flew across the country to have dinner with him. After having supper with him, pulled out a document, a research article supposedly, under Duesberg's name. Duesberg had nothing to do with writing it. What was amazing was that if you take responsibility and say this is your work, you're back in the science establishment simply by saying, provide and acknowledge the existence of an AIDS virus. Wow. And he turned it down and just stayed in exile."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the scientific community's reaction to questioning the existence of an AIDS-causing virus, referencing Peter Duesberg.

**RAY PEAT:** "The drugs that they gave these kids? From the diagnosed as AIDS? Yes, sir. Peter Dursford makes a good case that it was, at first, recreational drugs that were very popular in the homosexual community. And then, after Fauci became involved, the non-researched or fraudulently researched chemicals to supposedly treat the infection turned out to be deadly. And Duisburg goes through that history that when the death rate from the recreational drugs was tapering off, the pharmaceutical anti-retroviral agents coming on the market took over killing the patients."
**CONTEXT:** The host inquires about the role of drugs in the AIDS crisis, specifically AZT.

**RAY PEAT:** "The PCR didn't come into use until just about a year after the HIV was supposed to be identified. Yeah. But this was the work, too, that Carey Mullis, who did invent the PCR, he was looking into this, right? And I've seen videos where he says, I couldn't find any virus. That's right. The existence of the virus was thoroughly established, according to Fauci and the government, before the PCR. Test existed, and when it did exist, Jerry Mullis, as I said, there's no basis for claiming that."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the diagnostic tests for AIDS were similar to the PCR test and references Kerry Mullis's skepticism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, they vary. Each one has its own toxicity, and there's a tremendous variation in those. But when you add up all of the reported deaths, from the pre-existing vaccines, the deaths reported from the new so-called vaccines something like 100 times more than from all of the existing vaccines added together for the last 10 years. So, there were several of the standard so-called vaccines that were very toxic, like for the papillomavirus, fairly toxic, the anti-tetanus shot, the others were almost harmless, but still, they were all a burden to the immune system, and adding up even these things which were only about 1% as harmful as the present RNA virus vaccines, when you add up these relatively harmless things, then you see a tremendous increase in allergies, not a massive... wave of deaths in middle-aged and younger people, but allergies developing in childhood. So it's about 50 times as many allergic kids and young people as before the 1970s and 80s when vaccines were really pushed."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there are similar issues with childhood vaccines as with newer ones.

**RAY PEAT:** "The hepatitis B vaccine was shown to cause lingering brain damage in animal studies, and they gave it to little kids as if everyone was going to be exposed to sexually transmitted hepatitis or to contaminated intravenous drugs. So, even the... the theoretically harmless measles, mumps, rubella, you know, that they just give the kids... Cowan and others argue that they really do mess up the innate immune system."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential harm of specific childhood vaccines like the hepatitis B vaccine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, for example, there's evidence that the kids who had normal measles... are relatively resistant to developing cancer later in life. Who just go ahead and have the measles?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the long-term effects of contracting measles naturally.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, in the late 1930s and through the 1940s, my parents just got their information from newspapers and radio and magazines and so on. And still, there was enough evidence already to indicate that. Vaccines were very questionable as a preventive or as a harmless measure in the, starting fairly early, the beginning of the 20th century, there was evidence that injecting anything intramuscularly, anything irritating especially, predisposed kids to getting paralysis of the area that receives the injection, so if it went in their right hip, that leg was more likely to develop polio paralysis, or the left shoulder, that left arm was much more likely to become paralyzed, that has been reported now for over a hundred years, and there were very, very well-publicized studies in the 1950s, that pretty well turned everyone who is at all informed against the vaccines, and that effect of the area affected by polio is still seen in Africa today, you can, the frequency of paralysis of a particular part of the body corresponds closely to the site of vaccination."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the history of vaccine administration and early concerns.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, currently I think most of it is called the vaccine-derived polio. Paralysis very specifically relating to the virus given in the vaccines."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if polio vaccines are still administered and if there are associated risks.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if they're properly prepared, they're fine. Thousands of years ago, people, I guess, cooking around an open fire found that if they got ashes, wood ashes into their cooking wheat or corn or whatever their cereal was, that it tasted better and that it was better for their health, easier to digest, more nutritious, and that it's now called, generally it's called... nextimalization. Yes, sir. And you've told us about this, right? Nextimalization of the corn in Mexico, and we can do this. Yeah, it tastes very good and it's very digestible and highly nutritious. The toxins of the grain are mostly removed or destroyed by the alkali, at the same time that tryptophan, which in itself... leads to a promotion of serotonin and inflammation. The tryptophan, which is a potential toxin, is converted to niacin, niacinamide, which is one of the signs of eating corn unprocessed, is the deficiency disease of niacin, and people who use the nixtamalized corn don't get that deficiency disease because it gives you a very abundant source of niacinamide, and the removal of the polyunsaturated fats is part of it, that they suponify a very large proportion of them become soap-like in the presence of lye or the calcium hydroxide, lime, and in the suponified form they wash out and are thrown away or added to chicken food or whatever for extra calories, but simply reducing the PUFA content of the grain is a very important thing. So the nixtamalization of corn has been used in traditional... in South America and Mexico for a long time. People just kind of knew it, they figured it out, passed it along to generations. And in Asia, other grains, including wheat, were processed in the same way. And people have experimented trying out maybe a dozen different types of grain, saying that they all are improved in flavor and digestibility by the process."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the healthfulness of grains, referencing a guest's opinion that they are not good for us.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the storage protein, not to mention the PUFA, unsaponified PUFA, is an inhibitor. of protein digestion, and so any protein that is in the ordinary grain is very poorly digested, because the PUFA is one of the plant's protective toxins to discourage the consumption of their seeds. Because wheat, and they're really seeds, aren't they? They're really... seeds of the grass, right? Yeah, and when a person digests the storage protein, gluten for example, gluten is somewhat worse than the other storage proteins, but the sense of storing, it's nitrogen which is being stored in a concentrated form. And if you sprout the grain, let it turn into a bit of vegetable rather than a starchy cereal, that converts a potentially toxic nitrogen rich compound into an actual protein that has nutritional value. So, if it's unsprouted... and unprocessed by alkali, those storage proteins, especially combined with polyunsaturated fats, make it practically useless nutritionally. The so-called protein value just isn't there in practice. It's there analytically, but since our animal digestion is blocked by... these agents themselves, they are very poor nutritionally."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if commercially available grains like white rice or wheat are problematic due to their preparation.

**RAY PEAT:** "If it has been processed, making it white, you've probably removed the germ and you'll get some, if it hasn't been heated, just soaking it, you'll activate some enzymes that reduce the toxins, the oats, if it hasn't been heated, will sprout. But you have to check that the grain is vital because they're often sterilized chemically or heated and that prevents the enzyme activation that makes them safer."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sprouting white rice or oats would make them safe and usable.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, about 50 years ago there were some good studies of comparing the protein in rice which just from the analysis it would look like it was a fair source but when you compare it to the protein quality of cooked greens, spinach or kale for example, the quality of the protein in the leaf is much higher, similar to milk protein than the grain, such that while there might be six or seven percent chemically, analytically, in some of these feeding experiments, amounted to hardly more than zero protein. And compared to the leaf protein, that ranked similar to milk or meat in quality."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the protein quality of grains compared to leafy greens.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, much better when it has been soaked to make sourdough or even starting the sprouting process. But the smaller the ancient grains generally seemed. That kind of meager, not plump with starch, and that meant that their protein and mineral value was a lot higher. And that's good."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if ancient grains like einkorn need to be sprouted to be beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the starch? There have been a series going back about a hundred years of studies showing that if you put in especially raw starch, you can purify the starch. Corn starch, potato starch, each has a characteristic granule size ranging from five microns in diameter to a hundred microns in diameter. And if you give a good feeding maybe a stomach tube to put a lot of starch in at once and then sample the animal's bloodstream, its liver fluids, its cerebrospinal fluids, the urine, all of the body fluids, every 15 minutes you find first going into the bloodstream and from there to the brain and from the blood into the urine finally. So even though they are large particles approaching and even much bigger than a red blood cell, these particles unchanged as far as can be seen will go from the intestine right into the... circulating body fluids. And that's not good. So, when they reach a capillary or a small arterial, they're too big to go ahead. And so when they slice up the mice, for example, after they've been fed that way, they find that... their bodies and brains are full of little areas of dead tissue. Everyplace a grain particle clogs an arteriole, the surrounding tissue dies for lack of oxygen and nutrients. And the same... procedure has been tested in medical students. They're giving them a glass, a swurry of cornstarch or potato starch, and then every 15 minutes they're drawing blood or checking their urine. You can centrifuge the blood or urine and find the characteristic size. and form of the starch granules that they were fed, and you can decrease the effect if you take the fat in a well-cooked form and with butter or cream to slow the absorption. And if your peristalsis is very active, for example, if you take it with coffee, more of them go through into your bloodstream, so something is always happening to some extent, but the more the starch is cooked and eaten with a balanced diet, including milk, milk or butter, so that would be why, would you say then, a well-cooked potato with butter is pretty good? Better than, it's okay?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the guest's idea that starch from grains could contribute to heart disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, really well-cooked. Yeah, meaning that the starch reaches about Fahrenheit 211 degrees. completely cooked, takes about an hour of baking a potato."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on what constitutes "well-cooked" potatoes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Right, and the polyunsaturated fats in the unprocessed rice. The reason the Chinese developed the polishing process to make white rice is that the much of the oil in the bran and germ are removed. Are gone. Yeah, so there's nothing much left to get rancid, so polished white rice is less allergenic and less cumulative. toxicity."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if unprocessed rice, even organic, could cause problems due to starch particles and polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "If it hasn't been heated, there will still be some vital enzymes that will break down the starch and protein."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if common white rice, which has had the germ removed, can still be sprouted.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Yeah, and it helps to eliminate the PUFA. The PUFA, because there's PUFAs in these grains, right? And that's what gets rancid so quickly in the whole grain. Wow. That the fad of having whole grains rather than white flour, it's true that they're that they contain much more mineral value, but still there are a risk for the rancid fats. For the rancid fats because they got them in there because they've not been polished out."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sprouting helps break down starch and protein and eliminate PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah. Yeah, the smaller particles get rancid much more quickly because their surface is greater in relation to their mass. So we don't want small LDL particles. We want big ones, big puffy ones?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the NMR lipoprotein panel and its significance regarding LDL particle size.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there's a close connection between heart health and the egg. Eating helps to keep the particles big, and so eggs have a heart protective effect in reducing the number of ultra-small fat particles."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if eating eggs is beneficial for heart health in relation to particle size.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the bigger particles are much less exposed to oxygen."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on why larger cholesterol particles are better.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the starches do cause vascular damage on the small vessels. They do cause vascular damage. Yeah, and that triggers immunological changes. The damage makes you... have a general systemic allergic reaction to the starches or the grains they come from, and that would contribute to your heart and artery damage."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if starch particles cause damage to arteries and lead to heart disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the cholesterol is involved in detoxifying the polyunsaturated fatty acids that cause oxidative damage to the lining of the artery. And so the cholesterol temporarily reduces inflammation and should, over time, gradually reduce the damage. But if you keep eating the Pufa, you keep damaging the arteries and the Pufa combines with the cholesterol and it gets overloaded in the tissue. So you get a plaque of what's really half and half Pufa and half cholesterol."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of cholesterol in artery buildup and plaque formation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Yeah, once the tissue is damaged, the calcium tends to... take it out of action."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of calcium in artery plaque.

**RAY PEAT:** "Right. A big part of it. And the information goes back close to a hundred years. The 1930s was when they really started. Thinking about what's going on with H-pigment and in the 1940s, it was clearly established that PUFA increase accelerates H-pigment formation and all of the degenerative processes. And it turns out that vitamin E slows that process. And that was involved in not only selling vitamin E as a protective antioxidant, which isn't its exclusive function. It functions as an anti-inflammatory agent and as an anti-estrogen, but once they could show that it was an antioxidant. That took over and they didn't talk anymore about the anti-inflammatory, anti-estrogen effect because estrogen was being sold as a protective thing rather than a promoter of age pigment and tissue damage."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks why Dr. Peat advocates for avoiding PUFAs, referencing historical research.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so. The studies over the years have got different results, but it's because what is called vitamin E has been redefined so much. For a time it was defined as a substance that increased fertility, by opposing estrogen. Then it was turned into simply an antioxidant. And then the manufacturer changed and it became very low in the anti-estrogen effect and tended to have more fatty acids polyunsaturated fats right in the vitamin E product. And during those years, vitamin E supplements tended to increase mortality because they were actually selling anti-vitamin E mixed in with the vitamin E. But when you look at the nature of the substance you're talking about, then yes, vitamin E is very protective. And then go ahead, go ahead. It probably only takes about 30 to 50 milligrams per day to give you full protection."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking vitamin E regularly is beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "A fair amount of viscosity and dark color. And a high potency in the smallest volume, you don't want a big clear capsule diluted."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks what to look for when purchasing vitamin E supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, those are the anti-inflammatory. And what are these things made out of, Doc? These vitamin E's, where do they come from? Plants make them as a regulatory signal."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about mixed tocopherols and the origin of vitamin E.

**RAY PEAT:** "Theoretically, at least, make it yourself. If you, for example, boil milk with oysters in it or seaweed, a source of iodine and trace minerals, the prolonged boiling will create iodized casein, which in effect works like a thyroid hormone. You can make it right in your kitchen. If it happens that you weren't able to buy a thyroid in a pharmacological form."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how someone without a thyroid could survive, referencing a hypothetical scenario of radiation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oysters in milk? Yeah, the reaction between trace minerals, casein, and iodine will produce an active thyroid-like substance."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on the process of making a thyroid-like substance from oysters and milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, it's so easy to overdose and lots of people have a strange allergy-like reaction. To add an iodine or iodide, no one really understands what is going on. It's some peculiar immune system but it's fairly common."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's stance on taking iodine supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just getting very sick, headaches, headaches of constipation or diarrhea, arthritis, pains and the studies I've seen about 70 different studies of the addition of iodide to salt and the, if you have three or four times more than the daily requirement of iodine taken in through iodized salt over the years at the risk of hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer greatly increase. So on the population basis the iodized salt has been harmful to public health."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the symptoms of excessive iodine intake.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most of the salt in the store I think is iodized. And if you're in an iodine deficient area, there are areas in the Andes and Mexico and around the Great Lakes. that have traditionally been deficient in iodine, and so it's okay in those regions. But some studies found that when iodide was being used as a dough conditioner, the average American was getting about ten times more iodine than desirable if they ate bread."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the prevalence of iodized salt and its potential impact.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sometimes the bacteria in yogurt help. For example, the Greek yogurt has reduced lactic acid content, but still it's full of the anti-inflammatory bacteria. It's probably good. A safe addition to the diet."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to repopulate the microbiome after antibiotic use.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you don't take it with other food, but just slowing down the absorption with milk, for example, will moderate that insulin spike. And if you compare it to rice, sucrose in the orange juice, it contains an insulin moderating component, the fructose. It slightly inhibits the release of insulin compared to rice or corn starch, which breaks down into pure glucose, lacking the moderating effect of fructose. So when you look at the glycemic index, the starch is at the top of the list and sucrose is well down the list because the fructose has a moderating effect and also the high potassium content of oranges has a moderating effect."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about drinking orange juice and its effect on insulin spikes.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you drink it slowly, don't go down 8 ounces at once, but just as if you're... If there are 4 oranges in a glass of juice, just spread it out over time as if you're eating the whole orange."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if orange juice is okay on its own or if it should always be consumed with other food.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's very hard to get it in Mexico as well as being expensive but... Almost all of the drugstores in Mexico will have two forms of a compound that includes T3 and T4. Ceto Plus contains the ratio that Armour Cyrate... In fact, they designed the product to be equivalent to Armour Cyrate. A 4 to 1 ratio of T4 to T3, and then another product called Novo T-Ral, it's a 5 to 1 ratio, and it's pretty good."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to obtain Armour Thyroid in Mexico or if there are better alternatives.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the Natural Gland actually varies from 3 to 1 to 4 to 1. Okay, pretty close. So the Seno Plus, which you can get into a Mexican Pharmacy, is 4 to 1, so that would be a reasonable replacement, right?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the T4 to T3 ratio in Armour Thyroid and compares it to Mexican pharmacy options.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the phenomenon of shedding through our breath, sweat, urine, saliva, it's going on all the time. And Pfizer was fully aware of that and warned that they're a team of vaccinators not to let pregnant women or breastfeeding women get exposed to someone who had been vaccinated. So that knowledge going back at least 10 or 15 years was fully known by Pfizer. who put it in their instructions in the very beginning when they were testing the vaccines."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about exosomes used as vaccine carriers and the phenomenon of shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just like everyone is shedding some of their natural proteins, RNA, DNA, lipids, a little bit of all of our chemistry. We shed this all the time, right? Just by breathing. Yeah, you put a cold piece of metal under your nose and fluid can... condenses on it, then you analyze that and you find the surprisingly big stuff, the exosomes, free pieces of RNA, free pieces of DNA, very complex, complex pictures."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks what is being shed by vaccinated individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's a form of biological cooperation, like bacteria, even bacteria of different categories. If one group has been exposed to an antibiotic and survived, then it's a form of biological cooperation. They will develop a bit of DNA that specifies how to make a detoxifier to the antibiotic and they will join up with other bacteria even of different species and transmit their DNA instructions right through a little tube, so the new species. You can figure it out. That knowledge, yeah. So if bacteria learned somehow to cooperate with each other and improve their survival, I think all of the higher levels are doing it constantly."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the evolutionary or philosophical implications of shedding exosomes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there's a lab in Germany that has found all of our food substances, DNA, in our bloodstream and tissue and some of them are actually incorporated in our own genomes. I didn't quite understand that, so what is the company doing in Germany with the food? If you eat beef regularly, you can find some beef genetic material circulating in your blood and then if you culture some of the animal's tissues, occasionally you can find some of that DNA. has made its way into the nucleus and become part of us and there's evidence that an algae, a toxic algae, can deliver its toxic DNA to our system and become incorporated. So, there is. some suggestion of a toxic effect being picked up from certain organisms, but also the possibility that we can use that material constructively."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about a German lab's findings regarding DNA from food being found in human blood and tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think if you look at the mortality around the different countries in relation with their continuing vaccination processes, I think what's happening is that we're calling... the shedding phenomenon and the vaccination delivery of the toxins, we're calling that an epidemic. I think the epidemic is really long past and what we're having is echoing. of the shedding effect and the new vaccination damaging our resistance. And no telling what this, whatever test they're using is picking up, right? There's just no telling, is there?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if being around vaccinated individuals with potentially dangerous substances could be harmful.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they have failed to demonstrate the meaning of the tests they're giving. Yes, sir. So all these new cases that we see in the news, it's just not relevant, is it, Dr. P? Relevant as far as spreading some kind of a mysterious thing."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the validity of diagnostic tests used for current health concerns.

**RAY PEAT:** "Kerry Mullis observations, I think, are so relevant. You spin it enough, it'll pick about up anything, I think, is those were his words, right? The CT, the circulation threshold. What you have to do is show a causal relation between your tests and symptoms. Which hasn't really been done, has it?"
**CONTEXT:** The host references Kerry Mullis's skepticism about diagnostic tests.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, aspirin and all of the anti-inflammatory things, sugar has really been neglected as an anti-inflammatory thing. It reduces stress, lowers the stress hormones and reduces the inflammatory. Five times. Sugar. Do the damage. Sugar. Great. Well, they didn't teach us that for the last 30 years. They told us that sugar was going to kill us. Right? Yeah, but sugar corresponds pretty well to the production of carbon dioxide. And if something, if a stress causes us to shift... from glucose oxidation to fatty acid oxidation, that lowers the CO2 production and increases lactic acid production, which supports all of the inflammatory problems. So getting your CO2 up by maintaining glucose oxidation should be a basic thing."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for advice on treating a child with fever, cough, and vomiting, and about dangerous high temperatures.

**RAY PEAT:** "Honey and orange juice are very good. The maple syrup, the brown stuff, is a fairly inflammatory material in itself. Oh, the dark stuff. I thought the darker was the better. No? Well, it does correspond to mineral content, but also there are amino acids which heated in the presence of the sugar. You get a toxic reaction between amino acid and glucose. That's brown. So, the browning of food tends to increase its allergenicity. I thought they just got... the maple syrup out of the tree and that's it. But no, they cook it. Oh yeah, you have to boil it for a long time. Same with cane sugar. If you just juice a stick of cane, you have a very nice amber-colored solution, which is very, very safe. But if you cook it long enough to get... black molasses, the reaction between the amino acids and sugars are allergenic or toxic."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about different forms of sugar and their health effects, specifically regarding maple syrup.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most people don't like to cook their rice until it's gummy, for example. Yes, sir. They like some separation of the kernels. Until it's gummy, you're still going to have some of the risky starch particles."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the hazards of raw and undercooked starch, referencing studies on senile dementia.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you aren't having it with fat, and if you eat a lot of it regularly, then I think you have the risk that they saw in their experimental animals of premature dementia. Wow. It goes to the brain. It's just something that starts messing with the brain. Yeah, the arterioles that get plugged by a starch granule, everything downstream from that arteriole gets deprived of nutrition and is likely to die."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the dangers of undercooked starch particles.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think pasta and rice and such things should be boiled for at least 40 minutes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the proper cooking time for pasta and rice.

**RAY PEAT:** "I would go with the tocopherol mixture. In feeding experiments, the tocotrienols cause liver enlargement if they. gave very much of it. And that indicates some kind of a stress effect from the trienes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the difference between tocotrienol and mixed tocopherol forms of vitamin E in relation to PUFA toxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "It does have some vitamin E value, but there is no dry vitamin E. No such thing? It's just that suction is sometimes sold that way as having special anti-tensor effectors. I remember Dirk at one point was recommending rubbing estrogen into his scalp to make his hair grow. Yeah, did it work? Dope. That didn't work. That didn't work."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the legitimacy of "dry vitamin E" and references Dirk Pearson and Sandy Shaw.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh conceivably, but the biological vitality of the scalp and the hair follicle corresponds, for example, low thyroid people tend to lose their hair. And just increasing your metabolic rate will increase your ability to grow and retain hair. And so, if something is causing constant stress. That could slow your metabolism and contribute to hair loss. Many years ago, when I taught in Bozeman, Colorado, or Montana, the rate of white-haired, prematurely grey-haired people seemed very high in those very cold towns, and I decided that the stress of the skin was probably a factor. Radiation, when a person has dental x-rays, the whiskers will sometimes turn white in circular areas on the cheeks, a series of overlapping circles suggesting that the radiation was knocking out the ability to oxidize the pigment. Copper is both the respiratory catalyst and the pigment-forming catalyst, so if you're copper deficient, you're going to tend to have white grain here, as well as lower metabolizing, maybe more inflamed tissue."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a plate and screws in a wrist could cause hair thinning.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, getting enough copper in relation to iron, I think, is a protective factor. So people who eat too much meat or other rich food are going to compete and displace. The copper that is needed for energy production and pigment formation. And so meat like muscle meat or ribeye and t-bones, that's fun to eat, that has a lot of iron. Yeah, as well as, for most people, too much phosphate. And too much tryptophan and other excitatory amino acids, so it has, and too much heme, everything that it provides, too much of, tends to support cancer development and degenerative processes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the value of drinking water from a copper vessel.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there's three amino acids that correlate with aging, degeneration, and inflammation, loss of thyroid function, are methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if tryptophan in meat is excitatory or inflammatory.

**RAY PEAT:** "Scallops, crab. Lobster. Calamari. Calamari? All of the crustaceans and mollusks are pretty good. Shrimp? Yeah, shrimp. High copper in relation to iron."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about good seafood choices, referencing scallops.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think part of it is the less iron content and love. The low-fat fish, I think, are the best. Low-fat fish, so other than, let's see, salmon would be a high-fat fish with a lot of threes, right, which you're not fans of, omega-3s, correct?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if people who eat more fish have better mortality rates than heavy meat eaters.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and the shrimp and scallops are relatively low-fat."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the fat content of shrimp and scallops.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know. I don't think I've ever heard of that. Yeah, I've never heard of that one. But now, again, so just to know, to repeat, your favorite, if I understand, is the pickling, Morton's Pickling and Canning Salt, right, with no iodine. Right. Right. It's very pure. Very pure stuff."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks why consuming too much salt might cause joint stiffness and pain.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, I'm going to write something about cancer. I return to the subject about every five years or so. Oh, you do. And some of the things I've been working on now for... 20 or 30 years are just now starting to really take off as subjects of interest."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the status of Dr. Peat's newsletters.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it's going to be four times. A year, rather than six times a year. And the subscription per year will be something around ten dollars. Oh my god. Ten dollars, and because PayPal charges almost eight percent fee on ten dollars, we're going to make it ten dollars. Ten dollars and twenty cents."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the frequency and cost of Dr. Peat's newsletter.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, if they aren't prepared properly. If they aren't prepared properly."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a final thought on grains and their preparation.
