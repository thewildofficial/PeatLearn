**RAY PEAT:** "The adjuvant quality of the lipids they're using in the RNA so-called vaccine. The adjuvant quality of the lipids that they're using in this so-called vaccine. Yeah, when I googled the names of those lipids, a company came up which sells supposedly those are similar lipids as a vehicle or a carrier medium for introducing drugs, but they've been selling them the very same lipids for years as adjuvants. So it seems to me that Pfizer is using them nominally as a mere carrier for the RNA, but conveniently their lipids that function as adjuvants. So they leave out the aluminum, which actually will explain, and put in something which is possibly even worse for creating inflammation in the whole body."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the lipid quality of the adjuvants in the COVID-19 vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the best explanation would require a lipid specialist. It's an extremely specialized branch of lipids. I'm sure there are people who know about it who would be glad to talk, but I haven't even looked for those people."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat has looked into the COVID-19 vaccines and what could be going wrong.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's an opportunity for Pfizer to lie and deceive. Immediately when Dr. Gregory Michael died of an absence of blood platelets, after he got sick, the automatic blood analyzer reported zero platelets. And they thought that must be a mistake, so they counted by hand and found one platelet in the batch instead of hundreds. And then Pfizer said that there's no reason to believe that there could be a connection between failure of platelet production and vaccine. But people, the government has already compensated people for other vaccines causing that fatal disease. And the substance PEG in other vaccines seems to be responsible for creating the immune reaction that kills the platelet system. And the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine is the one that has been most incriminating."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about reports of people getting sick and dying after vaccination and what Dr. Peat has seen in his research.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, someone familiar with that situation says that between 1 in 25,000 and 1 in 40,000 people vaccinated develop the platelet deficiency. And when you have tens of millions of people vaccinated, that starts being a lot of seriously, often fatally damaged people."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if childhood vaccines also negatively affect platelets.

**RAY PEAT:** "I basically agree that the terrain is the important thing. The so-called pathogenic agent has to find a receptive terrain, and it happens that about 90% of the current population doesn't present a terrain for a pathogen like that to grow in. But some of the things that affect a terrain are vaccinations. For example, people who've had an influenza vaccination are much more likely to, the following year, develop a coronavirus condition rather than influenza. And... The world figures for influenza show a practically complete disappearance of influenza around the world, but the best fudged claims for effectiveness are around 50% for the influenza vaccine. Some of them claim higher, but some people have pointed out that they're changing definitions to get that high result. I think it's about 10 different studies that have shown the year after an influenza vaccination, the incidence of corona infections and other conditions is much higher. So vaccines are one of the things that prepares the terrain for the problems such as pneumonia."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to comment on Dr. Thomas Cowan's video regarding RNA vaccines and his germ theory skepticism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, even that isn't very clear because they haven't done thorough studies of coronaviruses. Common cold viruses from the people have had repeatedly over the years, and like a common cold, there have been very few people who've caught the apparent coronavirus twice, but that's like one in a million. It isn't as effective as the common cold by that appearance."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat suggests a person's terrain determines illness, and questions the transmission of viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the studies I know of were in animals and in lab cultures, so they can clearly demonstrate that it transfers from one animal to another. They don't want to give the full influenza to a person, but with human cells in culture, they can also get infection from the same virus that they're transmitting from one animal to another in culture."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Cowan's argument that just because something is in culture doesn't mean it happens between humans.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, it isn't absolute proof. That's very rare anywhere in science. Is there proof about anything in science that we know for sure? No. The practical aspect is the best we have, not absolute logical truth. By the way, Fauci and almost everyone in government is treating science as an absolute all-or-none. They have disproved this and proved that. It's all magic or some kind of cult rather than science."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Koch's postulates and proving cause of death.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's never possible to absolutely prove what someone died from. Really? Never? They might have. When a person is in a weak condition, just a slight change of temperature might be enough to be the actual cause of death. Or you could choose any of the things that contributed to the loss of energy in their system. Hypothyroidism has almost always involved weakness of the adrenal system, a bias in the pituitary, all kinds of nutritional deficiencies or excesses will contribute to the energy weakness and could be focused on this cause of death. So if you look at a thousand people, you could pick out big groups of people dying from a particular nutritional deficiency or hypothyroidism or insufficient adrenal steroids. The existing low body temperature from multiple failures of metabolism, things that can be repaired, that simple low body temperature creates inflammatory reactions that look just like the reaction you get from a virus or some bacteria and so on. So simply a low body temperature, maybe because you didn't eat at the normal time and then a cold wind blew through, that will kill lots of people."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that proving the exact cause of death is impossible and that low body temperature can mimic viral reactions.

**RAY PEAT:** "They were not only instructed to list the COVID virus as cause of death, they were paid out of the government compensation fund. If they diagnosed the infection, they would get, I think it was $14,000 support from the government. If they had to intubate the person because of slightly low oxygen pressure or saturation, they would get $48,000. So hospitals were not only instructed to diagnose cause of death, they were paid to incline them toward diagnosing the COVID as cause of death. That whole period, the supposed huge spike, there was a very high proportion of the people in hospitals getting intubated and dying just as what was known would happen. After three or four days of intubation, there was very little chance of recovering. One doctor very early in the process helped bring intubation to an end for COVID. He showed that in the hospital he caused to use a very simple nasal cannula to provide oxygen when needed, there was zero mortality from COVID pneumonia. An adjacent high quality hospital that was following the World Health and CDC recommendations had 60% mortality, absolute night and day difference just from using intubation."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how hospitals were incentivized to list COVID-19 as the cause of death and the disastrous outcomes of intubation compared to simple oxygen support.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've seen very few unusual trails sitting out in the yard. Yeah, we don't see much around here either, very, hardly ever, never. And there's no real cure for the particle exposure. I did a newsletter on nanoparticles, and they can even be absorbed through the skin, and they're being used in lots of fabric now as deodorants to kill microorganisms that produce odors and dirty clothes, but the ability to kill bacteria and fungus, these same particles can penetrate into the bloodstream and begin affecting our immune cells. So it's important to be alert about the many sources, food additives, for example. Silica particles are probably one of the most common, which contain the deadly size range of particles. And you find silica and even probably the majority of health food supplements added as lubricant to make the machinery run smoothly. And even when it's not on the label... Lots of those are in there, right? Yeah, there are Teflon particles used as in a micro or nano form used as a machine lubricant that doesn't have to be listed on the label even though it gets into the food."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks about chemtrails and how to get rid of nanoparticles in the lungs.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the important functions of thyroid is to lower the body's estrogen absolute content and its ratio to the androgens like DHEA and progesterone. And one of the important ways of getting rid of estrogen is to attach sulfuric acid to it. And so sulfation is probably the biggest single route of disposing of estrogen. But simply by keeping your body temperature up, all of the good effects of thyroid are likely to be activated. So even keeping your body warm artificially, avoiding chilling from extreme exposure and fatiguing amount of chilling, even artificial heating reduces some of the estrogenic effects. For example, the ears of a rabbit are much cooler than the core body temperature. And a researcher knowing of that, that the ovaries are somehow kept cooler than the adjoining body temperature tissues in a very short space, the temperature of the ovary can be a whole degree Celsius lower than the adjoining tissue. No one knows how that cooling, where the heat goes, but structural changes of water in the blood coming in, for example, are the only mechanism that I know that could account for that cooling. But anyway, this researcher aware of the low temperature of the ovaries and the low temperature of rabbit's ears injected some ovarian small pieces of the ovary tissue into the skin of the rabbit's ear. And those animals went into constant estrous, premature aging, but with an exaggerated constant level of estrogen production. So carefully avoiding a low body temperature is extremely important to keep a healthy balance of the hormones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the importance of thyroid function for overall health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some of the beliefs about pH were absolutely reversed when they were able to use MRI for measuring intracellular pH. I'm not sure of the following. Warburg's observation that all cancers produce lactic acid, people noticed that yes, all tumors have a high concentration of lactic acid and low pH, and so that led to the idea that baking soda, for example, has a high concentration of lactic acid. Raising the pH might help avoid or cure cancer, but it turns out that the intracellular pH of cancer is always higher and that should have been known way back in the 40s or 50s because when a cell forms lactic acid from pyruvic acid, it absorbs protein. And so raises the pH in the cell and the removal of lactic acid from the cell is exactly a removal of acid from the cell, making the cell less acidic, more alkaline. And it turns out that when you eat baking soda, it does alkalinize your blood, but the brain tissue in particular and muscle and other tissues are acidified by taking baking soda because the carbon dioxide component of the bicarbonate quickly enzymes convert bicarbonate to carbon dioxide in a gaseous form, which is soluble in cell material. So just by solubility, it tends to stay inside the cell, acidifying the cell. So if people were just more careful about doing their chemistry and observing what the enzymes are doing, all along they should have known that cancer was an intracellular alkaline shift, and baking soda, although alkaline in itself, turns to carbon dioxide and acidifies the cell."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of pH in cancer and the effect of baking soda.

**RAY PEAT:** "What's known is that Fauci himself instructed all the testers to use the PCR process running the cycle more than 40 times. Although it has been known that above 30 to 33 cycles it produces more and more false positives. The instruction went out all across the country to use a process of testing known to produce an extreme excess of false positives. So right on the surface anyone should infer that they wanted to have as many apparent positive results as they could to justify that there was a pandemic. And now, if the vaccine comes into a fairly widespread use, all they have to do is instruct the testers to properly use the test with maybe 30 or 32 cycles, and they will discover that the virus has disappeared. There are people out there right now, even WHO and other people, saying that just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you can't get this thing or share it. The whole thing is such a mess. I think they have something like 40,000 pages of data about what their so-called vaccine has done. They've released a lot of data about what they've done, what they've done, what they've done, 400 pages, and an editor of BMJ, the British Medical Journal, Peter Doshi, I think is his name, he analyzed the data he could find that was released to the public, and from his calculation, and he's been working on vaccines, particularly for 10 years, his analysis showed that from 19 to 29 percent, according to Pfizer's data, were protected by the vaccine, not at all the 95 percent or 69 percent or whatever they announced publicly. But they don't want to release the full set of data because that would spoil the whole plan. The whole thing."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks for a simple explanation of the coronavirus situation, including deaths and testing.

**RAY PEAT:** "A little bit, but I've been watching the whole education indoctrination process for 50 years and more, and they have created a gullible population, maybe at least 80%, I would guess, of absolutely gullible people when it comes to calling something science. Science totally failed to teach critical thinking, which really should begin in grade school. What it means when someone asserts that something is scientifically shown, and no one functionally seems to be thinking critically about what the government and the mass media are saying."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat is surprised by the scale of the perceived deception.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they were educated in the same way. In the same way. They're absolutely gullible when it comes to Fauci or someone else on television in a white coat saying something."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if politicians follow the CDC due to their education.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there's a website. I looked at it when they had 3,400 variations on the virus. Now, here they have about 6,000 variations. And how are they, even if there were only a few variations, how are they going to test to demonstrate that one is more infectious or more deadly than another one? No one is doing any statistical thinking at all regarding the claims of new strains."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about new strains of the virus.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just about 20 years ago, they were still subsidizing shipment of books and scholarly materials. The post office was helping to keep people informed. With the internet, it momentarily looked like this might be spreading information more widely. It went along with a plan to shut down the post office, take away its funding, make it run in debt, until finally it could be bought by UPS or another private service. And shifting everyone's communication to the internet, which was taken over by companies that were started with government, CIA, Pentagon subsidies. And now these corporations are acting as extensions of the military and CIA, so that when something embarrasses those people and their intentions, they disappear from the internet."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses media censorship and the control of information.

**RAY PEAT:** "Fructose intolerance. It is a new way of defining gas and diarrhea indigestion problems, but it's usually just a bad microbial mix in the intestine. Most of our fructose, except in apples and apple juice, which contain a fairly concentrated pure fructose. Most of our fructose comes in the form of sucrose or ordinary sugar. And it's very rare to lack the enzymes for absorbing those. They break down and each one can be absorbed, but if your microbial balance is out of control, then the bacteria are likely to turn fructose into toxin and other bacterial toxins. And balancing the microbes, the main thing is to increase the metabolic rate of your intestine so that you can absorb the sugars high up in the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks for an explanation of fructose intolerance and if it can be fixed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Keeping your body temperature up. Keeping the body temperature up. And your thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to increase the metabolic rate of the intestines.

**RAY PEAT:** "The quick acting component of the thyroid is suppressed by intense exercise because the glucose needed to produce T3 is being consumed by the muscles and it should bounce back an hour or two after the exercise. If your liver has stored enough glycogen, made when you had a little excess sugar, and to form glycogen that's stored in the liver, that's one of thyroid's basic functions. Selenium, thyroid, and a source of carbohydrate in the diet, you'll quickly replenish the liver. The glycogen, which you need to maintain a high metabolic rate, and with that high metabolic rate your intestines should have finished its digestion fairly high up. But the lower the general metabolism, the farther down undigested food will go. And in a very healthy person, maybe 10% of the population, the whole small intestine system is sterile. 10 or 20%, the microbes invade the small intestine in extreme cases, even into the stomach by raising the pH of the stomach. In the absence of thyroid, you can't make enough stomach acid."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if wearing warm clothing and exercising is the same as having a healthy thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and at an extreme the stomach becomes alkaline and bacteria such as H. pylori then thrive because they are alkaline-loving. And some people will even develop a brewery containing yeast all the way up into the stomach so that if they eat carbohydrate they'll have alcohol in their breath. That's all because of a very slow metabolic rate. So normalizing, optimizing your thyroid is going to give you a sterile stomach and small intestine. And the bacteria will live almost exclusively in the colon. Which is where we want it, right?"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the connection between low thyroid, low stomach acid, and SIBO.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they used to sell glass straws with actual hydrochloric acid for such things to sip it without dissolving your teeth. But what they sell now is usually betaine. And the betaine itself seriously affects your cyanine metabolism, your methyl processes. And so it can have very unexpected side effects."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about using HCL or apple cider vinegar for low stomach acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "More than 100 years ago, I think approaching 200 years ago, a few doctors were curing sciatica almost always by using a good laxative fiber and purges. Because the colon, when it's very overloaded, stuffed, it becomes so heavy, especially over the left leg, but it can affect both. It becomes so heavy, it sits on the... and pressurize it. It damages by too much pressure the nerve conduction to the leg, and I've seen people do that, just take a few days of strong laxatives and a good fiber, and the leg pains disappear."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks for advice on sciatica.

**RAY PEAT:** "Not always, but it's a preferred food, but the problem is that the body normally has trouble producing and delivering enough sugar to the tumor. In one experiment with a tumor isolated to the leg where they could control, put a huge amount of glucose into the artery feeding the tumor, they found that they could create so much lactic acid production by the tumor that it killed itself, a very, very high amount of glucose that took, which you couldn't do to the whole body. When the tumor experiences hypoglycemia internally, which it always does, low oxygen leads to the increased need for sugar. When the body experiences that, once the tumor becomes a self-sustaining, self-replicating, noticeable thing, that signals the whole body turns on the adrenal glands and starts converting our tissue proteins to glucose or amino acids. You're losing ground because when you can't provide enough glucose from either your food or your short glycogen, then the body has to start feeding the tumor amino acids and the tumor can live very well perfectly on amino acids and on fat. When there's not enough glucose, the tumor will thrive on pure amino acids and fatty acids. And so the worst thing you can do to accelerate death from a tumor is to starve the cancer for glucose."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks if sugar always feeds cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, if they ate enough sugar, they would get wound down. Sugar is even a mild anesthetic for a baby. Getting injections and such, a dose of sucrose is demonstrably calming and actually stops the pain and it lowers adrenaline so it's actually not getting enough sugar that makes the kids get hyperactive. The immediate effect of the sugar is quieting."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why children get hyperactive from sugar, contrasting it with Dr. Peat's experience.

**RAY PEAT:** "Two experimenters tried not depriving their patients of sugar. They called it the sugar disease, the saccharine disease. And so doctors thought if it's a sugar disease, they should not feed sugar. But that inevitably led to death by wasting. And two doctors decided, what's the point of restricting sugar? Why not let them have as much as they crave if they're going to die from converting their body to sugar? So they found that they craved about 12 ounces a day. And when they ate a normal diet and were allowed to have 12 ounces or so of purified ordinary white sugar in addition, their patients recovered quickly."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains a historical approach to treating diabetes with sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, before bedtime, hot flashes, people have found a lot of carbohydrate. I think they used corn starch or rice or something like that. They found they could stop night sweats and hot flashes just by giving them a very big dose of carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if adding a carbohydrate with dinner is helpful.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's closely related to what those two doctors demonstrated. Your body can have very high requirements for sugar when it's under stress. Oh, I see. If you really meet those high needs, you can turn off the stress and that ends the disease."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the rice diet and if it has merit.

**RAY PEAT:** "It already has taken control, so it's a matter of working our way out of it. All kinds of dropout systems would be helpful."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks how to stop the "medical police state" from taking over.

**RAY PEAT:** "A couple of people have done it half-heartedly. No one tried the 12 ounces a day thing because of fear of hyperglycemia in itself. And usually you will stop the acidosis and ketosis just by letting your blood sugar go higher than it's supposed to be."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks for advice on managing diabetes with insulin and high blood glucose, and if they should continue insulin while following Dr. Peat's recommendations.

**RAY PEAT:** "Those can help to acidify your stomach, but they are very unlikely to be the whole solution if you don't get your thyroid going."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks how to tell if they need apple cider vinegar or HCL.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1970s in the US there was a study of a large population and they found that almost all Americans were getting too much iodine from iodized salt and the use of iodized salt in preparing foods and so on. That would indicate that an excess of iodine nowadays for most people is the problem. An excess? Wow. I've got about 70 some references showing on big population studies that as little as half a milligram a day of added iodine or dietary iodine total was enough to cause long range cumulative deterioration of the thyroid gland."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks if iodine deficiency causes thinning hair shafts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, possibly more than enough. I haven't seen the exact amount, but definitely iodized salt, because of the other foods which now have it added, iodized salt is, in the United States and Europe at least, it's creating an excess. There are still places in central China and the Andes that are very deficient in iodine."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sea salt provides enough iodine.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know what that is."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the herb strophanthus for the heart.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. Part of the lab norm for T3 is because of the widespread use of things like pure T4 supplements, like Synthroid, for example, Levothyroxine, or iodide supplementation. I think it's better to look at your TSH. It should be well below 1.0. Wow, well below that."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks if they should be concerned about a high free T3 score if their temperature is low but they don't feel hyperthyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. And how long do you have to take it before you would recheck? I would rely on symptoms and temperature. Symptoms and temperature, okay. Your heart rate should get up consistently to, I would say, at least 80 during the daytime, and your temperature should be at least 98.6. At least 98.6."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how long to take thyroid medication before rechecking labs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the most accurate, but a quick and easy thing is the eardrum thermometer. Oh, let me see. I don't know about those. So is that something you stick all the way in your ear? No, it's an infrared from the eardrum, and it has to be aimed just right. So you should take two or three readings at a time. A certain feeling. If it's aimed sideways, it's getting the canal temperature from the skin. And not the eardrum, right? Right. But the eardrum is very close to the brain temperature, and I've noticed that a different kind of mental activity will make either my right ear or the left ear hotter."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the accuracy of forehead thermometers and if eardrum thermometers are better.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it really doesn't, does it? Quick cooking at normal pressure, I think, is the best for taste and health."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks about cooking in pressure cookers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, selenium, I think 100 micrograms is a safe supplement. And selenium is essential for the local production in the tissue, so it's always good to try that. But eating shellfish or seafood, halibut or cod or sole, for example, will provide enough selenium to keep your tissue supply active."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks if minor iodine or selenium deficiency could cause underactive thyroid issues and if adding them in micro amounts would help.

**RAY PEAT:** "Very often, yeah, it's a safe amount. And then you like that progesterone, right? That one, you think that's valuable, regularized? Yeah, that helps the thyroid in a variety of ways. Any other things regularly that people should think about? Enough carbohydrates in the diet is essential. Enough carbohydrates."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if 100 micrograms of selenium is beneficial for everyone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Broda Barnes himself has demonstrated that a high meat protein intake can lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and powerfully suppress the thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about other regular recommendations for people.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and in the case of viral damage, for example, the antibodies are as much cleaning up the damaged tissue and in the process, they sort of accidentally destroy the virus that's causing it. But in their theories, the whole process of immunity is based on a clean-up maintenance system in which the so-called pathogen can get involved and be destroyed. And so that's the argument with Cowan and Kaufman and all these other folks that the viruses, these so-called viruses, so-called, we don't even know what to call them now, they're actually there cleaning things up."

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks about thyroid antibody tests and the conventional understanding of antibodies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, it's our maintenance system which cleans up the viruses. A maintenance system cleans up the viruses. No matter what has caused the damage, malnutrition or whatever sensitizes the tissue and it starts falling apart, getting inflamed. We produce antibodies actually as a repair process for the damage and anything that has caused the damage will get caught up in the process and taken out with the debris. Anything that has caused the damage, which could be chemicals or, I don't know, stress or anything, right? Yeah, stress, malnutrition."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies the role of antibodies in the immune system, aligning with a "cleanup" theory.
