**RAY PEAT:** Sunlight puts electrons into the form of sugar. The source of all our energy is energized electrons from the sun in sugar. And when we consume it, if we're really healthy, it goes all the way down to oxygen forming water. And so the cycle is complete. But if we aren't healthy, then the sugar electron energy stops very near where it started and comes out as lactic acid. It's only half broken down, but it becomes toxic rather than constructive. When we burn the electrons all the way down to oxygen, a byproduct of the sugar is carbon dioxide. And the carbon dioxide is what keeps our structure finely tuned and adjusted, favoring that complete use of energy.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the role of carbon dioxide in energy metabolism and cellular structure?

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. And when Warburg discovered that cancer produces a huge amount of lactic acid, even when it has oxygen and should be able to oxidize it all the way to carbon dioxide, people for a hundred years now have been inattentive to what that means. ... what Warburg started discovering was that it isn't just cancer producing lactic acid, but lactic acid itself produces cancer, keeps it going. It creates the energy block in other cells, so when the cancer cells turn glucose into lactic acid, the lactic acid circulating in the neighboring cells disturbs their energy, interferes, displaces the carbon dioxide and its metabolism, and so the cancer spreads just by lactic acid to a great extent. And then it becomes systemic that the circulating lactic acid it can be a test for cancer and general health if they just look at the amount of lactic acid in your blood, because when it's circulating, it's putting all of your body under stress, shifting the electronic balance away from full oxidation, displacing carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does lactic acid relate to cancer and overall health?

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly, yeah. Just about anything that interferes. The idea of stress is extremely general. It can be too much activity or too little activity. If you're put in a cage so you can't move, the same physiology happens as if you were forced to run on a treadmill. Same thing, too much or too little. Yeah. When you're strapped down, for example, your serotonin increases and the serotonin turns on that cancer metabolism or the stress metabolism and if you're forced to run constantly, for example, the circulating lactic acid suppresses the active thyroid hormone and interferes with your ability to finish the oxidation to carbon dioxide and so it leaves you in a stress condition.

**CONTEXT:** How does stress, both too much and too little activity, impact metabolism and potentially lead to a stress condition?

**RAY PEAT:** So the natural progression is to turn this sugar into carbon dioxide. And then why does the body like to have this carbon dioxide? People have looked at all kinds of organisms, single cell organisms of various types and there are a lot of simple organisms that don't need oxygen. They just need some form of energy. But it turns out that all of the simple organisms that have been tested, even though they might not need oxygen, they still need carbon dioxide. So it's really in the whole picture of life. It's even more essential than oxygen, but most organisms have the oxygen and produce their own carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental importance of carbon dioxide for life, even for organisms that don't require oxygen?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just the right amount of exercise. You don't want to over-train, that's where the... that starts melting you down, increasing cortisol and such, and lowering the constructive progesterone, DHEA and testosterone. The right amount of exercise increases those constructive steroid hormones and produces more carbon dioxide than at rest. So you're raising your body temperature by the right amount of exercise. And that increases the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is binding to all of the cellular proteins and changing, it even changes the way the hormones interact on the cell proteins.

**CONTEXT:** How can exercise influence carbon dioxide production and its impact on cellular function and hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Many years ago, in explaining breathing respiratory physiology, they always mentioned that a major way to transport carbon dioxide on the red blood cells is in the form of carbamino compounds where the carbon dioxide sticks to an amino group on the hemoglobin molecule. That forms a compound, the acid and the base stick together instantly and then reaching the lungs where there's more oxygen that compound decomposes, but Strangely only two or three people that I found over the last 50 or 60 years Have been interested in that interesting carbamino Reaction it happens not only in the red blood cells, but everywhere Everywhere there's a protein with an exposed amino group. And that means the so-called hormone receptors are influenced, modified by the presence of carbon dioxide. So every place there's a protein basically, the carbon dioxide is going to adjust the sensitivity to things such as hormones. And these groups happen to be where oxidative damage happens, you've seen the so-called diabetic way of diagnosing red blood cells when they're getting glycated. Glycation happens in the brain, in Alzheimer's disease, in the blood vessels, in aging in general. And these so-called glycation compounds are sticking the same place the carbon dioxide should be. So if you have high carbon dioxide, any glycating compounds, like breaking down sugar or unsaturated fats these broken-down oxidative particles just don't stick because the site is protected by carbon dioxide binding to it. Just don't stick.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the carbamino reaction and how carbon dioxide binding to proteins influences hormone sensitivity and protects against glycation?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I make sure that I take some thyroid to keep my body temperature up and my heart rate up. And every couple of years, I check my oxygen saturation. And if I'm at a high altitude, it's easier to get my oxygen saturation down to the level that is the safest, but just waking up in the morning when I'm feeling best, my oxygen saturation will go down to 90 or 89 maybe, and if I'm under stress, my finger gadget that measures the oxygen hemoglobin saturation might go up to 98 or 99 percent. It isn't good to have your tissue saturated with oxygen because that's competing against the carbon dioxide. You should keep your oxygen and carbon dioxide in a good balance.

**CONTEXT:** What are your personal practices for maintaining metabolic health, including monitoring oxygen saturation and balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but these finger gadgets really aren't... The person who invented the saturation instrument had a more complex way of doing it. And these things on your finger, if you put your finger in warm water, you'll tend to have a lower saturation. I've experimented putting my fingers in cold water, and it goes right up to 100% saturation. If you're not using the oxygen, it'll simply show a high saturation in your extremities. You want to be using the oxygen and making carbon dioxide. I think the average person ought to be around 93 to 95% saturation in general.

**CONTEXT:** What are the limitations of pulse oximeters, and what is a more accurate indicator of oxygen utilization?

**RAY PEAT:** Sometimes just relaxing and paying attention to how your body feels and if you're just having a thought of things you have to do. That can tend to make you hyperventilate and just by being anxious and hyperventilating you breathe so fast you're blowing out too much carbon dioxide and all by itself that will raise your lactic acid because carbon dioxide suppresses that wasteful use of sugar and protein. So you don't want to hyperventilate and taking thyroid makes you breathe harder but it's doing it by producing more carbon dioxide stimulating breathing so the amount of oxygen you're moving isn't the question it's how you're using that oxygen and if you're using it efficiently generally you'll be in the middle. 90s, middle to low 90s.

**CONTEXT:** How does hyperventilation affect carbon dioxide levels and lactic acid production, and how can thyroid hormone influence breathing efficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** A low thyroid person. Breathing just a few times per minute can still be hyperventilating because they don't need the oxygen if they're very hypothyroid. And so breathing a normal amount will still be hyperventilating chemically for them.

**CONTEXT:** How can breathing rate be misleading in assessing hyperventilation, especially in individuals with low thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** The temperature just... getting in a warm bath can solve a lot of things. If you're sure you're keeping the energy up, having some orange juice or milk and sugar or something to make sure you don't get low blood sugar, warming your body either by muscle activity or just by sitting in a warm bathtub will improve your metabolism, lower inflammation. by getting the carbon dioxide produced.

**CONTEXT:** What are practical ways to improve metabolism and reduce inflammation, particularly by increasing carbon dioxide production?

**RAY PEAT:** Very often the TSH, if it doesn't easily increase your thyroid secretion, the TSH keeps rising. And when it acts on other cells, the first thing it does is to excite the thyroid gland, and that should produce T4 and T3, which keep the TSH down at a moderate level. But if the gland isn't responding with enough thyroid hormone production, then the TSH keeps rising, and the TSH has an irritating, stimulating action on other cells, such as your blood vessels and bone marrow cells, and it will create a generalized inflammation so that hypertension, a lot of the circulatory problems are caused directly by too much TSH rather than by too little thyroid hormone. So they go together, low thyroid hormone, high TSH, both of them contribute to the problem.

**CONTEXT:** How can elevated TSH levels, even in the presence of low thyroid hormone, contribute to inflammation and circulatory problems?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I keep seeing people being diagnosed exclusively on the basis of their TSH. You have to look at the whole metabolism, how many calories they're eating. You can't be hyperthyroid and maintain your body weight on 1,800 calories a day. I keep seeing that diagnosis and people treated for years with a thyroid-suppressive drug when their metabolic rate is already too slow. And stress hormones will lower the TSH. So it looks like you're hypothyroid, but you're really just under stress.

**CONTEXT:** Why is relying solely on TSH levels for thyroid diagnosis potentially misleading, and what other factors should be considered?

**RAY PEAT:** Looking at large populations and their natural level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, one study found that people with 0.4... below the so-called normal range, from 0.01 up to 0.4, these people were free of thyroid cancer. But as their TSH, on average, went up, so did the incidence of thyroid cancer. It's the same way that the gonadotropins, FSH, for example, can drive ovarian cancer, if you remove an animal's one ovary, the FSH in the pituitary increases and overstimulates the remaining ovary, so that one is more likely to develop cancer. Same with a testicle or an adrenal gland, if you remove one adrenal, the other one overworks and gets too much of the pituitary stimulating hormone intends to develop a tumor.

**CONTEXT:** How does TSH levels relate to thyroid cancer risk, and what parallels can be drawn with other endocrine glands and cancer development?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've seen a few people over the years who were on a raw vegetable diet, for example, eating lots of undercooked or raw broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, and soybeans, and they were developing multiple endocrine problems, and just by adding some eggs and milk to their diet, people who were told that their thyroid, or that their pituitary gland was hopelessly defective just by adding eggs and milk and orange juice, their pituitary function came back to normal. And besides those raw vegetables, probably the two most important things for damaging thyroid function are a protein deficiency. People sometimes get along for years eating only 20 or 25 grams of protein a day, but that just isn't enough to keep your energy running at the proper high rate. And the other thing is the polyunsaturated fats, which even on an ideal diet... they will still tend to accumulate in the body over the years, but if you're eating lots of vegetables and nuts, seeds are generally rich in polyunsaturated fats, and fatty fish and poultry and pork because of what those animals are generally fed, the polyunsaturated fats are efficient for making the animals gain weight because their thyroid is suppressed so that they retain more of the food they eat as fat. And so if you eat fatty fish, poultry, pork, and the vegetables that are high in those polyunsaturated fats, you retain progressively. Inhibit the secretion of the thyroid hormone from the gland by blocking enzymes and they interfere with the transport from the gland to your tissues and then in the tissues they block the actions of the thyroid hormone and at the same time these polyunsaturated fats are intensifying the actions of estrogen and actually stimulating the formation of estrogen and the estrogen is a major inhibitor of the secretion of the thyroid hormone so the polyunsaturated fats work complexly on your whole metabolic system. Ultimately they tend to degrade the mitochondria that produce the carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors, beyond raw vegetables, can significantly impair thyroid function, and how do polyunsaturated fats negatively impact thyroid hormone activity?

**RAY PEAT:** The National Academy of Science did a study for the army and they found that even medium-sized Men and women at just desk work just ordinary eight hour a day activity nothing very physical Needed at least a hundred grams of protein a day to work efficiently and they didn't specify the the upper limit, but the minimum even for Medium-sized women was about a hundred grams per day and the trouble is that the highest quality proteins are rich in methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan and all of these happen to be potentially toxic amino acids. Too much of them can cause seizures or inflammation, excitotoxic processes. So... Ideally, you would get more gelatin-like amino acids. Gelatin happens to be deficient or to lack those toxic or excitatory amino acids, methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan, but fruits have a fair amount of amino acids. Typically, about 1% where milk is 3%. So, milk happens to have some anti-stress factors, a variety of nutrients and proteins that counter the stress which the excitatory amino acids would promote, and the high calcium content of milk is the most important anti-stress factor.

**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended daily protein intake, and what are the potential risks associated with certain amino acids found in high-quality proteins?

**RAY PEAT:** For an old person, that's the best, because it doesn't support tumor growth, for example. Oh, but for younger types, 20, 30, 40. When you're growing up until 25 or so, you need the full protein, like milk and cheese and eggs.

**CONTEXT:** What are the differences in protein needs between younger and older individuals, and why is gelatin particularly beneficial for older people?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the animal foods are very rich in those essential and growth promoting amino acids. So with age, to be safe from inflammation you don't want to overdo the growth promoting, especially if they're theyre associated with polyunsaturated fats. So then the fatty fish, and you said pork and chicken, poultry, they tend to have more of the poofers because of what they're fed?

**CONTEXT:** How does the type of animal food consumed impact its essential amino acid profile and potential for inflammation, especially in relation to polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Soybeans and corn, for example, have a very high proportion of unsaturated fats. And during the 1940s, it was discovered that those grains produced the best return on investment. A small amount of the fatty grains would produce the best weight production per dollar.

**CONTEXT:** Why are soybeans and corn considered problematic in animal feed, and what was the economic rationale behind their widespread use?

**RAY PEAT:** My friends in Mexico would feed their kitchen scraps to the chickens and there would be lots of meat scraps and lots of tortillas, leftover tortillas, which had the fat removed. Their eggs were super good. The taste is improved. Polyunsaturated fat content goes down, the cholesterol tends to increase, and the taste is better. If you have noticed supermarket eggs, sometimes they will say they're high in N-3, omega-3 fatty acids. I've noticed that those have a very fishy taste. Flax seed has been used as a chicken food supplement for those fatty acids, but I think people notice the fishy taste and tend to stay away from those just after they notice the taste.

**CONTEXT:** How can the diet of chickens influence the quality and fatty acid profile of their eggs, and what are the sensory indicators of high polyunsaturated fat content?

**RAY PEAT:** Table scraps are very good, bread or tortillas or cooked potatoes, all kinds of edible, human food is very good for chickens.

**CONTEXT:** What are ideal supplemental feeds for chickens, especially during winter when fresh grass is unavailable?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when I was in graduate school, we had an international immunology conference and the big shots from all around the world came and did their presentation and At that time, the innate immune system was considered a primitive thing, irrelevant. These people were talking about the structure and function of the antibodies. That line of thinking was continuous from the time of Paul Ehrlich and his magic bullet. The antibodies were still being thought of as extensions of Paul Ehrlich's magic bullet, but Ehrlich shared the Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff, who was an embryologist who showed the immune function as part of the whole developmental process of the organism, a holistic view. And in the 1960s, this was put aside as a primitive, somewhat irrelevant form of immunity. But now it's coming out that the antibody system is kind of a desperate last measure of immunity. It's promoted by estrogen and the stress hormones. Meanwhile, the innate immune system actually does learn and is an adaptive immune system, but the antibody people were saying that the antibody system is the adaptive part, and the innate system is merely a primitive forerunner of this fancy system.

**CONTEXT:** How has the understanding of the immune system evolved, and what is the current perspective on the innate versus antibody-mediated immunity?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the natural exposure to irritants and infections is through the skin, or the lungs, or the digestive system, or even the eye membranes. Definitely not through the muscle, where you inject something into the muscle. It's an absolutely different process. More substances were exposed to the organism, the human, the mammals, the people.

**CONTEXT:** How does the route of exposure to antigens, such as through natural pathways versus intramuscular injection, affect the immune response?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there have been studies in several countries. India has done a lot of it, showing that vitamin A can reduce infectious disease on a level comparable to vaccines. And vitamin D is the other essential immune-supporting nutrient. Very few studies have combined vitamin A and D and generally good nutrition. The idea is how to keep infections spreading from poor countries. And vitamin A doesn't cost very much, so they reduce the focus of infection by giving people partial nutrition. If you simply gave everyone good nutrition, you wouldn't have epidemics. They would, the body, so we kind of understand the innate immune system, so when you give a vaccine with the adjuvants like aluminum and such, talk us through how this antibody theory is supposed to work.

**CONTEXT:** How can vitamin A and D, along with good nutrition, serve as effective alternatives to vaccines in reducing infectious disease, and why is this approach particularly relevant for developing countries?

**RAY PEAT:** It's a very complicated course. You have cells that catch the antigen and process it and communicate it to the cells, which supposedly it's a cell that has already mutated to be able to match that antigen and then that one cell multiplies as a clone, called the clonal selection theory, and that one antibody's descendant produces a flood of these specific antibodies that then persist in the body sometimes for the whole lifetime. And that's supposed to be a process. The promoters of vaccines to make the body immune from whatever, measles, mumps and stuff.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the mechanism of antibody production according to the clonal selection theory and how it relates to vaccine-induced immunity?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I got interested in the fact that estrogen promotes the B-cells which produce the antibodies, where progesterone supports the thymus gland and the T-cells, which have the intelligent adaptability and multiple levels of interacting with bad factors, and it happens that estrogen promotes autoimmunity. Women have five or ten times the incidence of autoimmune diseases as men because of this influence of estrogen. And the fact that the vaccines are working exclusively on that system shouldn't be surprising that autoimmune diseases are the fastest growing malady in the population. I think it's not only the estrogenic substances but the vaccines which work in exactly the same way that estrogen stress does.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen influence the immune system, and why is this connection relevant to the rise in autoimmune diseases, particularly in relation to vaccines?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1986, the government passed a law saying that drug companies would have no liability at all for any harm done by the vaccines, and the Department of Health Human Services pledged at the time that they would check and work with the drug companies to improve the safety of the vaccines and would report every two years. But 30 years later, a lawsuit when Freedom of Information didn't get the information, they sued them. And finally, the Secretary of HHS admitted that they had done absolutely nothing over those 30 years. And when you look at these studies, the pressure is put on the journals so that critical articles have been retracted and denounced as fraudulent just because they were criticizing the dangers of the vaccines. But many of the studies supposedly testing the safety of the vaccines used the word fraudulence. As a control, the whole vaccine minus one antigen, the control contained the most toxic understood part of the vaccine, the adjuvant, so they were comparing a known toxin against the vaccine and saying the vaccine wasn't much more toxic than the toxic components of it. A completely crazy, crooked way to do science. But those articles, no one has pressured them to be withdrawn, even though they're essentially fraudulent.

**CONTEXT:** What is the history of government oversight and scientific integrity regarding vaccine safety studies, and what are the implications of industry-funded research and suppressed critical findings?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I've looked into many, many over the years. When the Armor product was sold to a different company, the recipe was changed and completely different things are put into it now. At least the first 20 or 30 years, they were removing the thyroid calcitonin hormone and selling it separately. So I stopped using the glandular. I happen to have some of the powdered pure gland from a chemical company that I trust. But I don't know of any well-defined. Reliable glandular product now.

**CONTEXT:** What is your current assessment of desiccated thyroid products, and why have you stopped recommending them?

**RAY PEAT:** I've heard the fewest bad things about WP and nature. WP, is that a brand? Yeah. And nature-throid. You've heard the fewest issues about it. Yeah, but I haven't used them personally, so I'm not sure. I use a synthetic that was designed to be exactly equivalent to the old Armour Thyroid product 40 years ago. It's called Xeno Plus. It's a mixture of T4 and T3 in the same ratio that the old Armour had.

**CONTEXT:** Based on limited information, which desiccated thyroid brands have you heard the fewest complaints about, and what synthetic alternative do you currently use?

**RAY PEAT:** Sino Plus. S-C-N-O? P-L-U-S? C-Y-N-O. Like Sino Plus. Sino Plus. And that's got T3 and T4. And that's one of the cleanest forms. It's a synthetic? Yeah. And the tablets are equivalent to more than two grains of the old armor. So you want to start with about an eighth of a tablet or a fourth of a tablet.

**CONTEXT:** Can you clarify the spelling and composition of the synthetic thyroid hormone you use, and what is the recommended starting dosage?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, I've known basically everyone who supplements the right thyroid. One person was supplementing only T4, which is a very conventional thing to do because it doesn't give you the metabolic effect of the T3, but it does have a full thyroid suppressive effect, but one person who wasn't having the nodules shrink after three months of a full supplement of T4 added T3, and within just, I think it was about three weeks, the nodules had shrunk.

**CONTEXT:** Can thyroid nodules be reversed, and what role does T3 supplementation play in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I've been following the research for many years, and one of the problems is that the body produces a fraction of a milligram, and so even a one milligram dose, which people use for improving their sleep. That's already unphysiological, but if someone takes five or ten milligrams, then that's really getting risky, I think. There have been studies, for example, most animals, both in the lab and in the wild, their gonads regress during the winter. They don't want to reproduce in the winter. And why that is, is that melatonin rises in proportion to darkness. The days are short in the winter, and so melatonin rises to a higher level. And it causes regression of the gonads and also of the thymus. So, if one's going to mess with melatonin supplementally, you're talking about really very, very small doses. I'm York. I have a tenth to a fourth of a milligram.

**CONTEXT:** What is your current opinion on melatonin supplementation, considering its physiological production and potential effects on the gonads and thymus?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think that's good. Yeah, it seems like it, doesn't it? Yes. Yeah, a person sometimes using a stethoscope so they can hear what their intestine is doing can improve, it's a way of meditating to improve relaxation. Anxious things go quiet and as soon as you relax and are having fun, your intestine gets lively.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on stomach noises, and how can listening to one's intestines be a form of meditation for relaxation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah. If you have gas, naturally it will resonate more. Sometimes it's the lack of a carrot salad. Carrots are antiseptic and anti-inflammatory and stimulate the intestine while binding the toxins such as estrogen secreted in the bile preventing reabsorption so it can just having a good size carrot salad every day can shift your hormones significantly reducing such things as sinus inflammation but also infertile women have become fertile by shifting the balance away from estrogen and the stress hormones and increasing progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** How can a carrot salad contribute to hormonal balance, reduce inflammation, and improve fertility?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because it's almost completely indigestible and even bacteria are suppressed by it that doesn't support bacterial or fungal growth in the intestine. So it's like an antibiotic broom that sweeps you clean.

**CONTEXT:** Why are carrots considered a unique and beneficial raw vegetable in your dietary recommendations?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it generally regrows and is adequate but the T4 will tend to keep it suppressed and that's okay if your liver is able to turn the T4 to T3. The reason the glandular or the balanced thyroid supplement is better is that so many people have poor health. Lever efficiency and you have to have your blood sugar steady to convert Cyroxin T4 into the active T3 hormone. If you do everything right, right amount of activity and balanced nutrients, then your liver will be able to turn T4 to T3. Women are many times more likely than men to have a problem with just T4. Just T4.

**CONTEXT:** After thyroid surgery, can the remaining thyroid gland regrow and become sufficient, and what factors influence the conversion of T4 to T3?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the most important thing is the accumulation of the polyunsaturated fats, which block your ability to respond to thyroid hormone. And so if there is some way to minimize the intake and activate the process of elimination. I think it should be able to go on indefinitely. That's the basic motor of aging, I think.

**CONTEXT:** What is the primary factor that limits lifespan, and how can minimizing polyunsaturated fat intake and promoting its elimination contribute to indefinite longevity?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, except macadamia. I think even Brazil nuts have a fair amount of Pufa macadamia nuts are pretty pretty low. The lowest I know of.

**CONTEXT:** Are macadamia nuts the lowest in polyunsaturated fatty acids among all nuts?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's why I've emphasized sugar and other carbohydrates to reduce the fat intake. Even though butter and coconut oil are mostly safe, they still have two or three percent of the toxic fats. And so you can minimize your intake of those if you increase starch and sugar.

**CONTEXT:** How can increasing starch and sugar intake help reduce the negative impact of even small amounts of polyunsaturated fats found in butter and coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** Orange juice, tropical fruits in general, the sweet ones rather than the starchy. And all of the nixtamalized grains such as tortillas, tamales, and so on. Ancient cultures in Asia as well as the Americas, discovered the technique of cooking grains in lye or lime ashes, or limestone. Cal is what they call it in Spanish. And so that's why you could recommend corn, you know, in the tortillas and the tamales, because of the process.

**CONTEXT:** What are the ideal sources of starch and sugar to increase in the diet, and what is the significance of nixtamalization for grains like corn?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's easy to make if you get organic corn and boil it with the alkali. It swells up, makes hominy, the hominy. You throw away the water because the alkali has turned the fat into soap. And you throw the soapy water away and then the corn has been partly digested by the alkali so that the protein changes composition, produces some niacin, increasing the nutritional quality of the protein. Partly digesting the carbohydrate so it's less likely to form gas and feed bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** Can you provide instructions on how to nixtamalize corn at home, and what are the nutritional benefits of this process?

**RAY PEAT:** About 45 years ago, 50 years ago, I made bread regularly, soaking the flour for about 12 hours until the gluten was essentially gone and so it wouldn't leaven normally and so I would make up a batter basically with powdered milk and the gluten and starch were turned to sugar. It didn't have any of the rubbery quality of gluten that makes bread rise, so I would make a wet batter and then bake it at a high temperature, so it would boil and leaven itself by the steam, and it made a very delicious non-toxic bread, because the long-soaking 12 hours would convert the harmful proteins to valuable nutritious proteins and the gluten. Uh, uh, w-w-was essentially zero. No, no. I-I grinded it first and then soaked it. Not for 40 years. No. No. No above, huh?

**CONTEXT:** What is your method for preparing bread that eliminates gluten and makes it non-toxic, and why did you stop making it?

**RAY PEAT:** If your thyroid function is low, you should check your waking temperature and pulse rate, as well as your midday temperature and pulse rate. If your metabolic energy is low, getting cold can slow things down even more and put you over into the inflammatory state. When your feet, for example, are around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, they start producing inflammatory signals that affect the rest of your body, so your hands and feet are the quickest to get cold when your metabolic energy is low, and a cold bath in that situation just can make things worse.

**CONTEXT:** How does low thyroid function affect the body's response to cold, and why are extremities the first to feel the cold?

**RAY PEAT:** Waking up with, say, a 98 degree temperature and 70 beats per minute. Yeah, around. So, that 98 to 98.6, you're not too picky about getting all the way to 0.6? By about 11 in the morning, it should rise about half a degree from the waking temperature. And if it would not, if it would stay the same, say 98 throughout the day, you would want to maybe look at maybe a little thyroid? Uh, yeah, uh, check, uh... the situation changes. If your night is very stressful, some people will wake up with a 98.6 temperature and a 75 beats per minute heart rate. And then after they start having orange juice and milk and sunlight, their temperature will go down to maybe 97 and a 60 beat per minute, because nighttime stress can give you artificially increased metabolism at waking, so it's important to look at the change. It should rise, your metabolic rate should rise after breakfast and stay there till sunset.

**CONTEXT:** What are the ideal morning body temperature and pulse rate for a balanced metabolism, and how should these metrics change throughout the day?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't think it... No, you don't see much? The studies on mice I don't think are applicable. It's important to look at the right species and the right combination of foods and the timing. It depends on the age and so on. If you don't have a very high metabolic rate, one meal a day might be okay, but with a very high metabolic rate, going 20 hours without food can bring on stress.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on intermittent fasting, and why might studies on mice not be applicable to humans?

**RAY PEAT:** No, they're very stable. Really? So you could actually put this Great Lakes Gelatin in a hot drink if you would, or put it in something like that? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Wow.

**CONTEXT:** Is powdered gelatin stable enough to be added to hot beverages without degrading its protein structure?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid and... Orange juice and milk are the quickest ways. Orange juice, milk, what was that one? Thyroid. Thyroid. A thyroid T3 supplement in particular.

**CONTEXT:** What are the most effective remedies for breaking out of chronic inflammatory patterns, such as stress-induced aerobic glycolysis?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it was orange juice and tortillas and... Cheese maybe.

**CONTEXT:** What foods would you choose if you were stranded on a desert island?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're now manufacturing cheese with engineered microbes and things that you just don't want to expose yourself to. Yeah, yeah. Raw cheese, you think, easier to digest than the pasteurized? Well, pasteurization doesn't necessarily hurt it, but it's the additives that I think should be avoided.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential risks associated with conventionally manufactured cheese, and how does raw cheese compare in terms of digestibility and additives?

**RAY PEAT:** Years ago they were finding that I think it was about 30% of the peanut butter samples they tested contained a very toxic fungal metabolite and just that risk I think is enough reason to avoid it. That could be why so many people are allergic. To peanuts, I guess.

**CONTEXT:** What is the risk associated with peanut butter consumption, and how might a toxic fungal metabolite contribute to peanut allergies?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think aflatoxin. Aflatoxin, yeah. And I guess there's no reason to believe that an organic peanut is really organic these days with drift, and we just don't know, do we? Well, even organic things can have fungus growing on them. Oh, it's the fungus in the peanut, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** What is aflatoxin, and why is it a concern even with organic peanut products?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the whole idea of working on people's genes. No gene engineer is going to be going to be as competent at engineering the genes as our cells are. A bacterium is constantly editing and revising its genes according to situations. If bacteria can do it, we can do it. But when you try to do it in a test tube, it's always lacking. Information that the whole body has. The whole body evaluates the situation of our chromosomes and can modify them accordingly with various epigenetic mechanisms, but the genetic engineers are missing almost all of the actual mechanism that produces appropriate changes. I think it's becoming more and more interesting to think about the possibility that we are manipulating and changing all of this with our state of consciousness about what we think and believe.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on CRISPR gene editing, and how does the body's natural ability to modify genes compare to artificial gene engineering?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we're continuously interacting with the environment. When we talk, we're modifying each other's brains. The whole organism changes in the process of talking and listening and understanding, and those changes are nearly as... doesn't cause drastic changes, but in bad situations it can be the decisive factor.

**CONTEXT:** How does communication and understanding influence our brains and overall organismal changes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, uh, when I... I had TV twenty years ago. I was watching some Supreme Court judges talking, and I took my blood pressure and it had gone up to 168 over 110. I could tell that their thoughts were harming me.

**CONTEXT:** How can exposure to certain media, like watching Supreme Court judges, negatively impact physiological markers such as blood pressure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we have enzymes called dehydrogenases which Can in principle use hydrogen instead of? Glucose or other molecules the NADH molecule that transmits energy from glucose or protein to be producing energy. I think hydrogen molecule can be handled by the enzymes that handle NADH and transmit hydrogen electronic energy into the electron transport chain to produce carbon dioxide or produce water. You wouldn't be getting your carbon dioxide if you relied too much on hydrogen. Producing energy, I think it can be constructive.

**CONTEXT:** How does molecular hydrogen fit into the paradigm of regenerative metabolism, and how might it interact with the body's energy-producing enzymes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, by reducing inflammation, I think. Inflammation is an imbalance of electrons. Sometimes, just not having enough energy is a problem. If you cut off your oxygen or glucose supply, you go into that stressed condition that produces dangerous electrons, and glucose or hydrogen, I think, can often solve the problem.

**CONTEXT:** How might molecular hydrogen help reduce inflammation and address energy deficits in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** If your thyroid function is low, you should check your waking temperature and pulse rate, as well as your midday temperature and pulse rate. If your metabolic energy is low, getting cold can slow things down even more and put you over into the inflammatory state. When your feet, for example, are around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, they start producing inflammatory signals that affect the rest of your body, so your hands and feet are the quickest to get cold when your metabolic energy is low, and a cold bath in that situation just can make things worse.

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of low thyroid function on the body's response to cold exposure, and why are extremities particularly sensitive?

**RAY PEAT:** Waking up with, say, a 98 degree temperature and 70 beats per minute. Yeah, around. So, that 98 to 98.6, you're not too picky about getting all the way to 0.6? By about 11 in the morning, it should rise about half a degree from the waking temperature. And if it would not, if it would stay the same, say 98 throughout the day, you would want to maybe look at maybe a little thyroid? Uh, yeah, uh, check, uh... the situation changes. If your night is very stressful, some people will wake up with a 98.6 temperature and a 75 beats per minute heart rate. And then after they start having orange juice and milk and sunlight, their temperature will go down to maybe 97 and a 60 beat per minute, because nighttime stress can give you artificially increased metabolism at waking, so it's important to look at the change. It should rise, your metabolic rate should rise after breakfast and stay there till sunset.

**CONTEXT:** What are the ideal morning body temperature and pulse rate for a balanced metabolism, and how should these metrics change throughout the day?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, thyroid and... Orange juice and milk are the quickest ways. Orange juice, milk, what was that one? Thyroid. Thyroid. A thyroid T3 supplement in particular.

**CONTEXT:** What are the most effective remedies for breaking out of chronic inflammatory patterns, such as stress-induced aerobic glycolysis?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it was orange juice and tortillas and... Cheese maybe.

**CONTEXT:** What foods would you choose if you were stranded on a desert island?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're now manufacturing cheese with engineered microbes and things that you just don't want to expose yourself to. Yeah, yeah. Raw cheese, you think, easier to digest than the pasteurized? Well, pasteurization doesn't necessarily hurt it, but it's the additives that I think should be avoided.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential risks associated with conventionally manufactured cheese, and how does raw cheese compare in terms of digestibility and additives?

**RAY PEAT:** Years ago they were finding that I think it was about 30% of the peanut butter samples they tested contained a very toxic fungal metabolite and just that risk I think is enough reason to avoid it. That could be why so many people are allergic. To peanuts, I guess.

**CONTEXT:** What is the risk associated with peanut butter consumption, and how might a toxic fungal metabolite contribute to peanut allergies?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think aflatoxin. Aflatoxin, yeah. And I guess there's no reason to believe that an organic peanut is really organic these days with drift, and we just don't know, do we? Well, even organic things can have fungus growing on them. Oh, it's the fungus in the peanut, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** What is aflatoxin, and why is it a concern even with organic peanut products?
