**RAY PEAT:** "The concept that the fatty acid essentiality is, first it was a mistake and then it turned into a fraud."

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on the concept of essential fatty acids?

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1970s, I saw research in which they fed saturated fat, or highly polyunsaturated fats, or a mixture to rats through their whole lifetime. And they found that it wasn't the quantity of fat that made them obese, it was the degree of unsaturation. So that the ones that ate saturated fats, such as coconut oil, were lean at the end of their lives, no matter how much they ate. And the ones that ate only polyunsaturated fats were fat at the end of their lives, even if they had a low-fat diet."

**CONTEXT:** What did you observe regarding the effects of saturated versus polyunsaturated fats on obesity in animal studies?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, those are so sensitive to oxygen degradation that people have checked the blood content after someone eats a fatty fish and finds that very little of them even reach the bloodstream, and when they do, they're an oxidized breakdown product. A great majority of the fat is degraded by the time it gets into your bloodstream."

**CONTEXT:** What happens to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like omega-3s once they are consumed?

**RAY PEAT:** "Only because of the trace minerals that are reliably in seafood. Selenium and iodine, for example, aren't reliable in, if you eat foods grown only in one locality, you can become deficient in a particular trace mineral."

**CONTEXT:** Do you believe humans need to eat fish at all?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, the low-fat fish and the shellfish. Shellfish are great sources of copper because they generally don't use iron. Oysters are high in iron but squid is very good. It's low in iron and high in copper and has selenium and iodine and other trace minerals. Cod and sole are low fat fish that are safe."

**CONTEXT:** Are there specific types of fish that are better to consume?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you take, say, a fish oil supplement and then look in your bloodstream, there's enough of the oxidized fat already to suppress the immune system. That's why they use them as anti-inflammatories, but the trouble is that they accumulate and create progressive suppression of your immune system."

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of consuming fish oil supplements?

**RAY PEAT:** "But a newborn, there have been many publications saying that when they check the brain of a newly born, say, of miscarriage, they find that the brain is very low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and so they say you must supplement pregnant women with fish oil or the equivalent because babies are being born with a brain deficiency of PUFA. But in France, there was a study in which they did give a proof of supplement to pregnant women. Figuring that they would advance brain development, and so they gave a sound test to the woman's abdomen to measure the baby's response. They found that the babies learned more slowly in utero if they had extra PUFA added to the diet and they were born with smaller brains. And that shouldn't have been done in humans because already in the 1960s and 70s, experiments were showing that animals, if the mother was fed a diet high in unsaturated fat, the babies were born small brained and slow learners. If they were low in PUFA, but fed, for example, saturated fat, the babies had bigger brains and learned faster."

**CONTEXT:** What is the impact of PUFAs on infant brain development?

**RAY PEAT:** "It's about 8% or 10% or 11% PUFA. The rest of it is very good fat. So if you hold it down to one or two teaspoons per day, you're safe."

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on olive oil?

**RAY PEAT:** "All during the growth time, up to the age of 20, the body is diluting the PUFA in the diet, so the brain isn't seriously impaired until about the age of 20 when you stop growing in size and volume. The brain and other tissues begin increasing their concentration of PUFA. So from 20 to the mid 40s, the brain is becoming more and more polyunsaturated. And so more at risk of stress. When you're under stress, you release any of the sword proof into the bloodstream where they can become oxidized and toxic."

**CONTEXT:** How does PUFA accumulation affect the brain over time?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, that gives a head start on the problem. But even if you eat most perfectly fresh pufa, by the time it reaches your stomach, it's deteriorating. And then when it gets into the tissue, it's farther along and some of it reaches your brain and is stored for years. But then every night your brain is renewing itself considerably. But unfortunately during the night, your free fatty acids in the blood coming out of your fat tissues rise and so the brain is trying to renew itself but what it finds in your bloodstream by the time you're 40 is polyunsaturated fatty acids that add to the damage of the brain. So that every night when you're over the age of 40 your brain is at risk of deteriorating faster."

**CONTEXT:** What are the additional problems associated with PUFAs, beyond their inherent instability?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, definitely. I got the information from Dr. Ray Peay. And by the way, let me â€¦ Let me add that we're just discussing the snowflake on the tip of the iceberg because Dr. Ray Peay is a true polymath. He's a renaissance man. I recommend you go to his website and read his numerous blogs. He also sells a newsletter. And I don't know when his books are coming back online, but he writes books also."

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the role of carbon dioxide in metabolic health?

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1960s I was living and working in Mexico, I had a school there, and I got interested in how people could be fed economically. And grains are a very cheap source of starch, but they come with a variety of defensive toxins. For a plant, its leaves are important, cows and insects eat their leaves, and so they put some toxins in their leaves, but they can regenerate the leaves. But their seeds are essential for the next generation to survive. So the worst toxins that a plant can produce are put into the seeds as defense against predators."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on grains as a food source?

**RAY PEAT:** "And so the traditional societies, like the indigenous Mexican preparation of any grain, was to soak it in lye. Lye or lime. But in China and other countries, the same thing was practiced. If they used grain, they would have ashes left over from their fires. And so they would put the ashes in and boil the grains with acid and the with lye, alkali. It would break down the starches and the storage proteins, the gluten-like chemicals. And so the native Mexican diet, based on corn, no one was getting pellagra, but in the South, when people started growing corn, they didn't know the traditional lye or lime treatment. And so pellagra became an epidemic through the Southern states because of the corn in the diet. And corn is one of the less toxic grains. Any grain should be highly processed, such as with lime or lye, to degrade the toxins. And just soaking a fresh grain, if you soak it for a day or two, that activates enzymes and turning it into basically a sprout, then the toxins are reduced. The root and the shoot will have some toxins, but the main, the worst toxins are in the seed itself."

**CONTEXT:** How should grains be prepared to mitigate their inherent toxins?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it loses some of its characteristic taste, but it's a lot safer."

**CONTEXT:** Is soaking a grain for 24 hours before cooking the best way to make it safer?

**RAY PEAT:** "It's a fairly long story, I've got some articles on my website about it, but until about 1940 the agriculture department hadn't required that it be removed from the waste from the slaughterhouses used to be put into hamburger and such. In 1940 or 42, the agriculture department declared that the thyroid gland had to be sold to the basically the armor meat company to produce thyroid hormone by desiccating the gland. Removing the fat, adding glucose to it, and putting it in tablets. But until that time, anyone who was eating a traditional meat-based diet, for example, in Germany, they would put the thyroid gland and other parts in the sausages. And anyone that made traditional fish or chicken soup, the neck and the thyroid and the head. Would go into the soup. So everyone was getting thyroid as a natural supplement. After 1942, it was by law not permitted in food. So at that point we became dependent on a supplement."

**CONTEXT:** What is the history of thyroid medication and its availability?

**RAY PEAT:** "It's our natural antidote to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the tissues. Because those as they build up in the blood, block every function of the thyroid hormone. They block the production of it in your gland, the transport in your blood, and the reception and use of it in your mitochondria. So PUFA are the great enemy of thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** How do PUFAs interfere with thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "And if we aren't allowed to get it in our natural chicken soup or fish soup, then we're dependent on getting it. As a supplement and armor made a great supplement for almost 100 years then they sold their company to Revlon the cosmetics company and the price went up about tenfold and in a series of sales the pills went from less than one cent each up to close to a dollar each simply as a matter of financial arrangements but still our armor has gone with the new owners armor has gone through a series of problems because they changed the formula added various junk to it but insisted hasn't changed because it's still called armor thyroid but there since then other companies have taken over more or less the traditional armor formula but it depends on who they are getting their glandular material from. The armor descendant Forest Pharmaceuticals said several years ago that they were using the raw material of the gland to extract thyrocalcitonin to regulate calcium. That used to be a part of the natural thyroid supplement. So now it's hard to know whether your thyroid glandular has been pre-extracted, losing the calcitonin component. So since the 1990s, I've been using a product made in Mexico called Sino Plus, which imitates the armor formula. Sino Plus is an armor company. They made a synthetic equivalent of the glandular and called it Cyrolar, and that formula was exactly copied by a couple other companies, but Sino Plus continues to make the armor equivalent in a synthetic form. When I started buying it, 100 tablets cost 60 cents, and now they're selling for about $20. But still, it's cheaper. The equivalent made in the U.S. is close to $100 for that many tablets."

**CONTEXT:** What are the issues with current thyroid supplements and what alternatives do you recommend?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were some studies in the 1980s of various things related to heart rate. They found that brain function closely corresponded to heart rate. They looked at kids in school, in high school, and saw that their grade average corresponded to their heart rate. And that led them to look at people with pacemakers. They would give a person with pacemakers set at 70 beats a mental test, and then they would just turn the regulator up and give them an 85 per minute heart rate, and their mental functions all improved. And there were studies that showed that if your blood pressure and heart rate increased every year a little bit on average, you were doing well. But they saw that if, for example, at the age of 70 or so, your pulse rate stopped increasing. Or even started decreasing. Those people didn't have a long life expectancy. Really? As long as things were tightening up with age, in effect compensating for the increased inefficiency because of the PUFA storage. If you could keep increasing your blood delivery, you were making up for that inefficiency from the stored lipofuscin."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between heart rate and brain function, and how does it relate to aging?

**RAY PEAT:** "If your hands should be warm and your oral temperature shouldn't be too much above your hand temperature. Keeping your adrenaline low will let your heart rate correspond to your metabolic rate. And when you get your temperature up, so that you're temperature rises to about 98 when you wake up, and then gets up to 98.5 or 6 or 7 when you're moving around, then your heart will have a corresponding increase in rate. And that goes with also an increased stroke volume of the heart, so it delivers more blood per beat. If you're having high adrenaline. Or other stress hormones, your heart is going to have a short stroke, not delivered very much per beat, and so it has to beat faster. And that leads to inefficiency and tissue stress."

**CONTEXT:** How can one differentiate between a healthy increase in heart rate and one driven by adrenaline, and what is the role of body temperature?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. When your metabolism is going at a good high rate, you're producing carbon dioxide in proportion to your oxygen consumption, and the carbon dioxide has a relaxing constructive sedative effect."

**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of a high metabolic rate on the body, particularly regarding carbon dioxide production?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, definitely. I got the information from Dr. Ray Peay. And by the way, let me â€¦ Let me add that we're just discussing the snowflake on the tip of the iceberg because Dr. Ray Peay is a true polymath. He's a renaissance man. I recommend you go to his website and read his numerous blogs. He also sells a newsletter. And I don't know when his books are coming back online, but he writes books also."

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the concept of carbon dioxide's role in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** "Broda Barnes spent most of his career up in Colorado at a high altitude, where people were seldom overheated with high humidity. In Eugene in the summer, some days were very humid and hot. I found that hypothyroid people would come in with normal temperatures. I realized that even a dead person would have a fairly good temperature when the environmental temperature is very high, so I started looking at the pulse rate as well as the temperature. There were lots of experiments with the quality of brain function according to brain temperature as well as pulse rate and delivery of blood, glucose and oxygen to the brain. Someone devised sort of a heating pad integrated with a helmet so they could heat the head specifically. Again, they would give people mental tests, mental calculation. Memory and so on and they found that when they heated the head Up to I think a hundred and one degrees or or slightly more their mental abilities increased with each degree of Warmer and if you look at at some fairly small brained animals If they have a high body temperature like crows and parrots Run around with Well over a hundred and five degrees Fahrenheit temperature with a very small brain. They're extremely intelligent It isn't brain volume. It's it's a combination of brain volume plus the working temperature the warmer you can stand You don't want to force yourself to get warmer because your your liver has to keep supplying a good stream of glucose and your lungs have to regulate the oxygen delivery efficiently. But if your system can stand it, the brain works better the warmer it is."

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of body temperature, particularly in relation to brain function and thyroid health, considering the work of Broda Barnes?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can't have cold hands and feet. Except during stress. Emotional stress raises your adrenaline and will make your hands and feet and nose get cold. But if your thyroid is low, you experience stress almost all the time. So people run around doing their business with cold hands and feet and wonder why they're inefficient."

**CONTEXT:** What causes cold hands and feet, and how does thyroid function play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** "So if you're......highly stressed, for example, during the night, cortisol rises to a peak in the morning because your blood sugar is falling. Low thyroid people have extremely high cortisol in the morning, as well as sometimes adrenaline. That can make your morning temperature misleadingly warm because the cortisol is tearing down your protein-eating tissues to turn them into glucose. My goodness. And the adrenaline will make your skin cold too. Increase your core temperature. So it can be misleading unless you check all of those things the the cortisol and adrenaline will show up as your Increased morning temperature and heart rate But then if you have some orange juice and milk for example a couple of hours later if your temperature and pulse rate are slower That means you're under heavy stress during the night"

**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline affect morning body temperature and heart rate?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everything is less stressful when your thyroid is good."

**CONTEXT:** What is the overall impact of good thyroid function on stress levels?

**RAY PEAT:** "Sure, unless you're eating a chicken neck soup or fish head soup every week, everyone really needs a certain amount of thyroid supplement by the time they're 30 or 40."

**CONTEXT:** Is thyroid supplementation necessary for most people, and what are natural sources?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you're on a farm or where you get the unprocessed chicken, for a while at Safeway stores I found that chicken necks contained about one in ten contains the whole thyroid gland, but when I mentioned that everyone started buying it and Safeway stopped selling their necks because they didn't want to get in trouble with the FDA, the Agriculture Department."

**CONTEXT:** Can chicken necks be a source of thyroid hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, that works just like the pill."

**CONTEXT:** So, consuming chicken necks in soup is equivalent to taking a thyroid pill?

**RAY PEAT:** "At my recent newsletter on cholesterol, there were two of them, but I review the effects of PUFA on plaque and cholesterol. With aging, the free cholesterol in the brain drastically decreases. People talk about the cholesterol increasing with age, but free cholesterol is decreasing because it's being bound to polyunsaturated fats, which make it toxic. And it piles up in the brain and lowers brain metabolism and brain function. And in the plaque, it's the in proportion to the PUFA attached to the cholesterol as an ester form that makes the plaque. It's in that newsletter, I go in detail over how the enzymes are changed under the influence of PUFA. So the plaque is strictly a matter of excess PUFA. About 40 years ago, people checked the lipofuscin content, basically yellow fat disease of the arteries, and found that the plaque was loaded with lipofuscin, the degenerated form of free fatty acids."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of PUFAs in the formation of arterial plaque and cholesterol metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they cause plaque as well as other problems. That's in medical books, too."

**CONTEXT:** Do PUFAs contribute to plaque formation?

**RAY PEAT:** "For about 40 years, the Agriculture Department was listing lard as a saturated fat. So there are hundreds of publications on so-called saturated fat damage, and they were using lard as their saturated fat. And two or three years ago, it came out, someone measured the lard saturation and found that it was about 30 percent PUFA."

**CONTEXT:** What is the actual PUFA content of lard, and how has it been misrepresented in research?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, you're talking about the hydrogenated classic Crisco or something like that. Fully hydrogenated fat is very safe. There is a Russian study of using saturated peanut oil, a very hard saturated fat shortening, and they found that it reversed the aging changes in mitochondria. And since that time I've shifted to using hydrogenated coconut oil, which is now available on the Internet. And that's okay. That's good. Very good, yeah, because it has zero PUFA."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on hydrogenated fats, specifically hydrogenated coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** "No, it's actually chemically hydrogenated. Oh, that's okay. Yeah, we're looking for ways to get the pure saturated form by distillation or something other than the chemical treatment. That isn't available yet, but it would be the ideal."

**CONTEXT:** Is chemically hydrogenated coconut oil acceptable, or is there a preference for a non-chemically treated saturated fat?

**RAY PEAT:** "In Mexico, out in the country where you can get chickens or pork that were fed on fruit and tortillas rather than soy and corn, they're very safe to eat."

**CONTEXT:** What are the advantages of traditional animal husbandry practices regarding the safety of animal fats?

**RAY PEAT:** "Rivisi was very good on noticing the effect of the day-night cycle. I started thinking about that about 40 or 50 years ago that you have to look at the hormones in context. If your liver is in very good condition and your muscles are working right, your body should store several ounces, maybe 10 ounces of sugar which can be drawn on during the night. If you didn't store your sugar efficiently because you were not producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid. That wastes your sugar. So during the night you run out of sugar and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol and you start breaking down your tissues releasing whatever fat is stored and that's what causes bone loss during the night for example. And if you can keep your body well stocked on sugar. Then you can avoid that night time deterioration stress."

**CONTEXT:** How does the body's ability to store and utilize sugar relate to hormonal balance and tissue preservation, particularly during the night?

**RAY PEAT:** "Avoiding the pufa is the essential thing. And eating adequate carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** What are the key dietary factors for maintaining adequate sugar stores and preventing nighttime stress?

**RAY PEAT:** "It has a similar effect because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine. And when you have too much pufa in your body, that poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar, and so in making lactic acid from glucose, you use several times more glucose per minute than when you're making carbon dioxide. It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body, so within an hour or two of of going to sleep, your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar, turns on the stress hormones, and so if you have sometimes just a little salty snack will do it because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar more efficiently and lower stress hormones. But for example, a tablespoon of sugar in a glass of milk could be honey."

**CONTEXT:** Why does consuming a carbohydrate before sleep help with sleep, and how does PUFA intake interfere with this process?

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I would usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours. But you said actually a salty snack would do the same thing. Very often it does. I've seen people with hyperactive kids who never wanted to go to bed gave them a little bit of salty consomme or something and just right out like they'd been given a shot of morphine or something."

**CONTEXT:** Can a salty snack have a similar sleep-inducing effect as a carbohydrate?

**RAY PEAT:** "Good oranges are very important. Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially is from unripe oranges. And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges, they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect. So, good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach. And coffee, the various brands vary, but coffee is always somewhat acidic. And it's much easier on the stomach if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar. And that kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it, the heavy cream?"

**CONTEXT:** What are the best ways to consume coffee and orange juice to avoid digestive issues like heartburn?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, makes it taste better and is much easier on the stomach and you absorb the caffeine more slowly."

**CONTEXT:** How does adding heavy cream to coffee affect its digestibility and caffeine absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, cheese and eggs and milk and occasional shellfish. I think the average person benefits from having liver two or three times a month because so many of the foods are unreliable for nutritional content."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on dairy products, eggs, and shellfish as part of a healthy diet?

**RAY PEAT:** "Shellfish has a lot of cholesterol, but we want to keep our cholesterol up though, right Mr. Peay?"

**CONTEXT:** Is it beneficial to maintain high cholesterol levels?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the cosmetics companies have caught on to the fact that old people's free cholesterol decreases tremendously. The skin aging is basically a cholesterol deficiency syndrome, the way Alzheimer's disease gets the fatty acid ester, which is toxic, but the real cholesterol is down by about 50% in aged skin. The cosmetics companies are building on experiments which showed that if you add cholesterol to the skin, it restores the cell function, live cells come back, the dead, flaky cells aren't produced. When there's adequate cholesterol, so they're actually adding cholesterol to the cosmetic creams and that biologically is very appropriate because the reason old people need more vitamin D is because vitamin D is made when sunlight hits the cholesterol in the skin and if you're old, the skin has only half as much cholesterol as a young person. Produce half as much vitamin D, so an old person just doesn't, they need twice as much sunlight as a young person."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cholesterol in skin aging and vitamin D production?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were studies in the US too in which people in rest homes and such, they looked at their cholesterol and checked how long they lived. 250, 260 were the longest living, it's the same idea, if you look at how much progesterone an ovary produces, it's exactly proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary, same with your adrenals and brain, any tissue, it makes it hormones. Like DHEA, pregnant alone and progesterone by converting cholesterol straight into the steroid hormone and to do that thyroid is the catalyst."

**CONTEXT:** What is the correlation between higher cholesterol levels and longevity, and how does cholesterol relate to hormone production?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a hundred and eighty is good for a middle-aged person but by the time a person is 50, according to the Framingham study, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is higher in people who are not over 200 in their cholesterol."

**CONTEXT:** What are the optimal cholesterol levels for different age groups, particularly concerning Alzheimer's disease?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, experimenters have produced aneurysms in as short a time as one hour, giving the angiotensin hormone. You produce angiotensin when the kidneys aren't getting what they need. Kidneys send out signal renin, which causes many tissues to produce angiotensin, and the angiotensin converting enzymes, the inhibitors, are used as drugs. That's one of the few drugs that has a logical basis. If you give an animal an overdose of angiotensin, it immediately damages the arteries so much that it has an aneurysm. And if you block that angiotensin, you can reverse aneurysms, simply restoring the energy to the blood vessels. And you don't produce excess angiotensin if your kidneys are getting the blood supply they need, the nourishment they need. And so a thyroid and a diet adequate and free of PUFA. It is what keeps your kidneys getting the nutrients they need so they don't raise your endotensin."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism behind strokes and aneurysms, and how do the kidneys and thyroid play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and salt is another thing that guarantees adequate blood volume perfusing the kidneys so they don't produce those toxic. Anfotensin reactants. Salt lowers your aldosterone produced by the adrenals and aldosterone works parallel to the anfotensin causing tissue degeneration. There are now drugs coming out to lower or oppose aldosterone to protect the failing heart. High aldosterone is produced by chronic deficiency of sodium in your diet, and aldosterone causes fibrosis, aging of all of the tissues, but the heart is usually the first one that shows up the effect as heart failure. So the low-sodium diet is one of the most dangerous things."

**CONTEXT:** How do salt, aldosterone, and kidney function contribute to cardiovascular health and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, even a fourth of a teaspoon is very helpful."

**CONTEXT:** Is a small amount of salt beneficial for sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, sometimes 20, 30 years ago I drank a gallon a day."

**CONTEXT:** Do you still consume a large quantity of milk daily?

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with grains and leaves is that the plants produce these defensive toxins. And if a cow ate those and didn't process them in some way, the cow would succumb to all of those toxins. But the cow has an extra stomach that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast process out those toxins. So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process. Before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids and sugars into the blood, the plant material has been very detoxified. So you're getting all of those nutrients multiply filtered before it gets into the bloodstream. From the bloodstream to the udder, it's filtered again. So it's the most highly refined food that we can get economically."

**CONTEXT:** What makes milk such a highly refined and beneficial food source?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but even low-fat pasteurized milk is still the best food available, even if it isn't. Organic and raw."

**CONTEXT:** Is pasteurized milk still a beneficial food source, even if not organic or raw?

**RAY PEAT:** "The high polyunsaturated is the main problem. There are some good components but some bad. Most people who use the flaxseed as a laxative or bulk are absorbing very little of the substance. So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay. You aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff."

**CONTEXT:** What are the negative effects of flaxseeds, and how does their consumption as a fiber source impact absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some people do very well, others get more constipated with it, so you have to try out the fiber. Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people. Well-cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people. Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years, but then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots apparently."

**CONTEXT:** What are some safe and effective fiber sources, and how can individual responses vary?

**RAY PEAT:** "Only in the most superficial sense. Before it has penetrated to the dentine, the proteins of the enamel can capture calcium from the environment. And reconstitute the seal. But once it has entered the dentine, then it should be treated with a filling of some sort."

**CONTEXT:** Is it possible to regrow tooth enamel, and what are the limitations?

**RAY PEAT:** "No. No? Doesn't do it."

**CONTEXT:** Does lemon juice help break down anti-digestive toxins in raw greens?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, raw eggs are nutritionally very, very good. They have an antiviral effect in the intestine, the fresh form. But cooked, they're extremely nutritious except for the cumulative effect of the pufa."

**CONTEXT:** Are there nutritional differences between raw and cooked eggs, and what is the impact of PUFAs on cooked eggs?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, you mean it just depends on their diet, and you've got to be really careful about that."

**CONTEXT:** Does the diet of the chicken affect the nutritional quality and PUFA content of its eggs?

**RAY PEAT:** "One more thing to validate the DHA thing is that a salmon is lucky, it's a high DHA, and it's lucky if it lasts to 9 years. An orange ruffy is the lowest fish of all in DHA, and it lives to 149 years."

**CONTEXT:** How does DHA content in fish relate to their lifespan, using salmon and orange ruffy as examples?

**RAY PEAT:** "When they feed fish, fish oil, they lose endurance and age quickly."

**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of feeding fish oil to fish?

**RAY PEAT:** "The southern fish around the equator have the least PUFA."

**CONTEXT:** Which types of fish have the lowest PUFA content?

**RAY PEAT:** "They are still pretty high in PUFA, but you pretty much have to live in the region to get the warm water fish."

**CONTEXT:** Are low-fat fish like cod and sole also high in PUFA?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, lots. There are about 100 articles there on all the subjects we've talked about."

**CONTEXT:** What kind of information can be found on your website, raypeat.com?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, every two months now. It's $28 for two years."

**CONTEXT:** How often is your newsletter published, and what is the subscription cost?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I haven't been to a doctor, so I don't really know. 50 years without seeing one."

**CONTEXT:** Have you seen a doctor in the last 50 years?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, there are some of my pictures from 20 years ago up on my website."

**CONTEXT:** Do you have any artistic endeavors, such as painting?

**RAY PEAT:** "The thyroid is really the source of acid. There you go, back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen is named means the source of acid. And thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid. And that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic. And the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production to produce the hydrochloric acid."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence stomach acid production?

**RAY PEAT:** "Inability to use oxygen and thyroid increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation. And so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion including the acid."

**CONTEXT:** How do PUFA and heavy metal accumulation affect thyroid function and digestion with age?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. By the tests that were used up to 1940, easily 40 percent of the American population is hypothyroid. Just by the medical standards up to 1940, then the drug companies got involved, sold their phony tests, like the protein......bound iodine tests, in the late 1940s, convinced everyone who had been taking the thyroid, they showed normal on that test, and so they stopped taking the thyroid. Doctors taught everyone that the reason they're fat and lethargic is because of their bad character, rather than low thyroid, because the test showed they were normal. Twenty years later, that test was shown to be absolutely unrelated to thyroid function. So for 20 years, people were indoctrinated to believe that 95% of the population has good thyroid function, where it was a phony test. But on the basis of that belief, that only 5% might be hypothyroid, the new test, TSH, is meaningfully related to thyroid, although ambiguously, but those new tests were interpreted in terms of the 95% not needing thyroid. So, no matter how good a test it is, if your assumptions are wrong, the test isn't going to do you any good."

**CONTEXT:** What is the history of thyroid testing, and how have changes in testing methodologies and assumptions affected the diagnosis of hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** "No. No? Over the years, it's likely to make it worse. Oh, good. Iodized salt is usually, around the world, where they have iodized the salt, they see increased thyroid gland degenerative conditions, increased nodules, inflammation. Hashimoto's diseases and so on. You can produce it by just a moderately excess of iodine. So you're not, I take it then, you're not a supporter of taking supplemental iodine at all?"

**CONTEXT:** What are your views on supplemental iodine, and does it help thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Seafood, once a week, eating seafood gives you all the iodine you can use. And again you said the low fat, I've written it down, but the low fat fish are cod and sole?"

**CONTEXT:** What are good sources of iodine, and which low-fat fish are recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "It contains Pregnenolone and a small supplement of Pregnenolone if you can find a safe source, which I can't. But Pregnenolone used to be a good reliable support for adrenal problems. But it's hard, you can't find a clean one, Mr. Pete?"

**CONTEXT:** Are there any safe and effective adrenal supplements, and what are the challenges in finding them?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everyone is tending, women get breast pain or uterine cramps from it, which means it's probably contaminated with estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential side effects of pregnenolone supplementation, and what might cause them?

**RAY PEAT:** "A protein is okay. The hemp protein? Yeah, but you have the seed protein problem. It should be properly processed. Lime processing would make it more digestible. But the oils are highly unsaturated, so I think it's good to be very cautious with them. They're proofers."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on hemp protein and hemp oils?

**RAY PEAT:** "The high polyunsaturated is the main problem. There are some good components but some bad. Most people who use the flaxseed as a laxative or bulk are absorbing very little of the substance. So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay. You aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff."

**CONTEXT:** What are the negative effects of flaxseeds, and how does their consumption as a fiber source impact absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some people do very well, others get more constipated with it, so you have to try out the fiber. Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people. Well-cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people. Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years, but then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots apparently."

**CONTEXT:** What are some safe and effective fiber sources, and how can individual responses vary?

**RAY PEAT:** "The combination of low-thyroid and slow digestion will cause various inflammatory degenerative processes. And when you're low-thyroid, you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones. And so if your cholesterol is very high, that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA. And I've seen people supplement like a woman came visiting from Sweden. To give lectures in Eugene and she had had, I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because all of her joints were getting so deformed. She spread progesterone over all of her body and spent three days in Eugene. I was walking around seeing the sights with absolutely no joint pain."

**CONTEXT:** How do low thyroid and slow digestion contribute to inflammatory and degenerative processes, and what is the role of cholesterol and protective hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** "People have experimented with that, experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement. Watching what is happening with the glands output, they would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing. And then they would stop the dosing and measure the return, and it's almost immediate. I've seen people who could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose. Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been. So I stopped taking it. The very next morning my neck was smooth. The gland had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces. So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed."

**CONTEXT:** What happens to the thyroid gland when taking high doses of thyroid supplements, and how quickly does it recover when supplementation stops?

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate our sugar because calcium regulates everything and and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid and people sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient but vitamin D, part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone when you're low in calcium and vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher. And that causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2,000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of Vitamin D and calcium in thyroid function and overall health, particularly in relation to bone health and mood?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50. Your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10am to 2pm in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure in 30 minutes. You can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right?"

**CONTEXT:** How does age affect the body's ability to synthesize Vitamin D from sunlight, and what are the optimal times and methods for sun exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** "Enough good sugar in the diet. That's why I recommend orange juice. A quarter or two of orange juice is very supportive to your thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors are supportive of thyroid function, and why is orange juice recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there are advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the public perception and marketing of salt and sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there is a lot to that, but the particular practitioners, I think, drove it into the ground by trying to sell their particular treatments. But yeah, there are various alternative forms. And it relates to a bigger question. We actually have pleomorphic stem cells in our tissues, which are pleomorphic in the sense that they are pluripotent. They can develop into what we need unless we're poisoning them with pufa and heavy metals and radiation. And our tissues should be able to change form as needed. And incidentally, when you eat a particular food like beef or chicken or fruit, you are absorbing and integrating some of their DNA into your own structure, and that increases, I think, in the long run, our capacity to produce the changes that we need. We have only about 5% of our DNA is really in use, and we have that big reserve that we can draw on under stress."

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on pleomorphism, and how does it relate to cellular adaptability and DNA integration?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's, again, the adrenaline."

**CONTEXT:** What is the likely cause of slight teeth chattering at night, not related to cold?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the adrenaline. Yeah, and sugar and salt and calcium, milk and vitamin D are behind the thyroid function to keep your blood sugar steady."

**CONTEXT:** How do adrenaline, sugar, salt, calcium, milk, and vitamin D interact to regulate blood sugar and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it is."

**CONTEXT:** So, you believe adrenaline is the cause of the teeth chattering?

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, you could eat fungal enzymes to break down cellulose and such, but the problem is that you get traces of the fungus along with the enzymes. So I think it's better to try to not break down cellulose in your intestine. The cellulose is having a good function to sort of sweep things along, help them not be reabsorbed. Your liver excretes toxins into the bile, and if you have fiber moving through your intestine, that will prevent that toxin being reabsorbed so you can excrete it."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cellulose in the digestive system, and are fungal enzymes a safe way to break it down?

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, you know, the thyroid... is really the source of acid. There you go, back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen is named... means the source of acid. And thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid. And that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic. And the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production to produce the hydrochloric acid."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function relate to stomach acid production and cellular acidity?

**RAY PEAT:** "Inability to use oxygen and thyroid increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation. And so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion including the acid."

**CONTEXT:** How do PUFA and heavy metal accumulation affect thyroid function and digestion with age?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. So, if we take supplemental iodine, Lugol's or detoxified the Edgar Cayce thing, does that help the thyroid function?"

**CONTEXT:** Does supplemental iodine, such as Lugol's or detoxified iodine, help thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "No. No? Over the years, it's likely to make it worse. Oh, good. Iodized salt is usually, around the world, where they have iodized the salt, they see increased thyroid gland degenerative conditions, increased nodules, inflammation. Hashimoto's diseases and so on.

Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been. So I stopped taking it. The very next morning my neck was smooth. The gland had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces. So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed."

**CONTEXT:** What happens to the thyroid gland when taking high doses of thyroid supplements, and how quickly does it recover when supplementation stops?

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate our sugar because calcium regulates everything and and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid and people sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient but vitamin D, part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone when you're low in calcium and vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher. And that causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2,000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of Vitamin D and calcium in thyroid function and overall health, particularly in relation to bone health and mood?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50. Your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10am to 2pm in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure in 30 minutes. You can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right?"

**CONTEXT:** How does age affect the body's ability to synthesize Vitamin D from sunlight, and what are the optimal times and methods for sun exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** "Enough good sugar in the diet. That's why I recommend orange juice. A quarter or two of orange juice is very supportive to your thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors are supportive of thyroid function, and why is orange juice recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there are advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the public perception and marketing of salt and sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there is a lot to that, but the particular practitioners, I think, drove it into the ground by trying to sell their particular treatments. But yeah, there are various alternative forms. And it relates to a bigger question. We actually have pleomorphic stem cells in our tissues, which are pleomorphic in the sense that they are pluripotent. They can develop into what we need unless we're poisoning them with pufa and heavy metals and radiation. And our tissues should be able to change form as needed. And incidentally, when you eat a particular food like beef or chicken or fruit, you are absorbing and integrating some of their DNA into your own structure, and that increases, I think, in the long run, our capacity to produce the changes that we need. We have only about 5% of our DNA is really in use, and we have that big reserve that we can draw on under stress."

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on pleomorphism, and how does it relate to cellular adaptability and DNA integration?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's, again, the adrenaline."

**CONTEXT:** What is the likely cause of slight teeth chattering at night, not related to cold?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the adrenaline. Yeah, and sugar and salt and calcium, milk and vitamin D are behind the thyroid function to keep your blood sugar steady."

**CONTEXT:** How do adrenaline, sugar, salt, calcium, milk, and vitamin D interact to regulate blood sugar and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it is."

**CONTEXT:** So, you believe adrenaline is the cause of the teeth chattering?

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, you could eat fungal enzymes to break down cellulose and such, but the problem is that you get traces of the fungus along with the enzymes. So I think it's better to try to not break down cellulose in your intestine. The cellulose is having a good function to sort of sweep things along, help them not be reabsorbed. Your liver excretes toxins into the bile, and if you have fiber moving through your intestine, that will prevent that toxin being reabsorbed so you can excrete it."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cellulose in the digestive system, and are fungal enzymes a safe way to break it down?

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, you know, the thyroid... is really the source of acid. There you go, back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen is named... means the source of acid. And thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid. And that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic. And the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production to produce the hydrochloric acid."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence stomach acid production and cellular acidity?

**RAY PEAT:** "Inability to use oxygen and thyroid increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation. And so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion including the acid."

**CONTEXT:** How do PUFA and heavy metal accumulation affect thyroid function and digestion with age?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. By the tests that were used up to 1940, easily 40 percent of the American population is hypothyroid. Just by the medical standards up to 1940, then the drug companies got involved, sold their phony tests, like the protein......bound iodine tests, in the late 1940s, convinced everyone who had been taking the thyroid, they showed normal on that test, and so they stopped taking the thyroid. Doctors taught everyone that the reason they're fat and lethargic is because of their bad character, rather than low thyroid, because the test showed they were normal. Twenty years later, that test was shown to be absolutely unrelated to thyroid function. So for 20 years, people were indoctrinated to believe that 95% of the population has good thyroid function, where it was a phony test. But on the basis of that belief, that only 5% might be hypothyroid, the new test, TSH, is meaningfully related to thyroid, although ambiguously, but those new tests were interpreted in terms of the 95% not needing thyroid. So, no matter how good a test it is, if your assumptions are wrong, the test isn't going to do you any good."

**CONTEXT:** What is the history of thyroid testing, and how have changes in testing methodologies and assumptions affected the diagnosis of hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** "No. No? Over the years, it's likely to make it worse. Oh, good. Iodized salt is usually, around the world, where they have iodized the salt, they see increased thyroid gland degenerative conditions, increased nodules, inflammation. Hashimoto's diseases and so on. You can produce it by just a moderately excess of iodine. So you're not, I take it then, you're not a supporter of taking supplemental iodine at all?"

**CONTEXT:** What are your views on supplemental iodine, and does it help thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Seafood, once a week, eating seafood gives you all the iodine you can use. And again you said the low fat, I've written it down, but the low fat fish are cod and sole?"

**CONTEXT:** What are good sources of iodine, and which low-fat fish are recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "It contains Pregnenolone and a small supplement of Pregnenolone if you can find a safe source, which I can't. But Pregnenolone used to be a good reliable support for adrenal problems. But it's hard, you can't find a clean one, Mr. Pete?"

**CONTEXT:** Are there any safe and effective adrenal supplements, and what are the challenges in finding them?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everyone is tending, women get breast pain or uterine cramps from it, which means it's probably contaminated with estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential side effects of pregnenolone supplementation, and what might cause them?

**RAY PEAT:** "A protein is okay. The hemp protein? Yeah, but you have the seed protein problem. It should be properly processed. Lime processing would make it more digestible. But the oils are highly unsaturated, so I think it's good to be very cautious with them. They're proofers."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on hemp protein and hemp oils?

**RAY PEAT:** "The high polyunsaturated is the main problem. There are some good components but some bad. Most people who use the flaxseed as a laxative or bulk are absorbing very little of the substance. So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay. You aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff."

**CONTEXT:** What are the negative effects of flaxseeds, and how does their consumption as a fiber source impact absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some people do very well, others get more constipated with it, so you have to try out the fiber. Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people. Well-cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people. Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years, but then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots apparently."

**CONTEXT:** What are some safe and effective fiber sources, and how can individual responses vary?

**RAY PEAT:** "The combination of low-thyroid and slow digestion will cause various inflammatory degenerative processes. And when you're low-thyroid, you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones. And so if your cholesterol is very high, that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA. And I've seen people supplement like a woman came visiting from Sweden. To give lectures in Eugene and she had had, I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because all of her joints were getting so deformed. She spread progesterone over all of her body and spent three days in Eugene. I was walking around seeing the sights with absolutely no joint pain."

**CONTEXT:** How do low thyroid and slow digestion contribute to inflammatory and degenerative processes, and what is the role of cholesterol and protective hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** "People have experimented with that, experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement. Watching what is happening with the glands output, they would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing. And then they would stop the dosing and measure the return, and it's almost immediate. I've seen people who could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose.

**CONTEXT:** What is the likely cause of slight teeth chattering at night, not related to cold?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the adrenaline. Yeah, and sugar and salt and calcium, milk and vitamin D are behind the thyroid function to keep your blood sugar steady."

**CONTEXT:** How do adrenaline, sugar, salt, calcium, milk, and vitamin D interact to regulate blood sugar and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it is."

**CONTEXT:** So, you believe adrenaline is the cause of the teeth chattering?

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, you could eat fungal enzymes to break down cellulose and such, but the problem is that you get traces of the fungus along with the enzymes. So I think it's better to try to not break down cellulose in your intestine. The cellulose is having a good function to sort of sweep things along, help them not be reabsorbed. Your liver excretes toxins into the bile, and if you have fiber moving through your intestine, that will prevent that toxin being reabsorbed so you can excrete it."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cellulose in the digestive system, and are fungal enzymes a safe way to break it down?

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, you know, the thyroid... is really the source of acid. There you go, back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen is named... means the source of acid. And thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid. And that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic. And the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production to produce the hydrochloric acid."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence stomach acid production and cellular acidity?

**RAY PEAT:** "Inability to use oxygen and thyroid increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation. And so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion including the acid."

**CONTEXT:** How do PUFA and heavy metal accumulation affect thyroid function and digestion with age?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. By the tests that were used up to 1940, easily 40 percent of the American population is hypothyroid. Just by the medical standards up to 1940, then the drug companies got involved, sold their phony tests, like the protein......bound iodine tests, in the late 1940s, convinced everyone who had been taking the thyroid, they showed normal on that test, and so they stopped taking the thyroid. Doctors taught everyone that the reason they're fat and lethargic is because of their bad character, rather than low thyroid, because the test showed they were normal. Twenty years later, that test was shown to be absolutely unrelated to thyroid function. So for 20 years, people were indoctrinated to believe that 95% of the population has good thyroid function, where it was a phony test. But on the basis of that belief, that only 5% might be hypothyroid, the new test, TSH, is meaningfully related to thyroid, although ambiguously, but those new tests were interpreted in terms of the 95% not needing thyroid. So, no matter how good a test it is, if your assumptions are wrong, the test isn't going to do you any good."

**CONTEXT:** What is the history of thyroid testing, and how have changes in testing methodologies and assumptions affected the diagnosis of hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** "No. No? Over the years, it's likely to make it worse. Oh, good. Iodized salt is usually, around the world, where they have iodized the salt, they see increased thyroid gland degenerative conditions, increased nodules, inflammation. Hashimoto's diseases and so on. You can produce it by just a moderately excess of iodine. So you're not, I take it then, you're not a supporter of taking supplemental iodine at all?"

**CONTEXT:** What are your views on supplemental iodine, and does it help thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Seafood, once a week, eating seafood gives you all the iodine you can use. And again you said the low fat, I've written it down, but the low fat fish are cod and sole?"

**CONTEXT:** What are good sources of iodine, and which low-fat fish are recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "It contains Pregnenolone and a small supplement of Pregnenolone if you can find a safe source, which I can't. But Pregnenolone used to be a good reliable support for adrenal problems. But it's hard, you can't find a clean one, Mr. Pete?"

**CONTEXT:** Are there any safe and effective adrenal supplements, and what are the challenges in finding them?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everyone is tending, women get breast pain or uterine cramps from it, which means it's probably contaminated with estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential side effects of pregnenolone supplementation, and what might cause them?

**RAY PEAT:** "A protein is okay. The hemp protein? Yeah, but you have the seed protein problem. It should be properly processed. Lime processing would make it more digestible. But the oils are highly unsaturated, so I think it's good to be very cautious with them. They're proofers."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on hemp protein and hemp oils?

**RAY PEAT:** "The high polyunsaturated is the main problem. There are some good components but some bad. Most people who use the flaxseed as a laxative or bulk are absorbing very little of the substance. So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay. You aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff."

**CONTEXT:** What are the negative effects of flaxseeds, and how does their consumption as a fiber source impact absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some people do very well, others get more constipated with it, so you have to try out the fiber. Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people. Well-cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people. Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years, but then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots apparently."

**CONTEXT:** What are some safe and effective fiber sources, and how can individual responses vary?

**RAY PEAT:** "The combination of low-thyroid and slow digestion will cause various inflammatory degenerative processes. And when you're low-thyroid, you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones. And so if your cholesterol is very high, that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA. And I've seen people supplement like a woman came visiting from Sweden. To give lectures in Eugene and she had had, I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because all of her joints were getting so deformed. She spread progesterone over all of her body and spent three days in Eugene. I was walking around seeing the sights with absolutely no joint pain."

**CONTEXT:** How do low thyroid and slow digestion contribute to inflammatory and degenerative processes, and what is the role of cholesterol and protective hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** "People have experimented with that, experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement. Watching what is happening with the glands output, they would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing. And then they would stop the dosing and measure the return, and it's almost immediate. I've seen people who could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose. Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been. So I stopped taking it. The very next morning my neck was smooth. The gland had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces. So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed."

**CONTEXT:** What happens to the thyroid gland when taking high doses of thyroid supplements, and how quickly does it recover when supplementation stops?

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate our sugar because calcium regulates everything and and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid and people sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient but vitamin D, part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone when you're low in calcium and vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher. And that causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2,000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of Vitamin D and calcium in thyroid function and overall health, particularly in relation to bone health and mood?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50. Your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10am to 2pm in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure in 30 minutes. You can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right?"

**CONTEXT:** How does age affect the body's ability to synthesize Vitamin D from sunlight, and what are the optimal times and methods for sun exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** "Enough good sugar in the diet. That's why I recommend orange juice. A quarter or two of orange juice is very supportive to your thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors are supportive of thyroid function, and why is orange juice recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there are advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the public perception and marketing of salt and sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there is a lot to that, but the particular practitioners, I think, drove it into the ground by trying to sell their particular treatments. But yeah, there are various alternative forms. And it relates to a bigger question. We actually have pleomorphic stem cells in our tissues, which are pleomorphic in the sense that they are pluripotent. They can develop into what we need unless we're poisoning them with pufa and heavy metals and radiation. And our tissues should be able to change form as needed. And incidentally, when you eat a particular food like beef or chicken or fruit, you are absorbing and integrating some of their DNA into your own structure, and that increases, I think, in the long run, our capacity to produce the changes that we need. We have only about 5% of our DNA is really in use, and we have that big reserve that we can draw on under stress."

Iodized salt is usually, around the world, where they have iodized the salt, they see increased thyroid gland degenerative conditions, increased nodules, inflammation. Hashimoto's diseases and so on. You can produce it by just a moderately excess of iodine. So you're not, I take it then, you're not a supporter of taking supplemental iodine at all?"

**CONTEXT:** What are your views on supplemental iodine, and does it help thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Seafood, once a week, eating seafood gives you all the iodine you can use. And again you said the low fat, I've written it down, but the low fat fish are cod and sole?"

**CONTEXT:** What are good sources of iodine, and which low-fat fish are recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "It contains Pregnenolone and a small supplement of Pregnenolone if you can find a safe source, which I can't. But Pregnenolone used to be a good reliable support for adrenal problems. But it's hard, you can't find a clean one, Mr. Pete?"

**CONTEXT:** Are there any safe and effective adrenal supplements, and what are the challenges in finding them?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everyone is tending, women get breast pain or uterine cramps from it, which means it's probably contaminated with estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential side effects of pregnenolone supplementation, and what might cause them?

**RAY PEAT:** "A protein is okay. The hemp protein? Yeah, but you have the seed protein problem. It should be properly processed. Lime processing would make it more digestible. But the oils are highly unsaturated, so I think it's good to be very cautious with them. They're proofers."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on hemp protein and hemp oils?

**RAY PEAT:** "The high polyunsaturated is the main problem. There are some good components but some bad. Most people who use the flaxseed as a laxative or bulk are absorbing very little of the substance. So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay. You aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff."

**CONTEXT:** What are the negative effects of flaxseeds, and how does their consumption as a fiber source impact absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some people do very well, others get more constipated with it, so you have to try out the fiber. Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people. Well-cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people. Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years, but then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots apparently."

**CONTEXT:** What are some safe and effective fiber sources, and how can individual responses vary?

**RAY PEAT:** "The combination of low-thyroid and slow digestion will cause various inflammatory degenerative processes. And when you're low-thyroid, you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones. And so if your cholesterol is very high, that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA. And I've seen people supplement like a woman came visiting from Sweden. To give lectures in Eugene and she had had, I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because all of her joints were getting so deformed. She spread progesterone over all of her body and spent three days in Eugene. I was walking around seeing the sights with absolutely no joint pain."

**CONTEXT:** How do low thyroid and slow digestion contribute to inflammatory and degenerative processes, and what is the role of cholesterol and protective hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** "People have experimented with that, experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement. Watching what is happening with the glands output, they would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing. And then they would stop the dosing and measure the return, and it's almost immediate. I've seen people who could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose. Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been. So I stopped taking it. The very next morning my neck was smooth. The gland had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces. So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed."

**CONTEXT:** What happens to the thyroid gland when taking high doses of thyroid supplements, and how quickly does it recover when supplementation stops?

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate our sugar because calcium regulates everything and and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid and people sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient but vitamin D, part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone when you're low in calcium and vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher. And that causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2,000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of Vitamin D and calcium in thyroid function and overall health, particularly in relation to bone health and mood?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50. Your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10am to 2pm in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure in 30 minutes. You can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right?"

**CONTEXT:** How does age affect the body's ability to synthesize Vitamin D from sunlight, and what are the optimal times and methods for sun exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** "Enough good sugar in the diet. That's why I recommend orange juice. A quarter or two of orange juice is very supportive to your thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors are supportive of thyroid function, and why is orange juice recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there are advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the public perception and marketing of salt and sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there is a lot to that, but the particular practitioners, I think, drove it into the ground by trying to sell their particular treatments. But yeah, there are various alternative forms. And it relates to a bigger question. We actually have pleomorphic stem cells in our tissues, which are pleomorphic in the sense that they are pluripotent. They can develop into what we need unless we're poisoning them with pufa and heavy metals and radiation. And our tissues should be able to change form as needed. And incidentally, when you eat a particular food like beef or chicken or fruit, you are absorbing and integrating some of their DNA into your own structure, and that increases, I think, in the long run, our capacity to produce the changes that we need. We have only about 5% of our DNA is really in use, and we have that big reserve that we can draw on under stress."

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on pleomorphism, and how does it relate to cellular adaptability and DNA integration?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's, again, the adrenaline."

**CONTEXT:** What is the likely cause of slight teeth chattering at night, not related to cold?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the adrenaline. Yeah, and sugar and salt and calcium, milk and vitamin D are behind the thyroid function to keep your blood sugar steady."

**CONTEXT:** How do adrenaline, sugar
