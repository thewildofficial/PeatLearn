**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it is. It lacks engineering design right from the start. It could have been designed more stably. Odd things turn up, like at one point someone discovered that the whole thing when it was integrated resonated and tended to be interrupted just by resonating with the Earth's resonance frequency in the solar wind. What they had done was create a huge antenna across the country in the power grid that was being interfered with just by the streaming energy from the sun that makes the Earth ring at a certain frequency."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the fragility of the power grid and its susceptibility to external influences.

**RAY PEAT:** "They were also studying the effects of that. I think it was 11 cycles per second that it started vibrating at, and that tends to drive. The solar wind, apparently, is what drives that basic brain rhythm in humans, and so the experiment had put people in a cage where they could keep out those natural oscillations and subject the brain to an artificial field with varying frequencies. They gradually slowed the vibration frequency below 10 or 11 cycles, down around 7 or 8 cycles. The brain rhythm being artificially driven slower, the people all got feeling sick and disoriented. So our normal consciousness according, I think that was either an FBI or NASA study, it showed that our normal consciousness is based on resonance with the earth cavity."

**CONTEXT:** The host inquires about the effects of these frequencies on humans, referencing a study.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, right through the earth and the air. So when you're in a house with wiring, you get some of it imposed from the sun and the earth, but you're mainly being subjected to 60 cycles a second in the house."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the vibrations are transmitted through household wiring.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I haven't heard that. But both of them are unnatural. I used to like the area where I have a house in Mexico. The University of Mexico built a stellar radio antenna there because it was so free of artificial radiation. It was just a few miles from my house. But now I don't suppose the radio antenna is very good anymore because of the cell phone towers that have invaded the area."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if 60 cycles are more difficult for the body to handle than 50 cycles.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, my health always improved, even my eyesight."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the host felt healthier in the area with less artificial radiation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but the world health, especially Europe and the United States, the health and lifespan are decreasing rapidly in recent years."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the general health trends in developed countries.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, no, the CDC matches other sources that the actual lifespan average is shortening the last three or four years and the documented rate of allergies, autoimmune diseases, degenerative diseases in young people has skyrocketed in the last 40 years, 30 years."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the decreasing lifespan is factual or "fake news."

**RAY PEAT:** "The bad foods, polyunsaturated fats and vaccinations, and another big cause is the nanoparticles that are being used in food industry, clothing, soap and shampoos, constantly exposure to this microscopic junk that goes right into our cells and turns on inflammatory processes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat what he attributes the decline in health to.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the industry talks about the great value of, they say, targeting drugs into cells. I think that's all phony, absolute phoniness. They sell ways to, for example, target extraneous DNA to do genetic engineering or gene therapy. But when someone was doing a control using those commercial targeting agents, they did a control using plain, untreated DNA along with those chemical targeting agents, and they found the crude DNA went into the cells better than the commercial, supposedly useful material."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there is any beneficial aspect to nanotechnology.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the particle size is the important thing for this substance. Chemistry doesn't matter as much as the size of the particle. And in a certain, very small particle range, it... signals activation of the inflammatory process and turns on the cytokines that turn on other inflammatory cascades. And so if you're on the edge of slight metabolic fatigue or weakness, then those things can really activate a process like lung inflammation, bowel inflammation, changes in the brain and all of the tissues."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effects of nanoparticles in consumer products on cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think we have a very inefficient way to get these tiny things out. But to the extent that white blood cells can detect and remove them, because they enter into nerve cells. Blood vessel walls, right into the cell, is not obvious to the white blood cells whether they need to be removed right away. It can start a very slow, chronic process. But when the white blood cells can catch them, then I think the white blood cells can degenerate in a way that lets them be excreted either through the bowel or the kidney."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about methods to remove nanoparticles from the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, people used to put a silver coin in the swimming pool. Copper is very similar, so that you didn't have to use chemicals to keep down the algae growth. Just a very small amount of, like if you don't have a water purifier, putting a silver coin in your water and letting it stand has a strong germicidal effect."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions nano silver in food products and asks about its use in swimming pools.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's the trouble. If people get carried away with it, it can damage the tissues. When I was in my teens, I knew a woman who always wore a veil and gloves. Because she had been treated with silver, and it turned her skin a horrible purple color."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the colloidal silver craze and its potential side effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, oh sure, if you have a silver cup or silver spoon, that's the idea. It's extremely germicidal. Germicidal. Ayurvedic medicine likes this idea of putting water in a real authentic copper cup and drinking some of that every day."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the historical use of silver and copper for germicidal purposes.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's safe."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if drinking water from a copper cup is useful or viable.

**RAY PEAT:** "Absolutely right, I agree with it. But have you seen the videos of Zack Bush? I've heard about it, I have not seen Zack's videos. What's his argument, Dr. Pete? His argument is exactly the opposite, but his purpose is just as good. All of them are arguing that there's nothing to panic about. And that's my position, that there has been nothing unusual happening this last year. It's all made up fear. Lawyers are suing the government, asking them, where's the evidence for all of this fear? So far, the courts haven't forced them to give up the evidence of why it's so dangerous. So I don't believe there really is any unique thing in history. It's just the annual fluctuations of influenza and colds."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat for his opinion on the germ theory arguments presented by Cowan and Kaufman, and also mentions Zach Bush's opposing viewpoint.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, when a person takes a chemistry lab in school, they have to go through the whole lab. You learn to identify chemicals with great precision, that's the purpose of the techniques. But you don't have to purify things to identify them. And that's, I think, the crux of their argument. It's based on the mistaken idea that you have to have absolute purity to know something exists. But when they talk about pure chemical reagents, even those are, every smallest bit that you analyze, it's going to have some atoms and molecules of other substances. You don't have to purify chemicals to identify them with certainty."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat has seen a "pure, real isolation" of viruses, referencing the argument that viruses have never been properly isolated.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because it's not a living substance. You should categorize it as a biological chemical. Like insulin is a chemical. And bits of short pieces of RNA, just 5 or 10 base units, they work like chemicals. They can be catalytic and so on. So if it isn't self-sustaining like a protozoan or a bacteria, as all of the features of life, if it isn't self-sustaining, you have to describe it as a non-living chemical substance, even though complex."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a virus is a chemical, given the argument that they are not truly isolated.

**RAY PEAT:** "But I think the problem comes in not looking at the actual nature of what is a virus. How could that complex chemical come into existence if it can only be multiplied in an organism, like the bacteriophage or the plant viruses? They're easy to get in a fairly pure form. Not absolutely pure, but enough that everyone, even a beginner, can make electron micrographs showing these things. With the small viruses, the electron microscope pictures are always muddy and a matter of judgment. If you see a majority of particles that are all approximately the same size and shape, then you suspect that it's something. But the evidence for even these small viruses is much better than things like the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, and so on. There are pictures of them, but not everyone is convinced that they exist. With viruses, the evidence is about a thousand times better than those other things. It's good to be skeptical, because it isn't as absolute, clean knowledge as a lot of chemical tests can achieve."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the origin of complex chemicals like viruses if they can only be multiplied within an organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I'm a critic of the so-called germ theory that gives causality to the germ, because healthy people are not subject to getting sick from germs. So the great weakness of the germ theory is that you need a particular receptive host for the germ. And if you just eat well, are relatively sanitary, and get your vitamin D in sunlight and so on. Then you don't worry about these viral or bacterial or fungal diseases."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat believes the germ theory is correct and that viruses are transmitted.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, Zach Bush I think is right that you can find viruses on Antarctic ice and snow, they're blowing everywhere. But I think their actual nature, many biologists just don't like to touch the question because how do you get this complex bit of DNA or RNA floating around capable of being adopted and participating in an infection. I think there's enough evidence now going back more than 50 years that there is horizontal transmission of nucleic acids going on constantly even before DNA was identified as the basic genetic material. People were seeing evidence of transmission of genetic information across extremely different biological types from plants to animals, algae to protozoa to humans and so on. And genetic engineering, I mentioned that as a control some experimenters injected absolutely simple DNA strands and cells without treatment, cells simply took up that massive molecule right through their so-called membrane and integrated it into their own genes. And a group at Harvard and MIT recently demonstrated that the mRNA virus strip that's used in the vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine, that that virus added to a human tissue, human cell culture can be replicated by the cells as virus people intend, but it can also be copied into DNA and integrated into the cell's genome, which is specifically what Fauci says can't happen because he studied genetics to the extent that he did in the 1960s before retroviruses were conceived as a possibility. So he says, no, it can't happen, foreign DNA can't be integrated into our genome. But it turns out that a huge part of our genetic material comes from outside material, including virus-like particles. But when you look at the horizontal transmission of genetic information, you can see that people who have drunk water contaminated with an algae, the algae DNA has been found inside their brain cells and other body cells, and experimenters with food find that a certain amount of the DNA in food finds its way into our cells. And when you wonder how it is that this DNA is wandering around from species to species, bacteria have specifically engineered a way so that they can, if they are starving for a certain nutrient, they can mutate their genes over a period of a couple of days so that they can digest and assimilate a different nutrient. They can adapt and create new genes, and if they're exposed to a poison like an antibiotic, they can mutate and become resistant to that, and they can pack that information that's useful to them into a packet and transmit it to other bacteria of their own species or even of different species, and that has been studied so well in bacteria, it's only starting to be studied, it actually began in the 1960s, but there are people who continue to study the transmission from one part of our body to another, the nucleic acids, but also from one organism to another, and apparently as the bacteria naturally do that as part of their living properties, probably every organism has that ability to share genetic information, and just for our internal repair and maintenance system, in the last 15 or 20 years, people are accepting that the exosomes, particles just about the size of viruses, are circulating in all of our body fluids, carrying information, even a cancer cell can put out exosomes that induce cancer in other parts of the body, so it's not always just a repair process, but can be a disease-spreading process within the body, and so if those things are constantly being put into our human milk and urine, for example, bacteria are being exposed to these exosomes, and bacteria can assimilate human DNA, and the same way humans can assimilate bacterial DNA, human DNA can get into the bacteria and yeast, and so just through the urine, for example, we're putting our DNA constantly into the environment for bacteria and fungus, and other organisms can pick it up, and then when those organisms, bacteria especially, are picked up and carried around by other organisms, then that human fragment of DNA that we emitted is then available to the new recipient via the fungus or bacteria, so all of the means of transmission of exosomes are known, and so exactly the point that Cowan and Kaufman are making is that degenerated cells transmit sickness, among other things, new abilities, but also new sicknesses if the transmitter was sick, so what they're saying is right, that they are probably derived from other animals and sick people, but still it's not a crime to call them viruses because they can be transported around by bacteria and fungus and whatever."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on the transmission of genetic information and the nature of viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, no, the same with chemicals, we're confident that we know. How a chemical reacts and even what shape it has and weight and so on, without isolating it just by identifying how it behaves and reacts. The same with everything in the world, you don't have to, you know, many things exist with great confidence, but you don't necessarily have to have seen it in isolation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the argument that if something isn't truly isolated, then you don't know what you're dealing with, is valid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, it's the same with causation. It's a matter of judgment and probability, and causality. You always need a relatively susceptible and sick person to cause sickness in them. A very tough, healthy person can undergo tremendous threats, eating dirt and bathing in filth, and still they're absolutely healthy."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the gray area of proving causation, especially with factors like antibiotics or monkey kidneys in petri dishes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I absolutely agree with that overall purpose, that don't make a virus a magical thing, because then, crux in the government, ignorant people like Fauci with knowledge that wasn't good. 60 years ago, we'll make proclamations about what the virus is going to do, it's all fantasy nonsense and lies. And it's in that theory, that same thought, the whole background for vaccines in general, right?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the underlying idea is that if we don't focus on viruses, we can identify the real causes of disease, like toxins and chemicals.

**RAY PEAT:** "Right, right. The smallpox vaccine actually worked, but it was done in a traditional way, scratching the skin with the bad stuff, whatever it was. That's what it was. It would induce a sore and usually lifelong immunity to smallpox and that scratching the skin or irritating the intestine, that activates, in a healthy person, that activates a resistance rather than a sickness. And that......vaccine was used intelligently to encircle the isolated areas where... smallpox broke out. They would encircle the area with vaccination and over a very short time were able to eliminate the disease entirely. But that was not at all good business for the vaccine industry to eliminate a disease from the world. So even though they knew how to use a vaccine intelligently, activating the skin, not injecting it deep into the muscle where it gets into the brain, but activating the proper immune system and then using it to stop in a focused, organized way to encircle and eliminate the infections. That's how a vaccine should be used, but because of the profitability, they're going crazy inoculating areas that haven't suffered noticeably from the sickness. They get half a dozen measles cases and they want to vaccinate millions of people instead of encircling and eliminating the disease forever from the world. The disorganization is a ploy to keep selling more and more vaccines to more and more people."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the germ theory and the rationale for vaccines are linked.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I think they're... You think there's something there? Yeah, like a cold or herpes person who is out of a proper environment, like you go indoors and keep the air warm and dry, your mucous membranes get dried out and inflamed and just any harmful agent, exosomes junk emitted by people in the house or you contact, whatever it is, the irritant or toxin or germ emitted by these people will catch in a damaged mucous membrane and then you suffer the same process."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if measles and mumps could be natural detoxification processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, first, I would... identify the cause of the high blood sugar. I think the type 2 and proposed other kinds of so-called diabetes, like pregnancy diabetes, I think these are just medical inventions to sell products and services. And it's based way back in the 1940s. Research on the pituitary, pancreas, thyroid, adrenal interactions showed that the insulin was only a very tiny part of the blood sugar regulatory system. And yet, doctors almost always fail to check what's going on with your endocrine system known to regulate blood sugar. They just call it diabetes and leave it at that. Give you something that directly lowers the blood sugar, even though it's achieved at the cost of damaging your mitochondrial respiratory system so that you go into an inefficient glucose wasting condition. And a traditional side effect problem of this treatment of diabetes has been increased lactic acid production with serious, even deadly lactic acidosis being a result. But the principle has continued to be damage the respiratory use of glucose so that you waste glucose and lower the blood sugar. I think the problem should be approached by looking first for what is causing the high blood sugar. Often it's just a chronically high level of cortisol production or of another hormone. And if you find out why your cortisol is high, often that's a reaction simply to hypothyroidism. The lack of thyroid hormone makes you unable to oxidize glucose. And that puts you in a stress state. The stress state amplifies to raise the blood sugar. It keeps the cells from using it and shifts you over, forcing you to run on fats. And putting fats into your bloodstream. Free fatty acids are the other essential blood test for anyone diagnosed with so-called type 2 diabetes. Cortisol and free fatty acids, and if possible, checking on your lactic acid level. Your lactic acid should be at the very bottom of the so-called acceptable normal range."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for recommendations for reversing type 2 diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Right, right. As well as lowering thyroid. Just a very sudden onset of worry, anxiety or fear can give you a surge of free fatty acids, which will block your ability to use glucose. There's a direct antagonism when your blood fats rise in the free fatty acid form. That blocks use of glucose, and so you can instantly create the appearance of type 2 diabetes. In other words, just high blood sugar is all they diagnose it on."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if angst, worry, or fear can raise cortisol levels and lower thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the inflammatory prostaglandins. Wouldn't be made except that we eat either arachidonic acid or linoleic acid or linoleic acid, linoleic and arachidonic acids. They call them essential fatty acids, but when animals or people are put on a diet that makes them absolutely deficient. In the so-called essential fatty acids, their immunity and all types of resistance to infection, poisoning, and trauma. Fatigue, hypoxia, all kinds of stress, resistance tremendously improves when you're free of the inflammatory prostaglandins made from the essential so-called fatty acids. When you eat the high proof of vegetable oils, canola, soy, all of the popular cooking oils, you're getting a very high background content of the material from which prostaglandins will create inflammation at the slightest provocation. It happens that olive oil contains maybe 8-10% of these potentially toxic polyunsaturated fats. The rest of it is safe monounsaturated fats. The rest of it is safe monounsaturated mostly. Those don't contribute to the formation of the toxic prostaglandins. So regular use of olive oil is, in your opinion, fine?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if vegetable oils cause leaky gut and could be related to rheumatoid arthritis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, butter is better because it's only about 3% of the bad stuff. But if you hold your olive oil down to flavoring, maybe a teaspoon full or so, it gives good flavor if it's good olive oil without much danger. But butter is like 3 times as safe. Butter is the safest."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if regular use of olive oil is fine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, people, my brother for example had a cataract diagnosed when he was about 70 and in his late 70s he went back and the oculist said he could see where there had been one but there was no trace of a functioning cataract left. So people do recover from them when their physiology changes, but the lack, loss of energy to those cells that become opaque, leads to them... swelling, just like any de-energized tissue swells, takes up water, and the water, the effect is like cooking egg white. The change of the water from an organized, transparent state, it becomes an opaque, like a cooked egg white. And in the cornea of the eye, that can happen to a woman with, for some reason, extreme water retention. I knew someone who suddenly, in a period of just a few hours, went blind in both eyes because the corneas became white and opaque. And just by bathing her eyes in a slightly hypertonic salt solution, the salt, hypertonic salt solution removed some of the excess water, and immediately her corneas were clear again. And anything that can shift your balance away from that water disorganization and retention effect can let the cataract clear up."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for natural remedies for cataracts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, saline comes into contact with the cornea directly, so it acts immediately, but it can't reach the lens, so it isn't going to work. It might have an effect over a period of a long time, but the problem is to get your whole body shifted so that your body fluids themselves, the blood and the fluids in the eye are bathing the eye with more water restraining effect, possibly more protein and sodium in the water of your bloodstream and all body fluids. But probably other things involved like keeping the external degree of oxidation in your blood and fluids, keeping that higher so that you don't push things towards inflammation and water retention."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for instructions on how to prepare a saline solution for the eyes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, for the clearing up the cornea, I think she used in a quart of water, I think she used either two rounded teaspoons or maybe three rounded teaspoons in a quart."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for the proportions of salt and water for the eye solution.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the canning and pickling sauce, its feature is that they don't add iron and other materials for free flowing. It's just that the sodium chloride is a very... pure form. For example, someone I knew worked in a blood chemistry lab and they would buy most of their chemicals from a company like Sigma or Spectrum and... pay astronomical prices, but when they wanted chemically pure sodium chloride, they would just go to the store and get pickling salts."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Morton's Pickling and Canning Salt versus Redmond Salt or Himalayan Salt.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because the coloring material, if it's gray, copper paint or whatever, the pink is usually iron oxide or iron other chemicals. And the sea salts. Of course, the sea salt people make this argument that we need all of these different minerals, but you're not, you don't resonate with that."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if pickling salt is a good choice for daily use.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, some places identify 90 or 92 different minerals, but most of those are toxic minerals."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the argument for needing all the minerals found in sea salt.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, it's very clean stuff. Clean stuff. And it's very inexpensive. I mean, you can get a whole box of it for what, a buck or something? I think it's four pounds in a box for a couple dollars."

**CONTEXT:** The host recalls Dr. Hal Huggins recommending Morton's pickling and canning salt for better blood balances.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, yeah, the blood sugar normally falls at night as the metabolism slows down. And just the very low blood sugar can give you surges of adrenaline that create symptoms like that vibration, sometimes with changes in many brain chemicals. In reaction to the hypoglycemia, you might wake up with extreme clarity of thought. Or extreme panic and fear. But it's derived from the fact that the liver and muscles should be well supplied with stored glucose as glycogen and then during the night, as we stop eating, the blood sugar falls and liver glycogen should be released into the blood so that we don't have surgery. There are a lot of versions of free fatty acids, but about halfway through the night, most people do have a failure of the liver stored glycogen and they start putting out large amounts of free fatty acids and those fatty acids block our ability to use glucose and creates really a brain toxic situation. And so waking up and having a snack, a glass of orange juice or milk for example, gives our brain some glucose and helps lower the free fatty acids in the blood."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about waking up with internal vibrations and potential remedies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some orange juice, jello, marshmallows, ice cream, milkshake, emphasizing carbohydrate, experiments to stop nocturnal hot flashes and night sweats. They would give them a huge amount of corn starch for example. Any carbohydrate will do, but it should be along with nutrients."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for advice on what to consume before bed to prevent waking up with vibrations.

**RAY PEAT:** "When you're under stress, any carbohydrate is better than the stress which poisons you with the usually polyunsaturated fats that get into your brain. The brain is renewing itself during the night so there's a huge turnover of brain substance and if stress is putting free fatty acids that you've eaten into your bloodstream, they get incorporated very quickly as they pass through the brain. So your brain substance is changing very quickly over a period of just a few weeks. The brain will change its substance according to what you ate. So could this be where the whole idea of comfort food comes in where you have something really like potatoes or organic pasta or something and you just feel better if you're freaked out about something?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the difference between simple carbohydrates and other forms, and if this relates to "comfort food."

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, it can be potatoes or pasta or a milkshake. The sugar getting your blood sugar up and your free fatty acids down creates a sense of peace and well-being and lowers inflammation. Lowers inflammation, wow! They're suffering a deficiency of glucose even when they have high blood glucose because it isn't getting into the cells to be used and hypoglycemia is a powerful cause of inflammation just like hypoxia. It's basically suffocating on the energy level."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if comfort foods can provide peace and well-being by raising blood sugar and lowering free fatty acids.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a person shouldn't specialize in those if they have a weight problem but milk, it happens that the high calcium to phosphate ratio of milk activates the metabolism so that it burns energy at a much higher rate. Animal studies as well as human studies show that mostly the calcium but other things in a high milk diet are great for weight loss, a very great increase in the metabolic rate and ability to burn calories."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of milkshakes and ice cream before bed, and if milk is good for weight loss.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think a small amount is okay, but it is. Glutamic acid is a brain excitant, especially if you don't have a protein to balance it. There is glutamic acid at a fairly high concentration in gelatin, for example, but the other amino acids keep the glutamic acid from getting into your brain at a high level where it could cause excitotoxic damage. So if you're just having pasta, for example, even a fairly small amount of MSG could potentially be toxic."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the harmfulness of MSG and if small amounts are acceptable.

**RAY PEAT:** "Only if you're regularly exposed to it, like animals that live outdoors develop a heavy coat of fur in the winter, and their thyroid adjusts up like four times as active during the winter, but that's because of the stimulation of the skin. So if you're well fed and spend your days doing some activity outdoors where you're constantly exposed to the cold, that should, like any animal, should increase your thyroid function."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if living in a cold climate can be healthier.

**RAY PEAT:** "It gives you a surge of sympathetic activity. Sympathetic activity. Wow. Yeah. They think it activates a diving reflex. In babies you can see a shift of the blood flow, like in a seal. They drastically shift the nervous system, the sense that their face is underwater, redirects the blood circulation so it's mostly oxygenating. The remaining oxygen goes to their brain and lungs and lets the muscles live on glycolysis. Cold water on your face, especially if you've been overheated, can cause that shift of the nervous system."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effect of splashing cold water on the face and neck on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's just because overheating is dangerous. I see. If you get your temperature under control, then your body can adjust to go to sleep. But the overheating turns on what my last newsletter was talking about, the heat shock proteins, which defend against the heat, but they do that at the expense of energy production in the efficient oxidizing way. And so they lower all of your healthy adaptive functions as an emergency measure against the heat. And so after overheating seriously, like an athlete might, then you have to do something to try to reverse that heat shock protein suppression of your proper metabolism."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on an article about Tour de France cyclists using ice packs on their necks to sleep, which seems contrary to the previous statement about cold water.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you don't want to overheat as long as you don't have a bad reaction like fatigue. Cold water, if it's too cold, can drain your energy. The amount of energy that we actually use for functioning is a fairly small fraction of what we emit by conduction and radiation. We radiate about three-quarters of our food energy out as infrared and microwaves. And so if we're in a very cold relative to our ability to burn calories, then our body temperature falls and we're seriously sick."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking an ice-cold shower after a sauna is beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "You can survive. When I worked in the woods, I knew a guy who only took one quart of water and sipped it occasionally and only one little sandwich. He was very apparently comfortable, but when you look at the outcome over a lifetime, the higher your metabolic rate... the longer you live, and the fewer sicknesses. So wasteful heat production, uncoupling your heat production from the production of usable ATP, it has lots of beneficial effects. It reduces inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's possible to learn to survive and thrive on less physical food using more "God force."

**RAY PEAT:** "Avoiding PUFA is the most important basic thing for most people."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to raise metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you're avoiding a calorie-restricted diet, the benefit of it is that people eat almost none of the toxic polyunsaturated fats, and they get lower intake of heavy metals and iron, so they're drastically reducing the poisoning. The amino acids tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine, people are almost always overeating on those amino acids and the proteins that they get. And Broder Barnes found with his experiments on himself that when he ate a high protein, almost pure protein diet, he needed at least twice as much a thyroid supplement to keep going. Really? Because of those particular amino acids being thyroid-suppressive and nonmetabolic. And so a low protein diet, as long as you get just what you need, and gelatin is very helpful for that because it doesn't have the suppressive amino acids."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if surviving on less food lowers or raises metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, gelatin and carbohydrate will support your high metabolic rate at a much lower calorie intake if you avoid the toxic calories."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about supplemental gelatin or gelatin from bone broth.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've only been concerned with its effects on the organisms, but the whole electrical function of the earth's interaction with the solar wind streaming past the earth, it's like a wind chimes sort of effect. It's activated by the streaming solar wind and the earth resonates to that and in the process you get big shifts of electricity that undoubtedly contribute to why there are more thunderstorms in some seasons and how those interact with the solar cycles. Solar cycles are probably a better explanation for the data that they see and refer to as anthropogenic planetary warming."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the Schumann resonance affects the magnetic frequencies of the earth and if it disproves global warming.

**RAY PEAT:** "A lot of the sunspot people, Dr. Pete, suggest that we could be going into much more of a cooling rather than a warming in the next... Until Three Mile Island happened, all of the experts were predicting, for decades they've been predicting a new coming ice age, but the Pentagon put out some publications following the Three Mile Island scare where people turned against nuclear power because they saw the dangers and the Pentagon needed their nuclear power as a source of material for atomic bombs and they didn't want people to turn against nuclear power, which they needed an excuse for why we should give up petroleum and coal and shift to nuclear power. They invented the planetary warming thing and suddenly in just a period of a few months the public media shifted from coming ice age to a coming heat catastrophe."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions that sunspot data suggests a cooling trend and asks about the shift in predictions from an ice age to global warming.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's called the Lisa News has a good article on the Pentagon's invention of global warming."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the Pentagon's involvement was the beginning of the man-made global warming narrative.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, usually it's hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, sleep apnea, sleep apnea, and if you look at the people who have had hypothyroidism and high blood pressure, wasn't I correct? The hypothyroidism, it's the rule that they have corrected their high blood pressure too. And hyperthyroidism tends to lower the blood pressure. Hypothyroidism compensates with high adrenaline and high inflammatory processes. So hypothyroidism is a very important cause of high blood pressure. Interesting. As well as sleep apnea."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions to tackle high blood pressure and snoring/sleep apnea, and what causes sleep apnea.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, I've seen two or three really spectacular examples of that. One woman who was diagnosed as having a non-functioning, completely dead, pituitary gland, and all of her adrenaline, thyroid, and other hormones had gone down to zero. And when she took for just a few days, I think it was only a half a grain of a thyroid supplement, suddenly that little bit catalyzed a signal that the stress situation was over, and the stress had been knocking out her pituitary function. So just in a week, everything came back. And others, one woman who had been sick and disabled for I guess about 30 years, she felt better when she was taking a couple of grains of Armour Thyroid. But she decided to experiment and got a doctor to increase the dose up to five grains a day was the maximum he would prescribe. Five grains? And she felt so much better on that, that she went across the state and got another doctor and convinced him to give her five grains. And she was almost back to normal after 30 years of extreme, needed a walker to get around. My goodness. Now she didn't stay on the five grains a long time, I suspect. No, but she got a third doctor for another. She took 15 grains for a couple or three weeks and as she returned to normal, it took her maybe eight or ten weeks to cut it down, went back down to five grains and was back to work absolutely normal. My goodness. Now a grain is 60 milligrams, right? That's a lot, right? Yeah. Well, Broderbarn's average patient got two grains. About two. About two. Yeah. And that's about half of what a healthy gland produces. So even if you have no gland, you can function moderately well on two grains a day."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's possible for people to use a small amount of thyroid supplement to help their thyroid function without taking it daily.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. As soon as you can. Unload all of the stored polyunsaturated fats, which create the inflammation and the stress. That requires thyroid and suppress thyroid as soon as you can unload that fat. So a thin person, the first woman I mentioned, was very skinny and it just took her a week to get out of the stress. The other one had hips that were almost three feet across, I think, and so it took her a lot of time to burn off some of that excess fat."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a way for someone taking thyroid medication to help their thyroid recover and potentially stop taking it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I think that probably there is a lot of carbon dioxide because the remaining oxygen is being circulated mostly to the brain and lungs. And so they do accumulate a lot of carbon dioxide. But I think there is an immediate nervous signal to stop breathing hard. But over a period of 15, 20 seconds or so, the carbon dioxide starts having its effect of calming the stress nerves. Even though the higher carbon dioxide increases your sense of need to breathe, I think for a diving animal it is probably having a protective, stabilizing effect."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if splashing cold water on the face initiates the diving reflex and if increased carbon dioxide provides oxygen to slow breathing.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you choose from fruits that aren't starchy or irritating, some fruits can be very allergenic and hard to digest, especially in supermarkets. They aren't properly ripened. Peaches, for example, are usually hard and indigestible."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's important to have fruits throughout the week besides orange juice.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, so when you get those kind of things, you bite into them, you just know that you shouldn't be eating that. That's a lot of starch and not ripened properly. Yeah. Not ripened properly."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on what to look for in fruits.
