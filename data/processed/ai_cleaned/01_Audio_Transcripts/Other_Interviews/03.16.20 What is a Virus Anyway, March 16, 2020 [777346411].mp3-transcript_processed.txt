**RAY PEAT:** "We're full of retroviruses. Some people say a huge proportion of all of our genes consist of retroviruses. And during stress, we emit... these as possibly part of a curative system."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion revolves around the idea that viruses might originate from within the body, rather than solely from external transmission.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress causes retrovirus material to explode into the bloodstream so you can find and sell a blood test for just about anything you can imagine."

**CONTEXT:** This statement connects stress to the release of retroviral material, suggesting that many tests might be detecting stress responses rather than specific infections.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ACE, the angiotensin converting......enzyme number two, ACE2, it's the receptor for the virus. The virus attaches to that in the process of entering a cell and becoming infective. And ACE2 is the enzyme that undoes the work of ACE itself. ACE... produces androtensin and ACE2 then destroys androtensin. So what the virus does in binding to ACE2 seems to be inactivating the inactivator of androtensin. That leaves ACE free to make androtensin, which then doesn't have any way out. So it accumulates. Causing all of the dry cough, the high fever, increased hypertension and stroke and so on."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the proposed mechanism by which a virus, specifically a coronavirus, might interact with the ACE2 enzyme to cause symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** "The CDC has said that an average of about 40,000 Americans die of the flu. So now they're getting excited when a few dozen people die out of proportion to what they claim to be the usual annual mortality from flu."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights a perceived discrepancy in how mortality statistics are presented, particularly concerning flu deaths versus deaths attributed to other causes.

**RAY PEAT:** "The way the CDC has built up the market for flu vaccines is to call anyone who dies of pneumonia a death from influenza, but a very old person, say a hundred-year-old person without any particular sickness might just eat too much raw cabbage or something that gives them gas. And that will cause pneumonia, and so people dying of pneumonia can't be counted as flu deaths, so CDC has been fudging on that."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the CDC's methodology for classifying flu deaths, suggesting it inflates the perceived impact of influenza.

**RAY PEAT:** "The coronavirus was known to simply activate the common cold. Inflammation systems, the anthotensin system, for decades we've had the anthotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors. The anthotensin converting enzyme produces the inflammatory protein that causes blood pressure to rise and so on. And there's a close interaction between serotonin and anthotensin and those are both well studied causes of aging related inflammation. So your anthotensin exposure and production will increase in old age and that increases your... your likelihood of getting pneumonia from anything. It's a general inflammatory system that increases contraction of blood vessels and risk of clotting and fatigue of interfering with energy production and so on."

**CONTEXT:** This links the coronavirus to the angiotensin system, a known factor in aging-related inflammation and cardiovascular issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Peter Duesberg's argument closely now for 35 or... 40 years. He has never been proven wrong. He lost his research grants and is now officially out of the science world because he persists with his evidence... He says it's... The genetic DNA strip is a retrovirus. He says it's a harmless retrovirus, and we're full of such DNA. When we're under stress, it shows up in the blood, so you can have a blood test for it, but all it's showing is that you're a stressed individual, and that's just one of many pieces of DNA that shows up in this cloud."

**CONTEXT:** This introduces Peter Duesberg's controversial theories about retroviruses and HIV, emphasizing his long-standing arguments and the scientific community's reaction.

**RAY PEAT:** "Duisburg's argument... correlated the Bay Area, in particular, there was a fad of using particular vasodilator drugs for a play for experience. Yeah, like poppers. Yeah, exactly. Right, right. And how did that tie into it with the gay community, with the poppers? That particular... drug creates a very intense stress reaction that causes the release of these retroviruses."

**CONTEXT:** This connects the use of certain recreational drugs to the release of retroviruses, as proposed by Duesberg, in the context of the AIDS epidemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Tabasco idea is a traditional medical idea to increase circulation. I think it does work. Ultrasound, general low energy, low frequency ultrasound greatly accelerates bone healing. You can get a cheap apparatus for, I think, around $100 and applying that a little bit every day does. Internally, it probably imitates the action of the Tabasco sauce, and red light has a similar increase open blood vessels and accelerate energy production and speed healing."

**CONTEXT:** This provides practical recommendations for accelerating bone healing, suggesting both topical and internal applications.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sunlight is best because it increases your vitamin D, which is the other essential bone healing factor."

**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the importance of sunlight for vitamin D production, a key element in bone healing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Any starch, if you take it, even when it's well cooked, a load of starch can pass directly into your bloodstream. In mouse experiments, they could show that. Any of the starches with grains ranging from 5 microns to 100 microns, all of those could pass through the wall of the intestine into the bloodstream unless there was a lot of fat and fiber taken with it. Once these get into the bloodstream, the particles might be bigger than capillaries. And depending on the size, they can plug blood vessels and cause tissue cells to be deprived of blood supply."

**CONTEXT:** This explains a concern with consuming starches, suggesting they can pass into the bloodstream and potentially obstruct blood vessels.

**RAY PEAT:** "The only starch I eat now, hominy or tortillas made with the lime process called nixtamalized corn."

**CONTEXT:** This specifies preferred starches and the preparation method that makes them more digestible.

**RAY PEAT:** "Nixtamalized. And that takes away the whole fat thing that you talked about. It takes out most of the polyunsaturated fat. It increases the niacin content and it predigests the starch to a great extent."

**CONTEXT:** This details the benefits of nixtamalization, a traditional corn processing method.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the U.S. Southern states, pellagra was a big problem, but because they were eating corn without the lime treatment, the Central Americans, Mexicans, South Americans... Chinese, everyone for thousands of years were cooking their grains in ashes, producing sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or burned limestone for the lime, and they were detoxifying their grains, but at the same time that would produce a lot of niacin. and reduce the leucine content. Without that, people were getting very sick with pellagra."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the historical prevalence of pellagra and its connection to the lack of nixtamalization in corn consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** "You can buy powdered lime. At any, I think some of the big markets like Whole Foods are probably selling it now, but for sure at any Latino market. Powdered lime, right? Yeah, and if you want a big kettle, like a gallon of water, you put in maybe a pound or two of corn kernels. A big tablespoon, heaping tablespoon or two of the lime and boil it until the seeds swell up to about the size of an olive and get soft and that's how many of the cellulose coating separates from it at that time."

**CONTEXT:** This provides instructions on how to nixtamalize corn at home using lime.

**RAY PEAT:** "The lime also digests the protein, makes it more nutritious."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights an additional benefit of the nixtamalization process.

**RAY PEAT:** "The lime breaks down the starch so that I had students experiment with it and it didn't have any of those harmful effects that we could identify."

**CONTEXT:** This reinforces the safety and efficacy of nixtamalized corn based on experimental observations.

**RAY PEAT:** "The first calcium to be laid down in the bones, for example, is calcium carbonate. And then as it ages and matures, it takes up the phosphate."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the process of bone mineralization, starting with calcium carbonate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Shingles. Yeah, it's a stress breakout of the chicken pox. virus of the herpes family and it's probably involving those microparticles that are shed by cells under stress and aspirin by reducing stress and inflammation, all of the anti-inflammatory things help to prevent the cycling."

**CONTEXT:** This describes shingles as a stress-induced reactivation of the herpes virus and suggests aspirin and other anti-inflammatory measures for prevention.

**RAY PEAT:** "Aspirin actually has germicidal antiviral properties. There was a study... done in Washington, D.C. of AIDS patients, giving them big doses of aspirin. And they were improving, and the study was called off despite the disappearance of the AIDS symptoms."

**CONTEXT:** This presents a historical study suggesting aspirin's antiviral properties, even in the context of AIDS.

**RAY PEAT:** "When... when you're just not using oxygen properly... so the things that create stress are... are those that block oxygen use. And you end up producing lactic acid instead, wasting the glucose making lactic acid. And the lactic acid accelerates the process, producing inflammation and further reducing the ability to use oxygen because that process is part of wound healing, which is a reversion to a primitive."

**CONTEXT:** This explains how impaired oxygen utilization leads to lactic acid production, inflammation, and a regression to less efficient metabolic states.

**RAY PEAT:** "And one of the things that will make it... easier for, for example, a wounded or sick or aged person to restore their energy is, for example, bathing in carbon dioxide in the bathtub or a bag. You absorb it through your skin and that increased level of carbon dioxide turns off the inflammatory process. It suppresses the wasteful production of lactic acid and reduced lactic acid tends to turn off all of these virus release processes."

**CONTEXT:** This proposes carbon dioxide baths as a method to reduce inflammation, lactic acid, and the release of viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** "You absorb, they've known that in mineral springs that are rich in... carbon dioxide and bicarbonates, the bicarbonate itself is turned in the surface of the skin into carbon dioxide and is absorbed into the skin even though the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is very high normally compared to the water you're bathing in. The body has such an affinity for it, it will pull it. out of the water, converting bicarbonate to carbon dioxide at the surface and then absorbing the carbon dioxide."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the mechanism by which carbon dioxide is absorbed through the skin from mineral baths.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, that's a traditional thing. A pound or so of baking soda and maybe some Epsom salts with it, but both of those, the magnesium will be absorbed better for the bicarbonate that goes into the body with it."

**CONTEXT:** This provides a practical method for creating a carbon dioxide-rich bath using baking soda and Epsom salts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid is the single most important thing. There have been a couple of publications showing that high estrogen damages the hair cells in the hearing apparatus and I think prolactin along with the estrogen, you want to make sure those aren't elevated. They tend to go up with aging and thyroid and vitamin D are among the things that prevent... those types of damage to the apparatus of the inner ear."

**CONTEXT:** This identifies thyroid hormone and vitamin D as crucial for preventing age-related hearing loss, linking it to estrogen and prolactin levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "The process we were talking about in relation to the virus, the angiotensin system, is at the root of the development of atherosclerosis, and experiments in animals and people show that you can reverse the process and start getting the plaques unloaded. Using the ACE inhibitors and the antrotensin receptor blockers."

**CONTEXT:** This connects the angiotensin system to atherosclerosis and suggests that ACE inhibitors and receptor blockers can reverse the process.

**RAY PEAT:** "Losartan protects, the Chinese have good evidence that it's protective against the. Inflammatory processes of the virus but separate research completely unrelated virus shows that the molecules like Losartan help to reverse atherosclerosis."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights Losartan's potential benefits for both viral inflammation and atherosclerosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone, the body's natural, it lowers the receptor production so it's not as immediate and powerful as these pharmaceutical drugs, but it works."

**CONTEXT:** This suggests progesterone as a natural alternative for managing the angiotensin system and potentially reversing atherosclerosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "An experimenter using distilled water put a gram of reagent grade. Highest purity ascorbic acid into it and then put it in an electron spin resonance apparatus and showed it was as full of free radicals as a killing dose of x-rays."

**CONTEXT:** This raises concerns about the purity of vitamin C supplements, suggesting they can contain free radicals.

**RAY PEAT:** "All of the anti-inflammatory things do help. Do they? Losartan included. Losartan. It's protective against x-rays like progesterone and aspirin. Even turmeric and things like aspirin, turmeric? Yeah, yeah."

**CONTEXT:** This lists several substances, including Losartan, progesterone, aspirin, and turmeric, that may offer protection against x-ray damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid and vitamin D work so closely together, you can't really separate their effects."

**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the synergistic relationship between thyroid hormone and vitamin D.

**RAY PEAT:** "5,000 units a day is able to bring most people up into the... middle of the range, 50 nanograms per milliliter, 50 to 60 is a good healthy range."

**CONTEXT:** This provides a recommended daily dosage of vitamin D for maintaining optimal blood levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "The parathyroid hormone and aldosterone collaborate to knock... down your energy production and shift you over to lactic acid production. Parathyroid hormone is... its main function is to pull calcium out of your bones for emergency use in the bloodstream. So, when your aldosterone and parathyroid hormone are high, you will have increased blood calcium and the calcification of the soft tissues, which is... precursor to atherosclerosis and hardening of the arteries."

**CONTEXT:** This explains how elevated parathyroid hormone and aldosterone contribute to calcification and atherosclerosis by disrupting energy production and calcium metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you lower your aldosterone and parathyroid hormone by having enough calcium and salt in your diet, lots of calcium in your diet, it can be thousands of milligrams a day, will tend not to calcify your arteries but to lower the parathyroid hormone, along with vitamin D, lowering the... Parathyroid. And when the lower... the parathyroid is lower, your mitochondria are able to work full speed to produce energy, which keeps calcium where it belongs, in the bones, not in the blood vessels."

**CONTEXT:** This advocates for adequate calcium and salt intake, along with vitamin D, to lower parathyroid hormone and prevent arterial calcification.

**RAY PEAT:** "The cow has the apparatus to detoxify the greens. The greens The plant doesn't want its leaves to be eaten so it puts irritants and digestion blockers into the leaves. The leaves and seeds have defensive toxic chemicals to prevent being eaten by insects and cows. So the cow has the extra stomach which favors the growth of microorganisms. For more UN videos visit www.un.org which destroys those toxins and release the amino acids and other nutrients to form the milk. So a cow is a detox factory."

**CONTEXT:** This explains why consuming milk is preferable to eating greens directly, as cows possess the biological mechanisms to detoxify plant compounds.

**RAY PEAT:** "The reason I recommend it [orange juice]. A favorite carbohydrate is that it comes with many very powerful anti-inflammatory flavonoids. Naringin and nobiletin and a whole variety of very anti-inflammatory things that can help your thyroid work."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the rationale behind recommending orange juice for thyroid health, citing its anti-inflammatory flavonoids.

**RAY PEAT:** "Salt and calcium work closely to hold down the albastrone parathyroid system."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the role of salt and calcium in regulating the aldosterone-parathyroid system.

**RAY PEAT:** "The formula I designed in the 1970s, progesterone in vitamin E. And natural coconut oil, that has been made ever since by a company called KenoGen."

**CONTEXT:** This describes a specific progesterone cream formulation developed by Dr. Peat and its manufacturer.

**RAY PEAT:** "My dissertation was on the age-accelerating effects of estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** This reveals Dr. Peat's early research focus on the detrimental effects of estrogen on aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "The adrenaline system has been maligned. It's the fight-or-flight immediate response stress hormone. But it does activate other stress hormones, cortisol and so on. So it can, if it persists, it can be harmful. The history of maligning that has led people to overemphasize the opposite parasympathetic part of the nervous system, which with severe stress and aging, the parasympathetic overtakes the other side and creates the degenerative processes. Momentarily increase the epinephrine or adrenaline side can be very, very helpful if they are stopped soon enough."

**CONTEXT:** This defends the role of adrenaline, arguing that its perceived negative effects are often due to prolonged activation and an overemphasis on the parasympathetic system.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sugar and salt happen to be two of the nutrients that will limit uncontrolled production of the adrenaline system thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** This suggests sugar and salt can help regulate adrenaline production, particularly in the context of thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "The parasympathetic system turns on. When you lie down, your adrenaline goes down and that's the sort of thing I was just talking about. The parasympathetic goes up at night and with age in particular, the parasympathetic starts overpowering the adrenaline system and during the night that causes your blood sugar to go down."

**CONTEXT:** This explains how the parasympathetic system's dominance at night can lead to low blood sugar and associated issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Anti-inflammatory things, chicken soup, a source of salt and gelatin, for example, orange juice, milk and ice cream, all of these can help reduce inflammation, aspirin, low Sartan, the thing I mentioned for end-foot tension. opposition that has been used for treating pneumonia among other things."

**CONTEXT:** This lists various foods and substances that can help reduce inflammation and potentially treat pneumonia.

**RAY PEAT:** "The russet... I think has the best nutrition. Technically you could find the nutrients in the Yukon, but the high... I think they're the ones with the yellow carotene content. They are harder to digest because the carotene interferes with the breakdown of the starch."

**CONTEXT:** This discusses the nutritional differences between potato varieties, noting that russets may offer the best overall nutrition and that Yukon Golds can be harder to digest due to carotene.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you have a bad intestinal situation, charcoal, or I think the best approach is to have a daily carrot. A carrot salad, for example, will clean your intestine and remove anti-thyroid factors."

**CONTEXT:** This recommends a daily carrot salad as a method to cleanse the intestines and remove anti-thyroid compounds.

**RAY PEAT:** "Mixing magnesium carbonate with vinegar and calcium gluconate. Magnesium carbonate, first of all, a lot of people are sensitive to some impurity in most of the products that I've seen. I used to use it regularly as a magnesium supplement, but I've... had very bad headaches from it and lots of people experience that so you have to be cautious with any of those pure chemicals."

**CONTEXT:** This advises caution with magnesium carbonate supplements due to potential impurities and adverse reactions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The cause of it [venous reflux disease] is usually a hormone imbalance, high estrogen in relation to DHEA, Pregnenolone, Progesterone and Testosterone. The bad ratio of estrogen weakens the wall of the veins and lets them balloon and tend to form clots. So, having... checking your hormones, making sure that your thyroid is good, that's usually deficient causing the high estrogen to the progesterone and androgen ratio."

**CONTEXT:** This links venous reflux disease to hormonal imbalances, particularly high estrogen relative to other hormones, and suggests thyroid support.

**RAY PEAT:** "I'm sort of a fan of the process theology. If you Google that, you can find one of the most famous current process theologists. They're basing their thinking on Alfred North Whitehead, who was one of my philosophical influences. Whitehead made himself unpopular among philosophers by using the word God. But if you read the process theology based on Whitehead, you'll get an idea of my approach."

**CONTEXT:** This explains Dr. Peat's philosophical leanings, referencing process theology and Alfred North Whitehead.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I don't think it is [surgery for jaw cavitation]. If there's no pain, there's very...almost certainly no infection. When you pull a tooth, sometimes the bone doesn't fill in the hole. No problem there."

**CONTEXT:** This advises against surgery for jaw cavitations if there is no pain, suggesting it's likely not an infection.

**RAY PEAT:** "Adami soy. I think it's okay as a condiment in very limited amounts. For example, soy sauce, I think is safe to use occasionally in a small amount. But the more, for example, in Hawaii, there was a study of people who ate tofu. And those who didn't, and dementia was higher in the tofu eaters."

**CONTEXT:** This suggests that soy products like tofu should be consumed in moderation due to potential links with dementia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another study in China found that milk drinkers had much lower incidence of dementia. High-quality protein and anti-inflammatory properties of the milk."

**CONTEXT:** This contrasts soy consumption with milk consumption, noting milk's association with lower dementia rates due to its protein and anti-inflammatory properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "Love heals everything, right? Your husband will massage your legs. I mean, how could you not feel better, right?"

**CONTEXT:** This humorously acknowledges the healing power of touch and positive relationships.
