**RAY PEAT:** The more double bonds you have in a molecule, the longer chain of maybe five or six double bonds, the more anti-thyroid it is and the more pro-estrogen, and that combination is especially bad for metabolism. So omega-3s are double bond and it's anti-estrogen, so that would be? Pro-estrogen. Pro-estrogen, right, which we don't want, right?

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the red blotches on the forearm after consuming salmon and walnuts, and their potential link to omega-3s.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, those are actually little hemorrhages and its weakness of the capillaries and a combination of high cortisol and high estrogen is typically involved in that.

**CONTEXT:** Following up on the cause of the red blotches.

**RAY PEAT:** High cortisol? Yeah, and that tends to increase with aging.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the cause of weak capillaries.

**RAY PEAT:** Not having enough energy to meet the demands of the world. A lot of that going on, right Doc?

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the relationship between cortisol and energy.

**RAY PEAT:** I think most people are overeating on protein. Essentially you get enough but it depends on the rate of metabolism in affluent countries. I think most people get much more than enough protein. Animal studies where you restrict methionine right down to the bare minimum which might be only half or a third as much as people normally eat, their lifespan is extended by 40% even without limiting calorie intake. So the low calorie diet, the reason that can extend lifespan is mostly two things, lower methionine intake and lower PUFA intake.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing protein intake and its relation to lifespan and aging.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually. A better appetite in general and a livelier feeling. Yeah, oatmeal for breakfast. Yeah, and as long as you get enough milk in your diet, the mineral binding quality of oatmeal has scared a lot of people away from it. But all you need to do is make sure you're getting enough milk.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the benefits of reducing protein and increasing carbohydrates, and the role of oatmeal and milk.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's largely the calcium content, but there are innumerable anti-stress factors in milk besides the calcium. Very digestible. And a lot of people feel something unpleasant when they have a glass or two of ice-cold milk. But if you just bring it up towards body temperature, it's the drop of body temperature that a lot of cold drink can actually stop your heart just by a reflex action.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing the common criticism of dairy and milk consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** It lowers adrenaline and cortisol. It increases your metabolic rate, but the higher metabolic rate allows your nerves and muscles to relax, takes energy to relax, and that's what warm sugar and milk are good at.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining how sugar can be calming.

**RAY PEAT:** The calcium and sugar combined activate the oxidative metabolism and turn off the various stress kinds of metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** Connecting sugar's calming effect to metabolic rate and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, isotonic glucose solution is a very common... Sugar. But they don't use it enough, and they tend to keep it down in concentration, like 5% sugar is the standard concentration. But if you use about three or four times that much, the concentration, whether it's salt or sugar, the concentration itself helps to restore your own energy production. Because when you're starved of energy, your cells take up too much water. And if you put in a slightly hyperosmotic solution into your blood, whether it's glucose or salt, that draws the excess water out of your cells and helps with resuscitation.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the use of glucose solutions in hospitals and their osmotic effect.

**RAY PEAT:** A book published in 1905 describes sitting in a tub of CO2 for an hour like spending a day at the beach, refreshing and restorative. And if you just put it on one arm, for example, a small bag of pure CO2, in about 15 or 30 minutes you can see that arm is pinker than the other one. And it will usually stay noticeably pink for a few hours after that because the CO2 saturates the cells and fat and connective tissues, everything. It just becomes slightly more acidic, but the amount is enough to keep the blood circulating more freely, and it binds to hemoglobin, releasing the oxygen in the tissue, and that also opens up the blood vessels. So it's a real nice circulation thing, the CO2, right?

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the benefits of carbon dioxide exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, normally the small arteries out in your extremities are offering resistance and that keeps your blood pressure up. But when they're relaxed, your blood pressure comes down and so your heart pumps more blood faster through those open arteries.

**CONTEXT:** Elaborating on how CO2 affects circulation and blood pressure.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the acid nature of the CO2 molecule helps you keep the soft tissues from crystallizing calcium, brings them back into solution. But in the bone, the carbon dioxide plus dissolved calcium actually increases the crystallization into the bone. And people who've lived in a submarine with well above normal CO2 for months at a time, they find that their bones are getting denser and denser with time. Up to a year or more, the bones keep adding calcium and carbon dioxide. So it's actually putting the calcium where it wants to be rather than in the arteries.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the effect of CO2 on calcium deposition in soft tissues versus bone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the opposite of that, when you block the formation of CO2, you get the formation of lactic acid instead. And in your bone, those have exactly opposite effects. The parathyroid hormone makes local lactic acid in the bone that dissolves your bones, and the CO2 has just exactly the opposite effect. And a drug called acetazolamide that raises the carbon dioxide in your body, it has a side effect of increasing bone density.

**CONTEXT:** Contrasting the effects of CO2 and lactic acid on bone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and... A surprising proportion of the population is over-breathing, even at rest, to the extent that your hypothyroid, instead of making carbon dioxide, you will make an excess of lactic acid, and that's a sign of over-breathing, so when too much exercise raises your CO2, it means you should have been exercising more slowly.

**CONTEXT:** Linking over-breathing, hypothyroidism, and lactic acid production.

**RAY PEAT:** Well your liver is what brings it down to normal after over-exercising or being hypothyroid. If you're at rest, the liver will take lactic acid out of the blood and combine it to make glucose again. But that takes extra energy, so you need some good thyroid function for your liver. To have the energy to turn lactic acid back into glucose and so a low thyroid person very easily gets into a low CO2 high lactic acid condition even without noticeably breathing hard or exercising. Those are the people who if they take an airplane up to... Mexico City, for example, don't have time to adapt. They get various kinds of altitude sickness, headache, swelling of the lungs and brain, and in extreme situations there can treat it with breathing a little bit of concentrated CO2.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the liver's role in managing lactic acid and the connection to altitude sickness and CO2.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, over the years I've known several people who did that. Once you get it up, it's the same with progesterone. Both thyroid and progesterone support each other. And so, if everything else is good about the way you live, what you eat, just a few doses of progesterone or thyroid can remedy the situation and you don't need the supplement.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the sustained benefits of thyroid supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you don't want to. Stop taking it if your temperature falls and you start feeling bad again. Right, right. I mean that exactly would it how long would it take for the temperature to fall? If you're gonna we want to wean off of it, dr Pete to know if you're on the wrong track here, and it's not time to go the active hormone Has a very short Stay in the body about 12 hours I'm three, but the t4 the Cyroxin has about a two-week residency in the body So after two weeks you still have half of the amount of Cyroxin Been there previously So yeah, so you'd be able to tell fairly soon if it's not not time to do that Yeah, about a week you feel yourself cooling off

**CONTEXT:** Explaining how to monitor the need for thyroid supplementation and the half-life of thyroid hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** If you completely suppress your thyroid function, I did that once using a Cytum LT3 And I looked in the mirror one morning and I had two grooves about the size of my index finger, one on each side of my voice box And I realized my thyroid had shrunken down to almost nothing And so I stopped taking the T3 and in 24 hours my neck was level and smooth again The gland is extremely flexible and quick to recover

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the reversibility of thyroid gland shrinkage due to T3 suppression.

**RAY PEAT:** It's probably a good idea to have a blood test measuring both lactic acid and carbon dioxide because adequate carbon dioxide slows cell division and reduces inflammation. And there's usually some sort of inflammation like an antigen involved in all of the leukemia lymphoma type problems. And so, they're finding that for both lymphoma and leukemia, both aspirin and acetazolamide or something to increase your body's CO2 content will slow the growth.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding a 67-year-old male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, low cortisol, and low energy.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's been, I guess, 40 years since I first dared to. A woman who was desperate with inflammatory breast cancer, extremely painful, and doctors wouldn't touch it. It occurred to me that she would be an obvious one to emphasize the pain-controlling effect, and as a side effect, reduce the inflammation and growth of the cancer. So, I suggested she take aspirin until the pain subsides, and just two or three days, she said, the redness and swelling and pain had all subsided so that she could then wear a brassiere and talk to doctors about what to do.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the efficacy of aspirin for pain and inflammation, referencing a case of inflammatory breast cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Mainly anti-inflammatory? Mm-hmm. Mainly anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** Clarifying the primary action of aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** The basic effect, if you're not suffering from an infection or something, if you just take an aspirin and check your temperature, very typically, your temperature and pulse rate will rise with the aspirin because it's activating the respiratory system the same way thyroid does, and it even activates the thyroid action on cells.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining how aspirin can increase temperature and pulse rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's always best to take it with food because any concentrated crystalline substance, whether it's vitamins or salt or sugar, it can injure your stomach membranes. So, it's very important to have food or milk with it.

**CONTEXT:** Advising on the proper way to take aspirin to avoid stomach irritation.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, you can buy it not too expensively on the internet. If you enter bulk aspirin, one of the advertisements coming up will be white willow bark. Really? I mean, it's the same thing, really? Well, the bark has lots of other stuff, so it's a load of aspirin. You can get a pound of aspirin for something in the range of $12 to $20 a pound.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the source of aspirin and its availability.

**RAY PEAT:** Pretty good, except they put additives in it. They put additives? Yeah, the bear I've had good luck with, but some aspirin tablets have junk like talc. Yeah, and sometimes they coat them up and God knows what they do with them, right? They put coatings. Yeah, wax and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the presence of additives in some aspirin tablets.

**RAY PEAT:** I really think a lot of the stories about aspirin like Reye's syndrome don't give aspirin to babies with a fever. That started, I think, around 1970s, mid or late 1970s, and Tylenol was having a big sales campaign, and simultaneously we had a lot of stories about people dying from bleeding or Reye's syndrome from taking aspirin came out. But later, several studies questioned whether there ever was such a thing as Reye's syndrome, and one study in Australia found that people who took Tylenol had a higher incidence of so-called Reye's syndrome than those who took aspirin. So I think a huge part of the myths about aspirin came because of Tylenol advertising. Now they're giving even premature babies, they'll treat them with Tylenol, and despite knowing that Tylenol causes kidney failure is associated with during pregnancy or prematurity, it is strongly associated with causing autism and liver failure. It's very poisonous stuff, and it happens that aspirin is an antidote to the toxicity of Tylenol.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing the controversy surrounding aspirin and Reye's syndrome, and the potential dangers of Tylenol.

**RAY PEAT:** Milk has about a 10 to 1 ratio, I think it is, of calcium to magnesium, but still the body can sort it out and get all the magnesium you need from milk.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding calcium intake and its effect on magnesium absorption.

**RAY PEAT:** Good nutrition is the basic thing. Stopping leaky blood vessels and deteriorating capillaries is what you have to do. And aspirin is generally protective. I think there are other things, other drugs that improve the metabolism of the retina. For example, agmatine is a very harmless chemical that derived from arginine that lowers the production of nitric oxide when there's an inflammation or degeneration. So there are lots of ways to protect the retinal metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing dry macular degeneration and its potential reversal.

**RAY PEAT:** Beets, right? Beets as well? B vitamins are a generally balanced, rich diet. If you cut down on your fat intake, that means you're going to eat more of the other foods, and fat doesn't contain B vitamins. So a low fat diet is pretty similar to a high B vitamin diet.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing foods that support blood vessels and the role of B vitamins.

**RAY PEAT:** It's been around for about 150 years. The diet industry found that it was somewhat germicidal, Paul Ehrlich advocated it for killing parasitic diseases, huge doses of, I think, 500 mg at a time, but one of its side effects is if you go into the sunlight and your tissues, sometimes the white of the eye turns blue if you're taking a lot of it. It sensitizes you to sunlight and can cause red blood cells to break down and sunburn easily and so on. I don't recommend the high doses, and it's being used for Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative nerve diseases because it is an electron donor and acceptor both, so it can pick up electrons in the electron transport chain and carry them past a defect in your enzymes and deliver that electron the other side of the defect, so it's like a short circuit for getting your electron transport and respiration going again, and to do that, for example, people with depression, they're not making enough mental nervous energy, just a half a milligram is plenty for that electron transport effect. People sometimes pop right out of a depression with just a tiny dose of methylene blue.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the uses and potential side effects of methylene blue.

**RAY PEAT:** I have never looked at that particular interaction, but sirolimus, I think, has anti-cancer functions, anti-immunity, can be very protective for some infections, fungal infections, for example.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the interaction of methylene blue with sirolimus.

**RAY PEAT:** Concentrating on his digestion, more fiber, more digestible carbohydrates, but not too much at once, in case there are bacteria converting them. But the fiber will help to move the bacteria through and out of the system faster, and possibly antibiotics as well as the fiber to help clean out the bad bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing ankylosing spondylosis and inflammation, focusing on digestion and fiber.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and making sure your thyroid is good so that your digestion is active and quick.

**CONTEXT:** Connecting thyroid function to digestive health.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's true. It has many, many known effects, but I think the essential activity is that it's anti-inflammatory. Anti-inflammatory? Yeah, like aspirin. It can be good for everything.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the perceived benefits of ivermectin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's originally a parasite killer, but I think any good anti-inflammatory thing is going to help with autism.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing ivermectin's potential role in autism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Just for taste, I like the Crown Prince brand of smoked oysters in olive oil, but I don't think you can be sure of their level of contamination. I think they come from the west of Japan, and so they aren't in the worst of the radioactive pollution. But when possible, if you can get South American oysters that are lower in industrial and radiation toxins, that's preferable.

**CONTEXT:** Recommending brands of oysters and discussing contamination concerns.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Yeah. Besides the smoked things in the can, we usually at the fish section of a supermarket, they will have freshly filled oysters in a little container. So you can get, I think it's a 10-ounce container that has five or six or seven or eight oysters in it. Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Suggesting sources for fresh oysters.

**RAY PEAT:** Are very rich in all of the sea minerals, selenium, copper, iodine, zinc, and so on. But they're also high in iron. So if you're worried about excessive iron, it would be better to alternate with things like crab and shrimp.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the nutritional benefits of oysters and potential concerns about iron content.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it's great. Very similar nutritionally to shrimp though, and the price of lobster is sometimes excessive.

**CONTEXT:** Comparing lobster and shrimp nutritionally.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, thyroid makes you form sebum or the skin oils and sweat at the same time. So it moisturizes and oils your skin.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing dry and sagging skin.

**RAY PEAT:** The TSH at 0.5 or below, correct, if I'm right? Around, yeah. One study showed that 0.4 and below, but 0.5 is fine.

**CONTEXT:** Confirming the optimal TSH range for thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** No, because there are so many things. For example, if you have PUFA circulating in your blood, whether it's N minus six or N minus three, both of those block the function of thyroid. So you're going to have lots of thyroid hormone in your blood, but it's being blocked in effect by the polyunsaturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining how PUFAs interfere with thyroid hormone function.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, macadamia are pretty low in PUFA, more saturated fats, and I think the taste quality goes up with the saturated fats. I think cashews are fairly low in PUFA. They're from a moderate climate, and so I think they're fairly high in PUFA.

**CONTEXT:** Identifying nuts with lower PUFA content.

**RAY PEAT:** Those are the things that block thyroid. Block thyroid. Man, I wonder how much... Corn oil, they sold over the last 50 years. My goodness. Oh, yeah. Wesson oil, right? Ooh. Yeah, cottonseed oil was the first one to be promoted because it was a waste product. Very, very cheap. And in the 1950s, they started selling it as a health food. And they claimed that it would prevent heart disease, the more you ate, prevent cancer, and even would make you slim. But it turns out to cause cancer, to cause heart disease and obesity.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the history and harmful effects of corn and cottonseed oil.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it varies in its PUFA content, but Hans Selye did studies with it showing that it wasn't the erucic acid. Canola was designed to be low in erucic acid, but Hans Selye showed that it's the linoleic-related PUFA that make canola harmful to your heart. He showed a high canola diet cause when he would slice up the hearts of experimental animals. The heart was full of little dead areas. But if he gave them cocoa butter, a highly saturated stearic acid-rich fat, that would block the effect of the PUFA and protect their heart from canola oil.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the harmful effects of canola oil and the protective role of cocoa butter.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you want to check. Sometimes a person can be allergic to something in it. It depends on exactly how it's made. It's always good to check for allergies.

**CONTEXT:** Advising on the potential for allergies to cocoa butter.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a pregnenolone is helpful by lowering general stress and inflammation. But aspirin and thyroid, getting your thyroid function up and using aspirin, both of those reduce ordinary inflammation of the prostate. So that's what it is.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing enlarged prostate and suggesting remedies.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, better not look at it, even. Around 1990, when that came out as a test indicating prostate cancer, suddenly the death rate from prostate cancer went up, I think it was 50% in a year or two because they were giving more treatment just on the basis of PSA, no evidence of cancer. But the more treatment they gave, the more people died from the treatment associated with having diagnosed cancer.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the PSA test and its potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can take the dose that stops the symptoms without totally sterilizing your intestine and risking the development of dangerous toxic bacteria like C. difficile or something like that. Yeah, the microbe difficile, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Advising on the safe use of antibiotics to avoid disrupting gut flora.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's safest because I have talked to just hundreds of people who got chronic bowel problems from following through on the idea that you have to take all of your prescription every day for the full number of days it was prescribed and that's very often enough to totally disrupt your natural bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the risks of completing full antibiotic prescriptions and their impact on gut bacteria.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. The creams are, with the greatest attention and rubbing in, you might absorb as much as 10% of what you put on, but usually it's less than that. Really? And so putting on only 5 or 10 milligrams, your body won't even know that it has had a boost of progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the poor absorption of topical progesterone creams.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you put on 1,000 milligrams on your skin, you definitely will feel it. And all you need is a dab of that really inexpensive progesterone and you're there, right? Yeah. If you put it on your lips or tongue or take it with food, it's essentially 100% absorbed because it mixes with the fats in your food and is absorbed, bypassing the liver, circulating in the chylomicron fractions.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing effective methods of progesterone absorption.

**RAY PEAT:** A little bit of iodized salt is okay if you're eating a lot of local foods, for example, but if you get sea foods or imported foods, you're likely not to be iodine deficient. Of several dozen studies of the association between iodized salt or any iodine supplement and nodules or cancer of the thyroid, there's a very strong relationship between getting a little too much iodine. For example, even half a milligram a day of supplement continued for a long time is associated with increased degeneration nodules and cancer of the thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** Advising on iodine intake and the risks of excessive supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if someone is having a stressful night, for example, the stress hormones rise during the night if you're deficient in some nutrients, including carbohydrates. And TSH goes up during the night along with several other stress hormones that disturb your sleep and keep you tired.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining why taking T4 at bedtime can be beneficial for sleep and stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, almost all prescribed thyroid in the U.S. is only T4. And for women, women have a very poor average response to T4. Why is that, I wonder? Because estrogen inhibits the conversion of T4 to the active hormone. And so doctors, they think that when you increase the T4 too much that you're getting hyperthyroidism. But if you're not converting it properly, as about half of all women do, then too much T4 starts turning under the influence of stress hormones into reverse T3 rather than active T3. So it lowers your metabolic rate and other thyroid functions to take too much T4.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining why T4-only thyroid medication is often ineffective for women.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that's not at all natural. That's a synthetic, which in a healthy young man, it works just like thyroid hormone because their livers can activate it. But the reason women have about ten times the incidence of thyroid disease as men is that estrogen limits the ability to convert thyroxine to real hormone. And so it's a really very irrational, unscientific thing to prescribe thyroxine for women.

**CONTEXT:** Critiquing the prescription of synthetic T4 for women.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you have very high TSH, you at least benefit from suppressing that. T4 is fine for acting on your pituitary to ease off on the TSH, and that will greatly protect your thyroid from developing nodules if you just suppress the TSH. Because TSH itself, when it's elevated, is producing the symptoms that are associated with hypothyroidism. It isn't just the lack of metabolic activating T3 hormone. It's the actual positive direct pro-inflammatory effect of TSH itself.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the benefits of T4 in suppressing TSH and protecting the thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** That's undoubtedly the most common reason for thinning hair. There are fewer hairs because so many fall out, and the hairs that do grow if your thyroid is low are thin, frail hairs.

**CONTEXT:** Identifying low thyroid as a common cause of hair thinning.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, the traditional way of getting those enzymes was to powder the pancreas gland of animals. Yeah. Pancreatic, right? Pancreatic. Yeah, that's a very good mixture of digestive enzymes that do help with things like preventing clots and inflammation. But since you can't heat the dried gland to sterilize it, there's always a risk of the animal having some kind of infectious disease. So essentially, pancreatic enzyme substances have to be still alive tissue, which means they could have bacteria and other pathogens. And the alternative is to use similar enzymes made by fungus. Most commonly, a fungus is used and that always leaves antigenic traces of the fungus itself. And so you have the potential to have an allergic reaction to fungal enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing systemic enzymes, their sources, and potential risks.

**RAY PEAT:** I would go with the pancreatic. Just go and do the pancreatic? Yeah, despite the risk of infection.

**CONTEXT:** Recommending pancreatic enzymes despite potential infection risk.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Dr. Kelly was one of the pioneers in that, and it goes back to early 20th century. And that has fairly recently been supported by new types of studies that show that the pancreatic enzymes entering the intestine are actually reabsorbed into the system. So if you make them yourself properly, or if you take them as powdered thyroid or pancreas gland, you are actually getting those enzymes into the bloodstream, not just into your intestine. And so there's clear evidence that they do get into the bloodstream, act as proteolytic enzymes, just as I think it was Dr. Beard at the turn of the 20th century who advocated that as a cancer treatment, and Kelly and Gonzalez developed it and followed up.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the reabsorption of pancreatic enzymes and their historical use in cancer treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** I accept they are combined with a lot of antigens and indigestible material, so they can cause intestinal irritation, indigestion and gas and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the potential downsides of raw foods.

**RAY PEAT:** If you have lots of production of the protective steroids which are precursors to cortisol, pregnenolone and progesterone and a moderate amount of DHEA, those protect against cortisol but progesterone also functions the same way cortisol does so if you have enough of those you don't need any cortisol and so if you are vigorously producing steroids you should have a very low cortisol level. The stress of night time is what causes the cortisol level to rise around on.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining ideal cortisol levels in relation to other steroids.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, serotonin is the major thing, inflammation of the intestine is responsible for the great bulk, more than 90% of all of the serotonin in the body is produced in the intestine and if it's irritated that increases and if your intestine is inflamed that interferes with your liver's ability to regulate the way the blood platelets handle serotonin and so the platelets which should be detoxifying the serotonin, taking it mostly to the lungs where it's destroyed, they can't handle the extra serotonin which then causes the blood vessel inflammation leading to clots and or hemorrhaging and so anti-inflammatory things, first very easy to digest foods but aspirin, ciproheptadine is an anti-serotonin that calms intestinal inflammation and keeping your CO2 up has the action of acidifying your platelets. And the acidic granules in the platelets bind to serotonin and allows the serotonin to be carried to the lungs and liver for detoxifying. And so the hyperventilation caused by the serotonin itself tends to drive off your CO2, causing your platelets to spill serotonin into the blood, causing the clots and blood vessel inflammation, carditis, and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the link between intestinal inflammation, serotonin, and persistent cough, and the role of CO2.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's the quickest, simplest way to get some. I've seen people control their hypertension, spending a few minutes every day. You can see the blood pressure come down the first or second days of doing that.

**CONTEXT:** Confirming that breathing into a bag to increase CO2 can help with hypertension.

**RAY PEAT:** In itself, it doesn't alkalize the body, but the bicarbonate, baking soda, for example, directly regulates the pH neither too high nor too low, and the CO2 has so many protective effects on blood vessels, on circulation through the lungs just by adding CO2 to a person with breathing difficulties. For example, on Mount Everest, they were putting people in a big body bag, adding oxygen as a way to bring them out of inflamed lungs and brain from the altitude, but someone noticed that in these airtight body bags, they were accumulating pretty high levels of CO2, it wasn't the oxygen, it was the increased CO2 curing the altitude sickness, and the same thing that happens in altitude sickness happens from the serotonin poisoning and inflammation caused by COVID and other degenerative diseases.

**CONTEXT:** Clarifying the role of CO2 in altitude sickness and its similarity to COVID-related inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sores around your nails? I'm not sure. I've never heard that one. Sometimes it's a vitamin deficiency. Just improving your diet, vitamin A. Sometimes putting vitamin A right around your nails.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing paronychia (sores around the nails).

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, definitely. Just by feeding them barley instead of corn and soy, the barley is lower in PUFA. Depending on the climate, there are many alternative foods that are lower in the PUFA content. The general inflammatory properties of chicken and pork, standard American pork, has more than 30% polyunsaturated fats in its tissue. Europeans don't like American pork because they say it has soft fat. You can see that when I was a kid, lard was a solid like butter that would stay in a block at room temperature. Now it's semi-liquid.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the high omega-6 content in farm-raised chickens and American pork.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are now, I've heard of three pig farmers that are producing pork fat that is solid. And the content of PUFA is approaching beef and lamb down around 4% or beef and lamb are about 2.5% to 3% PUFA. So the pork is, from those farms, it's essentially as safe as beef or lamb.

**CONTEXT:** Identifying sources of pork with lower PUFA content.

**RAY PEAT:** At room temperature it should stay firm and white.

**CONTEXT:** Describing the characteristic of firm, white fat in healthy pork.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the thyroid is the main thing that regulates hydration and oiliness of the skin.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing sagging and dehydrated skin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, anxiety is a constant suppressor of the thyroid. A great shock, the death of a close relative is often the trigger that turns a person's thyroid off. Or an accident, just the emotional shock is enough to knock out your thyroid. The body tries to go into hibernation to get away from the horror of the experience. I'm afraid that the fear campaigns from fear of nuclear war or whatever fear of a virus or fear of terrorists, all of those are being promoted actively by the government and the media and they're harming everyone's bodies as well as their minds.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining how stress, anxiety, and emotional shock can suppress thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** It's a criminal hoax, essentially. That the whole thing was a hoax? The vaccine never was intended or conceived to prevent the infection. It can't, in principle. That's been known for more than 15 years. The people, the insiders, can't have been so stupid and ignorant as to ignore all of the evidence showing that the vaccine was purely, essentially, a manner of chemical warfare.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah. I've been seeing people with lupus so-called do very quick recoveries. Just the last year I've been following a woman who was diagnosed with lupus and could hardly move because of arthritis and she just changed her diet and started supplementing thyroid and progesterone and avoiding the allergens and pro-inflammatory things, and it's all well. Its autoimmune conditions are very well defined as the results of too much estrogen, too little progesterone and thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** Explaining the causes of lupus and its potential treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** Milk and even oatmeal has a surprising amount of protein in it.

**CONTEXT:** Discussing sources of protein in the diet.
