**RAY PEAT:** Stress, trauma of all sorts, poisoning, anything that damages the organism. Activates the phospholipases, it isn't just an oddity of COVID virus or cobra venom that activates the phospholipases that have all of those harmful effects. Anything harmful that excites the organism too much turns on those things. For example, when you activate one kind of phospholipase, you get the production of prostaglandins. The prostaglandins activate all sorts of inflammatory things. For example, the cytokine storm or inflammatory cascade is activated among other things by phospholipase. And that's what kills you from COVID and that's one of the things that can kill you with snake bite is systemic inflammation. So the phospholipase.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about a video that discusses snake venom and COVID-19, and Dr. Peat explains the role of phospholipase in inflammatory processes.

**RAY PEAT:** So there's always a lot of phospholipids around to be acted on by the phospholipase and anything that disrupts your cells will activate that. And that liberating arachidonic acid immediately brings up your prostaglandins, which then activate many other cytokines and inflammatory processes.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the mechanism by which phospholipase activation leads to inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** A virus is extremely common for causing colds, and it's somewhat different from the influenza virus and other things that can cause pneumonia. But the cold virus has always killed a few people, babies that aren't very strong, especially very old people, often it has been nothing but a cold that it takes to kill a very old sickly person. So the cold is a good virus to start modifying if you want to create a weapon, for example, and that's why it was chosen by places like the Fort Detrick germ warfare lab and the North Carolina virus lab of Ralph Baric. A transmissible unit for putting all kinds of other things in to modify the effects so it isn't just a common respiratory infection type cold, but it can carry other inflammatory systems with it.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the origins and potential weaponization of coronaviruses, referencing Ralph Baric and Fort Detrick.

**RAY PEAT:** It is a real coronavirus, but it has these segments with special functions of making the spike protein especially transmissible to humans. And Ralph Baric described the way he and his lab developed the transmissibility and the insertion of the spike protein and the modification of the spike protein. That's all public information, patent descriptions and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the genetic modifications of coronaviruses, specifically mentioning Ralph Baric's work on transmissibility and spike protein.

**RAY PEAT:** In developing them, at first they were transmitted from animal to animal by contact, but then they let them develop in ways that until they could put animals in different cages and blow the air from one into the other and spread the virus. So it was definitely established in the lab to be transmissible through the air. And autopsies have been done on the natural or whatever the current COVID germ consists of and you can stain the tissues and show the presence of the virus getting into the lining of blood vessels, traveling to the intestine of the lungs and even into the blood vessels of the brain.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms the airborne transmissibility of viruses developed in labs, citing animal studies and autopsy findings.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it doesn't matter that you can have a test tube, a picture of a certain virus. You can demonstrate its presence by multiple ways. You form antibodies to it and then you can detect it when it's connected to the tissues of the victim.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat addresses the debate around virus identification, emphasizing the importance of detecting the virus within tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** He has slides showing the staining of the virus with immunostains, attaching a colored material to an antibody that's specific for part of the virus, and then another set of stains specific for the spike protein. Bhakti shows that those can occur together, but you can distinguish them clearly. In these 15 autopsies, there are numerous cases in which it's clearly only the vaccine dependent spike proteins that are causing the deaths, the breakdown of blood vessels, for example, and the concentration of inflammatory blood cells around the identifiable spike protein. So it's the most graphically clear incrimination of the vaccine itself distinct from the viral disease causing the myocarditis, breakdown of blood vessels and clotting, hemorrhaging, injury, the whole range of things that have empirically been associated with vaccine injury. Now this specifically shows the presence in the tissues of the spike protein itself without any of the rest of the virus.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses Michael Palmer's autopsy findings, highlighting the presence of vaccine-induced spike proteins as a cause of death and injury.

**RAY PEAT:** Could have been, yeah. Could have been, but they could have also somehow taken something in from the outside as well.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat acknowledges that symptoms experienced by some individuals could be due to detoxification or external factors.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure, yeah. But before the COVID thing started at all, the CDC had been describing that how many tens of thousands of people were dying of influenza pneumonia every winter. That was used to herd people into getting the influenza vaccine. But then someone said, well, what is the evidence really that this is influenza killing them? The same question some people have asked about the COVID so-called virus. But when they had just reported something like 60,000 deaths this season from influenza pneumonia. And so someone suggested that they actually check for evidence that there was an influenza virus. They said, oh, well, yes, there were something like 1,200 deaths seasonally from influenza. And the others were from COVID, were from coronaviruses, was one cause, common colds probably. Bacterial pneumonia was another set. Syncytial virus pneumonia accounted for a big block of the deaths that had been called influenza. And unidentifiable pathogen was a major block of people dying of pneumonia and they couldn't find bacteria or viruses at all. So it could have been toxins of various sorts. A major source of pneumonia without germs is endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide, leaking out of the intestine. And so when anyone is seriously stressed, endotoxin tends to become one of the factors leading to pneumonia.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat questions the attribution of deaths to influenza, suggesting that endotoxins and other factors might be responsible for pneumonia.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the body's retoxifying trying to get rid of it, right? Yeah, the endotoxin or whatever toxin is causing it. When you're very healthy, your liver and your brain in particular have detoxifying systems that keep you healthy. You don't notice the toxins being destroyed.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies the concept of detoxification, explaining how a healthy body handles toxins.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it can eat up germs and activate toxins and excrete them, get rid of them. Never knew it had them.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that a healthy body can efficiently eliminate pathogens and toxins without noticeable symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a lot of it was the same causes of the flu that killed 40,000 to 60,000 people every winter before COVID. The post-influenza syndrome was already defined very similar to the post-COVID syndrome, leaving permanent fibrosis of the lungs and a general weakening of the organism.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat draws parallels between pre-COVID influenza deaths and post-COVID syndromes, suggesting similar underlying causes.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, just roughly, yeah. It's sick babies and very old people always die of increased incidence of respiratory pneumonia during the winter season generally.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reiterates that vulnerable populations are most susceptible to respiratory illnesses during winter.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a gene-destroying material. The things that have been used for influenza and herpes treatments that were originated about 30 years ago, those... actually had very, very horrible side effects, but they came into use anyway.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes remdesivir as a "gene-destroying material" with severe side effects, referencing older antiviral treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, the fact that the......comparison of two hospitals near each other in Germany during the first few months of the so-called pandemic, one hospital was influenced by a doctor who administered only the amount of oxygen through a cannula, just free breathing, that was clearly beneficial. They had zero mortality from the COVID cases. Oh, just enough oxygen, not the ventilator. Yeah, and a nearby hospital that followed the instructions of the World Health Organization and CDC, that hospital had a 60% mortality, just the difference was only that they stuck a tube in there. Chest and forced oxygen into their lungs, extremely high mortality once you stick the tube into them, and that in itself was known to be almost always deadly, but prescribed, ordered by the CDC, so it was mass murder for a couple of months.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights a stark contrast in mortality rates between two German hospitals, attributing the difference to the use of ventilators versus simple oxygen administration.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there were many approaches better than Remdesivir, and any approach practically was better than intubation.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat asserts that alternative treatments and avoiding intubation were superior to remdesivir and mechanical ventilation.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, they're both somewhat anti-inflammatory, especially ivermectin has several anti-inflammatory effects, so does aspirin and antihistamines. From the very beginning, people were seeing very good effects from aspirin and antihistamines.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that ivermectin, aspirin, and antihistamines possess anti-inflammatory properties that contribute to symptom relief.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but that's very closely connected to antibiotic and antiviral effect of aspirin. A general, not very specific, but definitely existing antiviral effect. But it doesn't go in and kill some so-called virus, right? What does it do with the body? It just helps the body to deal with whatever's going on? Yeah, when it's acting as an anti-inflammatory, it's preventing disruption of the immune system. Preventing disruption. Letting your immune system continue in a highly energized way. Once you go over the edge into the prostaglandin and cytokine storm degree of inflammation, you've knocked out the energy system. And instead of producing lots of heat and carbon dioxide and usable energy, you just produce lactic acid and shift away from oxidative processes. And oxidative processes are necessary for destroying viruses.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that aspirin's antiviral effect stems from its anti-inflammatory properties, which prevent immune system disruption and support oxidative processes essential for fighting viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and laxatives use is historical and turns out to be very well based because of the endotoxins. I mean, when you've eaten something that you can't digest or you get constipated, and inflammation begins inside your intestine, producing, among other things, lactic acid, histamine, serotonin, and those make your blood vessels of the, that should be a barrier against toxins in your intestine, lets them absorb the endotoxin, and that lowers your whole systemic body energy, and that can lead to death from pneumonia in a week first.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat validates the historical use of laxatives, linking constipation and intestinal inflammation to endotoxin absorption and systemic energy depletion.

**RAY PEAT:** About 150 years ago, pathologists and the coroners recognized bowel inflammation as a major cause of death.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights the historical recognition of bowel inflammation as a significant cause of mortality.

**RAY PEAT:** And the bowel gets inflamed because these endotoxins are, when we don't have sufficient bowel movement in getting things out, it just creates a problem down there, an inflammation, and then it causes all kinds of issues. Yeah, leading to inflammation of the lungs and brain and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how insufficient bowel movements lead to endotoxin buildup, causing inflammation and affecting various organs.

**RAY PEAT:** And they tried to convince people that it didn't matter how much you pooped, it just... Yeah, for example, one professor of medicine said that there's no such thing as bowel toxins causing sickness and headaches. He said it's all basically in your mind. And to demonstrate that headaches weren't caused by toxins, supposedly he had his medical students, he stuffed their rectums with wads of cotton. And the next day, the people who often had headaches reported that they had a headache. So he released a publicity that, see, we've demonstrated that it isn't poison, it's pressure. And that was just part of... it didn't say anything at all about toxins in the intestine, but just that whatever the level of toxins exists in the intestine, if you have pressure as well, you're going to get a headache or other sickness.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recounts a historical attempt to discredit the link between bowel toxins and illness, using a flawed experiment involving rectal cotton.

**RAY PEAT:** And animal studies showed that just putting a balloon into the intestine, if the animal is in a good physiological state, you can blow up the balloon and nothing, no symptoms occur. But if you give them some insulin to lower their blood glucose and then blow up the balloon, the combination of the stress from low blood sugar combined with stretching the intestine will produce all kinds of things. Not just headaches, but epileptic seizures, asthma spasms, all kinds of psychosomatic changes of circulation and excitation.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat cites animal studies demonstrating that intestinal distension combined with low blood sugar can trigger various adverse physiological responses.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, no, not at all. It's just normal. It's kind of natural, right? Yeah, it has lots of other beneficial effects. Yeah, I've had some effects. Even a little bit of green tea will even move things around a little bit more. Isn't that interesting? I guess there must be some caffeine in green tea too, right? Yeah, a small amount. It's just weaker than coffee.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat affirms that coffee consumption is normal and beneficial, and notes that green tea also has mild effects on bowel regularity due to its caffeine content.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Yeah. It happened that when I was four years old, I just loved the smell and taste of coffee.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares a childhood fondness for coffee.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it helps to balance everything. Helps to balance everything. You can't count on it making up for food. No. If you drink coffee on an empty stomach, it can give you the shakes and accentuate hypoglycemia. So that's why it'd be good with food, with breakfast or something like that, right? With breakfast, yeah.

**RAY PEAT:** **CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that coffee helps balance bodily functions but should not replace food. Consuming it on an empty stomach can worsen hypoglycemia and cause jitters.

**RAY PEAT:** Not really. No. Some people who have a really inflamed problem find that cilium husk Is the same thing vegetables? canned vegetables with the exactly the same vegetables Material. Are a source of nutrition they often thrive. Once your metabolism has slowed down it actually slows your metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat addresses concerns about laxative dependency, stating it's not a significant issue. He also notes that psyllium husk and canned vegetables can be beneficial for those with slowed metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** And if you want to do a little thyroid and you want to do a little thyroid but the key is taking it at morning right upon waking midday or noon and then again right before bed so once twice or three times a day but always at those times and that's because that's when your body's naturally producing its own testosterone and all we want to do is amplify that sine wave we don't want to start to take testosterone at a time where our bodies purged it from the bloodstream instead we want to take it at a time where those levels are already spiking and we're just subtly helping to increase them

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises on the timing of thyroid hormone intake to align with the body's natural testosterone production cycles.

**RAY PEAT:** So if you're looking to increase your testosterone or androgen levels and you want an alternative to pharmaceutical testosterone replacement therapies there's nothing that does it better than pine pollen pure and we love this product i i've been taking well what i do and and what you should do are two different things but i'll tell you i've been i've been using it for years it's a food it's a pollen and uh little pine trees do their thing in the spring and pine pollen and all the animals and everybody eats it and who knows it's just a pretty magical substance

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses pine pollen as a natural alternative for increasing testosterone and androgen levels.

**RAY PEAT:** So that's the the main argument against them when they're incorporated into living organisms they're already extremely highly purified and so they're they're safe in that form

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that minerals incorporated into living organisms are highly purified and safe.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, there are many studies showing that even the type of isotope within a given element it can be chemically pure in the chemical sense but have the wrong balance of isotopes Isotopes yes, the typical molecule comes in the standard form sometimes it has an extra neutrino extra neutron so the atomic weight is a little different and those are just randomly mixed together in the uh mineral sources but a plant sorts out and prefers certain isotopes over the others so it's it's the ultimate and find not just chemical purity but a bias in the weight of the a particular chemical element the weight and the energetics of it from the living is just different just yeah

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the importance of isotopic balance in minerals, explaining how plants selectively absorb specific isotopes.

**RAY PEAT:** For example, the cane sugar grown in the tropics from the first rain that comes out of a warm ocean has more deuterium. It's a heavier form of water and high deuterium content accelerates the aging process in the early 50s when heavy water was being used in the nuclear industry no one had studied it biologically so they gave experimental mice deuterium oxide rather than ordinary water and they turned gray and got arthritis and deteriorated much faster because of the different isotope but organisms plants filter out the preferred isotope apparently for every element that has a significant difference in atomic weight if you use sugar that was grown in a northern and either central or eastern region where the rain has the tropical rain has fallen out and then coming over the rockies for example, the cold temperature the cold temperature squeezes out even more of the heavy water so the any water that's left over the northern plains is likely to be very depleted in deuterium and so the crops especially sugar beet growing in those areas is has more light water which is biologically more compatible

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the biological impact of deuterium in water, noting that high deuterium content accelerates aging and that plants selectively absorb lighter isotopes.

**RAY PEAT:** All of these atoms come in more or less a random arrangement of the distribution of the neutrons and protons it's just a random thing as far as I know

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the natural isotopic composition of elements.

**RAY PEAT:** I guess it would yeah anything that causes inflammation inflammation yeah okay here's one for you how to gain weight I'm a 66 year old female long covid digestive symptoms pain in location of the pancreas liver fullness fatigue have to lie down too tired to complete more than some of the basic activities fat malabsorption fall asleep after eating wow so this lady's got a lot going on here first thing would be to check thyroid function and body temperature very low body temperature depletes your ability to make energy and so if your body temperature is very low you would want to have a blood test to see in particular TSH which causes inflammation if it's high and vitamin D deficiency of which causes inflammation and under metabolism vitamin D deficiency right

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises a 66-year-old female with long COVID symptoms to check thyroid function and body temperature, as low temperature indicates under-metabolism and potential vitamin D deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah a person who spends for example on the beach a person spending hours a day with a lot of skin exposed to full sunlight will have maybe 150 wow yeah I'm out in the sun a lot, it would be fun to take it just to see as an experiment you know to see what the levels are, it would be interesting

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that significant sun exposure can lead to high vitamin D levels.

**RAY PEAT:** TSH and again for those who are new to Dr. Pete's work and he's done quite a bit on thyroid your favorite TSH level is... Close to zero. Close to zero. Right.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat states that his preferred TSH level is close to zero.

**RAY PEAT:** I've been attending to the TSH issue ever since it came into use. First, when synchroid substituted for armor thyroid, armor had been the standard of thyroid potency for about 50 years. Then, when synthetic thyroxine was developed, a huge advertising campaign convinced doctors that the T3, they didn't know at the time that T3 was the only active thyroid hormone. They said, scientifically, you should use the pure thyroxine, not the random mix that you find in the armor thyroid. They used a blood test, protein-bound iodine, and found that only 5% of the population was deficient in protein-bound iodine. So they said, almost no one needs a thyroid supplement, but when they need it, thyroxine should be the thing. And using the meaningless protein-bound iodine test, all through the 1950s into the 1960s, they were saying, almost no one needs a thyroid supplement. And it turned out that there was absolutely no biological basis for saying that protein-bound iodine had anything to do with your thyroid function. At that point, they were convinced that T4 thyroxine was the only scientific way to treat thyroid and that only 5% of the people might need it. And so they discovered very… …precise ways of measuring TSH using radioimmunoassay, and so they picked out the 5% of the population who had the highest TSH and said, that's the number that is justified to give thyroxine to. But it was entirely phony based on a meaningless test that that 5% of TSH was established. So ever since the 1960s, that has been refined, discouraging, literally telling doctors to ignore all of the traditional signs of hypothyroidism, to ignore body temperature, all of the signs like falling hair and problems maintaining the weight, either being too thin or too thin. Ignore all of those, go only by TSH, but without looking at the history of it. It might sound scientific in some way, but it's totally irrational. Irrational.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat critiques the historical shift from Armour thyroid to synthetic thyroxine, highlighting the flawed reasoning behind TSH testing and the disregard for traditional hypothyroidism symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** It turns out that TSH directly activates inflammatory systems, and a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism come from elevated TSH, not from an actual deficiency of thyroxine. An elevated TSH.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that elevated TSH can directly cause inflammation and contribute to hypothyroidism symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** Armor, yes. But that's no longer available, correct? Oh, it's still available, but when the Armor Company sold out in the early 90s, they had been testing every batch. They had both pork thyroid, beef thyroid, and a mixture. And every batch was tested for biological activity on mice, so it was refined right down to 1% of effect on metabolic rate. It was scientifically ultra-precise. During those years when the synthoid people were saying, don't use a natural product, it isn't scientifically refined enough. During those years, there were times when the thyroxine activity of synthoid was off, I think, by as much as 40%.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat praises Armour thyroid for its precise standardization and criticizes Synthroid for its inconsistent thyroxine activity.

**RAY PEAT:** Mostly it's I think made in Mexico and it's popular in Latin America and somewhat in Europe. So if you had to take it, wanted to take it, that's what you would go for, the Seno Plus? Yeah. I wouldn't hesitate to take armor even though they really don't pay attention.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends Seno Plus as a viable thyroid option, noting its origin and popularity, and expresses no hesitation in using Armour thyroid despite its perceived lack of attention to detail.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if it's actual glandular material, the ratio will be somewhere between 3 to 1 and 4 to 1, but the question is how pure it is and whether it has been diluted and standardized. So it's very good to be cautious and take maybe something like 15 milligrams of the powdered material. Just a little bit for a test and see how you feel and get your body temperature.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises caution with desiccated thyroid products, suggesting a low starting dose and monitoring body temperature to assess potency and purity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and so people often not realizing how potent they are very often overdose on their Seno Plus, you should start with an eighth of a tablet. Yeah, and just kind of work your way up.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat warns that Seno Plus can be potent and advises starting with a small dose to avoid overdose.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, with Synthroid, women are much less able to activate thyroxin turning it into T3. So they'd be better with Armour, the ladies? Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that women may benefit more from Armour thyroid than Synthroid due to their reduced ability to convert thyroxine to T3.

**RAY PEAT:** Unfortunately, the researchers generally have failed to notice that because of estrogen level, women's livers are much less likely to fully activate the thyroxin. And so sometimes a woman can get more and more hypothyroid the more thyroxin they take because it begins diluting the T3 that came out of their own thyroid glands. And if their liver is blocked by estrogen, they can get worse by taking more thyroxin.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that estrogen can impair women's liver function, hindering thyroxine conversion to T3 and potentially worsening hypothyroidism with increased thyroxine intake.

**RAY PEAT:** Basically, I don't know, but I've experienced some things and found that occasionally there would be a resonance with something that I wasn't hearing through my ears, but by resonating through my sinuses, something in the environment that happened to be vibrating at a different frequency from my heart. I would hear this ticking, wondering why my heart rate was doing one thing and the ticking in my head was doing something else and found it turned out to be something in the environment just resonating with my head.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat speculates that unusual head thumping could be due to environmental resonance rather than a cardiac issue.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I'm very skeptical. That would improve heart disease. Oh no, atherosclerosis is an inflammatory condition that affects your heart at the same time as the blood vessels. But people have removed the plaque and chemically stained it and found that it's full of breakdown products from polyunsaturated fat, age pigment basically.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses skepticism about chondroitin sulfate reversing heart disease, attributing atherosclerosis to inflammation and polyunsaturated fat breakdown products.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, you eat too much fish. That's why I advocate only the low-fat fish. Low-fat fish, which are, what are some of your low-fatters? Cod and sole. Cod and sole are the best ones, call it cod and sole. That's why the salmon are, they got a lot of poofers in there, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, good old poofers.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises consuming low-fat fish like cod and sole, and warns against excessive intake of fatty fish like salmon due to their polyunsaturated fat content.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Okay, in Dr. Pete's experience, how does vitamin A supplementation, how long does it take to clear skin problems like follicular hypokeratosis? I've had experience with the leukoplatia, which is on the moist surfaces, for example, inside your cheeks, it can, the cells get swollen and waterlogged and they can stick out so that you bite your cheeks unavoidably. But that's considered a precancerous condition. But I found that whenever I was extremely deficient in vitamin A, I would get leukoplatia and so I tested it with, if I took 50,000 or 100,000 units of vitamin A just for two or three days, it would disappear completely. So it depends on how deficient you are and what caused your deficiency. Estrogen happens to accelerate the turnover and the formation of the dead teratine state of the cells and vitamin A has an anti-estrogen effect on the skin, slowing the turnover, creating less of the dandruff effect and it's very easy to see on the wet tissues like the uterine cervix. Leukoplatia is sometimes an excuse for doing a hysterectomy, but just putting a vitamin A on topically in just a few days, same as inside your mouth, it can totally abolish the white abnormal cells.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that vitamin A can effectively treat leukoplakia, a precancerous condition, by counteracting estrogen's effects on skin cell turnover.

**RAY PEAT:** Weak capillaries. Weak capillaries. That's kind of a young age for it happening. Even 80 or 90 year olds it becomes very common so that a 90 year old will typically have those from red to brown splotches covering their surface fairly well.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies weak capillaries as the cause of purple dots on the skin and notes their increased prevalence with age.

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your cortisol low, avoiding unopposed estrogen causes your adrenals to overproduce cortisol and underproduce DHEA, pregnenolone and progesterone. Keeping your cholesterol up as a precursor to pregnenolone and DHEA, that toughens all of your connective tissues and your capillaries. Keep Mr. Cholesterol up so I have lots of eggs, good? Carbohydrates are how we make cholesterol. Carbohydrates not the eggs, carbohydrates. It takes lots and lots of eggs to raise your serum cholesterol for just a moderate amount of extra carbohydrates can do it. Like oats or rice? Yep, just making sure they're well cooked so they digest easily.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises on strengthening capillaries by managing cortisol and estrogen levels, maintaining adequate cholesterol through carbohydrates, and consuming well-cooked oats or rice.

**RAY PEAT:** DHEA falling in relation to cortisol is going to weaken all of your connective tissues and the vitamin D deficiency, it isn't just the bones that are strengthened by adequate vitamin D, but all of the connective tissues and muscles are weak in the vitamin D deficiency. Second thing is to make sure you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D and then if that's adequate then check to make sure you don't have an excess of cortisol and estrogen relative to the pregnenol and DHEA.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat links DHEA deficiency and vitamin D deficiency to weakened connective tissues and muscles, recommending adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, and balancing cortisol and estrogen with pregnenolone and DHEA.

**RAY PEAT:** Stress, pretty much. Yeah, hypothyroidism, B vitamin deficiency can do it, various kinds of poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies stress, hypothyroidism, B vitamin deficiency, and various forms of poisoning as factors contributing to excess estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think so, 5,000 units a day. Some doctors say that's excessive, but I've never seen anyone get a very high blood level from 5,000.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat believes that taking 5,000 units of vitamin D daily is safe and unlikely to cause excessively high blood levels.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and thyroid. And thyroid, that old thyroid again, boy. So that's the deal, you want to get that TSH down to near zero, as close to zero as you can, Doc, right? I think so, as long as you're eating well.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reiterates the importance of thyroid function for scoliosis and advises aiming for a TSH level close to zero, provided adequate nutrition is maintained.

**RAY PEAT:** Can you explain a little bit? If you take a lot of thyroid, you can get your TSH down very low, but also your metabolic rate is increasing, and so you have to make sure you're getting enough of the vitamins and other nutrients.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that while high thyroid intake can lower TSH, it also increases metabolic rate, necessitating sufficient vitamin and nutrient intake.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it should be tested, have a doctor take swabs and such to see what's happening. See what it is, right.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends medical testing for a persistent blister on the shin to identify the underlying cause, whether it's a toxin or infection.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't recognize that word yeah I've seen that somewhere but I don't know what it is either doc berberine berberine no hmm I don't either

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is unfamiliar with the term "berberine" in the context of lowering blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** um how much total phosphorus intake um matter if the diet has a good calcium-phosphorus ratio is a low phosphorus diet preferable to a normal phosphorus diet if the calcium-phosphorus ratio is exactly the same in both cases if both of them are extremely low, then it's possible to be deficient in both of them but in the normal range, it's the ratio that counts most

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat emphasizes that the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio is more important than the absolute intake of phosphorus, as long as both are within a normal range.

**RAY PEAT:** For example, all through the 1940s, experiments were being done on the rhythm of estrogen effect in relation to cancer. If you gave even a very small dose of estrogen continually, it had a very high rate of questionization of all of the organs and tissues. But if you interrupted it regularly about once a month, then it was harmless. And the function of progesterone is to knock out the estrogen system, stopping the synthesis and the receptor response to it once a month prevents cancerization of all of the tissues.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that continuous estrogen exposure increases cancer risk, while intermittent exposure and the presence of progesterone mitigate this risk by regulating estrogen's effects.

**RAY PEAT:** So if your progesterone is inactive, it's not going to be able to excrete any estrogen. The enzymes that are excreting estrogen don't remove it from cells, so the estrogen inside cells can go wild, leading to cancer, but it doesn't show up in the blood because it isn't being excreted, it's being formed right in the tissue. The uterus and the breast, for example, were thought of as target tissues for estrogen coming from the ovaries. But in rat experiments, if you take out the ovaries, wait a week, the serum estrogen is just as high as it ever was, because in the absence of progesterone, all of your tissues begin secreting, forming and secreting estrogen. But the uterus and breast, instead of waiting to be stimulated by ovarian estrogen in the absence of progesterone, they begin forming their own... estrogen locally. So, in endometriosis, for example, the uterus begins forming estrogen that doesn't have to depend on the ovarian estrogen. And a thyroid deficiency and a progesterone deficiency will increase endometriosis and eventually cancer by the internal... uterine production of too much estrogen, same in the breast. The breast tumor begins producing its own estrogen, doesn't need getting estrogen from the blood.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on how progesterone deficiency leads to uncontrolled estrogen production within tissues, increasing cancer risk, and explains that various tissues can produce their own estrogen in the absence of progesterone and thyroid support.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it should be used intermittently for about half to two-thirds of the month against a background of adequate vitamin D and thyroid so that you aren't overproducing estrogen in the so-called target organs. Fat muscle, uterus, breast, everything can take over the production of estrogen. And so it's very hard to imagine how any tissue could conceivably suffer from an estrogen deficiency because when it's under stress, not getting adequate thyroid and progesterone, every tissue can become a source of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises intermittent use of progesterone, alongside adequate vitamin D and thyroid, to prevent excessive estrogen production in target organs and tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, every little bit of the body matters. You can get along without various parts, but not as well. You just have to pay a little closer attention to eating digestible foods, keeping your thyroid and vitamin D and general nutrition at an optimal level. But considering everything, the lack of an appendix isn't a terrible problem.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat acknowledges the importance of the appendix but states that its absence is not a major health issue, provided one maintains optimal nutrition, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I mean, you can get things through the mail, right, Dr. Pete? Sure. So, yeah, you can go by his advice and just get things in the mail. I mean, this Sinoplus, what's the name of that place in Mexico, the Sinoplus, do you remember? Oh, yeah, there are two of them. One, the original Farmacia del Nino up near the border, it's a little corner pharmacy. Very helpful people you can talk to on the phone. And there's a big pharmacy in Mexico City which took advantage of the name, but they changed it to Farmacias with an S, del Nino dot MX. And they have the advantage of being close to an international airport so they can give slightly faster service.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that thyroid supplements can be obtained through mail order from pharmacies in Mexico, specifically mentioning Farmacia del Nino.

**RAY PEAT:** It's really good to learn a moderate amount about thyroid function, you'll very likely in a day or two know far more than your doctor knows.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that individuals can gain more knowledge about thyroid function than their doctors by studying the topic.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and low thyroid people often have that extreme ability to release histamine. They've got red ears and red cheeks and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat notes that individuals with low thyroid function often exhibit increased histamine release, leading to symptoms like red ears and cheeks.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if it's actual glandular material, the ratio will be somewhere between 3 to 1 and 4 to 1, but the question is how pure it is and whether it has been diluted and standardized. So it's very good to be cautious and take maybe something like 15 milligrams of the powdered material. Just a little bit for a test and see how you feel and get your body temperature.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises caution with desiccated thyroid products, suggesting a low starting dose and monitoring body temperature to assess potency and purity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, temperature and heart rate, first thing in the morning. And the temperature, normal, or where we want it, minimum, what is it, is it 97.7? Something around that. And then after eating breakfast, it should fairly quickly come up to 98.5, and later in the day, it's okay if it gets to 99.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies morning body temperature and heart rate as key indicators of thyroid function, recommending a minimum temperature of 97.7°F, rising to 98.5°F after breakfast, and potentially reaching 99°F later in the day.

**RAY PEAT:** Carbohydrates, since your morning cortisol is almost always high, it's a response to low blood sugar during the night. The more you use up your stored glycogen during the night, the higher your morning cortisol is going to be. So, getting it down quickly with something like orange juice or oatmeal is a good idea. Oh, so orange juice actually gets the cortisol down. Getting your blood glucose back up. Oh, your blood glucose back up.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that morning cortisol is elevated due to low blood sugar from overnight glycogen depletion. Consuming carbohydrates like orange juice or oatmeal can quickly raise blood glucose and lower cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** If your thyroid and progesterone are good, you can make it through eight or ten hours of sleep without getting hypoglycemia. But some people wake up in the night and have some milk and orange juice. Boy, I tell you what, I don't know what it is, but for me, if I wake up in the middle of the night and do some like raw goat's milk, you know, just warm it a little bit, shoot. Boy, it's like manna from heaven, Doc. Yeah, it's ideal. And I put sugar in it, though, too, you know, the organic beet sugar. Yeah, it's very good.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that adequate thyroid and progesterone levels promote uninterrupted sleep. He shares a personal anecdote about the restorative effects of warm raw goat's milk with sugar when waking up during the night.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you can get good milk, though. You don't have to get milk with all shut up, right? Yeah, a lot of places now make it evident that they don't give their cows hormones. Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that hormone-free milk is available, with many producers clearly stating their practices.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yes, thyroid and aspirin. I will generally do it fairly quickly. Thyroid and aspirin, good old aspirin. And making sure your vitamin D is okay.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends thyroid hormone and aspirin as effective treatments for enlarged prostate, along with ensuring adequate vitamin D levels.
