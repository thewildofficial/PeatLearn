**RAY PEAT:** "So far, I still haven't seen any real evidence of a pandemic and there are lawyers around the world who are suing the government to reveal the scientific basis for the lockdowns and the masks and all of that, they're keeping it secret if there is any real scientific basis. And yesterday I saw that Michael Yeaton, the former Pfizer vice president, has made another statement. And he says it's the science behind it is so non-existent that he's accepting that there could be other motives. And he says from what's known about the spike protein and the RNA so-called vaccines that it's very probable that they could have long-range degenerative effects breaking down organs over coming months and years and that one of the possibilities is that it's intended to depopulate the world."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat for his sense of what is truly happening regarding the pandemic and the scientific basis for public health measures.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, the workers at North Carolina in the virus department. I published several papers, a long series about 10 years ago, on how you can remove the nucleic acid section that describes specifically the protein that allows the virus to attach to human cell surfaces if you inject that into an animal virus, you can make it stick to a certain receptor on human cells. And the current coronaviruses contain this adhesive protein which in the process of making the virus stick to the surface of our cells, it inactivates the protein that it sticks to, and that protein, the ACE2 enzyme, androtensin converting enzyme number 2, happens to be the degrading proteolytic enzyme that breaks down androtensin 2, which is the promoter of high blood pressure inflammation, degeneration and all kinds of bad things in our body and so ACE, the androtensin converting enzyme, they found that if you block that or if you block the actions of the androtensin 1,2, the short peptide, that you can relieve high blood pressure, and at the same time it happens to relieve nerve degeneration, they're trying it out in Alzheimer's disease, kidney disease, muscle wasting, age-related tissue deterioration, muscle shrinkage, everything that aging and stress has been known to do. Hypertension, cancer, and all of those things are promoted by anthrotensin, and so if you block them, you get these very surprising therapeutic results. And very early people found that these blood pressure drugs were therapeutic for the coronavirus-infected people. But the medical establishment said, well, that protein ACE2 enzyme is where the virus sticks. And so if you increase that enzyme, you're going to make yourself more susceptible to the attachment of the virus. But it happens that if you don't have an abundance of that enzyme, you will have an oversupply of the proinflammatory degenerative enzotensin peptide. So the medical journals for a while were full of advocacy of promoting the blockage of this protective enzyme, but the facts turned out the other way, promoting the ACE2 enzyme turns out to be a radically important part of the defense against infection and symptoms."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to explain the spike protein.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's leaving one of the most horrible possible proteins being produced by us adopting the RNA from the virus so that we become virus-like and produce our own toxic a pro-inflammatory protein. So that's the reason why there's so many arguments with the ten pennies around and Kerry Mahdi is going to be in tomorrow and so many other people that there could be some really detrimental long-term effects of this thing."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the injection causes the body to produce the spike protein that knocks out the anti-inflammatory system, referencing Michael Yedin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Absolutely no evidence for that. He just says it. For 50 years we've known that our bodies have reverse transcriptase that can integrate that right into our own genes permanently, and a group at Harvard MIT a few months ago, almost a year ago, published in feature research showing that, in fact, human cells can and do incorporate the vaccine RNA section into the genes of the cell."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the CDC scientists understand that vaccine RNA can integrate into human genes.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you look at history, going back a hundred years of the U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC, they don't have a good record. If you look at the actual unpublicized things they have been experimenting on children, going into Guatemala to test dangerous, in fact, orphans, for example, to experiment on. It's really just something like out of a horror movie, the actual history of the CDC."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the general safety of vaccines and if they disrupt the innate immune system.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, to the extent that you over-activate the antibody producing system. That's sort of the most superficial, visible part of the immune system that really derives from the imaginary side-chains that Paul Ehrlich intended to sell his drugs at the beginning of the 20th century. It's a doctrine that came from the chemical industry that turned into the basis of official government corporate description of how immunity works if you have antibodies supposedly immune. But meanwhile, actual science was showing that plants have learned immunity. You give them a trace of vaccination, and you sensitize the system, and a few days later, that same trace amount that was harmless can become deadly because you've created an allergy. And that same thing happens in animals. A trace of something that is harmful but not deadly can activate an oversensitivity that causes sickness, and the junk that goes along with any vaccine is a risk. It's where you create experimental allergies in animal experimental animals is to give them a little bit of extraneous material. Wait two weeks, come back and give it again and you've created an allergic animal. And so that's one of the side effects of just about any vaccine. And so allergies have been one of the fastest growing problems in the United States. In our culture, just everywhere, and even in the animals, we've had natural docs on that have argued that all these little vaccines they give the animals to, some of them itch, you know, for a couple of years. I had one girl that itched for about three years before she got over it. Just couldn't stop it, you know, just itch, you know, just itch."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if vaccines disrupt the innate immune system.

**RAY PEAT:** "All of the whole organism, all the different levels will adjust and toughen up. So there's not really any part of our organism that isn't involved in immunity and resistance. The ability to produce energy efficiently is really our most basic immune process. And that's every cell, everything in our body, this life force that we embody, chi or spirit or whatever you call it, it's all involved in in resistance and working with anything that's assaulting it. Sustaining itself."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the body naturally adjusts to challenges.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's a shift from vital functioning cells to fibrotic inflammation, scar-like tissues. It doesn't seem like it's really a natural process, aging. I mean, aren't we kind of wired up to live happily and scar-free for a lot longer than we are doing as a culture?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if aging is a natural process.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think one of the things that causes that is that our environment now has too much oxygen not enough carbon dioxide. Yeah yeah how could we how can we retain more carbon dioxide? Moving to 8,000 or 9,000 feet. 8,000 feet? Leadville, Colorado if you can adapt to it. Wow. The heart disease, cancer and dementia rate, every 1,000 feet higher you live in altitude, the lower the cancer and heart disease. Is that right? So just because more CO2 is retained, so when we exercise, how can we actually get rid of CO2, right? If it's bad exercise. Bad exercise. What would be good exercise, in your opinion? Anything that raises your body temperature. It turns out that the good exercise that has prolonged effects is anything that raises your body temperature by muscle heat production. And they've compared exercise to just warming the body. And you get the same anti-inflammatory. Anti-heart disease effects, anti-cancer effects and so on. Just by getting your body temperature up, which good exercise does."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about retaining carbon dioxide and good exercise.

**RAY PEAT:** "Heat producing. Heat producing, which would be examples? Muscle resistant exercise. Leptin weights. Lifting weights or walking or running in short bursts. But it's a prolonged breathless kind of exercise where you become very hypo-capnic, very deficient in carbon dioxide. We're not getting rid of carbon dioxide. Yeah, you're increasing carbon dioxide. You're increasing. And that decreases the inflammatory production of lactic acid. And we can do that as our heart and our muscles and blood vessels get stronger, right? Mm-hmm. Right? Then we can retain more of that carbon dioxide. Yeah, and the muscle adaptation to exercise increases the volume of the muscle. And the ability of the muscle to produce protective steroid hormones rather than destructive estrogenic hormones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for examples of good exercise and how it relates to carbon dioxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's one of the benefits. Give some blood."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if giving blood is a way to get rid of excess iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's one of the benefits. Give some blood."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the historical practice of bloodletting.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's one of the benefits. Give some blood."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of giving blood.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but the flavonoids are another. And that's in milk, right? In the milk. Orange juice and milk are very safe ways to get very high intake of the bioflavonoids. Bioflavonoids."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why Dr. Peat is a fan of orange juice.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, fresh grass has the highest content of flavonoids, hay is fairly good, so dried grass still has lots of stuff, a highly grain-concentrated diet is the worst. You can actually, if you don't have a source locally, you can actually get, I've seen organic grass-fed milk at the Whole Foods. I mean, you can actually buy it if you want. Yeah, you can buy it if you want. And the flavonoids are a great virtue. Are in there. So that's another good argument to find grass-fed butter, like the ones we get from Ireland or something. Yeah. Even butter will contain these. These flavonoids. Flavonoids."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the source of milk and the importance of grass-fed cows.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, shift the diet away from fats to some extent. Increase the carbohydrates. Carbohydrates? Especially, yeah, orange juice is just the best, but any carbohydrate is better than more fat. Really? So many people say fats are so good for us, but talk about that a bit."

**CONTEXT:** Ben, aged 71, asks for a regime to increase low testosterone and gain muscle.

**RAY PEAT:** "The saturated fats, going back to Hans Selye's experiments in which the rapeseed oil was considered to be heart toxic, so they developed canola oil with I think it was a russic acid that was reduced, but Hans Selye showed that it was linoleic acid, which is still too high in canola oil. He showed that the high polyunsaturated fats were what were causing heart cell death. He would slice up the rats' heart after they had eaten a high PUFA diet and find dead heart cells all through the tissue. But then he fed them besides the same amount, he didn't reduce the PUFA, but he added a lot of cocoa butter, which is very high in stearic acid. And just getting the highly saturated long chain fat to balance and protect against the PUFA, he eliminated the heart death."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of fats in health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Fruit of fruit is higher in the protective flavonoids. Okay, the grains are very low in them. But then the protein should be adequate. You don't want too much of the methyl donors. The age-promoting amino acids are mostly cysteine and methionine. So you want just a moderate amount of those. And then the type of muscle activity, like using dumbbells and squats, just a few of those, like ten repetitions of dumbbells and ten squats or sit-ups will build muscle volume."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if carbohydrates include rice or pasta for muscle building.

**RAY PEAT:** "Beef fat is rich in stearic acid and monounsaturated which are safe. Pork fat can go all the way up into the 30 percent linoleic acid which is very age-promoting but there's one pork farm in Maryland that has experimented feeding a good high carbohydrate diet to their pigs and they got their proof of content all the way down to four percent. Beef fat sometimes is as high as three percent. So their pork was very competitive with beef for safety and high stearic acid content."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about animal fats like pork and beef fat.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, as long as you don't put raw seeds and nuts and raw vegetables in them. You don't need all that stuff."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if fruit smoothies are good for us.

**RAY PEAT:** "Cooked vegetables are a way of getting your well-balanced carbohydrates, but proteins are the main thing that acidifies our system. So if your urine is slightly acidic, you're much less likely to get kidney stones than a high-alkaline diet. So the people on a very vegan or excessively vegetarian diet tend to get a lot of kidney stones because the material crystallizes and deposits at a higher pH. I see. So our urine wants to be more in the 5-6 range. Yeah. Exercise producing carbon dioxide is one of the things that will help to keep your blood and urine slightly on the acidic side. Not acidic for the blood, but the less alkaline system, higher carbon dioxide, slight tendency towards hypercapnia. It is highly protective to all of your cells."

**CONTEXT:** Carol asks for suggestions for a system that is usually alkaline.

**RAY PEAT:** "People have been contacting me about that. Yeah, and I've seen stories too. Now, is it possible these vaccine-injected people are shedding something to girls? It's an obvious possibility. It hasn't been... People haven't done testing of swabs of their skin or condensing their exhaled breath and so on, but it's a very definite possibility that exactly as the virus can be exhaled or put into the sweat and urine, the vaccine RNA obviously can go the same route and the spike protein by knocking out ACE2 enzyme increases endotensin, endotensin increases aromatase and estrogen and prostaglandins and estrogen and prostaglandins are deeply involved in regulating the menstrual cycle, creating PMS and dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, changing of the length of the cycle and so on."

**CONTEXT:** Ryan asks if unvaccinated women are experiencing shortened cycles due to vaccinated friends, and if there's a scientific reason for this.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's logically just as possible as with the viral material. It's our breath contains the most surprising ascertainment of chemicals. Peptides, bits of nucleic acid, exactly the sort of thing that could carry virus-like fragments of RNA. You can even find isoprene in exhaled breath."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if people getting the injection could breathe out or share unwanted substances.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. No? Yeah. Humic substances. Humic, yeah. Just a component of dirt. Yeah. Which, it's probably harmless. Yeah, probably harmless, but..."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the value of ION Gut Health, made with aqueous humic substances.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a little bit, yeah. Good stuff in there? Yeah, a little dirt is completely harmless. Kids eat dirt all the time."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's true that organic vegetables don't need to be washed thoroughly.

**RAY PEAT:** "Allergies will cause a thickening. Something you ate getting into the blood, the endotoxin from bad digestion will circulate through your body causing sinus membranes, nasal membranes, lungs, everything to thicken up and have symptoms of inflammation, itching, burning. All of the inflammatory symptoms."

**CONTEXT:** Henry asks if his wife should be concerned about mild mucosal thickening in her sphenoid sinus.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh kefir is probably okay if it isn't very sour. If it has too much lactic acid, a large, like drinking a pint of it can upset your liver and give you a headache. You just have to be cautious with the quantity and the acid content, but there's really no benefit from culturing butter. They add strange industrial microorganisms byproducts to change the flavor, I guess. But butter itself, just the pure fresh formula, condenses when you shake up slightly sour milk, the milk, if it's naturally soured, has bacteria culture in it."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about cultured butter and kefir.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's the way we would make cottage cheese, for example, and if you want to make butter, you can let it stand for a few hours and still have sweet butter, but the idea of buttermilk was because if you left it out for eight or ten hours, it would start growing bacteria. Bacteria would fall in from the air, even if they didn't come from the cow, and the souring milk would create a faster making of the butter."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if leaving raw milk out to sour is beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and largely it's the diet. Goats prefer grazing on leaves and herbs. They're more reluctant to eat stuff like a high grain based diet and so their milk will have a lot more of the flavonoids than the average grain fed cow milk."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if goat milk is as beneficial as cow milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, for sure. For sure. You don't want to do that, right? No."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if animals eating genetically modified or glyphosate-laden food could be an issue.

**RAY PEAT:** "A couple of researchers, one of them named Sethi, S-E-T-H-I, traced the fate of DHA and EPA after they were ingested. And he found that by the time they reached the bloodstream, they were mostly oxidized and breaking down into other substances such as those. And it's those oxidized products that are so immunosuppressive. And you can call immunosuppression an anti-inflammatory and a resolving function. I think it's a dangerous way to resolve inflammation. I think of it as sort of analogous to the old treatment of arthritis with radioactive water. You can knock down inflammation with radiation, they used to treat acne with x-rays. With x-rays? Yeah, you can temporarily reduce inflammation with high PUFA content, oxidized fragments, or you can create the oxidized fragments quickly with x-rays. But the long-range effect is that you had a destroyed face and head from the X-ray treatment. So oxidation of the biomolecules, it's really this is where disease begins, starts, this is the action?"

**CONTEXT:** Mike asks about the anti-inflammatory benefits of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and Dr. Peat's stance on PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Part of it, yeah. It's a suppressive energy-lowering process. So all these poisons and chemicals and anything, this is what one of the chief causes? Toxins of oxidated, it slows down oxidative energy production and we compensate by increasing the glycolytic lactic acid processes that shift the whole organism towards degeneration. The lactic acid and that that is tied in else sometimes too. Myocardial infarctions and heart stuff with too much lactic acid, right?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if toxins and oxidation are chief causes of disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it in itself shifts cells in that same direction, so it's a self-promoting degenerative factor."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the link between lactic acid and heart issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Strophanthus is the plant and Strophanthus is the chemical. It's also called, the same substance, it's called Wabane, and it's a steroid glycoside that we make. It's an intrinsic natural adrenal and brain steroid in ourselves. And so the right, in aging metabolism, a slight, very, very small supplement of that can be therapeutic. It's similar to digitalis. Digitalis has, for example, some anti-cancer effects. But our natural version of it is strophanthin or wabane. Wabane, yeah. And yeah, he says, he said he's been using it for many years with no ill effects and just a few drops. You know, maybe that's interesting. And doesn't it do something with the peruvate or in the body that actually turns the lactic acid into? It stimulates our natural oxidative. Healthy processes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Strophanthus, a herb from Brazil used for heart muscle health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sugar? Oranges? Yeah, orange juice is a great. The best one. Such an orange juice guy you are. Do you drink a lot of it? Yeah. No question there. I just drink a lot of oranges. In Mexico where sweet oranges are cheap and easy to get. As fast as I could. I would get them, I would juice them and always have lots of juice."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what foods increase carbon dioxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, injuring the muscle will make it grow, but that's the extent of it. You're still hurting the whole organism. Are So what you're doing is you're actually damaging The muscle and it might make it bigger but it's for the whole organism. Isn't that good? Yeah"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about blood flow restriction training for muscle building.

**RAY PEAT:** "They've looked at the mitochondria of old people which are much less efficient Than young people's mitochondria and then they had them do only concentric exercise only contraction against resistance and no extension of the muscle under force and with just a few weeks of exercise they had created new young like mitochondria in these old people and it's the eccentric exercise like walking or running downhill or letting a weight down rather than lifting it Extending the muscle, stretching the muscle under resistance That's the eccentric muscle damaging kind of activity that causes the most muscle growth So if you want big muscles but not necessarily such good health, you can do eccentric muscle tearing exercises. That's tearing, right? When you do microscopic tearing damage."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effects of different types of exercise on muscle growth and health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's mostly the activation of the muscle. The activation of the muscle, but there's no... There's no resistance to it. I'm, you know, I'm just really stretching, stretching. Yeah. You don't want to force elongation of the muscle against resistance. Right. That would be counterproductive that way. Yeah, yeah. Yeah."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of deep stretching.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can usually get by taking it with a meal. The meal will delay the absorption, so it's more or less natural in the way it's absorbed by the cells a little bit with each meal. And the overall total amount that you need, animal studies as well as human. I showed that in a northern climate where you have winter weather and summer weather, the requirement for thyroid can be four times as high during the winter. Wow, four times. I found year after year that where I needed only a half a grain of armor thyroid, which would be a force. I would need two whole grains of armor or one whole tablet of Xenoplus during the winter months. Animals pretty much are the same. And so you have to be alert to changing according not only to the season, but your activity level and diet. And I have to. I do yard work in warm weather. I stop taking thyroid for a day or so so that I can be more physically active and not produce too much heat."

**CONTEXT:** Dana, who has no thyroid, asks about the minimum dosage of Sinoplus and how to take it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, Mary Shulman years ago had a good international list, but now they don't have the patient comments anymore that help you guide yourself to which doctor you wanted. If you ask around enough, you might be able to find a doctor who recognizes that women in particular tend to have problems because estrogen interferes with the conversion of thyroxin to the active hormone T3. So women always are more dependent on the actual preformed T3. And very often get an antithyroid effect from over accumulating the purithyroxine because the liver is our main source of conversion to the active hormone and estrogen, the average woman will have a sluggish liver for the conversion or for detoxifying alcohol for example. So women get drunk more easily usually than men because of the estrogen slowdown of the liver and if a person is depending on the liver as their main source of T3, if they have had a thyroid gland removed then their liver becomes the main source of T3. And it just can't do the work. Supplementing selenium or having seafood every week, the selenium allows our peripheral tissues to convert some of the T4 to T3. But if you have that problem of not proper reaction to the T4 then you simply need to have a product that supplements some T3."

**CONTEXT:** Rose, who has been hypothyroid for over 30 years, asks for guidance on finding a holistic doctor.

**RAY PEAT:** "Dogs like fruit. Do they? Yeah, we had a cocker spaniel that when the cherry tree had low-hanging cherries up on her leg to graze on the cherries. So would you do like just cut pieces of apple and things like that for your dog and see if they like them? Apple sauce for example. Interesting. Sort of more digestible. Yeah I never even thought about that."

**CONTEXT:** Gloria asks what kind of fructose she can give her dog for liver health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well I have articles on my website about two doctors in France and England in late 19th century who cured type 1 diabetes, the most deadly quick-acting wasting disease, by letting them eat all the sugar they craved, and within just two or three weeks, stopping the stress of inability to use glucose by letting them eat huge amounts of sugar, cured them, let their pancreas recover. Sugar supports the survival and the formation of pancreatic beta cells. So it has been used curatively for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it's usually the accumulation of large amounts of anti-metabolic PUFA in the body. And so if you just try to increase your sugar consumption, you're going to be adding calories to a system which… …is simply metabolically slow. You've got to first repair the metabolic process that has accumulated over years, usually with overweight fat tissue that contains a lot of unsaturated fats. Every time you get hungry, you pull pre-fatty acids into your bloodstream that— turn off your ability to oxidize sugar. And so in that kind of diabetes, the problem is to get your metabolism going again, and you can't just correct the problem by flooding the system with more carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** Vince asks how sugar can help reverse type 2 diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** "The same as with hot flashes. They can happen to men or women or young women. Anytime your metabolism is disturbed, your blood trigger following just a brief dip in your blood sugar will turn on things like nitric oxide production causing vasodilation and so experimenters have cured nocturnal hot flushes night sweats by having them drink a cup of starch solution or eating a big cup of rice or ice cream or some carbohydrate at bedtime. Just keeping your blood sugar up can momentarily stop the hot flashes, but the basic problem is getting your energy system efficient, making sure your thyroid and vitamin D and calcium intake are adequate."

**CONTEXT:** Mary, aged 70, asks about episodes of facial flushing and feeling of heat.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, but also potassium. Potassium. So that balances out, right? Yeah, the potassium itself fills in for insulin. Mm-hmm."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions drinking orange juice and having stable fasting blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, all day, intermittently. All day. But it has to be reasonably sweet. Yeah, and it's hard to find just really good organic oranges. In a climate like that, I think you have three orange seasons."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if drinking orange juice throughout the day is beneficial and about the seasonality of oranges.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, oh, sure, but, um, uh, uh, and, uh, oranges that you're suspicious of just, um, w- not only wash them, but, uh, don't, uh, get around the, the peeling. Uh, but, uh, with organic oranges, uh, you, you can make marmalade of the peeling. Heh, omega."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about concerns with non-organic oranges and chemicals like glyphosate.

**RAY PEAT:** "It, it's going to be on the, uh, uh, the same subject, uh, uh, the, the, the bad, uh, adaptive processes that, uh, we're, we're exposed to constantly, promoting aging. Mm-hmm. Uh, how, how it relates to inflammation and how to resist. Uh, the pro-inflammatory forces."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's latest newsletter topic.

**RAY PEAT:** "The survivors, yeah. The survivors. Good. Well, I hope you're one of them. We hope you stick around as long as you like."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if people will be stronger on the other end of current global events.
