**RAY PEAT:** "The 19th century doctors believed in food digestion poisoning, bacterial poisoning in the intestine. He wanted to disprove that, showing that toxins didn't cause headaches. So he, to show that it was just a myth. Nothing very subtle or chemical. He stuffed his medical students rectums with cotton wads. And all of those who were susceptible to headaches got a headache just from the cotton pressure. And he showed, he said that this disproves the idea that headaches are caused by toxicity in the intestine. But of course that didn't logically prove anything, just that pressure is enough. And toxins often lead to pressure in the intestine."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing early 20th-century medical theories and the limitations of certain experimental approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "And a lot of Russians were showing the interaction of nervous system with the intestine around that same time. Nervism was a 19th century concentration or theory of medicine in Russia. They saw the nervous system as controlling sickness and so the interaction of the digestive system and the brain was a big topic of research in Russia. They showed that if you put a balloon in an animal's intestine and inflated it nothing would happen if the animal's blood sugar was good. But if you lowered the blood sugar and inflated the intestine, then it would cause all kinds of things, asthma, seizures, the equivalent of headache, vascular distortions all through the organism. So the combination of energy in the form of blood sugar and stress in the intestine will cause that whole range of so-called psychosomatic ailments."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the historical understanding of the gut-brain axis and the role of blood sugar in stress responses.

**RAY PEAT:** "And some French Canadians are following Hans Selye showed that the immune system similarly interacts with the intestine and the energy supply. But if you drop the blood glucose level the intestine becomes extremely sensitive to allergens that otherwise wouldn't be noticed. So the energy and the brain which has the highest requirement for glucose as its energy source, these are behind the psychosomatic and allergic ailments."
**CONTEXT:** Elaborating on the connection between energy availability, the gut, and allergic/psychosomatic conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, about 20, 30 years ago some psychologists were demonstrating that... Helplessness, learned helplessness, training the brain to believe that escape is impossible made the whole organism shut down. The heart would stop beating in a few minutes rather than a few hours if the animal was convinced that escape was possible. So the whole organism... is either energized or shut down by the perspective that's possible. And so insight becomes a life-saving matter."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the physiological impact of psychological states like learned helplessness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I've seen that happen just with medical diagnosis. The doctor tells the person that they have an incurable disease and they pretty soon die."
**CONTEXT:** Illustrating the power of diagnosis and belief on physiological outcomes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, no, no, I was... Makes sense, really, I guess. Uh, yeah, I've never was committed to any particular so-called scientific view of the world. I am... It all seemed perfectly reasonable to a perfectly ignorant kid looking at the world and hearing these different experiments. So, the so-called scientific medicine always seemed like a closed dogma, dogmatic way of seeing things. Where they're just looking at things in parts, or taking the brain apart, and say, well, this is how the brain works. That kind of thing."
**CONTEXT:** Reflecting on a holistic versus reductionist approach to understanding the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and since about the 1940s, the pharmaceutical industry has shaped medical ideas so that it's really an outlet for their products. You get a diagnosis, and then you can......funnel the drugs in. And anything curative, like the old medical practice of giving people bran to cure constipation, like the Kellogg Institute, that isn't profitable to the pharmaceutical industry."
**CONTEXT:** Critiquing the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on medical practices and the suppression of non-profitable cures.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the mid-19th century in England and France, the autopsy cause of death was often given as inflammation of the intestine. But now, I think they see that just as often, but having an inflamed colon is a very common thing in a dying person, but they don't think of it as the cause of death."
**CONTEXT:** Observing the shift in medical understanding regarding intestinal inflammation as a cause of death.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, because they just, everything begins to shut down and they just don't, they don't go to the bathroom much. Yeah, it was people like Walter Alvarez who... who said, see, it isn't toxins causing a headache, it's just the pressure. And that took attention away from the intestine as a constant source of toxins and allergens. But it's really our most susceptible interface with the outside world. We're constantly putting these risky substances into our system."
**CONTEXT:** Re-emphasizing the historical shift away from considering the intestine as a source of systemic issues and its role as an interface with external substances.

**RAY PEAT:** "So that's why some folks, you've heard over the years, where they get constipated and they get a headache. Those two tend to go together. Oh, sure. And asthma attacks and seizures. When I was about ten, our dog found a coffee can full of bacon grease. The dog had been saved to make soap, but the dog liked the taste and ate the whole quart of bacon grease and had a seizure, and that started me. I think that was what made Walter Alvarez's publication so interesting, to see a seizure brought on by eating fat. I saw lots of people in. Experimented showing that the intestine could trigger a seizure or headache or runny nose, sore throat. Just about any symptom you can think of can be triggered from the intestine."
**CONTEXT:** Providing a personal anecdote and reinforcing the concept that intestinal issues can manifest as a wide range of symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** "For a long time, people have noticed that women have far more autoimmune problems than men. Also, about five times the incidence of thyroid disease. And there's a very close connection. Estrogen sensitizes your immune system. It acts on your brain and your glucose supply. For example, it... activates insulin secretion, but it shifts your metabolism away from glucose towards fat oxidation. And that makes you less able to oxidize glucose, turning it to carbon dioxide. And in the absence of the high production of carbon dioxide, you produce lactic acid. Lactic acid promotes inflammation. Starting with the fact that estrogen slows liver function by reducing the thyroid hormone, the slowed liver production shifts you into that lactate-favoring metabolism away from carbon dioxide, and lactate causes inflammation of everything. Autoimmune thyroid disease is just sort of the tip of the iceberg. Once the estrogen slows your thyroid down and starts inflammation there, then all of your other tissues are susceptible to chronic inflammation, ultimately leading to calcification or fibrosis, excess collagen production. And all this is cascading starting from high estrogen levels?"
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the link between estrogen, impaired glucose metabolism, lactic acid production, and the development of autoimmune conditions, particularly thyroid disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, women normally cycle two or three days. There's a surge of estrogen around ovulation. Then if they're healthy, well fed, the ovaries shift strongly to progesterone production. Diagrams in medical books often show estrogen and progesterone on the same chart, and they use a different scale. The production of progesterone is about a thousand times greater than the production of estrogen in a healthy person, but they show them on the same graph misleadingly. And so this little moment of dominant estrogen should be suppressed by a massive pouring out of progesterone for the rest of the month, but if anything interferes, like if they eat too much vegetable oil or too much starchy vegetables, things that are hard to digest, their energy level decreases so that they don't produce the normal amount of progesterone. It starts with a premenstrual syndrome where they don't have the energy and the sense of well-being of the progesterone controlled condition. And then in the absence of progesterone, everything tends to shift in an inefficient direction towards oxidation of fat rather than of glucose and that takes a lot more oxygen. Every carbon requires two oxygens if it's fat and only one oxygen if it's carbohydrate which already. It comes with one oxygen so you get a double supply of carbon dioxide in effect when you're using sugar as a fuel and the carbon dioxide has a stabilizing protective effect that suppresses inflammation and turns off lactate production."
**CONTEXT:** Detailing the hormonal balance between estrogen and progesterone, the impact of diet on progesterone production, and the metabolic advantages of glucose oxidation over fat oxidation, highlighting the role of carbon dioxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "A lot of ladies could have a hard time going through their periods and if they really they could be eating some foods that are causing the things to be worse feeling and if they maybe change their diet if they could figure it out they could feel better during this time. Is that what I heard you say?"
**CONTEXT:** Summarizing the previous point regarding dietary influences on menstrual well-being.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in the short run eating a lot of carbohydrate will make them feel better because it'll provide... lots of glucose. Eating rice and bread and vegetables, for example, in the short run can make a person feel euphoric, but at some point their liver needs a good supply of protein to keep working. Women who have been on a diet for a long time, I've seen women eating 15 or... 20 grams of protein a day, an army study found that even average or small women to work efficiently even at office work needed 100 grams of protein a day. And women often are told that 35 grams a day is fine. But all of the really competent studies show that. 85 to 100 or more grams per day are needed for the liver to function well, for the brain to work properly. So just a protein deficiency makes the liver under-produced."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the short-term benefits of carbohydrates for energy and the crucial role of adequate protein intake for liver and brain function, particularly for women.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1940s, some people did studies on the prisoners, war prisoners who were starved. They noticed that when they were let out of the prison camps and given some good food or at least more food, the men fairly often grew breasts in the first year after getting out of prison. And they found that that was because their liver had been damaged from the prolonged protein and vitamin deficiency. And the liver normally destroys. It causes an excretion of 100% of the estrogen reaching it. And so if you starve the liver for the B vitamins or protein in particular, the estrogen accumulates. So a man will grow breasts just from a prolonged nutrient deficiency. And that happens in women. That's the basic cause of premenstrual syndrome and the misinterpretation of what happens premenstrually. The estrogen industry, starting in the 1940s when they had a product to sell, they convinced the government, first of all, and the public. That these PMS problems and menopausal problems were the result of a deficiency of estrogen rather than an excess. At the very same time, the researchers were showing exactly how the liver keeps estrogen under control when your diet is good. But the estrogen industry totally reversed that situation. They even solved... estrogen to prevent miscarriage, all through the late 40s and 50s. Doctors at Harvard were convincing doctors throughout the country to prescribe estrogen to pregnant women. That created the DES syndrome, cancer in the next generation. The babies were exposed in utero to that. Estrogen, supposedly to prevent miscarriage, they developed estrogen problems later in life."
**CONTEXT:** Detailing how protein and vitamin deficiencies impair liver function, leading to estrogen accumulation, and how this was misinterpreted by the "estrogen industry" to promote estrogen as a treatment, with devastating consequences like the DES syndrome.

**RAY PEAT:** "And wasn't that whole syndrome, wasn't it blamed on some drug or something? Yeah, the diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen. Oh, so that was the cause? Yeah, in the 1930s. My professor, for example, Sodervall, was a student of one of the people who showed very early that estrogen causes miscarriage. And my professor gave animals graded doses. One animal would get a small dose, another a bigger dose. He showed that the number of miscarriages... exactly corresponded to the dose of estrogen they were getting. So, estrogen as a contraceptive or abortion producer was defined before 1940, but it was 1941 and 42 when the estrogen industry started promoting it to prevent miscarriage, exactly 180 degrees opposite of what it does. And so that has created... more than 50 years of total confusion about what estrogen does. For 50 years they prescribed estrogen to men with prostate cancer. It turns out that it is a major cause of prostate cancer. But it was given to men to treat their prostate cancer. And it would cause death from asthma. Blood clotting, seizures, accelerated cancer in other organs and so on. In fact, if you look at a man's testosterone, the high testosterone men in middle and old age are relatively free of prostate cancer. The ones who develop prostate cancer are the ones with lower testosterone. And more effective of the estrogen."
**CONTEXT:** Further elaborating on the historical misuse of estrogen, its abortifacient properties, and its role in causing cancer, particularly prostate cancer, contrasting it with the protective effects of testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it does, but I'm not sure how to rank those different proteins. Gelatin is one protein that is very safe because it lacks the three amino acids which can be very toxic. If you're eating more than is needed, and they happen to be used for growth, so they're needed until you're about 20 or 25 years old. They're used for expanding the body tissues. After that, they're just needed for replacing skin and the cells that are turning over rapidly need. Cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan, but if you eat the young person's requirement of those amino acids when you're 40 or 50, they tend to promote overgrowth, promoting inflammation, excitotoxicity of the nerves, and promote tumor growth. So they're associated with shortening. The lifespan of gelatin lacks those, so it's a very safe protein that can be added to those other proteins to balance it out and give you a mature person's protein requirement."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the safety of gelatin as a protein source due to its lack of potentially toxic amino acids (cysteine, methionine, tryptophan) that can promote overgrowth and inflammation in adults.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, you mean like the Great Lakes Gelatin or that kind of product? Yeah, that's a good one that I've used a lot. Okay, so they don't have the three that... that we don't need? Yeah, gelatin is used as the basically the stiffening glue that holds our other cells together and it tends to increase with age. You won't increase your rate of collagen production by eating gelatin. It just serves to... prevent the unnecessary stimulation of tissue growth. A lot of people are selling gelatin, calling it collagen, but it isn't. Collagen is the raw form in your tissues. To buy actual collagen costs something like ten dollars a gram because it can't be purified in a sterile form. Without a great lab process. I see. So if you're going to really want collagen, you should just get the collagen from, I don't know, pig's feet and camhoks and stuff like that, huh? Yeah, that's a natural way to get it. Chicken backs and wings and feet, for example, are the traditional ways when a person is sick. They found that giving them a gelatinous chicken soup is therapeutic. And so one of the reasons is the collagen and all the good things, the amino acids and things that they have?"
**CONTEXT:** Clarifying the distinction between gelatin and collagen, and recommending natural sources of collagen.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and the absence of those excitatory amino acids is part of its benefit. The excitatory again are what, lysine? No, glycine is the quieting. It can be used in the brain as part of excitation, but its normal function, and proline, these are the two protective energy providing and stabilizing amino acids. The ones that can be excitotoxic are tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. If we just eat animal products, we're getting those in there, Dr. P, right? They're already in there, in the meats?"
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the role of glycine and proline as protective amino acids, and identifying tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine as potentially excitotoxic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Okay. But so, if you take extra stuff, you don't want to take the ones that have those in there, because you can get kind of too wound up? Yeah. The different vegetable proteins vary quite a bit. You could combine some of them with gelatin to get an optimal... Oh, I see. You can add a little gelatin in there too. Cool."
**CONTEXT:** Advising on combining proteins and the potential for overstimulation from certain amino acids.

**RAY PEAT:** "All right. Well they used to say it was a perfect food. Remember the commercials? Yeah, they used to be the perfect food. I've seen the... Cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid content analyzed in the 30s, the 50s, the 70s, and then recently, there has been a constant decrease in cholesterol content and a constant increase in polyunsaturated fat content. Oh, because of the feed? The feed? They're feeding them so efficiently in the energy sense. In the pork industry, in the 40s, they found that... the highly polyunsaturated fats made the pig gain fat faster with less food. And so they shifted from the higher protein and starch foods to the higher polyunsaturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats also wasted energy, so the pigs stayed lean, and that spread over to the other branches of... agriculture and chicken feed has become more and more polyunsaturated."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the historical perception of eggs as a perfect food and how modern agricultural practices have altered their nutritional profile, increasing polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when I'm in Mexico and know where the eggs come from... The real stuff. Yeah, the chickens get tortillas and vegetables and lots of bugs and so on. Then I'll eat four or five eggs a day. And it's okay to eat more. One person was in the news, he's eaten a dozen eggs a day for 40 years or something like that. And the cholesterol myth was created by the......seed oil industry, especially cotton seed people, wanted to sell their product on the basis that it lowered cholesterol. And things that lower cholesterol generally cause cancer and degenerative disease. But in an experiment many years ago, medical students were fed, I think it was 22 eggs was the point at which they could... show an increase in their serum cholesterol. At 15 eggs a day, there was no increase because their natural liver production of cholesterol was inhibited when they were eating it, as if the body recognizes that it doesn't have to make cholesterol when it's getting the amount in 15 eggs. The studies that showed the increase of... serum cholesterol from eggs, the first ones who were done in diabetic, hospitalized, very sick patients. But when you look at healthy young people, you need lots and lots of eggs with no change in your blood cholesterol level."
**CONTEXT:** Reaffirming the safety of consuming eggs, debunking the cholesterol myth, and highlighting the body's regulatory mechanisms for cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** "There was a fellow that used to promote a kind of a live food diet, Igenus von der Planets, and he claimed that he worked with people over the years that they really had bad stomach problems, and it was really sad to see that young people couldn't stay there with them. That he would just have them do like a dozen raw eggs a day for a week and they usually straighten things out. It's pretty strange. Have you ever heard about that possum?"
**CONTEXT:** Recounting an anecdote about the therapeutic use of raw eggs for stomach issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I've seen several people. One, a year and a half old kid. The second one was a man about 70 years old. Both of them had a diagnosis of leukemia, and somewhere I had heard about the effect of egg on the stomach. The leukemia virus or something related to leukemia. So I suggested an eggnog, sort of an orange Julius formula, egg, milk, sugar, orange juice, or vanilla. Yeah. And both of these first two people who tried it had a recovery, no more leukemia symptoms. And so over the years I've suggested that several times for lymphoma. And leukemia in particular, but in general it's just, you don't have to make it your exclusive diet, but having an orange Julius once in a while is very good for your health."
**CONTEXT:** Sharing observations of positive outcomes with leukemia and lymphoma patients using an eggnog-like formula.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, there have been experiments that show that something in the raw egg yolk... is germicidal, helps to disinfect the intestine which somewhat is decreased by cooking it, but still you get almost all the benefit from a cooked egg. But it's better to cook it as little as possible so that the yolk is still runny because the presence of the polyunsaturated fat makes it very easily oxidized and damaged by heat."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the benefits of raw egg yolk for its germicidal properties and advising minimal cooking to preserve the integrity of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, for about 50 years the Department of Agriculture called lard a saturated fat. They hadn't checked their figures since the 1930s, but a more recent study showed that it's, I think it was 32 or 33 percent polyunsaturated fats in lard, so it ranks up with the worst of the liquid oils for oxidizability. When I was a kid... grocery stores would have blocks of lard sitting out at room temperature just like a lump of butter. But recently I saw lard in a plastic bag looking like a liquid fat. And what was that made out of, that stuff? That shows the change of diet on the fat. That was when the source of... energy is mostly starch and protein, the animal turns it into mostly saturated fat. Oh, real good stuff. It's good stuff. Yeah, solid lard, which stimulates your metabolism rather than poisoning it."
**CONTEXT:** Critiquing the misclassification of lard as saturated fat and explaining how modern processing and animal diets have altered its composition, leading to less stable fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "And that... If you are eating a vegetable fat, if it grows in the tropics, it'll be more saturated because... the temperature of the organism governs the saturation of the fats that it makes. So chocolate, for example, cocoa butter grown in the tropics is highly saturated. Coconut oil is highly saturated because the polyunsaturated fats are extremely unstable at 90 degrees or 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is our body temperature. So the plants that produce those fats would die if they were producing polyunsaturated fats because they would simply die of oxygen reaction poisoning."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the principle that tropical plants produce saturated fats to protect themselves from oxidation at higher temperatures, contrasting this with the instability of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, um, the, um, avoiding the things that produce inflammation, and those are the basic thing that amplifies and sustains inflammation are the polyunsaturated fats. Yeah, and... the bacteria that feed on indigestible plant matter, we don't have enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin and the woody fibers in plants, and so if starches and fats are associated with those indigestible polysaccharides, then... they will be protected against our digestive system and feed bacteria in the lower intestine and cause the absorption of bacterial toxins, endotoxin and others. And so, for example, lettuce is... if you eat it in a salad, it's going to be an ideal bacteria food, so if you have a tough intestine... you can stand the growth of the bacteria, but if you're at all prone to inflammation, then lettuce or other undercooked vegetables are going to feed the bacteria that produce bowel inflammation. And so, overcooked vegetables are actually more nutritious than raw or partly cooked. Our experiment with rats showed that even rats can't live on raw vegetables as an exclusive diet. But they thrived on canned vegetables that are overcooked. So this could be the reason why some people just don't do that well on raw foods. Yeah, and especially if you have colitis. A very bland milk diet, milk and egg diet, for example, is often therapeutic for colitis."
**CONTEXT:** Identifying polyunsaturated fats and indigestible plant matter as key drivers of inflammation, explaining how bacteria in the gut can produce toxins, and advocating for overcooked vegetables over raw ones, especially for those with inflammatory bowel conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the anti-estrogen drugs have many effects other than suppressing estrogen. You can powerfully decrease estrogen production inhibiting aromatase. If you thoroughly cut out polyunsaturated fats and use aspirin and... Other natural substances are the things that block the production of estrogen. Aspirin is just one of the natural substances blocking aromatase and it's very safe to use in breast cancer. Progesterone is another. There are several. plant-derived substances that are inhibitors of aromatase, but cutting out the polyunsaturated fats which are, they produce prostaglandins, and the prostaglandins are the main force activating aromatase and estrogen production."
**CONTEXT:** Recommending strategies to reduce estrogen production, including eliminating polyunsaturated fats, using aspirin, and progesterone, and explaining the role of prostaglandins in aromatase activation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, about 30, 40 years ago, I noticed that I was getting... a circle of white whiskers. And I realized that that was... that circle represented where the x-ray gun had been used to make dental x-rays. And right after that, each time I had dental x-rays, I would get leukoplasia on the inside of my cheek that would swell up and... get bitten accidentally. That would clear up when I eventually got enough vitamin A. But the x-ray destroys first the vitamin A and E and vitamin B2. The things that are light sensitive are the first to be destroyed by even low-dose x-ray or ultraviolet light. And... these essential growth factors, regulatory factors, are destroyed in the bone because the x-ray penetrates pretty well even into the bone. And getting your essential nutrients up would be the first defense. Vitamin D and calcium are the first anti-inflammatory. and restorative things especially for the bone and keeping the cortisol and prolactin down besides the vitamin D and calcium effect which tend to lower prolactin and cortisol, stopping your energy coming from carbohydrate rather than fats is protective. And again the aspirin effect keeps the prostaglandin production down. So an anti-inflammatory program protects against bone loss as well as cancer."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the damaging effects of X-rays on essential vitamins (A, E, B2) and their impact on bone health, recommending vitamin A, D, calcium, aspirin, and a shift to carbohydrate metabolism for protection.

**RAY PEAT:** "I know that Dr. Peet considers estrogen kind of pro-aging. And if high testosterone for example gives a man attractive traits like strong muscular All Right. Deep voice and courage and all of that then high estrogen woman is usually the one with attractive broad hips large breasts and narrow waist Being an artist. What does dr Pete think about estrogen as a factor in female physical attractiveness."
**CONTEXT:** Inquiring about Dr. Peat's perspective on estrogen's role in female physical attractiveness.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's an interesting question um it um, it does it increase the fat on the thighs and hips Uh when everything else is In in good balance and it's one of the essential things for breast growth but if if it Comes at the wrong time and in the wrong place It's also a masculinizing factor It will shift the balance in an embryo towards male development rather than female and it's progesterone which protects against protects the female against the masculinizing effects of estrogen so you have to have a generous supply of progesterone to keep down the cortisol which is promoted by estrogen. Estrogen if you give an animal a large dose of estrogen the first thing you're likely to see is bleeding adrenal glands. Because they're so overstimulated trying to make more cortisol to balance the estrogen That it will destroy the adrenals if the estrogen is very high, but short of that it raises your Cortisol and related stress hormones and the circulating free fatty acids are increased by estrogen so when the estrogen isn't blocked by progesterone you get these stress syndromes including belly fat."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing estrogen's dual role in female attractiveness (fat distribution, breast growth) and its potential masculinizing effects, emphasizing the protective role of progesterone in balancing cortisol and preventing stress-related fat accumulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's good to check her temperature and pulse rate and see how they compare with kids of that age. But as the estrogen starts rising after the age of six... especially nine, ten and eleven, the estrogen is blocking the thyroid gland. In teenage girls you often see a puffiness at the bottom of the neck, which indicates that the thyroid gland is producing something, but it isn't secreting the active hormone, so the gland enlarges under the influence of estrogen. And girls... often have a crease above and below where the thyroid is because of that puffing effect. Boys of the same age don't have creases in those areas because it's very common for the pubescent girl to have the bulging thyroid gland because the gland is trying to produce the hormone but it isn't able to release it into the bloodstream. That will be detectable in the blood if the doctor knows how to recognize the indicators. Vitamin D and calcium work closely with the thyroid and sugar metabolism. It's been pretty much ignored that vitamin D is connected to energy and sugar metabolism. Your thyroid can't work properly if you're low in vitamin D and calcium, and so getting lots of milk and cheese and eggs is important. Not a lot of the high-phosphate foods like nuts, beans, and meats, a moderate amount of those, but plenty of leafy vegetables, well-cooked. Cheese, eggs, and milk, and probably a supplement of vitamin D, unless you're able to get hours of sunlight on a lot of your skin every day."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining how rising estrogen levels in young girls can interfere with thyroid function, leading to a goiter-like appearance, and emphasizing the importance of vitamin D, calcium, and a balanced diet for thyroid health and energy metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've known lots of people who used it, and it isn't as dangerous as a lot of doctors will lead you to believe. But you do have to be careful with it because it can in itself be irritating. I always painted with it and tried the smell of it and felt it was... very harmless, maybe beneficial, but the research has been biased against it by the funding from the pharmaceutical industry that has something fancier to sell."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the use of turpentine, suggesting it's less dangerous than commonly believed and that research may be biased by pharmaceutical interests.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, they test for the receptors. Oh, the ER plus. Yeah, estrogen receptor positive. Plus. But the receptors just mean that the cell is able to produce and respond to hormones. And when it lacks those receptors it's usually the most dangerous type of cancer. But the presence of those receptors is almost always misinterpreted by doctors. The presence of estrogen, instead of depending on the ovaries as the source, once you get an irritation the breast itself begins producing estrogen internally. And what you need to do is first... find a way to reduce that by reducing the polyunsaturated fats and prostaglandins, inhibiting it with things such as aspirin. And the function of progesterone is on all of the cells where they have a progesterone receptor, progesterone inhibits cell division and... knocks out the estrogen receptor and can inhibit the aromatase that produces estrogen. So where they tell you to avoid progesterone because it has the receptors for it, the receptor means it's able to be inhibited by progesterone. But bioidentical estrogen is just as harmful. As a synthetic estrogen, they're all doing the same thing, activating cell, shifting metabolism away from glucose towards fat and towards the inflammatory intrinsic production of estrogen, so it becomes self amplifying."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining that hormone receptors indicate cellular responsiveness, not necessarily a cause of cancer, and that reducing polyunsaturated fats, using aspirin, and progesterone can help manage estrogen-driven cancers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, thank you. With cottage cheese, you want to make sure it doesn't have added lactic acid because bacterial lactic acid is pro-inflammatory. Cottage cheese is very good if it doesn't contain added lactic acid. It'll say lactic acid right on the label if you know. Yeah. Yeah. And in general, you want the anti-inflammatory foods, but when you say bone broth, the collagen, which is the main benefit of good bone broth, it is around the knobby end bones, the joints, more than the long bones. The long bone contains marrow, which is very rich in iron, and you don't want an excess of iron when you have arthritis. I ran across a woman who was convinced that her doctor knew what he was doing in prescribing estrogen for her rheumatoid arthritis, but when I talked to her, she couldn't get off the couch, her husband helped her from the bed to the couch, but I talked to her two or three times for an hour explaining. What estrogen does to the inflammatory systems and she was convinced that her doctor knew that estrogen should be helping, but when she finally tried giving up her estrogen pills, immediately she recovered from her rheumatoid arthritis. A woman was visiting Eugene from Sweden. She had had, I think it was three joint replacements and was going to have all of her other main joints replaced with ball and socket mechanisms. A friend gave her some progesterone. She oiled herself all over with progesterone. And she immediately had no more pain. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, she spent her time in Eugene, walking around, enjoying the parks, and said she was going to not have any more joints replaced. When you get the estrogen down and the progesterone up, whether you do it with diet or supplements, aspirin, one of the reasons aspirin is helpful for rheumatoid arthritis is that it turns your estrogen production down and progesterone up. An Italian researcher named Coutolo has shown that estrogen is being produced in the arthritic joint and that the problem is too. Reduce the estrogen not to increase it and then if you do a bone broth before you said Get some of these I think you can find pig joints and these knuckles and things like that Not necessarily the long bones where you get marrow and then too much iron and that's bad for yeah Yeah, the joint is full of tendons and ligaments. Yeah, that's what you want all the gooey all the gooey stuff in there"
**CONTEXT:** Advising on cottage cheese (avoiding added lactic acid) and bone broth (focusing on joint-related bones over marrow-rich long bones due to iron content in arthritis). He also shares compelling anecdotes about estrogen's negative impact on rheumatoid arthritis and progesterone's therapeutic benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the the two that I think are our safest for Killing actually killing organisms are flowers of sulfur for use on the skin and intestine 200 milligrams orally in two or three days it can kill off the most toxic of the intestinal bacteria and fungus on the skin. It has been used not only for fungus infections of the skin, just dusting on flowers of sulfur or using 10% sulfur soap to wash with leaves residue of sulfur on the skin, but it can be used for scabies even. A salve made of mixing butter with flowers of sulfur was tested and found just as effective as the salve. Brain-toxic insecticides or scabicides that are used medically. But these flowers of sulfur, you do take it internally, 200 milligrams?"
**CONTEXT:** Recommending flowers of sulfur as a safe and effective natural antibiotic for both skin and intestinal infections, citing its mechanism against fungi like Candida.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the fungus has been the best studied. Candida, for example, secretes enzymes. that convert the flower, the yellow crystalline sulfur, convert it to sulfuric acid and poison themselves, or hydrogen sulfide. So they vocally create a toxic condition that kills them, but it is very, very harmless to the intestine if you take a very small amount, like 200 milligrams."
**CONTEXT:** Further explaining the mechanism of flowers of sulfur against Candida, highlighting its safety at low doses.

**RAY PEAT:** "And aspirin, when it's used with the standard antibiotics, it can greatly increase their effectiveness. But all by itself, it has antibiotic antiviral as well as antibacterial and antifungal effects. It's too cheap to be... of interest pharmaceutically. There was a study of treating AIDS patients with just aspirin, large doses, and the results seemed very favorable, but no one promoted it. That was too cheap, right?"
**CONTEXT:** Highlighting aspirin's broad antimicrobial and antiviral properties and its underutilization due to its low cost.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's something I do just for... the known protective effects of it. I'll be darned, just a little bear aspirin. Yeah, anywhere from 100 to 300 milligrams. Yeah, I think one of the regular... aren't the regular pills about 300? Something like that. It's hard to even find a pure bear aspirin, though. They want to do all kinds of weird things to it."
**CONTEXT:** Recommending daily aspirin use (100-300mg) for its protective effects and noting the difficulty in finding pure, unadulterated aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the NAD is very important and is increased by supplementing niacinamide."
**CONTEXT:** Confirming the importance of NAD and its increase through niacinamide supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** "There's an article on my website about gluten. And it happens to interact with stress and estrogen. The gluten molecule, oddly, has a stretch of amino acids that resembles proteins that are involved with stress, inflammation, and estrogen. And so if you're stressed and tending to have high estrogen. You're creating a molecular antigen surface that responds to gluten in your diet. But if you're in very good condition, have your estrogen under control, the gluten is digested properly without pretending that antigenic. A toxic effect. So a lot of this gluten stuff is is tied in with stress?"
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the connection between gluten sensitivity, stress, and estrogen, suggesting that gluten's impact is amplified in individuals with high stress and estrogen levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Just like everything, huh? Yeah, it's a hormonal immunological process that gluten just happens to be a molecule that has this stretch of amino acids that gives us a signal that amplifies our own stress. Inflammatory reactions. Yeah, I think a bad diet that creates inflammation by not enough protein, having unsaturated rather than saturated fats, and generally poor nutrition, and having improperly leavened bread, blowing up the bread quickly, rather than soaking it for 12 hours in the old-fashioned leavening. The soaking to let it leaven naturally with yeast, in those 12 hours at approximately room temperature, the gluten was digested by the enzymes in the wheat germ. The pre-digestion kept us from being exposed to gluten, so when they make the bread economically and quickly, the gluten stays there and gives the bread a rubbery, elastic texture that is pleasant to eat because it tends to be moist. And soft. But that gluten which makes the bread economical and pleasant to eat happens to be androgenic and allergenic. So there's a lot going on in the gluten world with doctors and stuff and healing that maybe is just not right."
**CONTEXT:** Elaborating on how poor diet, stress, and modern bread-making processes (rapid leavening) contribute to gluten issues, contrasting it with traditional long-fermentation methods that break down gluten.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, many years ago I was interested in baking bread. I made very tasty bread with a 12-hour leavening process. I had previously noticed that eating a slice of standard grocery store bread would make me have bad sleep, digestive discomfort that woke me up repeatedly. When I baked my own bread that was leavened, I could eat a whole loaf of it at bedtime. And sleep perfectly. Oh, you mean because you were using yeast and you just leavened it. Or was it sourdough thing? Yeah, it was soaked for 12 hours. That destroys almost all of the gluten, converts it to a nutritious protein. So it's not only less pro-inflammatory but more nutritious. It actually has more protein."

**RAY PEAT:** "But the larger particles......much as ten times the diameter of a red blood cell......can pass through the wall of the intestine into the blood vessels. And those particles can obstruct arterioles and kill a whole region of cells. And so the plastic particles are getting into our food supply......of all different sizes, from hundreds as big as a bacterium. to ten times as big as a red blood cell. A great range of particle sizes all have their different toxic effects. And the larger particles in particular can be coated with these volatile, organic, especially polycyclic, aromatic hydrocarbons, which are carcinogenic in themselves. They tend to stick to the surface of some of these particles. And get carried into the bloodstream by passing through the wall of the intestine. The process is called persorption and it's been observed for about almost 200 years. And over 100 years ago, the second major study was done. Then starting in the 60s, a German researcher has published many, many studies on it. And it... It's a very common process. It happens whenever you eat undercooked starch, for example. Starch particles pass through into the bloodstream unless they're in the presence of enough food to energize the intestine cells to keep them from being leaky. The leaky... Intestine isn't just a matter of having holes between cells but it's that the individual cell is weak because it doesn't have enough energy to maintain its internal structure. It becomes slightly more tolerant of particles and fluids passing through unchanged. A particle will just press its way into the substance of a cell and pop out the other side into a blood vessel. That has been overlooked sort of intentionally because of a doctrine taught to all biologists practically that a cell has a barrier membrane and that it has to deliberately ingest a particle. But the only barrier is that the cell is energized to maintain a water repellent effect. When it loses energy, it becomes more tolerant to watery substances and particles. They can pass right into the substance of the cell."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining how particles of various sizes, including microplastics, can enter the bloodstream through the intestinal wall via persorption, especially when the intestinal cells lack energy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, clothes are being treated with particles that have a deodorant action, silver particles for example. And when these contact your sweaty skin... the silver particles can actually pass through your skin into your bloodstream. Toothpaste is often massively containing nanoparticles or larger particles just because they assure you that they aren't intended to be nanoparticles. Still the microparticles, once they're in contact with your... your mouth membranes, or if they're swallowed, they can pass into your bloodstream. Salad dressings are often thickened with nanoparticles, or close to nanoparticles. Fumed silica, it's particles of glass, basically so fine that they will float in the air, and these are used as a thickening substance in foods and... You notice lots of supplements contain silica and titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide. Yeah, silicon dioxide, yeah. And these are often designed to be larger particles but even the apparently not nano, only microparticles, these still can contain the nanoparticles that are most... pro-inflammatory resembling asbestos for their effects on cells."
**CONTEXT:** Identifying common sources of nanoparticles and microparticles in everyday products like clothing, toothpaste, salad dressings, and supplements, and warning about their potential pro-inflammatory effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, for example, there are things called... food-grade lubricants to use on your machinery are containing Teflon Microparticles as a lubricant, but they're food grade because they know they're going to contaminate the food But they don't show up on the label because they're just a processing aid and so When a food is processed if it comes in contact with the machinery it might... be contaminated with food grade teflon lubricant."
**CONTEXT:** Highlighting the hidden contamination of food with Teflon microparticles from processing machinery, which are not listed on ingredient labels.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, he's got some mercury. You want to get those out if somebody's got some neuro things going on? No, if they're old. They probably have released almost all of the mobile mercury and an old filling. I think it's better to not mess with it. You're going to damage the tooth more taking it out. Yeah, a lot of dentists recommend with you there. If it's really old and you can mess things up more than... And animal experiments in rats, they would pull a molar and test it. It's mental abilities. They found that its memory was impaired with each molar extraction. And that is just because the mouth nerves are closely related to the brain function. And so the more toxic or traumatic experience your jawbone has, the more it's going to affect your nerve stability."
**CONTEXT:** Advising against the removal of old mercury amalgam fillings due to the risk of further mercury exposure and potential damage to teeth and nerve stability.

**RAY PEAT:** "Testosterone makes everyone feel good, male or female, but the women get the same effect pretty much from DHEA, which is the precursor of testosterone, and pregnenolone and DHEA both will optimize your progesterone. Testosterone without as much risk of excess estrogen. After the age of about 35, the fat tissues in particular, the more fat there is in the body, the more likely it is to produce estrogen, and that becomes a continuous rather than a cyclic production of the estrogen. Normally, in a cycling woman, you have about two or three days of a strong effect of estrogen, then it's knocked out by progesterone. And the cyclic effect is, if it's knocked out thoroughly by cyclic progesterone two or three weeks of every month, then the estrogen is not carcinogenic. But if it's... not interrupted, it becomes even a small amount of uninterrupted estrogen as a higher degree of cancer producing. And progesterone, it's normally produced cyclically and the liver throws off the excess when it's been present for more than two weeks. And so you start losing the effectiveness of progesterone if you don't interrupt it and let the liver reset itself so it doesn't throw the progesterone off."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the hormonal interplay between testosterone, DHEA, pregnenolone, progesterone, and estrogen, emphasizing the importance of cyclic progesterone for preventing estrogen-related cancer and the role of fat tissue in continuous estrogen production after age 35.

**RAY PEAT:** "There's no need to supplement estrogen because all of the tissues, as they age, start to produce estrogen. The skin, uterus, breast, even the liver cells can start producing estrogen rather than excreting it. Testosterone has protective effects like progesterone. I think the reason women live on average longer than men is because they have more progesterone than men. Progesterone production is very low in relation to testosterone, and progesterone can't be converted to estrogen where testosterone can. So, progesterone is more protective in aging than testosterone is."
**CONTEXT:** Stating that estrogen supplementation is unnecessary with age as tissues begin producing it, and highlighting progesterone's protective role in aging, potentially explaining women's longer average lifespan.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think you're on to something. I mean, who knows? Maybe the buggies are eating some stuff that should not be there, and that's why you're losing some weight. Maybe you're digesting your food better. Maybe all the above. Maybe you're getting more minerals, which makes everything work better. It could be all of the above."
**CONTEXT:** Speculating on the potential benefits of probiotics for weight loss and improved digestion.

**RAY PEAT:** "I wonder what they mean, canned milk. You mean like... Oh, concentrated milk. It used to be very popular for coffee additive, but there was a discovery in the 1970s that they were soldering the cans with lead, and the milk contained much too high a lead concentration. But I think they've revised the... manufacturer of cans that I haven't checked recently, but I think canned milk is now prepared in a way that doesn't contain high amounts of lead, and all you lose is a little bit of the vitamin quality, and you have a little bit of oxidized fatty material from the heat process. So it isn't... not as good as fresh milk, but you have a gradient from fresh raw milk to pasteurized milk to ultrapasteurized to canned milk, and each time it loses a little value, but I use pasteurized milk almost always. You don't have a problem with pasteurized milk."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing canned milk, its historical lead contamination issue, and its nutritional value compared to fresh and pasteurized milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Very good. Good."
**CONTEXT:** Affirming the nutritional value of goat milk kefir and goat cheese for calcium and protein.

**RAY PEAT:** "I wonder if it's safe to take iodine every day. Iodine can interact with the polyunsaturated fats in your body producing an anti-thyroid substance and I've got a file of about 70 articles showing that the increased iodine in the diet as a result of iodized salt, it has produced a thyroid disease increase and is correlated with increased thyroid cancer as well as various degrees of thyroiditis and nodules of the thyroid. Probably because of its interaction with the polyunsaturated fats in the diet. And in some people at least iodine in excess has an anti-inflammatory value. So it has been used therapeutically to reduce inflammation and can for example help polycystic breasts. But... when it's taken chronically in large amounts, it's tendency is to have an anti-thyroid effect. So if you took too much, you could actually cause a Hashimoto's?"
**CONTEXT:** Warning about the potential anti-thyroid effects of iodine, especially when interacting with polyunsaturated fats, and its correlation with increased thyroid disease and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's the anti-inflammatory effect. Okay. You can demonstrate that very high... amount of iodine reduces inflammation and counteracts that inflammatory effect of estrogen. But some people have the reverse effect, get an inflammatory reaction to even small amounts of iodine. So you have to be very careful if you're experimenting with it."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining that iodine's anti-inflammatory properties can counteract estrogen's effects, but cautioning that some individuals may react negatively to it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, it's infinitely complicated, but it's a lot simpler than female hormones, because there isn't that powerful cyclic effect. A woman goes through two distinct... phases. The estrogen is knocked out by the progesterone, where man constantly has to deal with those same effects. And so if you think of it in terms of a long-range stress effect, testosterone for most of your lifespan is having an anti-stress effect. But... If your thyroid is interfered with in any way, radiation or too much of certain amino acids or not enough nutrients, slow thyroid will shift you over to the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. That's where the degenerative problems start. Testosterone should protect your nervous system, just like progesterone, and protects against cancer. But when your energy is reduced by a falling thyroid function, then it becomes analogous to the female's problem."
**CONTEXT:** Contrasting male and female hormonal systems, explaining how thyroid function influences testosterone conversion to estrogen, and highlighting testosterone's protective role against stress and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well, a pellet is probably better than an oily injection. I would recommend it if it was available as pure testosterone, but it's typically sold as testosterone esters, a completely chemically different substance. It's dissolved in vegetable oil, often with a solvent, a benzyl alcohol. Which is in itself toxic, neurotoxic, but the vegetable oil has its toxic effect in the muscle if it's injected IM, and so it's a matter of how it is available. So I don't often recommend it because the forms...usually an injection will......contain 50 or 100 milligrams of this testosterone ester and the man, a young man, might produce four or five milligrams a day of the actual testosterone. And so you get these huge excesses as well as the toxic breakdown products of the solvents that... are real drawbacks to the use of pharmaceutical supplements. So, if you can get a real pure testosterone, it might be okay to use."
**CONTEXT:** Expressing reservations about pharmaceutical testosterone esters due to their chemical composition, solvents, and excessive dosages, recommending pure testosterone if available.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it produces great physical mental effects. DHEA, as the precursor to testosterone, is very easily available. And... again, you don't want to take unphysiologically huge amounts. I've known men who developed an enlarged liver with estrogen as high as a young woman's when they were taking 25 milligrams a day of DHEA. A full replacement dose is around 15 milligrams, which an 80 or 90 year old man might need. I see. 15 milligrams. Anything with the DHEA for the tea or just by itself? Just by itself is fine. Just a little bit, though. Just a little bit."
**CONTEXT:** Recommending DHEA as a precursor to testosterone, advising caution with dosage to avoid estrogenic side effects, and suggesting a replacement dose of around 15mg for older men.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um...
