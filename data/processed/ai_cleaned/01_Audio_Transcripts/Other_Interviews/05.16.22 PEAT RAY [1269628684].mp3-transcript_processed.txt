**RAY PEAT:** "The whole country under the propaganda about the pandemic, I would imagine the fear chemical signals are very concentrated. So there's a wide variety of results that these fear things could have, even we could pick up from somebody else?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if fear or spiritual energetics could create observable changes in blood, suggesting that chemical transmitters on an emotional level might be involved.

**RAY PEAT:** "Definitely. They've been studied a lot in insects to use as bait and to use with insecticides, basically. But they have found out that a signal, a single molecule, acts as a radio transmitter, apparently, because when the pyromone molecules, say from a female insect, are covering a space of hundreds of yards, or even miles, the molecules can't be any closer together than, say, maybe a meter between molecules. And there's no way you could tell directionality from just running into the occasional molecule. There would be nothing you could define easily as a gradient. And so they think the sensor cells are tuned like an antenna to receive the signals. Every molecule is absorbing infrared energy and emitting more or less the same type of energy with some modification. The signals are complex enough to carry information and the shape of the antenna of the insect, if you've looked at them up close, a moth has this branch sort of fern like a sword shape with side branches. Those seem to be what are tuned to the direction of the electromagnetic signal. And humans don't have that extreme sensitivity but we do have nerve receptors in the olfactory system that definitely connect to our motivational and hormonal system."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on how pheromones, as physical molecules, can transmit information over distances, leading to the discussion of molecular signaling.

**RAY PEAT:** "Generally when you say energetics, biologists, soft being, scientific, there has been lots and lots of research for more than 100 years demonstrating radiant communication, ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths communication, many different kinds of energy, magnetic as well as electromagnetic. And still it's a very unpopular area of research. Scientists could ruin his career by trying to publish something on it. Yeah so you get out there in Wee-Woo-Land, La-La-Land and some of the most of the scientists they get frightened they don't want to mess with it."
**CONTEXT:** The host questions the scientific validity of "energetics" in biological communication, prompting Peat to discuss the historical and suppressed research in this area.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah in 1968 when I visited some researchers in Russia one of them gave me a reading list that included some extremely important electromagnetic studies that show a steady, more or less steady electromagnetic field can communicate so that just the seepage of water through the ground creates enough current that there's a detectable or a sensible magnetic field that water dowsers can use. That's how they find out where the water is. Yeah and that has been tested by burying wires and then running very weak currents through the wire."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the possibility of communication through electromagnetic fields, leading Peat to cite Russian research on the topic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, if a molecule can emit a meaningful directional attractive signal then the whole animal is emitting similar amounts of energy. So it's such a small amount of energy that the standard science doctrines about what an organism is, what a cell is, just say that that's not possible. A random signal would overwhelm it so that you don't have any possibility of sorting out the signal. But the sorting and detecting processes are not following the standard biological dogma about how information is transmitted."
**CONTEXT:** The host posits that if molecules can signal, then entire organisms must also be emitting energy, leading Peat to explain how standard biological dogma dismisses this possibility.

**RAY PEAT:** "Much, much less than they are claiming. All of their... Claims and experiments go wrong and do untold harm rather than any slight benefit if you... insert a gene, take out a bad gene, or put in a different DNA. Put in a good one. So, yeah, it changes the whole system unpredictably. The cell doesn't operate in a reductionist way. You've upset the whole nature of the being when you change just one part of the DNA."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Peat's opinion on the burgeoning field of genetics and its claims, prompting a critique of genetic manipulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that gene, also they recommend taking out the uterus as well as the breast. But it can cause other tissues to be unstable and so you can remove everything that could possibly be unstable and develop into cancer. But then some other factors are going to be noticing that your body is all fragmented and just taking off some part of your body that has unpredictable effects. Sure."
**CONTEXT:** The host elaborates on the genetic predisposition for cancer and the drastic measures taken, leading Peat to discuss the unpredictable systemic effects of such interventions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the habits of the family are heritable. The eating rituals, the popular foods, the national foods, so that given families will sometimes be eating the same meal generation after generation. But it's in no way an indicator of something that you're going to get, right?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if genetic predispositions are simply inherited family habits, leading Peat to discuss the heritability of lifestyle and dietary patterns.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, not in a very predictable way. Yeah. Would it be like in the case of this stomach or breast cancer, could that be used to maybe, I don't know. And for any benefit knowing that whatsoever, that you had like a stomach or a breast cancer gene like this movie star had, I mean, does it mean anything? I don't know. It might mean that you have a special sensitivity to... certain things in the environment, the fact that the disease caused by a gene typically takes many years to develop, like a person in their 30s is advised to have their breasts and uterus removed. What has been happening in all of these 20 or 30 years with no cancer, and if you see that you have the gene that they incriminate, all you have to do is change your diet. Avoid polyunsaturated fats, maybe use aspirin. You can identify the pathways leading from the gene to the cancer, and along that pathway during the decades when you don't have the cancer, there are all sorts of things you can do to change the way you develop."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if knowing about a genetic predisposition for cancer offers any benefit, leading Peat to suggest it indicates environmental sensitivities and can be addressed through lifestyle changes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, we're always modifying our development, either deepening the rat we're in or periodically... Or getting out of it, right?"
**CONTEXT:** The host reflects on the idea of modifying one's development, prompting Peat's agreement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, sometimes the rabbit's so deep, you're not trying very hard."
**CONTEXT:** The host suggests that the body wants to heal, leading Peat to offer a cautionary, yet realistic, perspective.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I think the peak of naturopathic thinking was probably a little over a hundred years ago. Wow. And, uh, they've, to gain acceptance, they have accepted a lot of conventional orthodox medical ideas. They take the same basic courses, and, uh, I think have underdeveloped the energetic understanding of the organism. The holistic part has been submerged quite a bit by making themselves acceptable to society that's trained to think in terms of drug curing disease."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the progression of naturopathic medicine, leading Peat to express a critical view of its current state and its embrace of conventional medical paradigms.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, just that anyone growing up has it built deeply into them that sickness can often be cured by a very specific chemical. And the old homeopathic idea was largely a scientific, holistic understanding that your defensive reactions, your immune system, in the general sense, that these need to be treated in a very intuitive, holistic manner, looking at the whole organism rather than just the sickness. The parts."
**CONTEXT:** The host inquires if naturopathic colleges have become influenced by conventional wisdom, prompting Peat to contrast the current approach with older, more holistic principles.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think a lot of it is intuition. Intuition? Some people just naturally, like a dog or a cat, can sometimes sense that a person is developing, for example, epilepsy. A dog can sometimes warn its owner that they're about to experience an attack, or detect the presence of a tumor, and so on. And a good practitioner starts out with that general openness to who they're dealing with, and works from there."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the process of discerning the most beneficial homeopathic remedy, leading Peat to emphasize the role of intuition and innate animal sensitivity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but the right Remedy Many different things when you're looking at the the organism as a whole You find that you can shift the internal balance by little bits of action in different directions and so Different people can use different Herbs or Minerals To Achieve the same purpose of balance interesting, you know, so there's no magic bullet kind of thing for anything There's no right. Yeah In general. Yeah in general. Yeah."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a specific "right" remedy in homeopathy, leading Peat to explain the individualized and holistic nature of treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the case of the fingertip Older people The tissues There's more connective tissue than A juicy vigorous selves in any part of the body probably the organism is drying up. If you start with a fertilized ovum with about a 92% water content, if you follow all the way through to old age, of newly formed tissue, from 92%, with maturation, you're getting drier and drier, and with aging, there's a continuous dryness of the tissues. So it's literally a degree of dehydration. There just isn't the turgor pressure of your tissues to push your skin figure back into position. It takes longer. And with an animal, if you pull up a piece of skin on the back of the animal, same thing as a dent in your finger that doesn't spring back right away, you pull up a flab of tissue on its back, a young animal's skin pops right back into place. On the old animal, a piece of skin takes maybe 10 seconds to work its way back into place. So it's this idea of what's called aging is a dryness. In Ayurveda, I think it's more of a vata, v-a-t-a, it's a dry, right? Dryness kind of thing in the elderly."
**CONTEXT:** The host describes skin imprints that remain for a long time, asking for the cause, leading Peat to explain aging as a process of tissue dehydration and loss of turgor.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, that really doesn't help anything. The factor that regulates the water content is partly the ratio of connective tissues and the type of connective tissue. As the glycoprotein content decreases, the tissue has less water. If you've got too much glycoprotein, as in hypothyroidism, that causes edema. And that causes a different type of, a persistent pressure will squeeze the water out of the tissue, and if it takes a long time to come back, that's partly because you've worked the water out of the glycoproteins that tend to make the tissue plump. Hypothyroidism tends to look young and plump, but it's because it's being retained in this soggy connective tissue. It's a different shift that causes the continuing dehydration with age, and to get the cells back to a normal plumpness, you have to energize them and accelerate the renewal process without developing tumors. A fast-growing tumor is very wet, returns to about 90% water content, so you don't want to just mindlessly increase the wetness. You want to have it in a deliberate, organized way, raising the energy back to, say, when you're 25 years old. You've got lots of energy, both the right amount of glycoprotein relative to collagen to create connective tissue moisture. Lots of ATP being formed in cells to renew the cells and to renew them at a proper hydration state."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if more water or oil would help with tissue dryness, leading Peat to explain the role of glycoproteins, hypothyroidism, and cellular energy in maintaining tissue hydration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Good energy is what makes the right amount of glycoprotein. Good energy, the chi or the prana, whatever you want to call it. Yeah, and estrogen has the cell-renewing effect, but you have to be very cautious with the effects of estrogen, because it will hydrate the cell very quickly and cause it to start growing, but that has to be under the control of differentiating things like progesterone and thyroid with proper oxidation. What's missing with estrogen is oxidative energy. With thyroid and adequate vitamin A, you can increase your hydration and cell renewal. In the skin, if you're deficient in vitamin A, estrogen dominates and will create sort of a dandruff condition. But when vitamin A is adequate, it suppresses estrogen and increases the renewal and maintenance of cells in a moist state. Under estrogen, you get moistness but thinning of the actual, vital skin. It prematurely turns to the keratinized layer. Same thing in your mouth. When you are vitamin A deficient, keratinization makes a little white lump on the cervix of the uterus. Same thing with leukoplasty from overgrowth of the superficial keratinized cells. If you get your vitamin A up, the skin becomes thicker and renewing itself at a better rate, but staying vital and functioning in a multicellular layer instead of prematurely reaching that dry keratinized state."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to energize cells and obtain glycoproteins, leading Peat to discuss the role of energy, estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, and vitamin A in cell renewal and hydration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, eggs, liver, milk and cream. Oh, our faves. Yeah, good stuff."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for high vitamin A foods, prompting Peat to list them.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, for years and years I've been thinking of the pro-aging effect of mesionine, cysteine, tryptophanes. The protein in meat. Ultimately, most of the other amino acids, if you limit your protein, you're going to drastically extend your average or expected lifetime. Really?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Peat's shift to a lower protein diet, leading him to explain the pro-aging effects of certain amino acids found in protein.

**RAY PEAT:** "It has to suit your metabolic rate. And with aging, the same thing that causes dehydration to develop, at the same time you're slowing your metabolic rate. It's the energy production that retains moistness in the tissues, and that high metabolic rate is what you need the protein for. And so as your metabolic rate slows, then you're more at risk of suffering from the toxic effects of too much mesionine, cysteine."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about appropriate protein intake, leading Peat to link it to metabolic rate and aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it just took me years to get around to actually trying that. But within two or three days, I noticed my temperature rising, so I didn't need as much supplemented thyroid. Oh, and your temperature was rising because, I kind of missed that part, because you were eating the protein? Eating more carbohydrates. Eating more carbohydrates, and your temperature is going up? Yeah, without as much supplemented thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** Peat explains his personal experience with reducing protein and increasing carbohydrates, noting a rise in body temperature and a reduced need for thyroid supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid is the main thing, but the right amount of vitamin A to help keep the estrogen under control is very important. Getting enough carbohydrates. And for her getting off carbohydrates. Yeah, fruit juices have anti-inflammatory things, flavonoids are protective against the effects of estrogen."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for remedies for teen acne before menstruation, leading Peat to recommend thyroid, vitamin A, adequate carbohydrates, and fruit juices.

**RAY PEAT:** "Surprisingly, progesterone and thyroid hormones can very quickly break a person out of that self-limiting fear."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to break free from fear, particularly when it's linked to a history of hypothyroidism, leading Peat to suggest progesterone and thyroid hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've had friends that were experiencing the transient ischemic attacks and their doctors were telling them to avoid vitamin K and foods that contain vitamin K and I recommended that they have their actual vitamin K and clotting factors measured and vitamin K can be measured as well as the clotting factors that it regulates and there are two anti clotting factors, protein C and protein S that the liver produces under the influence of vitamin K and in a vitamin K deficient person they are also deficient in those anti clotting factors and the people who ignored their doctors diet recommendations to avoid vitamin K foods and who actually supplemented vitamin K brought their proteins S and C back up to normal and stopped having the attacks."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about preventing strokes and transient ischemic attacks, referencing a doctor's advice to avoid vitamin K, leading Peat to explain the crucial role of vitamin K in producing anti-clotting factors.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, that's where you talked about those two combo, pregnenolone and DHEA, and that toughens them up a bit. Yeah, and progesterone. And the progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about preventing leaky capillaries, leading Peat to recommend pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "To start with, lots of carbohydrates, adequate amount of protein of high quality, milk, and other vitamin A rich foods or supplement vitamin A."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for solutions for varicose and spider veins, leading Peat to recommend carbohydrates, quality protein, milk, and vitamin A.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's a good carbohydrate. That's good."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if potatoes are a good carbohydrate source, leading Peat to confirm.

**RAY PEAT:** "I know in themselves, the polyphenols are extremely beneficial, but with certain berries, you unavoidably get the seeds. And the seeds usually have some plant defensive chemical that produces inflammation. So if you chew up the seeds of a berry or a clixom, you extract some of these harmful factors from the seeds."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential benefits and drawbacks of polyphenols in blueberries, leading Peat to explain the inflammatory compounds found in berry seeds.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, the pressure cooker has a pressure release, so you get rid of the toxins in the air and should ventilate your kitchen while they're cooking."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about cooking mushrooms in a pressure cooker with a lid due to poor ventilation, leading Peat to explain the pressure release mechanism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're very good for fiber, but they contain antibiotics and anti-cancer agents. Most all mushrooms?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of mushrooms, leading Peat to highlight their fiber content and medicinal properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, the progesterone detoxifies the estrogen in the cell. It inhibits aromatase production of estrogen, it inactivates estrogen receptors, and it promotes the addition of glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid to the estrogen molecule, making it water-soluble right in any cell where it's both experiencing estrogen excess and experiencing the effects of progesterone. So, you have detoxified it before it even leaves the affected cells, and once it's detoxified and in the bloodstream, it has no estrogen effects, and being water-soluble leaves through the kidneys without further processing."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effects of insufficient progesterone and the liver's ability to detoxify estrogen, leading Peat to detail progesterone's multifaceted role in estrogen detoxification within the cell.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, it's part of the reason they... Protestantism is associated... with pregnancy. It is a general protective hormone. It opposes the weakening and inflaming effects of estrogen. The process of starting a new life starts with erasing all of the previous information of the parent organism. That's the function of estrogen is to use inflammation and stimulation of the body, and that's the purpose of estrogen. Erasing all of the previous information of the parent organism, and that's the function of estrogen is to use inflammation and stimulation of cell division to start with a fresh, clean slate. After this period of erasing and starting over, then to produce a proper organism, you need to be flooded with progesterone. A woman experiences a spike of estrogen for a day or two every month, and after that has allowed an ovum to mature and be fertilized and implant, then progesterone takes over with these, about a thousand times more progesterone influence than estrogen when we start off on a new life. During pregnancy, it's stabilizing against all kinds of stress, keeps the blood sugar steady, the oxygen steady, a delivery of all of the nutrients stabilized by adequate progesterone. So the pregnancy is a crucial time when absolute defense through progesterone is essential. But at all other times, like in a man's brain during stress, progesterone is our basic protective anti-stress factor. All tissues in both sexes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a theoretical explanation of why a small amount of progesterone is beneficial, leading Peat to describe its protective role against estrogen's inflammatory and cell-division-stimulating effects, particularly in the context of reproduction and stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress has effects just like estrogen to erase our good functions and reduce things to the minimum. Hans Selye tested a different doses of estrogen and found that the shock stage of the stress reaction when the maximum stress in effect was identical to the effects of a big dose of estrogen."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the profound effects of stress on the body, leading Peat to draw a parallel between stress and estrogen's detrimental effects, citing Hans Selye's research.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, it's just one of the possible causes, but when a deficiency is the cause, you should see immediate correction of the problem just one or two days with anywhere from maybe 20 to 50 milligrams. And pretty quickly it'll get there. Yeah. But sometimes aspirin is all it takes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to take B6 for diarrhea, leading Peat to explain its use in cases of deficiency and mention aspirin as an alternative.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, just about everything. Our whole energy and renewal system involves the B vitamins. Do we need then animal protein for B vitamins? No. Plant sources are very good."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about general symptoms of B vitamin deficiency, leading Peat to state its broad involvement in energy and renewal, and clarify that plant sources are sufficient.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, it is, but COX is the enzyme that makes plastic landings, but the Leukotrines are probably the most potent things in asthma. But reducing the substrate that you make Leukotrines and plastic landings from, that's the essential fatty acids. So keeping your essential fatty acids at a very minimum or deficient state is really essential to avoiding asthma."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of LOX and Leukotrienes in asthma, leading Peat to explain their potency and the importance of minimizing essential fatty acids to prevent asthma.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, most kids grow out of the milk allergy. And the things that help you grow out of the allergy are keeping all inflammation lower, avoiding irritating foods, and keeping your digestive system active by keeping your thyroid level proper."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if serious allergies, potentially induced by vaccinations, can be overcome, leading Peat to suggest that most children outgrow milk allergies with proper management of inflammation, diet, and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, you should check it occasionally at different times of day, and there should be a curve rising after breakfast, and peaking in the late afternoon, and then falling during the night. So peaking in 3, 4, 5, down to 98.6 and then beginning to fall then, again? Yeah, it's okay to go to 99 or higher in the afternoon."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if temperature testing for thyroid function should only be done in the morning, leading Peat to explain the diurnal temperature curve.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, they're exactly what is the main blockage to cell respiration and oxygen use. So he's got that backwards. Yeah, he's selling the idea of polyunsaturated."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Peat's opinion on the theory that plant-based EFAs saturate cells with oxygen, leading him to refute it and identify EFAs as a blockage to oxygen use.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the N-6 for about 40 years were absolutely the best thing, according to all the studies, except a few of them in which they increased deaths from heart attacks and cancer. Except those studies. It took 40 years to kill the doctrine of the healthful essential fatty acids. And as they were disappearing, the Environmental Protection Agency told the fish processing companies to stop polluting the bay areas and land garbage dumps with all of their fish skin and waste fat. And right at that time, suddenly, with the discovery of N-6 proof of being carcinogenic and heart toxic, and the industry having a problem with the government telling them not to pollute the land with fish oil, they discovered it was the greatest thing since the N-6 fats. So it became an ideal health food. And when did that start? How far back was that? The APA action, I think, was in the late 70s or 80s."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks why omega-3 fatty acids are considered bad despite studies suggesting otherwise, leading Peat to expose the manipulation of scientific consensus regarding essential fatty acids, particularly the shift from N-6 to N-3.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in the sense that water vapor makes you need to turn over your lung gas exchange faster. So in a dry climate there's a little difference favoring CO2. But a high altitude is by far the best. You hear about the yogis going to high mountains to meditate."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the retention of CO2 in warm, dry climates, leading Peat to explain the role of water vapor and the superior effect of high altitude.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, food processor. So you grind them afterwards? My favorite way to use them is mushroom soup. If you grind them as fine as you can it makes the texture of the soup creamier and increases the flavor. Also releases more of the beneficial materials."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to prevent mushrooms from turning rubbery when cooked, leading Peat to suggest grinding them for a creamier texture and enhanced flavor.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're very good for fiber, but they contain antibiotics and anti-cancer agents. Most all mushrooms?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of mushrooms, leading Peat to highlight their fiber content and medicinal properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, having some blood tests is probably important. What would she be looking for, Doc? All of the liver enzymes would be very important to check. TSH, to see how her thyroid is working, checking her body temperature."
**CONTEXT:** The host describes symptoms of a clogged liver and edema, leading Peat to recommend blood tests for liver enzymes and thyroid function, along with body temperature monitoring.

**RAY PEAT:** "You know the olive oil, you know, the thing they do, the... No, it doesn't. It doesn't? It has a mild anti-inflammatory effect if you do it regularly. Mm-hmm. But the action, the medical standard for a long time was to use a muscle relaxant like atropine or gyms and weed to relax the duct out of the gallbladder and then take olive oil to stimulate the contraction. That action of the gallbladder in the combination would let the stones pass through."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if olive oil works on the liver as well as the gallbladder for stone passage, leading Peat to explain its mild anti-inflammatory effect and the medical standard involving muscle relaxants and gallbladder stimulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, or at breakfast. Or at breakfast, wow. And there were people over the years who recommended doing a thing called something FAS before you do it to relax. Is that the same thing? Do you know what I mean? What was the first? Something Phos, P-H-O-S, it was, I think was the ingredients in apples. Well, they want you to drink a whole bunch of apple juice before you did the flush. Oh, sometimes they recommend citrus juice, lemon juice. That's to get it out of your stomach very quickly. Yeah. Oh, you mean, yeah, when you do. But is there something you- What did you say, Doc, you do before the gallbladder flush that is good to do to relax the muscles around the gallbladder? Oh, the gymson weed. Gymson weed. It works like atropine, very similar chemical. And that 50 to 100 years ago was recognized as very effective and safe. But the atropine, partly because drug culture use for entertainment, it lost- Entertainment. Yeah, it lost a lot of its medical use. So you could actually go online and buy gymson weed in like a tincture or something? Yeah, just a piece of a leaf the size of your thumbnail sometimes was enough. You mean just a few days before you did the flush? No, right at the same time as the olive oil."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pre-flush preparations and muscle relaxants for gallbladder flushes, leading Peat to discuss apple juice, citrus juice, and the effectiveness of jimson weed (atropine-like) taken concurrently with olive oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Yeah. And if the liver is actually getting blocked up, that requires usually something to make your intestine more active and less inflamed. And usually a thyroid supplement goes with correcting the liver enzyme excess."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about a clogged liver and potential toxicity, leading Peat to recommend intestinal activation, reduced inflammation, and thyroid supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the natural thyroid brand. It produces, when it's digested, both T4 and T3, but it contains none of those as an actual ingredient. They're produced by the digestive enzymes, so taking it with food, there will be a gradual release of those things, so it doesn't hit your liver, for example, as evidence that you're poisoned by an excess of something. If you take too much T3, even 10 micrograms at once of pure T3 signals your liver that you're overdosed at that moment, and so your liver begins producing the enzyme to break down the T3. So if you do that regularly, the liver becomes very active in destroying T3. That's why it's important to take little bits of it gradually during the day."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if natural desiccated thyroid (NTD) can be taken once a day with a meal, leading Peat to explain that its gradual release with food is beneficial, unlike synthetic T3 which can overwhelm the liver if taken in large doses at once.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but it's present in the pill, so you still don't want to take your whole dose once a day. You should break it up into two or three parts."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Sinoplus, a balanced T4/T3 medication, leading Peat to advise against taking the entire dose at once due to its pre-formulated T3 content.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the Sinoplus pill contains 30 micrograms of T3 and 120 of T4. 120 of T4, I'm writing this down, and 30 micro of T3. It's pretty much equivalent to two and a half grains of old-fashioned armor."
**CONTEXT:** Peat details the composition of Sinoplus, comparing it to Armour Thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, never take more than, maximum would be a fourth of a Sinoplus, but better start with an eighth of a tablet. And then you would just do an eighth once a day and then work up a little bit until your temperature was stable?"
**CONTEXT:** Peat advises on starting with a low dose of Sinoplus, suggesting an eighth of a tablet once a day and gradual adjustment based on body temperature.

**RAY PEAT:** "People telling me that they suffer from a syndrome of hypersensitivity or intolerance to thyroid hormone because they've tried the absurdly high doses that so many people are recommending."
**CONTEXT:** Peat discusses the "syndrome of intolerance to thyroid hormone" caused by excessive doses recommended by bodybuilders and online sources.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, this is way, way long. Please, why don't you try to, Linda, try to shorten this down so I can get through it. I just can't read the whole thing. I'm sorry. Um. I always read to take thyroid on an empty stomach so the food doesn't bind to the thyroid enzymes and lose potency. Is that true, Dr. Beaton, they're writing, they're asking you? Yeah, it's true that pharmacists and doctors have been saying that now for more than 50 years. And it's true that food slows the absorption, but that's exactly what you want. That's what you want. You want gradual absorption because that's most like the action of your body secreting a little bit every hour. But doctors and pharmacists are thinking in terms of wanting to get, for example, a blood pressure drug or painkiller drug, fully working as fast as possible, and that's the only basis for taking it on an empty stomach in the morning. I see. It's completely unphysiological for a hormone. Unphysiological, that's great."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if thyroid should be taken on an empty stomach, leading Peat to explain that gradual absorption with food is physiological for hormones, unlike the rapid absorption desired for other medications.

**RAY PEAT:** "The soul in the Aristotelian tradition is the form creator. So the soul is necessarily present as the ovum starts turning into an organism. The Aristotelian concept is that this soul is there creating the process. So do you kind of go along with that one? As much as you can tell? As far as I can tell. Yeah, so, you know, they talk about life. It's very interesting. I mean, the sperm has life, right, and then the ovum has life, and so, I mean, from a spiritual perspective, it never really started. It always was, kind of. Yeah, yeah. Kind of always was, right? But the purpose is incomplete when you're only half of it, the sperm or the egg and so the completion concept is that the combination creates the individual."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the timing of the soul's entry into the body, leading Peat to discuss the Aristotelian concept of the soul as the form creator present from the beginning of embryonic development.

**RAY PEAT:** "The inflammatory processes are triggered purposely by the vaccine and they overlap with the problem at work. The inflammatory problem you might have been having is going to get worse when it's activated and the beneficial effects of aspirin and progesterone and vitamin D, all of the anti-inflammatory things are going to be more important following the vaccine."
**CONTEXT:** The host describes post-vaccination symptoms including insomnia, muscle spasms, and inflammation, asking if it could be autoimmune or histamine-related, leading Peat to state that vaccines trigger inflammatory processes and highlight the importance of anti-inflammatory measures like aspirin, progesterone, and vitamin D.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, it gets right in at the basis of correcting probably 10 or 20 known mechanisms that are interrupting stress-induced processes of inflammation. Interesting. And is there a downside of somebody wanting to take it every day? I mean, is that okay? Eventually it could cause a vitamin K deficiency. So if you're going to be taking big doses for a long time, you should eat aged cheeses, some liver, cooked kale and broccoli and so on. Yeah, all the good stuff."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if aspirin is more than symptomatic relief and if daily use is acceptable, leading Peat to explain its anti-inflammatory mechanisms and the potential for vitamin K deficiency with long-term high doses, recommending K-rich foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can get pure USP aspirin for $15 or $20 a pound in pure crystalline form. And then you could figure out how many milligrams that is and just take it, huh? Yeah, like an eighth of a teaspoon or so. And then getting this, it helps the body. It could help the body, if I understand you or what you're saying, Dr. Pete, it could help the body to heal a lot of different things if the inflammation goes down, right?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the source of pure aspirin and its potential benefits, leading Peat to suggest crystalline aspirin and its role in reducing inflammation for healing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and a lot of our... Excess inflammation comes from eating the polyunsaturated fat. Oh, the old poofers. Oh, yeah."
**CONTEXT:** Peat attributes excess inflammation to the consumption of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, vitamin K. Vitamin K. Vitamin E, I mean. Okay. And anti-estrogens, progesterone and thyroid and vitamin A. But vitamin E in particular helps the aspirin and progesterone to reduce the fiber formation."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about dietary or protocol interventions for Peyronie's disease, leading Peat to recommend vitamin K, vitamin E, anti-estrogens, progesterone, thyroid, and vitamin A, with vitamin E specifically aiding aspirin and progesterone in reducing fiber formation.

**RAY PEAT:** "A lot of things can start it, but the first aid is usually getting your sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium in balance and a spoonful of baking soda and about half a glass of water is a way to calm things by a quick... Oh, right there during the time, just boom. Yeah. And the other thing is we've got the sodium, potassium, calcium, that whole thing. How do we get that in balance? How does that work? Talk to us a little bit about that."
**CONTEXT:** The host describes a painful calf cramp, leading Peat to suggest electrolyte balance and baking soda as immediate relief, and then to elaborate on achieving electrolyte balance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Eating too much meat, for example, with high phosphate content, that increases the parathyroid hormone and creates a loss of energy at all levels. The parathyroid hormone blocks mitochondrial function and that lowers cell energy and cell energy is what keeps the internal electrolyte balance. Does chicken have that high phosphorus as well as beef? Oh, yeah. Oh, it does. Fish? No? Fish too. So just overall, too much protein, that could be a cause of that for this fellow."
**CONTEXT:** Peat explains how high phosphate content in meat increases parathyroid hormone, which blocks mitochondrial function, lowers cell energy, and disrupts electrolyte balance, and confirms that chicken and fish also contribute to this.

**RAY PEAT:** "The worst effects are during the first year after the explosion, and the longer-lived isotopes produce less harmful radiation. So this whole idea that the Earth will be damaged for the 100 years is something, God forbid that they ever did some nukes, it's not true."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about experiencing no ill effects from a nuclear explosion 15 years prior, leading Peat to explain that the worst effects are immediate and longer-lived isotopes are less harmful, debunking the notion of 100-year damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most of the radiation, long-lasting contamination from that explosion is elsewhere around the Northern Hemisphere. Oh, it's spread around. Yeah. It just didn't stay on the island. Yeah, and so if you just, no matter where you explode them, it's going to add to the long-lasting background radiation. And that's, if you extrapolate to a thousand bombs going off in dirty situations... I see....throwing up lots of smoke and dust, that's where you're risking exterminating life. I see. So in the old, or in the proverbial conventional nuclear war when everybody's bombing everybody, that could really be a problem. Yeah, even insects would risk being extincted."
**CONTEXT:** Peat explains that radiation spreads globally and that a large-scale nuclear event, with smoke and dust, poses a significant risk of extinction.

**RAY PEAT:** "As far as I can tell. Yeah, so, you know, they talk about life. It's very interesting. I mean, the sperm has life, right, and then the ovum has life, and so, I mean, from a spiritual perspective, it never really started. It always was, kind of. Yeah, yeah. Kind of always was, right? But the purpose is incomplete when you're only half of it, the sperm or the egg and so the completion concept is that the combination creates the individual."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the spiritual perspective on life and its beginning, leading Peat to suggest that life, in a sense, always exists, but the combination of sperm and ovum creates the individual.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, maybe. I don't know where you got that. Could be. A lot of viewpoints on this. I think soul goes back and forth as well. Yeah, you know, the whole abortion thing is such a personal and unique and, you know, it's just above my pay grade to get involved in that at all. You know, people need to do what they're going to do, and between you and God and the soul that's around and work that one out yourself. I don't have a dog in that fight. You know what I mean?"
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions a belief about the soul entering the fetus at the 4th or 5th month, leading Peat to acknowledge multiple viewpoints and defer on the abortion debate, emphasizing personal spiritual resolution.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you know, the whole abortion thing is such a personal and unique and, you know, it's just above my pay grade to get involved in that at all. You know, people need to do what they're going to do, and between you and God and the soul that's around and work that one out yourself. I don't have a dog in that fight. You know what I mean?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the timing of the soul's entry into the body, leading Peat to state that the abortion debate is a personal matter and beyond his purview.
