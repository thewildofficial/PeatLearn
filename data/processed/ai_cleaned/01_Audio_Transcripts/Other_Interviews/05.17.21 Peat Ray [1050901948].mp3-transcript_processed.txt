**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, after I had studied it in the lab I remembered that every time I handled it I would stop having hangnails and ever since I worked in the lab using it I've never had a hangnail or you know this little inflamed red broken places that where the skin sort of splits open and that started me thinking about how what are there things that might do in those very trace amounts and probably three or four years after I did my dissertation that I came across a woman who had what seemed to be a degenerative brain disease that they weren't sure whether it was optic neuritis or a deeper type of brain disease but she somehow got the idea of progesterone being involved I think because of her cyclic symptoms getting worse and she had been so bad that she was bedridden for six months at a time and never could for I guess two or three years couldn't function properly she needed a walker or would tend to get lost if she tried to go shopping but she convinced a doctor to give her progesterone shots that was 1975 or 6 and she started recovering just with a couple of the injections and she kept convincing different doctors to keep giving it to her and she recovered so completely that I asked her to do a talk to my endocrine class at the naturopathic medical school and it was in an old building two or three stories up and so she had to drive through the city find a parking place walk up two or three flights of stairs and then she lectured the whole hour of the class very well organized extremely well-informed and she had supposedly had a degenerative brain condition

**CONTEXT:** Would you say looking back on this Dr. Peat, it wasn't necessarily a lack of progesterone that caused it, but they're given the progesterone or help the symptoms to go? Why would you explain that?

**RAY PEAT:** It stops the stress and puts the cells in a higher energy state of rest, simply letting things catch up so that even if the original problem was for example radiation or poisoning or a vitamin deficiency or mineral deficiency, just by giving this rest period whatever was that was going wrong the body could reorganize itself, catch up, accumulate some of the missing nutrients and so on and become more efficient. So rest, so it's actually helping the cells just to settle down and be more parasympathetic, just in a state of readiness and you don't need to resort to either of those pushers, the upward or downward push of the cell. It's sort of like a political autonomy, you don't have to be pushed this way or that way. When the cells are really highly energized and efficient, they can take care of themselves pretty much and can cooperate efficiently rather than having to be bullied into becoming more active or for more acquiescent for sleeping and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Are there things that we do or don't do in the diet arena that occurs the idea that we need to take a little bit of progesterone? Do we miss something?

**RAY PEAT:** You know, just about anything we miss. The strange thing about progesterone is that it literally is good for everything. And that's the trouble of getting someone to understand how useful it can be is because of the belief that everything has a particular cause of a particular cure, but in the case of a few things such as progesterone, it's a matter of stabilizing the cell or the organism in its resting state, letting it gather up its forces to go back and work on the particular problems.

**CONTEXT:** It sounds like a real natural approach. You're not trying to kill anything or change anything, right? You're just helping the body to heal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, exactly. It doesn't worry about killing germs or viruses or cancer cells. Yeah, in the case of cancer cells, when you can, for example, a skin cancer, I've seen people with diagnosed cancers on their lips or their ears, which they didn't want cut off or irradiated, just because they were conspicuous. Just in a week or so, the thing would either close up, it stopped being a sore or would fall off.

**CONTEXT:** Now, the product you developed, Progestes, is it a wild yam derivative?

**RAY PEAT:** That was about 70 years ago. They were making it from wild yams in Mexico and I used to go to school right by the Syntex factory that got me curious in the 1950s. They were already producing that and other hormones, but I didn't start working with it until more than 10 years after that. But the Progestes is a yam derivative product. I know it's the now they use whatever source is economical. It just happens that the wild yam was a very abundant, cheap source. They just go in the jungle and pull out these gigantic yams that were sometimes 20 or 30 pounds each.

**CONTEXT:** But does the body really care that this source, as long as it gets it?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it goes through more than 20 chemical processes anyway, so it doesn't matter where it came from.

**CONTEXT:** It's really interesting talking to you all this time. I really appreciate that you've never been really dogmatic against some different pharmaceuticals if they do the job, is that accurate?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because some of them do something right. Some of them. Yeah, the antibiotics, after all, usually started with a natural substance. There are antibiotics in mushrooms as well as molds and then trees and fruits and so on. Antibiotics are everywhere. So the idea that an antibiotic has to be a harmful drug is a misperception. The problem is that the drug companies are always wanting something more profitable and so they discourage the use of the simple, abundant, safe materials and add chlorine or fluorine atom to it and change its behavior and patent it and then promote it as the latest thing that is so good you should forget using the old antibiotics. But what they do is generally make it riskier, even though more powerful in some ways, they're also more harmful in some ways.

**CONTEXT:** There's a whole cadre of people, as you know, the Kaufmanns and Cowans in the world and lots of them, Lankas in Germany, that are suggesting that even bacteria like in the throat, the strep throat, the bacteria is trying to do its thing and to use an antibiotic for that is just stopping the healing process. Does that resonate with you?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, basically, you should make the organism so healthy and happy that it makes its bacteria healthy and happy. But if you happen to have a rapidly growing bacteria in your throat that's hurting, a quick swish, rinsing an antibiotic over it can knock it out and give your body a chance to come back and keep it under control.

**CONTEXT:** In other words, let's see, because they're arguing that the bacteria is really doing the healing, that if you kill it, then you're just stuffing it somewhere else. But you're saying an antibiotic can actually not kill it all and just leave enough?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. There have been several studies going back decades in which once they identified that there was a harmful infection, they would give a minimal dose of the antibiotic and watch the symptoms and usually about a third to a half of the typically prescribed dose would get it under control quickly without hurting the body's immune system. And so the total dose, instead of continuing it for two weeks, as soon as they would see the symptoms subsiding, maybe in a few hours or maybe a day or a day and a half, as soon as the symptoms were gone, they would stop killing the bacteria and let the body's immune system take over again.

**CONTEXT:** And when did they do this? They figured this out?

**RAY PEAT:** I was reading those papers in the 1980s.

**CONTEXT:** Boy, you don't hear much of that going around these days, do you?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Nobody talks about that. All they do is tell you to, what, take three weeks and use them all, right? Don't stop. Just keep taking them. That's what gets people in trouble. They knock out the bacteria totally and then all of those remaining two weeks, what they're doing is weakening the body because these things are actually directly toxic to our own mitochondria and ribosomes and various essential processes. They're more toxic to the bacteria, but they're still somewhat toxic, and so if you keep taking massive amounts of them, all you're doing is poisoning yourself a little more unnecessarily.

**CONTEXT:** On the argument that if you do that and do the full course and you do what you just explained, does the initial insult on the body, is it still there? Does it drive it deeper or whatever it is, some kind of poisoning or heavy metal or something?

**RAY PEAT:** If you continue the antibiotic just a little beyond the disappearance of the symptoms, just taper off so that you are seeing that the thing isn't ready to have a great resurgence, if it stays away when you've tapered off, then what you're doing is letting the body's natural immunity start to come back and take over and not let the bacteria set up business again. And then if you, but if you go the other way and just really carpet bomb the whole thing, I guess I'm trying to understand is there something that's still left in the body that can come back?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, their idea is that the spores will be there and potentially to burst out again. The bacteria defend themselves and go into a spore state where they can resist a moderate amount of the antibiotic. And so the idea is that you have to wait a certain, usually two weeks, in some cases three weeks of constant bombardment so that you get the last trace of it. It's like cancer therapy in which first you do surgery and then you use chemical poisons and then irradiate the body for good measure. It's an obsessive belief that the body is absolutely incapable of taking over at some point.

**CONTEXT:** So do you think there could be some judicious, really good, positive ways of using chemo if you really were careful?

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. Right at the same time I was reading those antibiotic studies, people were doing the same, advocating about a half to a third or a fourth of the potency of the chemotherapy and watching what's happening to the tumor. And it's a matter of the balance between your body and the tumor. And if you see the tumor shrinking, you don't want to hurt the body any more than necessary. And they were having good results with simply trying to shift the balance in favor of the patient and against the tumor without obsessively trying to kill every last imagined cell. In fact, that idea of the cancer being a matter of a seed, one evil cell that multiplies and becomes the cancer, that whole thing has never been a valid theory of cancer. The cancer is always involving the restorative healing processes of the organism being weakened. And it's always a matter of gradation within a field of tissue organization and health. So the organism just doesn't get strong enough and then people get consumed by it and then they die, quote, of cancer, unquote.

**CONTEXT:** And just the last ten years or so, the standard treatments are demonstrating that when you cut out a tumor or otherwise kill it or irradiate it to death, what you're left with is a wounded area of the organism. And almost always that bad area is going to eventually produce more tumors if you haven't healed the body itself.

**RAY PEAT:** The signal from a tumor goes out and recruits cells from the bone marrow and from its immediate neighborhood. These signals of injury are a part of the normal healing process. And in a healthy person, the injury recruits healthy volunteers and does a thorough job of repairing the injury. And the cancer process is just a failed process of healing.

**CONTEXT:** Failed in what way?

**RAY PEAT:** The organism can't provide the energy or materials necessary to do a perfect healing job. And so some sickness or inflammation remains in that area. For example, any injury among the signals that it's causing is estrogen. Irritation or lack of oxygen or any stress activates the aromatase enzyme making estrogen. And the estrogen stimulates cell multiplication and amplifies the inflammation. And if the body can't produce massive amounts of the quieting substances, including progesterone, which should come in and turn off the production of estrogen, then the tumor is able to keep growing as wounds that can't heal.

**CONTEXT:** So then anybody with this thing called cancer, they would do everything they can to stay off of high estrogenic foods would be one thing?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's helpful. The injured tissue has become such a powerful source of estrogen that the important thing is to do everything possible to reduce the local production of estrogen. Even in the precancerous state, like in a ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast, that's a familiar place that doesn't look like cancer at the beginning. It does tend over the years to develop into a cancer and even at the earliest stages of that, just because the tissue is irritated, you can see the appearance of aromatase locally producing estrogen right there at the seat of the irritation or the failure to heal properly. And so everything of the organism should be directed to restoring the energy so it stops making the estrogen locally. The concentration of estrogen at an irritated site like that is internally the source is so intense locally that what happens in your diet or in the system in general, that estrogen is relatively mild and ineffective compared to what's produced locally.

**CONTEXT:** So is that one of the reasons why maybe soy and high estrogen foods are generally not best choices in general to eat?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that gives you a background inclination in that direction.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, stay right there. Dr. Ray Pete is with us and we're going to dig into your emails. Man, he's fun to talk to, huh? It's great when you have a guy around the house who's studied this stuff.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. Why not?

**CONTEXT:** Here's Sophie. She's in Baltimore. I have two skin tag questions for Dr. Pete. How to get rid of blackheads and how to shrink pores. Are blackheads skin tags?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Blackhead is the oily material with some dead cells mixed in with it. And the reason it's typically dark colored is that it has polyunsaturated fats in the skin oil that oxidize and turn dark. And so it's actually stuff that should have been secreted in a liquid form. But with things like a vitamin A deficiency in which your skin cells become obstructions to the secretion of oils, sometimes a disturbance of your thyroid gland combined with the vitamin A deficiency will create more blockage in the pores and those by being stationary edible material become potential food for bacteria and potential pimple or boil formation. So it's important to find out why you're secreting too much oil and shedding too many keratinized skin cells. And usually a good diet and checking your thyroid level will correct those and the pores will gradually return to normal size when you're not plugging them up anymore.

**CONTEXT:** So when the kids get these things, blackheads and stuff, it's just going to burger doodle and things like that and just bad food and fats and stuff?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, thank you. The progesterone and related steroids, DHEA, progesterone and pregnenolone are all stabilizers of the heart rhythm and of the blood vessel tone and those decrease, all of those decrease progressively with aging. And usually a declining thyroid after the age of about 40 or 50, the thyroid is becoming less active, less responsive. And so that produces less conversion of cholesterol to these protective steroids. So, if your cholesterol is 250 or 300, that means just by increasing thyroid activity you could produce a lot more of the protective steroids which have a heart stabilizing and blood vessel effect.

**CONTEXT:** So these things you mentioned, the DHEA and all that, they are in the body makes them when we have enough cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, thyroid, vitamin A and cholesterol are needed to make the protective steroids. And especially DHEA and progesterone have a natural, mild digitalis-like action, strengthening of the heart beat and rhythm. And when your progesterone and DHEA decline because of that intrinsic digitalis-like effect, what remains is the intracellularly produced estrogen. And estrogen has the opposite of the digitalis effect. So that if you imagine the stimulated heart as it increases the need to pump harder, it also gets a bigger stroke volume. It pumps both harder and faster when it has the natural protective steroids. And estrogen knocks out that ability to respond to a greater need by increasing both velocity and volume of pumping. And so you get a tendency to sort of collapse into a very weak shock-like pulse momentarily until you can gather up the stabilizing steroids. And one of the effects of estrogen is to also delay the readiness of the heart to beat again. And so the dangerous arrhythmia, it's called a QT prolongation or a slow QT wave. That's just because the estrogen and many other things that interfere with energy production cause the heart to become delayed in its ability to respond to the next beat. And progesterone and DHEA happen to be the QT shorteners that are more quickly ready to beat again.

**CONTEXT:** So would this give some real, even more, a little bit of credence to more of Cowan's idea that the heart is not necessarily the thing that's pumping everything around the body, that it's all the blood vessels and the, what's the guy's name, Pollard, you know, and the fourth phase of water and it's the blood vessels and they're happy and they're moving things around the body.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the veins converge back to the torso and the vena cava, for example, if it goes limp. A large part of the returned blood pools in this big vein in your body before it gets to the heart. And so the heart isn't receiving a fair share of the returning blood, and so it has a weak heartbeat. That's one of the effects of a shift towards estrogen away from DHEA and progesterone. And the tone of the vena cava goes limp, blood pools, and doesn't get to the heart. And so you have a rapid weak heartbeat. And what you need to do is tighten up your vein wall muscles, so that the veins don't simply hold the idle blood, but they squeeze it back into the heart. And when the vena cava pours its blood into the heart, then the heart can have a strong full beat.

**CONTEXT:** And we strengthen those how?

**RAY PEAT:** Avoiding the stress physiology, keeping the energy level up, which means keeping the ratio of progesterone to estrogen high in favor of progesterone dominance.

**CONTEXT:** And psychological fear, worry, angst, confusion that can mess with those guys, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for sure.

**CONTEXT:** Well, here's an email for you from, what do you recommend for acid reflux and preventing ulcers? Also, how do I convince my parents who are both diabetic that drinking orange juice and Mexican Coke is actually could be good for them? I tell them it could help reduce the cortisol in my body, but they won't buy it.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the first thing is to make sure your intestine is moving along rhythmically. The average American takes about 76 hours for food to move from the mouth to the excretion. And in Africa, in some areas, they've timed it on an average of 12 hours of very vigorous intestine action when you're active and eating fibrous food. And so just increasing the amount of safe fiber in your food can stimulate the intestine and keep peristalsis going in the right direction. When you're very hypothyroid and when your blood sugar falls during the night, that creates stress signals, a mixture of parasympathetic and sympathetic signals to the intestine, causing the peristalsis rhythm to get deranged and instead of moving from your mouth through your stomach to the intestine, it goes the other way. It goes the other way. And you get a flow backwards. And many years ago, a gastroenterologist experimented on his medical students by inserting a marker into their rectums. And then the next morning, taking a swab of their saliva and they found that the students who normally woke up with bad breath and a bad tasting mouth, they found the markers had migrated backwards into their mouth. So it was the habitual intestinal rhythm of a fair percentage of even a very healthy population like medical students. There was a nocturnal reversal of peristalsis.

**CONTEXT:** So what do we do or take during the middle of the night or before bed to help that nocturnal reversal go the other way where it's supposed to? And the acid thing will settle down.

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your blood sugar up is the first thing because the stress of nocturnal hypoglycemia is what excites your intestine in a random way. It's like a frenzy of activity that goes in all directions.

**CONTEXT:** So is that a call for more, that would be orange juice over say, milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Both milk and orange juice are very helpful because the calcium in the milk has a variety of calming effects.

**CONTEXT:** Pretty fascinating. So that's the real acid reflux thing is what's going on. Things are getting backed up.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and behind that, most often there's a thyroid deficiency leading to an imbalance of all of the other hormones. But milk and orange juice and fiber in the diet are the first aids that will help while you study your thyroid situation.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, that does have protective antioxidant effects, but you have to remember that its basic molecule is cysteine, and too much cysteine or methionine-related sulfur amino acid, these are potential excitotoxic life-shortening amino acids that you don't want to chronically overdose on.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the thing that thyroid does is make your metabolism run, consume oxygen. And if you aren't consuming oxygen, it's a fairly good chance that you don't have enough thyroid. It's the basic thing that makes us produce heat by consuming oxygen. So no matter whether you have the same amount of those chemicals detected in your blood, if it isn't activating the cells, then you can still be hypothyroid. And the TSH number ranges from 0.5 to 5.0, according to many official sources. And that range can cover everything from a very warm, active person to a very sluggish, cold, hypometabolic person, usually around TSH of 4. They're almost always suffering from fairly obvious hypothyroid symptoms. And so it's a matter of whether you want to please your doctor or whether you want to metabolize energetically.

**CONTEXT:** All right. This is interesting. OK, this is from Elena. She says, I am 55 years old, in good health, no issues, but every now and then I get swelling, what is called edema, in my feet. Sometimes one, sometimes two. It doesn't last very long, but I want to know the root cause of this, if Dr. Peet can tell me. Why is it doing this? What's that hooked up to? Is it a kidney thing, edema?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's part of it. Sometimes it's a very simple thing in your diet corresponding to your hormones. At the age of 55, people are still cycling. It doesn't matter that you're not having visible menstrual cycles, but still, the brain and the pituitary tend to cycle. And so, lots of women in their 50s will have the typical premenstrual water retention symptoms. And sometimes all that's needed is to salt your food to taste. In pregnancy, they used to restrict sodium so they wouldn't gain weight during pregnancy. And the problem was that the high estrogen people, who were usually low thyroid, weren't able to retain the sodium in their kidneys, and their body fluids became diluted, and the amount of albumin in the blood tends to be lost when you don't have enough sodium to hold the conformation of the albumin molecule proper. The edema goes with loss of sodium and albumin in the urine, and also the entry of albumin and sodium into your tissues with the water. But if you had more sodium available running through your system, that would stabilize the albumin in your bloodstream and attract the water out of your tissues, such as your feet, where it goes by gravity, and circulate the water through your kidneys, so that the water could be moved out of your body without losing the combination of sodium and magnesium. Getting the estrogen down makes you able to produce more albumin and retain more sodium, so that the water is properly distributed, pulling it into your bloodstream and carrying it to the kidneys.

**CONTEXT:** Wow, fascinating. All these little pieces, parts are all connected up, aren't they, Dr. Pete? Man, we really have to be clever these days to understand these bodies. We appreciate your input on these things. If one was to receive a prostate cancer diagnosis, writes Michael, what would be the best course of action, in your opinion, to prevent it from becoming metastasized? Would use of testosterone, DHT, or progesterone be recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** All of those, if you're sure that your thyroid is functioning properly and that you aren't likely to turn your testosterone into estrogen, and aspirin is a very competent way to suppress aromatase and protect your testosterone or DHEA from turning into estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Big old old bear aspirin, just a bear aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. More than 20 years ago, doctors started realizing that with the diagnosis of prostate cancer, they had seen the increased diagnosis using the PSA antigen. And following that increased diagnosis, the death rate went up sharply and as a result of that, the prostate specialists started realizing that not treating diagnosed prostate cancer was usually the best policy. Twenty years or so for a diagnosable prostate cancer to become harmful and meanwhile you have the opportunity to prevent metastatic spread of it and aspirin and progesterone and DHT are probably all protective against metastasis.

**CONTEXT:** So would you do like just one of the little bear, like what are they, 250 or could you do even baby aspirin or how much would you take?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, as much as your stomach agrees with.

**CONTEXT:** Really?

**RAY PEAT:** It could be two or three 500 milligram tablets per day.

**CONTEXT:** Really? That's a lot. But just so your tummy likes it, okay, so you eat it with food, you put them with food?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Because what does it do to the tummy?

**CONTEXT:** It can upset it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. It's only three or four percent of the people that have problems and most of them, if they took enough vitamin K, they wouldn't have the bleeding problems in their stomach.

**CONTEXT:** Vitamin K.

**RAY PEAT:** Mm-hmm.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, that's pretty interesting. Stay right there, Doc. We're going to do a couple of little breaks before we go. Dr. Ray Pete, well, that calls for a little plug for Daniel Vitalis' product. He has a vitamin D K2 thing. So if you want to get some vitamin D K2 thing, you can go to Daniel Vitalis' Surthrival website and get yourself a little K in there. Yeah, and vitamin D. And I like to get out in the sun. I think I think I have plenty, but every, you know, sometimes people want to even kind of, kind of check it out and test it and all that. But Sothrival's got the colostrum on sale and they have elk velvet antler and pine pollen and then the vitamin D, vitamin D3, K2 product. And it's all from very, very nice ingredients, just all kinds of really luscious stuff. No, you know, no camps, nothing like that. Just, just, just really cool.

So you might want to explore that on oneradionetwork.com. Here's our sauna.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the polyunsaturated fatty acids are the real villain. Looking at the functions of the pancreas itself, the beta cells that make insulin are constantly regenerating, and as soon as they regenerate, they are quickly killed by the oxidative damage done by the circulating fatty acids. The regeneration is supported by glucose, so if you keep your glucose up, you're going to have constantly regenerated beta cells in the pancreas, and the problem is how not to kill them with an excess of fatty acids. And if you look at a population like Israel, the first generation immigrants to Israel from North Africa were free of diabetes. But as soon as they adapted and became a fully adjusted and started eating the European diet, that was the common standard in Israel, that their diabetes level came right up to the European level. So it was the availability of vegetable oil, polyunsaturated oils, that made them adapt and become diabetic, where they had been completely free of diabetes. And animal experiments, if you make them, starve them for the so-called essential fatty acids until you can't detect a significant amount in their blood, then if you poison their pancreas and try to create diabetes, they are extremely resistant. All of these, both the internal mechanism, the individual's demonstrated resistance to becoming diabetic, and the population level, where a whole population adapts, all of these show that it's the polyunsaturated fats, not the carbohydrates, that cause the development of the so-called diabetes problem.

**CONTEXT:** So that's, we call them poofers, so that would be all oils like canola and wesson and, right, all these oils.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, corn oil, canola, soybean oil, they're all good diabetes manufacturers.

**CONTEXT:** And it would make sense, Dr. Pete, because, I mean, if you look in the foods, I'm sure it's, I would suspect they're all over fast foods, wouldn't they be? And fries and burgers and whatever, right? And then any processed food, I mean, it's hard to find even an organic one that doesn't want to put canola oil in it. I mean, they're everywhere, right? And it's the same with obesity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, population is. It is shifting towards an increasingly diabetesgenic, obesagenic diet with PUFA.

**CONTEXT:** So these things just weren't made to be put into oils. I mean, they just weren't, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, partly they are storing energy for the plants, but they are defensive substances. The plant doesn't want its seed to be consumed for food. They want the seed to produce a new generation of plants. And they produce a variety of toxins special in the seeds that block digestion. Cows or people eating the seeds don't profit from them very much because there are things like the polyunsaturated fats that block our ability to digest proteins. And so even though they contain proteins, they contain specific toxins that block animal proteolytic enzymes not affecting the plant's own enzymes. So it's obvious that they were evolved to damage animal digestion.

**CONTEXT:** So that's a problem with cows and eating, you know, corn-fed beef and that kind of stuff.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they eat grasses, the grass contains enough vitamin E that it is helping to destroy the great 97%, 98% of the PUFA is destroyed in a cow's healthy rumen in the presence of vitamin E. But if there isn't enough vitamin E that's in grass, then the PUFA in the grains goes right through into the milk.

**CONTEXT:** Well, I mean, because a lot of the meats are, they call it grain-fed and grass-finished or the opposite, right? Or grass-fed and grain-finished, so you got to be careful what they're doing, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Wow. So that's why our best shot is olive oil. Olive is a fruit, is it not? It's a fruit.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a fruit oil, and that means it's full of defensive things. The plant wants the fruit to be eaten without, the seed is very hard, and so it passes through the normal situation. You eat the fruit and discard the seed, so the seed is protected, but the fruit is protected a benefit to the animals, so the plant benefits by having its as seeds propagated by healthy animals.

**CONTEXT:** Hmm, hmm, interesting. This is from Mary. She said, I know you can't give medical advice and it's tough to do this on a show, but would you mind just giving me some input? She went to the doctor, everything was fine. The doctor said, my levels are great, but I have cold hands and feet and numb, and I'm also having a hard time getting pregnant. She's got a TSH of 2.5, a T3 of 3.5, and a T4 of 1.39. Could Dr. Pete give me some advice on what I can do from here? Her doctor says, everything's good.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it used to be recognized in the 1940s that thyroid hormone was the fertility hormone, the first basic fertility hormone, both for men and women, supported by progesterone, but the thyroid is the basic thing. And all of the signs of hypothyroidism, cold hands and feet are basic, infertility is just one of the standard hypothyroid signs. And I've known people who hadn't been able to get pregnant for 10 or 15 years within two or three weeks after correcting their thyroid problem and eating well, they were pregnant.

**CONTEXT:** So with these numbers, she could maybe experiment with a little bit of thyroid and see if she feels better? Do you think these numbers warrant her doing that?

**RAY PEAT:** I've never seen a person with even as high as 2.0 TSH who didn't have some serious symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, really? Wow.

**RAY PEAT:** If you look like doctors used to, but besides doing tests such as measuring their cholesterol, their keratin, their relaxation, recovery rate of a reflex, and their oxygen consumption, those were clear metabolic functional indicators of rate of metabolism, oxidative metabolism, and therefore thyroid function. They used to effectively diagnose by those indicators. And now the official policy statements of the medical boards are direct instructions to ignore all of those relevant things, go only by TSH.

**CONTEXT:** Just go by TSH, and you still like the lower the better, way down there, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they accept it all the way up to five or so. But when you look at the healthy population, people under the level of 0.4 on the TSH test, where the healthiest had no thyroid cancer, essentially, in that population.

**CONTEXT:** So you could just do a TSH and just forget all the other stuff, you know what you're saying, if you wanted, if you wanted to do a blood test?

**RAY PEAT:** The essential thing is to look at your temperature, your ability to metabolize calories, to eat 2,000 calories a day without gaining weight, and to have all of the normal energy functions that go with thyroid, and to ignore pretty much the blood tests, because you have to know a lot about the organism before you can interpret the blood tests.

**CONTEXT:** Right. And so, if I remember then, we want to be just anywhere above what 97, let's see, what is it, 97.7 to 98.6 in the morning?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, around plus or minus a few tenths around 98 in the morning, and up to 98.6 is good in the afternoon. And so, if you're below 98 in the morning, a little thyroid might juice you up a little bit.

**CONTEXT:** And you could start small too, right? Just start small?

**RAY PEAT:** Fourth of a grain or 15 milligrams of Armour Thyroid, for example, is a good starting point. And that amount used to be pretty close to the average consumed by people on the average diet throughout history. If you make chicken soup or fish soup, there was always a thyroid disintegrating in the soup, and so you were always getting some thyroid gland along with your meats.

**CONTEXT:** I love it. That's a great question. That's a good question. What do you... what do you... Doesn't the Bible talk about soul as the first breath or something in the first...?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's one of the meanings of it, is breath, psyche and so on. But the newsletter I'm working on right now is looking at all of the cells right from the beginning as containing soul. So yeah, it would be everywhere, right? Just everywhere. We're... yeah. Yeah, yeah, every bit would contain soul just as much as the whole. So that you can't sacrifice any part without being responsible for for knowing that it's an autonomous awareness. Yeah, so it's just... we're saturated. The whole body is saturated with who we are really and that's... that makes sense because if we worry or something, it's in our body, isn't it? I mean, it's in there.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, it's in there. So if we abort a fetus at a month that would... but then soul doesn't die. So I mean you are killing something, but you're not. I mean, you know what I mean?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the personality is constantly developing.

**CONTEXT:** Right. And the things we eat have personalities and you have to realize that like the Jain religion, their basic principle is harmlessness.

**RAY PEAT:** Right. But when you try to apply harmlessness, you see that you're constantly damaging awarenesses. Even plants have have sensations.

**CONTEXT:** Of course. Yes, of course. So everybody's killing something in a sense, even though nothing really dies because right, what has a beginning has an end, but God really has never had a beginning. Has it? He? She?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Is she it? Is she it?

**RAY PEAT:** Okay.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. Well, you're always fun to talk to Dr. P. Thanks so much for for visiting with us this morning. Dr. Ray Pete's, you can go Ray Pete's newsletter at gmail.com if you want to get on board with that. So that's the one you're working on now. That's when you were...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah, that's one.

**CONTEXT:** I'm looking forward to reading that guy. And well, you have a nice time up there in the northwest. Are you people just still like silly and and you know in the streets and whatever they do up there and

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah people are are starting to come out without their masks.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, are they?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** You're not going to get the vaccination or the jab, are you?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, no.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, I don't know.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay. I didn't think you were. I just wanted to because somebody emailed and wanted to know.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, it's Dr. Pete. Okay. All right, sir. Thanks a lot. We uh, we love you and Thanks for being here.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Bye. Bye.
