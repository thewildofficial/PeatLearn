**RAY PEAT:** Change in atmospheric pressure causes all sorts of symptoms. Usually it's increasing pressure that brings on the worst symptoms. The rising oxygen tension actually is harmful when the pressure is increasing with cold air. Cold, dry air is very heavy and so it increases the atmospheric pressure. The cold weather also, when you stay inside and run a heater, that raises the dryness, decreases the relative humidity when you raise the temperature. So if you have a cold wave of dry air coming in, and then you heat your house, you make super dry air with a high oxygen tension, and that causes lung injury. So your lungs are really susceptible to anything, anything of bacteria or fungus or virus, but simply any stress can make those irritated lung surfaces produce symptoms. Normally your lungs are the main detoxifying organ for things like circulating serotonin. If your intestine is irritated because you ate some strange food, they secrete serotonin into the blood and it's carried to the lungs to be detoxified. But if anything is happening in your lungs, even inflammation just from the dry air, extra oxygen pressure, then if your lungs fail to detoxify it, then you get all of these serotonin symptoms which can include increased coagulation in your blood. For example, it's known that lung disease, colds, influence anything that messes up your lungs, increases the risk of systemic coagulation and strokes even in young people. And some of the news stories in recent weeks have said that there is this horrible new quality of coronavirus. Young people are having strokes. It's not at all new. Colds, severe cold, increases the risk of a stroke.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Ray Peat, do you think it's possible if we have cold weather blowing through rain or chill or stress that we can create a situation where we think we have caught the flu or created a cold from a virus, but it was really an internal combustion from things like weather changes and stress and things?

**RAY PEAT:** Right. Just emotional stress. And then, so the body is producing these symptoms, why? To detox or to heal? That's the basic mechanism that when the body experiences a threat, it turns on the adrenal system, for example, the Hans Selye adaptive reaction system. And he explains that the high cortisol lets you have super adaptive properties for a while, but then if it continues too long, that high cortisol melts down your immune system, your thymus shrinks in a matter of hours of high cortisol. And so even emotional stress that keeps your cortisol elevated for a while is melting away your immune system. A young person with a big juicy thymus gland, if they have a severe accident, and live for maybe four or five hours, it's found that their thymus is gone.

**CONTEXT:** So, we can produce symptoms, fevers, fevers, all kinds of things with the lungs because of our outside influences that are not necessarily a virus or a bacteria that has come in from the outside and entered our being?

**RAY PEAT:** It's possible without without coming in contact with any virus. Not just possible. It's known. Known not just possible. It's known.

**CONTEXT:** And then if you would give a test to one of these persons either before or after and it showed positive. Does that mean anything?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that they're immune to that, supposedly. If you have antibodies to something, it means you've adapted to it successfully. The same with blood tests for classes of antibodies. They find that you have antibodies to potatoes or blueberries or whatever in your blood, they say, never eat potatoes or blueberries because you have antibodies to them but actually it means you've adapted to them and it's okay to eat them. So these PCR antibody tests that they give to just regular people that they want to test everybody and this is the meme, let's test everybody, are they of any value whatsoever?

**RAY PEAT:** Somewhat, it will tell you that. Something like 80 or 90 percent of the people that might have the actual virus sitting on some membrane isn't going to get sick. It shows you that the virus is harmless for the great majority of people. So the people testing positive, you're saying, could possibly be, they have an antiviral, they have an antibody. But not necessarily the COVID virus, because they don't even, right? The PCR test is to find the actual virus, which can be present in most people without causing either symptoms or antibodies, but possibly the antibodies will develop. But then the other tests are looking for antibodies, and some of the tests that have been used have not been able to discriminate between any old standard coronavirus and the new coronavirus.

**CONTEXT:** But so, in mid-February, when this thing kind of blew up, and all of a sudden they had this test, let's test people, there wasn't enough tests, but we're going to get more tests, there weren't enough tests, and people were testing positive, how would it be possible, logically, or from a virality, virology standpoint, that you could have a test that quickly that would be accurate to testing some virus, a new virus, named Corona, that hasn't been around until now.

**RAY PEAT:** To know the meaning of a test, you have to test the test. And they didn't do that. It takes a long time to know whether a test is going to tell you anything. And so, the test results, whether they're antibodies or PCR for the actual virus, you have to first establish what it means and they're just like a bunch of crazy chickens talking about numbers without having tested what the numbers mean.

**CONTEXT:** And how long, generally, Dr. P, would it take? To have one of these test trials to make it really very accurate, and what would be very accurate, 70% accuracy, 80%?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you have to test lots of healthy people, and some sick people too, and then compare the differences. See if there's more antibody or more virus in the sick people than in the healthy people. Develop the meaning of the test on the basis of actual results, conditions in the real world. But if you only test sick people and say a certain percentage have the virus or only test healthy people, if you concentrate on the population in general, like the study in Northern California. And then tell you, science can prove it in one at a time. Jay Bhattacharyya and his group were showing that the number of infected people was low and also the mortality per infection was very low. But still, they didn't test a big enough population to be certain of how many really are infected in that given area, but he said he was getting emails from colleagues saying things like, Jay, get with the program. And program means conforming to the opinion, the authoritative opinion. Don't investigate and stir things up.

**CONTEXT:** And if you really wanted to do according to virology, a test, in general, how long can you theorize, or the records show, how long of a time frame would it take before that test was, we have a good one here, we have something real that's valuable. How long?

**RAY PEAT:** I would guess at least six months. Six months. But meanwhile, the conditions are changing, and so In principle, it's very hard to do anything scientifically meaningful when you have a virus that changes radically in three or four or five months.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, if you don't distinguish very precisely to know that it's a certain mutant coronavirus, everyone is exposed to many different kinds of coronaviruses. And so when you're under stress, you might, your body might multiply and respond to some of the coronaviruses that are around you all the time, or other viruses or bacteria, or you might even have similar reactions without any any passage and being identifiable.

**CONTEXT:** And would it be fair to say that people who are afraid in fear of catching something, possibly dying, walking six feet apart with masks and everything, that they're under stress? Or they're...

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I'm sure that happens. There was a sociologist who wrote the book about 40 years ago looking at the death rate according to the unemployment numbers. And he saw that at that time, 40 years ago, the population was quite a bit smaller, but he saw an increase of 35,000 deaths per year for each point of increased unemployment. So a five-point increase in unemployment would be very, very big, bigger than influenza.

**CONTEXT:** So, what I hear you saying is there's a lot more stress other than just the fear of getting something out there, but we have the highest unemployment of unemployed people in this country ever in the history. So that's a whole financial, what am I going to do, stress, added on to it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you hear all sorts of media people saying we have to follow the science, but they don't want to talk about the science. Two very common phrases you hear. Medical experts say that means one thing, they want you to conform to conventional medical opinion. And medical opinion is regulated by the state, the state boards of medical licensing. If you don't conform too many times, you lose your license. And the other favorite saying is scientists believe. But the thing about science is that it's about testing and descent. And so if you say the descending researchers have been discredited because their opinion is not what medical experts say, then you're denying science itself. Science has to be descent driven.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in a typical month six or seven percent of all deaths are from respiratory disease like flu or pneumonia. And in the last report, they showed what looks like a doubling of respiratory disease associated with the diagnosis of coronavirus. But since respiratory diseases are around six or seven percent of total mortality, that month should have shown a big increase. Not necessarily doubling the 6%, but a definite blip on total mortality, but the CDC in their most recent report said total mortality in the U.S. is below average.

**CONTEXT:** Below average?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. I've been following the CDC's own reports, and not only is nothing happening, but there's a slight dip in total mortality this year, and the only way you can account for that huge spike in corona-diagnosed deaths is to see that it's made up for by a spike downward in deaths from cancer, heart disease, sepsis, and so on. That's how it feels. You diagnose someone that you would have put down for death by sepsis, heart disease, cancer, or other common things. If you decided you're not really sure what killed them, so let's say coronavirus killed them, then you have a perfectly normal total mortality, but an apparent spike caused by a virus.

**RAY PEAT:** And with all of the recognized ambiguity and absence of meaning for the definition and the tests, what you have is an epidemic of words. An epidemic of words.

**CONTEXT:** So you say that's what we're experiencing here?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't see any. Any other way?

**RAY PEAT:** No, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the old payment for being admitted with lung infection was around 13,000. But if it's diagnosed as COVID, that gets a 20 percent boost. So up to about 16,000 for diagnosing COVID lung disease, but the, if you put them on a ventilator, with ordinary lung disease, that goes up to 40, around 40,000, and a 20 percent boost takes that up to 48,000. So they're making, basically, 50, 48,000 dollars for putting someone on a ventilator until they die.

**CONTEXT:** 48,000 dollars received from the hospitals when they put somebody on a ventilator.

**RAY PEAT:** Received from both Medicare and the extra bonus from the CARES Act, the Free Money Act.

**CONTEXT:** How good? Dr. Ray Petersworth is fascinating. What do you know about the dangers of this ventilator? We've read quite a few reports. Have you seen some credible information that you can share?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Luciano Gattinoni, an Italian lung specialist working in Germany, has been advocating a more physiological, less dogmatic approach to treating all kinds of pneumonia-like or influenza-like lung infections. And he says in one hospital in Germany, and he didn't want to name either of the hospitals, but one good hospital was having a 60% mortality in their intensive care, and a nearby hospital that was abandoning the standard protocol of intubation had a 0% mortality following his more reasonable and physiological, non-invasive way of ventilating them.

**CONTEXT:** Wow. Interesting. And if you look at the average figures for mortality, some of the studies show an 88% at 60% wasn't an outstandingly bad hospital.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there's no way to simply state the scientific issue because they're has been no actual science involved in a first along the media are denying simple on the record published facts going back 3040 or more years, attempting to make flu vaccines. And they claim the current CDC claim for effectiveness of a flu. Last year's flu vaccine was 45% effective. But if you look at their results are talking about, it's very weird ways of arguing. They don't simply look at at a vaccinated population and then unvaccinated population. Because there have been about a dozen studies that have considered the whole health of vaccinated population versus an unvaccinated population and those have found the people who were vaccinated the next season developed several times as many lung infections from coronaviruses as the unvaccinated and that has caused sort of a panic in various authoritative sources and fact checkers and so on but you can look up those studies that the people getting flu vaccines the following year had one study I saw was 4.4 times as many lung diseases caused by coronaviruses and a couple other viruses.

**CONTEXT:** So you're making the argument that a potential for corona vaccines soon to come could be unnecessary and just dangerous....dangerous.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And would it be dangerous because of the adjuvants, maybe the mercury or aluminum and other things in there, or the actual substance that they'd be squirting into people, some kind of a virus, small...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and if you look at the whole population, the availability of flu vaccines has gone from around 10 million doses per year. Two years ago, it had a historic high of around 70 million vaccines. And then last year, again, a huge surge of, I think it was 169 million people vaccinated in the U.S. And you would think, if it was 45 percent effective, that this year and last year you would have had a very healthy population. But no, the curve of influenza, lung disease, pneumonia deaths has been very, pretty steady over the last. 10, 10, 15 years, if anything, a rising curve somewhat following the number of vaccines. So the whole population absolutely doesn't show it a 45% benefit of being vaccinated. So the scientific proof to show that these flu vaccines are unnecessary and ineffective, but also in many cases are causing. More problems the following year.

**CONTEXT:** From different viruses, yeah.

**RAY PEAT:** From different viruses, and where are these viruses coming from?

**CONTEXT:** Oh, just In the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the body, in the environment. There are just millions of viruses around. They're just everywhere. Yeah, and you can look at the published papers in Nature and Science and the standard virus journals going back they actually start with germ warfare research, and no one wants to talk about that. For a while they were saying that the Chinese had a leak of germ warfare viruses, but then that was knocked down. They don't want to talk about it at all. The Fort Detrick and several other labs in the U.S. were created solely for the purpose of germ warfare in the 1940s. Many of our leading medical people were working in German chemical warfare. They were the authors of the world's most used medical textbook of physiology, Arthur C. Guyton, was a specialist in aerosolizing germs, bacteria, and viruses. And some of those are known to have been tested on American populations. And one of the viruses he was aerosolizing was polio. And he became paralyzed by careless lab work and so went to Mississippi and became a medical professor and made up out of his head this awful book that became the standard most used medical textbook in the world. Because of his origin and authority coming from government association. And Nixon, in 1969, in response to world pressure, ordered the abolition of the germ warfare program and the destruction of all supplies. And what happened? It was suddenly the viruses were being made more potent, more virulent as weapons. Suddenly they discovered that there might be someone violating the international rules and making these weapons, and so they kept producing them. They were ordered to stop making weapons, so they said, Now... these weaponisable viruses have to be made so we can make a vaccine against them. That started right in 1969 when Nixon cancelled the war program. And ever since then, they have been designing more and more virulent viruses, and the coronavirus was pretty much their favorite. They did anthrax and Ebola, a lot of other potential weapons, but always with the excuse that we're designing defensive vaccines against these potential weapons. But continuing exactly the gain-of-function type of research, making a vaccine that would Chimera mixes of different types of virus to escape known immune defenses, but in all of these 40 years of explicitly designing horrible disease-causing viruses so they could make vaccines, they have never. Succeeded in making a vaccine that worked against them. Never succeeded in making a vaccine that worked against them.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, so why would we expect to have one suddenly, historically unique event by next fall? Next fall.

**RAY PEAT:** Why indeed? Why indeed?

**RAY PEAT:** It somewhat advanced the idea, but I think the real motor for it was Paul Ehrlich and his specific drugs that were designed, silver bullets, the concept of a silver bullet chemical. It blended in with the idea of antibodies that were the body's silver bullets and that created, right from Ehrlich's time, the drug companies naturally were pushing their silver bullet chemicals. Ideologically blended in with the idea that antibodies were silver bullets and so the study of the immune system focused all during the last century on the idea that antibodies were the secret to immunity. There were, I guess, about four. Nobel Prizes between 1960 and 2000 given for good work on the protein structure of antibodies, but it was misleading because the immune system was being misunderstood because of the emphasis on that particular protein, where really there are... a thousand other more important things than antibodies. And the antibody specificity can go either way. It can make a problem worse by intensifying inflammation, as well as take down a potential toxin.

**CONTEXT:** And who was Paul Ehrlich?

**RAY PEAT:** Paul Ehrlich? He shared the Nobel Prize of... I think it was in 1908 with Metzhnikov who was an embryologist who emphasized the cell phagocyte part of the immune system rather than the chemical specific silver bullet part and the embryology part of the cell....based picture of the immune system was ridiculed by the chemical cartels all through the 20th century and two people started, mostly two people, started proposing a radical alternative for interpreting the immune system that went back to......Mechnikov's recognition that cells and embryological development, the very structure of our being, were part of the immune system. Our whole being is involved in immunity and resistance, all the way from energy. The oxidative energy of each cell leading to changes in function at all levels. You can't say there's any one thing that is our immune system. So the idea of the immune system has been changing in a kind of underground way. Polly Matzinger works at the NIH now and she has been changing some of the terms that are now in the mainstream as danger recognition. One English doctor, Jamie Cunliffe, calls it ______. A damage recognition system rather than danger of polymapsing is a little closer to the Ehrlich antibody shelter bullet by saying that we have a system to recognize danger. But I think Cunliffe is closer to the Metrenkoff. Interpretation that our whole being is involved and when we sense damage to our intrinsic nature, that's what we're reacting to and what they call the immune system. He calls it the disorder repair system, something like that.

**CONTEXT:** So, is the entire vaccine phenomena, I went back all the way to polio and all that, based on antibodies, and it's still today, even measles, mumps, all these things, based on the antibody idea, which is just a very small part of the immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. So, it's a very small part of the immune system, and it's a very small part of the immune system, and it's a very small part of the immune system, and it's a very small part of the immune system.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, the official story isn't even believed by the insiders.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they don't even believe it. In December, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization was on international television telling the public that vaccines have been studied scientifically and they are perfectly safe. And then just five days later... someone leaked a video from the Global Summit Meeting on Vaccine Safety. And in that meeting, she was saying that the public is less and less trusting of what we say because of our obfuscation when they ask about the deaths caused by vaccines. So, one of the main concerns was that doctors were stopping their belief in vaccines and they weren't vaccinating their children, their own family. And she said, that's a real menace if our front line becomes......skeptical.

**CONTEXT:** So, people like Del Bigtree and Robert Kennedy Jr. conjecture that there's never been a real, authentic, viable test proving that vaccines are safe and effective. Is that true?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, absolutely true. The Congress ordered... NIH, or Health and Human Services, to report back to Congress every two years at least on studies of safety because Congress had given absolute immunity to the drug companies to produce vaccines without being sued for the damages. And since there is no financial motive to make them do safety studies, they ordered HHS to do the studies and report every two years. And the Big Tree Kennedy lawsuit, when they wouldn't deliver under freedom of information, they wouldn't deliver. So that was where they changed their mind. The documents, finally, when they were sued, they said no such documents can be found. They simply ignored Congress for 30 years, refusing to do studies because they knew that it was impossible to prove the safety. The tests, all of the data, showed that......certain vaccines are less harmful than others, but some of them are just terribly dangerous. They know, they see the figures, and there's a government agency that, under pressure, will acknowledge maybe about 1% of the actual injured patients. We'll get compensation from the government for the deaths and paralysis, but the definition that makes it possible to get compensation is that the death or paralysis or whatever has to be recognized and diagnosed within a time limit, five days. Fifteen days, so if you die on the sixteenth day, you can't be compensated, and despite all of that, they have paid out four billion dollars to injured patients, but it would be maybe a hundred times greater if they didn't have those time limits. And the government lists the injuries that they are bound to compensate for, and that list of injuries that they are compensating with fairly paltry amounts of money coincides with the package insert label. The list of side effects published by the pharmaceutical companies matches the conditions that the government is paying for. So if the doctor for the vaccine, if the patient knew that death and paralysis and brain damage and dementia, et cetera, were known. recognized side effects. How many people would let their kids be vaccinated?

**CONTEXT:** Fascinating. So there is, I wonder, wasn't that in 1986? Was that the immunity law during Reagan or 86?

**RAY PEAT:** That was when the immunity was given to the drug industry.

**RAY PEAT:** With desiccated thyroid, it really doesn't make very much difference because it has no hormone action until it's been digested and so if you eat it with food, it's going to slowly release the hormone all during the passage of that food through your small intestine. Ideally, twice a day theoretically could be better, but in practice once a day is fine with desiccated thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** So is that still, folks are going to do some of the piggy thyroid, that's still the best to get a desiccated thyroid where you have the T3, T4 and all that right in there?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. It has a lot of other things that are plausible benefits. American brands, when armor companies sold their product name, the new companies started removing components such as thyracalcitonin to sell separately. That was always part of the traditional thyroid, and so the stuff from Thailand is more likely to be these. The full natural material coming out of the animal, and so it could be more beneficial than a selected purified material, but even the synthetics that imitate that balance of T4 and T3, those are almost always completely therapeutic.

**CONTEXT:** Is there a way to use either one of the Thailand or the synthetic to work with your thyroid to get it happy again so you can get off of them, or...?

**RAY PEAT:** The traditional method that developed over several decades of practical use was to start with about 30 milligrams for a month, watching. For its effects, and Broder Barnes found that the temperature when you wake up is a good way to watch the daily progression of a given dose. And then after maybe six or eight weeks, if the symptoms weren't gone, he would double the dose. And over a period of five or six months, usually he would settle in for most people around 120 milligrams or two grains.

**CONTEXT:** But once you're on there, are you there forever?

**RAY PEAT:** No, in fact, I tested on myself after reading experiments on rats and I found that my requirement in winter months was about two grains a day. But in the spring I became slightly hyperthyroid on that dose and found that my summer dose was around half a grain.

**CONTEXT:** Half a grain is 30 milligrams, right? So when you say symptoms, were you going by your temperature or you could just feel as a general observation, you get a little just antsy with too much?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I went mostly by my pulse rate. If I didn't drop the dose in the spring, I would start getting out of breath, just getting up to answer the telephone, which is a sign of hyperthyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** The liver, the reason a woman cycles two weeks on and two weeks off is partly that the liver is designed so that it maintains homeostasis, meaning that when something rises above average it increases its excretory enzymes. The signals keep increasing so your progesterone production rises steadily until the last week of pregnancy and the liver never gets ahead to lower this huge production of progesterone, always keeps your serum level ahead of your liver. But if you're not pregnant and keep taking without the interruption, then your liver starts becoming so efficient that after two or three months, you can hardly feel the effect of the same dose of progesterone. So just to keep for economy, so that you're sensitive to moderate doses, it's good to lay off for a week or two every month.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the factors that creates stiffness and the specific loss of structural elasticity, but combined with stiffness, so basically it's a brittle, brittleizing effect of stress. The system that drives that is mainly, it involves estrogen and cortisol, the central factor....is the renin-anchotensin-aldosterone system. Aldosterone is the opposing hormone to progesterone. And the natural level of progesterone is one of the things that keeps your tissue firm, proper bulk, and elastic. So simply the absence of progesterone or excessive estrogen will turn on this endotensin-aldosterone system and tend to weaken tissue so that you are more susceptible to aneurysms, bulging arteries, varicose veins, general weakening of... tissues become easier to break from a scuff. You can get more serious injury from light percussion and such. The strengthening part is partly opposing those... keeping them down and the things that most strongly keep down your aldosterone system are vitamin D, zinc, all of the growth protein anabolic things such as vitamin A. The balance of calcium and phosphate, calcium works with vitamin D to hold down your aldosterone which is a major bridalizing hormone.

**CONTEXT:** So is there any foods that keep the progesterone level nice and the aldosterone down? Dietary wise?

**RAY PEAT:** Eggs and zinc and milk.

**CONTEXT:** Eggs and zinc and milk, huh.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for example, stretch marks. I had a young cousin who was about six months pregnant, and she showed me her belly had these like purple lightning streak patterns. Half an inch wide and brilliant color with a zigzag shiny pattern and it was just the most vivid stretch marks I'd ever seen and I suggested eggs, milk, and oysters which she ate for two or three days. I think it was just about three days later she came back and showed me her belly, no marks at all. Isn't that interesting? It was just amazing how they had, her belly was meanwhile getting bigger but the stretch marks had absolutely disappeared.

**CONTEXT:** Fascinating. Hasn't oysters also been touted to help men keep testosterone levels up?

**RAY PEAT:** Oysters? Oh, oh sure. That's part of keeping cortisol and aldosterone down.

**CONTEXT:** I see. Oh, it tamps them down so the T levels can stay good.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there have been a lot of publications on that warning against the aspirin. I think the conclusion is, yeah, they're perfectly compatible.

**CONTEXT:** And why would we want to take aspirin? Is it okay? For example, for the coronavirus, those happen to be both confirmed effective protections against the symptoms of the corona infection.

**RAY PEAT:** Can you go to aspirin? Can you? Can you actually get just pure aspirin these days, or they all have extracurricular activities in them? No, the cheap kind is generally the best. It's called aspirin USP. And it doesn't matter whether it's sold by a veterinary supply store. It's about $15 per pound. A pound.

**RAY PEAT:** A lot of studies found that there are steroids analogous to, but not exactly the same as testosterone and pregnenolone, the stabilizing steroids that protect against cortisol. But I think it's safer to use pregnenolone if you can find a safe and purer form.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, more emails here. Got lots of them. Let's see. Patrick Timpone along with Dr. Ray Peet. Sorry, my little mouse is not cooperating. Oh, here you go. Okay. What does it mean from Stefan, what does it mean when a woman bleeds during ovulation? Is it a progesterone issue?

**RAY PEAT:** To some extent, yeah, the surge of estrogen, its effect is to break down the lining of the uterus, and that's opposed by progesterone. So, usually the people who have what they call breakthrough bleeding, it can come anytime, for example, after a woman gets pregnant, if she was having those ovulation bleeds, she's likely to have a monthly loss of blood, even into the fifth month of pregnancy. And that goes with all of the signs of progesterone deficiency, a risk, increased risk of... preeclampsia or premature birth or all kinds of complications of pregnancy resulting from the bad balance of progesterone and estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** One of your specialties, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Been studying that a long time.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think the so-called ketogenic diet is always stressful. Diabetes itself tends to turn on the stress ketogenic. The body senses a lack of glucose in diabetes and that turns on stress metabolism and lactic acid tends to rise showing that glucose is actually being used although the body feels it. is deficient in glucose so it starts turning muscles to glucose and that happens in the ketogenic diet. The cortisol increases when glucose is low and the cortisol converts muscle to glucose at the same time that you're drawing fats out of storage or eating fats. Still the fact that your diet is ketogenic means that your cortisol is bound to be having too much influence and that is one of the things that shrinks your thymus and other parts of your so called immune system.

**RAY PEAT:** The quantity of a hormone that is powerfully active in rat experiments and in experiments I did on myself with the rats, they gave I think it was 10 grams of Pregnenolone in a single dose, enough to stretch its stomach so it couldn't eat anything for hours. But they didn't see any hormonal effects in most of the rats, but if the rat was stressed and having high glucocorticoid before the pregnant own, they were normalized. So the only change was beneficial stopping of the stress reaction. And I found that four... a thousand milligrams a day didn't have any harmful effect, simply felt about the same as a hundred milligrams a day.

**RAY PEAT:** As in the rant, its effect when you have a slight excess of, of, of, of pregnancy is to lower your... cortisol to normal. And elevated cortisol is one of the things that increases estrogen. And so when you're blocking the stress reaction with an abundance of pregnenolone, you're turning off the, the need for these other stress hormones and where the body will make... a human body will make on the order of 30 to 50 milligrams a day of pregnenolone and progesterone and 5 milligrams of testosterone and probably around 50 milligrams of DHEA. The daily dose produced in the body of estrogen is on the order of... of a small fraction of a microgram, one microgram per day as an effective estrogenic dose. So the quantity of these precursor hormones, if they're adequate, they tend to turn off these microscopic downstream. Hormones. So you will never have an increased conversion to estrogen or cortisol from an excess of pregnenolone or progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** The thyroid is most often the problem hormone in causing pregnancy problems. So you want to check your temperature and pulse rate and maybe have a blood test to make sure that your TSH level isn't elevated. The TSH itself is really a sign of some problems, so the higher it is, the less likely you are to have a successful pregnancy. There have been several publications that are showing a direct link between increased TSH even within the so-called normal range and pregnancy problems. And part of keeping that normal is to have adequate protein every day, not too much phosphate meat and beans and nuts happen to be extremely high in phosphate relative to calcium, and the high phosphate turns on your parathyroid hormone and the aldosterone, so it's bad for all of your tissues. And this increases cancer risk and so on. Calcium should be high relative to the phosphate, and vitamin D and calcium work together. Adequate vitamin A works with the thyroid hormone to have an anabolic effect on your protein and tissues, the thymus gland among others, keeping your muscles healthy. Well-developed as part of keeping your endocrine system in balance.

**CONTEXT:** So, one enough protein, but the meat, beans and what else?

**RAY PEAT:** Meat, beans and fish. Fish have a high phosphate, which is a little counterintuitive there.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, the phosphate, it just happens that those are very low. In calcium content and the foods that are highest have the best ratio of calcium to phosphate are cheese, milk, and for an extreme high calcium ratio, well-cooked greens are the richest in calcium and magnesium relative to phosphate. So when the phosphate gets too high with the beans, fish, and meat, that's a problem for almost everybody, right? If you have too much of those.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Americans in general. But when you look at the figures, the higher the phosphate is, when it gets to be five, six, or seven times as high as the calcium, that leads to long-term problems like osteoporosis and inflammatory diseases.

**CONTEXT:** On the TSHU, you had mentioned the normal levels. We can't go by those, but so what would be a good TSH level after all these years of talking about thyroid that would say, well, everything's pretty good there with the thyroid. What level would that be?

**RAY PEAT:** When people have done large-scale surveys and looked at the incidence of thyroid cancer over the years, they have found that if your TSH is below 0.4, there's no thyroid cancer.

**CONTEXT:** 0.4? Well, that's a low one, man.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. That's really way down there.

**CONTEXT:** So would you keep taking, if you wanted to test, just to be real geeky about it, Dr. Pete, would you keep testing if you're taking some kind of a piggy thyroid, desiccated, to get down that low?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it would be worthwhile. I go entirely by my pulse and temperature, but when I see people's results, if their TSH is as high as even 1.0, they always have some hormone-related problem. And 2.0 is where everyone I see with 2.0, even they have... fairly significant hormone problems by the time they're in their 30s.

**CONTEXT:** My goodness. Stefan wants to know, would there be any benefits to introducing a sourdough starter to the dough for making flour tortillas?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh... Yeah, I don't know how a sourdough flour tortilla would turn out. I don't know what it might be. You lose gluten with the starter, and so I think it might be hard to make something resembling a tortilla, but anyway, flour tortillas are essentially unleavened wheat. And studies have shown, for example, in Egypt, they have seen... dwarfism associated with people eating a lot of unleavened wheat bread.

**CONTEXT:** I got some of that... I got some of that nixtamize, you know, the one we... you talked about from that company, the grits, right? The corn grits. And is there any protein in corn?

**RAY PEAT:** A little, yeah. Not too much. Not very much.

**CONTEXT:** But is it pretty good food in general?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, as long as they get some protein and other nutrients. You can't live on tortillas and beans healthfully, but people who eat mixed-malized tortillas as a regular part of their diet. They usually are very healthy if they have mixed other foods with it, partly because of the high calcium content. High calcium. So they are milk, cheese, greens. How about eggs? Not very good. They're somewhat excessive for phosphate. But of course, the protein and seafood, you're getting the trace minerals. So it's good to have seafood once a week and eggs every day and the nixtamalized corn is another source of calcium in the diet.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it should still be lower but that's a tremendous improvement. I would guess that having a chronic TSH as high as 9.0 would be a major factor in what was diagnosed as MS. One of the things that you almost always see with a good thyroid correction is the muscle cramps. The first few days while you're adjusting, you need to make sure your diet is very high in calcium and magnesium. So a lot of milk while you're adapting to increasing thyroid dose will prevent muscle cramps. Basically, thyroid is one of the nerve muscle protecting hormones, absolutely essential.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, each of them is known to be biologically harmful and our whole system is part of our resistance and immunity. And so if you do anything crazy like sit in an electromagnetic field of any measurable intensity, even running an electric sewing machine for 20 years, they found a tremendous increase in dementia.

**CONTEXT:** Really? Associated with just that moderate field, but the fields from these communication devices can be many times more intense.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, very challenging. So anything with a motor, really, we get some magnetic fields, don't we?

**CONTEXT:** Anything with a motor.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah.

**RAY PEAT:** The gland is about as big as a human gland in proportion, maybe an ounce or so, and the measuring in grains or grams, the standard pill was based on the fresh gland because for the first 10 or 20 years they prescribed the uncooked. A gland would give usually 4 grains or 250 milligrams roughly as a replacement dose. And so when they started making dehydrated tablets, they added usually lactose to extend... the powdered gland, which they call 3X as a pure powder, and then they would dilute it, increasing the weight by threefold, so that 1X was the potency of the finished pill, which was equivalent in weight to the natural wet thyroid tissue. And so if you think of a 30 gram gland, each gram contains about 15 grains, so you can get 120 doses of more or less replacement dose from a single gland.

**CONTEXT:** Do you think when people ate more of a natural, I guess on the farm and stuff, or chickens, that we used to get some kind of a... Thyroid in there, didn't we, with the chickens, chicken neck?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah. I used to find, even at the Safeway supermarket, a pound of chicken necks. Two or three of them, they would have left the gland, thyroid gland, under the skin. Even though it was illegal, starting in the 1940s, the government required that it be removed and sold to the drug companies. On the farm, they would almost never bother removing the gland, so it goes in the soup or fried chicken. A guy I knew who worked on a farm said on Fridays that was their fried chicken day, and he always asked for the necks and would eat four or five necks for lunch. And he said he'd always noticed that on Friday afternoons he was constantly overheated and sweating because he was eating like 15 grains of thyroid for lunch.

**CONTEXT:** Isn't that interesting? Wow. Yeah, you would think if you ate a live thyroid that you'd feel that, wouldn't you? I mean, if you just ate a whole one or something like that.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and... They aren't as toxic as the government warned. If that guy was, on average, if half of the neck still had the gland in it, each one might weigh one gram, that would be 30 grains for lunch. And a friend of mine had her thyroid powder in a plastic bag. And her cat, she had about 30 grains of thyroid in the bag. And her cat found it and tore the bag open and ate it all. Really? And she said he was sitting there with a very fast heartbeat, smiling. Smiling.

**RAY PEAT:** If it's standard, tangy, somewhat sour yogurt, that amount of lactic acid in a big cup full is enough to cause the liver reaction, the liver turns it back to glucose. Energetically expensive to turn lactic acid into glucose and someone who is slightly hypothyroid can notice the depressed energy or even a headache brought on by as little as a cup of yogurt.

**CONTEXT:** Do you know anything about Mabendazol or parasites? The doctor just wants to know if you think it's relatively safe.

**RAY PEAT:** If you're sure you have a dangerous parasite, yeah, it's better than the parasite. But if you are not certain there's a parasite, its toxicity is enough. It isn't something to take diagnostically.

**CONTEXT:** Because he says he has bruxism, a severely grounding of my teeth. Is that one symptom of parasites?

**RAY PEAT:** That goes with sometimes anything irritating the intestine, but often it's your green salad that you ate at lunch is a more common cause of intestinal irritation during the night because that releases serotonin into the system. High serotonin is strongly associated with bruxism.

**CONTEXT:** High serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** So you might try something like ciproheptadine to see what effect that is at bedtime.

**CONTEXT:** What's ciproheptadine? What is that?

**RAY PEAT:** It's an antihistamine, antiserotonin, old-fashioned antihistamine with the antiserotonin function.

**CONTEXT:** Is that a pharmaceutical med?

**RAY PEAT:** It's a... prescription drug, I think, but a lot of doctors are willing to prescribe it.

**RAY PEAT:** The cellulose in uncooked vegetables especially is indigestible and so that carries the food far down your intestine. Bacteria can get at it, and the bacteria live on cellulose-rich foods and produce toxins. And the irritation of the chemicals from the food and the bacteria and their toxins cause the intestine to pour out a flood of histamine and serotonin, and it's known that bruxism is. Very closely connected with high serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** Do you think one has the same challenges with like sunflower sprouts or radish sprouts? If they're cooked, or if you grind up alfalfa sprouts while they're raw, there's a surge of cyanide release, so you don't want to eat a mass of raw. A cyanide, or a raw sprouts of alfalfa. How about sunflower, radish sprouts?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think those are safer except for the anti-thyroid effect.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, they kind of can tamper down the thyroid, huh?

**RAY PEAT:** The radish sprouts in particular.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, well that's right, yeah. Well, Dr. Pete, we're out of time, and... If we didn't get your email, we'll just put it in our file here, and we'll get you next time around. So no telling where this whole corona thing will be. Hmm, what, 30 days from now, lots of talk about a second wave. Do you have any theories on that?

**RAY PEAT:** I have the same issue of the word epidemic, if they're putting that down. Sepsis, heart disease and cancer as coronavirus deaths, then you have to look at the state of the language at the moment.
