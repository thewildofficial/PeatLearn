**RAY PEAT:** The information from the Japanese study of the movement of the vaccine in the body... showing that the vaccine material travels into the general circulation and is concentrated in various organs. The ovaries, the bone marrow, the heart, the brain, and the spleen. And that totally changes the nature of the treatment. The messenger RNA particle encased in a lipid coat actually travels through the circulation, and so it is implanting the RNA message to make the spike protein into our bone marrow cells, for example, and the ovaries. And information in the bone marrow cells is going to be lifelong. The bone marrow is turning over constantly, making new cells, replicating the RNA. The ovary concentration means that it's going to be a long, long, long, long, long, long is going to be a risk for the next generation. But if you think about what chronic spike protein irritation or inflammation is going to mean for the bone marrow, if these cells are expressing it and the cells are reproducing themselves, chronic inflammation of the bone marrow is well known to lead over a period of several months or even several years, maybe 10 years later, it will greatly increase the risk of leukemia and lymphoma. So the biology of it is very clearly known. The regulatory agencies had this information, lied about the meaning of what was getting into the general circulation.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, have you come across new information on the whole COVID phenomenon or the injections that you feel is important to talk about?

**RAY PEAT:** The medical head of Moderna, he recently resigned, but four or five years ago, he was talking about genetic engineering as... He was an oncologist promoting changing our genes as the future of medicine, and he went from genetic engineering of cancer treatments straight over to genetic engineering of vaccine against viral diseases, referring to it as changing our operating system, while talking about the RNA virus, which does have the potential to be copied into our DNA genome. But anyway, he was referring to changing our operating system by giving us the RNA vaccine. So, the mental framework demonstrably, at least some of the people involved, was intending to change our heredity, our nucleic acid operating system.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain how critical this is in this whole matter?

**RAY PEAT:** Cancer is not, it doesn't work like that. Cancer is there for a reason. The body is making cancer cells, right? It's not a genetic thing. It's the whole of the genetics. Dogma, going back a hundred years, has been running along a mechanistic ideology, which is the idea, first they were saying, we operate like a telephone switchboard, but as soon as they started operating on a computer ideology that information is what controls everything. The dogma of genetic, the DNA as a system of information, turned the organism into an information system, which it is not. That's an abstraction to justify mechanistic approaches to medicine.
**CONTEXT:** You're talking about the genetic dogma and how it's been applied to cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** The organism is the system which controls the DNA. They are pretending the DNA is what controls the organism. Absolutely backwards.
**CONTEXT:** So you can manipulate or stop or change the genes or whatever, right?

**RAY PEAT:** The so-called revolution in linguistics was financed by the Pentagon to treat language as something that can be totally defined by a computer. But at the very heart of it, it was obvious, right from 1960 at least, that the revolution in linguistics was based on phony claims, that a code generates language. But the code exists in the forms of rules, and to generate a sentence, you already have to know the sentence that you want to generate. The person can account for the language that they have produced by choosing the right rule at the right time to show that it can be described by rules. But that's totally interfering, ignoring the mechanism by which we created the sentence that is to be explained, and that whole backwards approach, saying that the code controls the organism rather than the organism bypassing the code entirely, and only theoretically making use of the code.
**CONTEXT:** You're talking about the connection between language and genetics.

**RAY PEAT:** Freud in the 1930s, I think it was just before he died, said that a person isn't conscious if they don't have the words for it. And very recently, Noam Chomsky in an interview said that you're only conscious through words and language. And he referred to his dogs, spelled out D-O-G, said that dogs aren't conscious because they don't have language. But in the presence of the dogs, he had to spell the word because he said that if they heard the word dog, they would get excited and think that they were going to get taken for a walk or something. But right in saying that dogs don't have... language, he made it obvious that if he said the word, the dogs would understand the situation by interpreting the word.
**CONTEXT:** You're talking about consciousness and language.

**RAY PEAT:** It doesn't even make medical sense to think that just because you put an injection in the muscle that it stays there, does it? I mean, it's not even logical. Not even logical. Absolute. It's a crazy dogma. They define whatever they want to do as science, even if it's nonsensical, such as saying what you put in your arm and get to your brain. For decades it's been demonstrated, for example, if you put polio or influenza injection containing, for example, aluminum particles into your arm or your hip muscle that those particles travel over a period of just a day or two travel up the nerve axon, retrograde axonal transport it's called. That's been demonstrated over and over 20, 30, 40 years ago that these particles reach your brain. You can demonstrate. About two days after the injection, the particles are in your brain, affecting your brain behavior. So it's absolute fabricated, false science to claim that a vaccine isn't able to get into your bloodstream if it gets into your brain directly by the nerves. How much easier? It's going to be if you're getting into your lymphatic fluids, the lymphatic fluids end up into your bloodstream. There's no way to think clearly that would say that it doesn't travel systemically.
**CONTEXT:** But it doesn't even make medical sense to think that just because you put an injection in the muscle that it stays there, does it?

**RAY PEAT:** I believe my long-term study of ayurvedic medicine, I think they talk about bone marrow. Not only blood cells, but white blood cells and replacement regeneration cells. For example, when they killed the oocytes in ovaries, it happens in any tissue that's injured. But they showed that... bone marrow cells very quickly began replacing even the oocytes in the ovaries after they'd been destroyed. Any tissue that's injured can send out SOS messages, at least partly in the form of particles in the ovaries. called exosomes, or extracellular vesicles, particles about the size of a virus that travel to the bone marrow, transmit the information of injury to a particular kind of tissue and organ, and the bone marrow manufactures replacement cells aimed at targeted targeted to the insert tissue for replacement and repair and regeneration.
**CONTEXT:** And you're saying that's where the blood is formed, also out of the bone marrow?

**RAY PEAT:** The great mass of our nuclear DNA. It's only something like 3% that we use to make the proteins that form our body. So more than half of our genetic information is something other than what we are right now using. For several decades now, it has been increasingly likely that organisms of all sorts are using shared DNA transmitted between individuals. It's very clear that bacteria do that if they are exposed. To a deadly situation, either starvation or toxins, the bacteria can create a DNA particle transmitting what they have achieved in resistance, a survival packet which they transmit directly through a little tube to other bacteria, not only of their own species, but even to different species of bacteria. They deliberately are transmitting useful DNA. If bacteria can do it, it seems very silly to assume that people and animals and plants can't do something similar, to share DNA for useful purposes, which, since most of our DNA is not used for making art. Our functional body proteins, it doesn't say that it doesn't have use.
**CONTEXT:** So you think these exosomes could be, as some are arguing, that are actually helping us to evolve more in a healthful thing by passing on information to each other?

**RAY PEAT:** It's a matter of biological energy. If the organism is well energized, oxidizing properly, it would be, even the degenerative inflammatory autoimmune....conditions. All of those are relieved when you intensify mitochondrial oxidation. You reduce the random harmful toxic lipid for oxidation, which is......competing pathway, in effect, for the oxygen availability and diversity. When you lose the ability to oxidize intensively, you leave the oxygen available in a toxic form that gets consumed by causing lipid for oxidation. The more intense your own mitochondrial oxidation is, the less... susceptible you are to toxic lipid degenerative peroxidation.
**CONTEXT:** So it's almost, in a sense, it could be a survival of the fittest kind of thing as well going on, in a way?

**RAY PEAT:** The mechanical thinking that the gene is simply going to be expressed is just wrong. All of the genes, even when they're mutant genes, they aren't. express in babies and teenagers, for example, it's a failure of energy that accounts for most of these so-called monogenic inherited problems.
**CONTEXT:** So these different gene snips that show up on these tests that get people kind of upset are...

**RAY PEAT:** It's a waste of money. It's a waste of time and money, really, isn't it? Because these things change all the time. Yeah, it's a propaganda. Procedure as well as an improper money-making business. It gives people very misleading ideas about their being and health.
**CONTEXT:** So you're saying that these genetic tests are a waste of time and money?

**RAY PEAT:** Everyone should be doing the healthful things. There are commonalities just now being recognized in COVID, which for generations have been known to be involved in cancer and aging, mental problems, heart disease. The interaction of iron overload over concentration of polyunsaturated fats in the tissues, not enough oxidative metabolism, those interact in all of the infectious, hereditary. or degenerative conditions. And all of those can be affected by managing how you metabolize iron, how you choose your fats, how much calcium and vitamin G you get to reduce the excitation and fatigue of tissues. All of these promote... good oxidation and protect against the killing random lipid peroxidation, tissue calcification, and so on.
**CONTEXT:** So, over the years when doctors go through this whole thing and ask you about family history of heart disease and all that stuff, it doesn't matter, does it?

**RAY PEAT:** The fact that the particles concentrate in the ovaries and the bone marrow and the brain and the circulatory system. That means that you have to be watchful and careful over the next decade, at least, because if these particles are in you causing chronic increase in inflammation, it's as if you're, for example, inhaling polluted air containing particles of silicon and iron and so on. A constant, dragging, nuisance level of inflammation accelerates your susceptibility to all kinds of things. And so, to the extent that the particles accumulate in your tissues, it's a constant source of deteriorating inflammation. And that means that you have to be more careful than other people in avoiding things that stress you and exacerbate the inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** So these unfortunate, uninformed souls who have taken this thing, they could experience all kinds of whatever stuff a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, that nobody's ever going to connect the dots to the spike broke, right?

**RAY PEAT:** The passage of time, they don't realize that this stuff has accumulated in your tissues and is slightly increasing the tendency to form blood clots, as long as there is any spike protein on the lining of your blood vessels, for example. The spike protein. You're more susceptible to form blood clots when you're tired, for example, or having hypoglycemia.
**CONTEXT:** So, my understanding that what you know... that these things could be very dangerous long term. Do we, do we really, is that conjecture, Dr. Pete, at this point, theory, or is it real science to show that these things could really be hurting people, possibly, long term?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is a protective substance. I don't even think of it as a hormone. It is so basic in the way it protects cells. And it's greatly increased during pregnancy because the developing fetus needs special protections. But the average person, male or female, has a very high concentration of progesterone in the brain because the brain needs special protection. And normally the brain contains about 10 times as much progesterone as in the blood serum. The brain produces progesterone. All of our tissues can produce some, but it's helpful if you have a placenta or ovary corpus luteum that is specialized in producing it. But if you're in good health, your brain is able to produce a lot of it. Your skin is a major contributor to your at your progesterone background. And when you're low in progesterone, the luteinizing hormone at the pituitary gonadotropin increases. And it happens that if the luteinizing hormone is too high, it in itself has toxic effects. And keeping the luteinizing hormone in a moderate low range is good for the health simply because the pituitary hormones themselves function as pro-inflammatory irritants. And so since progesterone along with testosterone tends to lower your luteinizing hormone, that's part of its benefit. When progesterone falls at menopause, the high luteinizing hormone attempting to make the ovaries produce more becomes toxic in itself and contributes to many of the symptoms of menopause. It's the same with a man. If your brain is deficient in cholesterol or a thyroid or vitamin A, all of which are needed to synthesize progesterone locally in the skin or in the brain, then you'll experience the effects not only of the progesterone deficiency destabilizing your nerve function, but also increased luteinizing hormone and its toxic effects. So that's why for a long time you've often recommended that all of us, boys, girls, regardless of age, could do, take a little dab of progesterone every day.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, is all kind of yammies? Is that mostly progesterone? Why that would be in a male kind of libido formula?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's any stress to the father or mother, or even your grandparents, that's been known for a long time, that for as long as five generations after a major trauma, such as war or famine, the children will be showing the effects of their great grandparents' problems. And especially your parents, if they have something that decreases their progesterone, the offspring will be more susceptible to metabolic problems and inflammatory problems.
**CONTEXT:** Beth is very concerned about this injection and the potential passing on to children. Did I hear Dr. Pete say that some of these problems could be intergenerational?

**RAY PEAT:** All the way up to 12,000, the problem with very high altitude is that it's cold all the time when you're much above 8,000 feet, but as far as the oxygen goes, the aging process of the skeleton, for example, people at 14,000 feet altitude chronically, have very sound teeth and bones because of the anti-stress, bone-protecting effect of carbon dioxide retention, and when you have more oxygen than you need, you're driving the level of carbon dioxide in your body down, and so you're losing the stabilizing effect. So coldness is probably the main reason for choosing an altitude under 12,000 feet, but 7,000 or 8,000 is extremely good altitude. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the insurance companies have recognized that the death rate from heart disease and cancer is much lower at high altitude populations. Every thousand feet you go up in altitude, your risk of dying of heart disease and cancer is lower, and even dementia, the brain is protected by the carbon dioxide balance at higher altitudes.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, what altitude is best to live in to get enough and more carbon dioxide?

**RAY PEAT:** If you have adapted, you shouldn't zoom, you shouldn't fly in the Mexico City, for example, from sea level, and expect to... In functioning right away, you should go up no more than about 500 feet per day to allow your body to adapt. And low-thyroid people are already, in effect, biochemically, they are hyperventilating, because they aren't producing enough carbon dioxide fast enough. So they have rapid breathing? Yeah, so the oxygen is lowering their CO2, and they compensate by increasing lactic acid production. So diabetics and hypothyroid people have a chronic lactate excess, and they have the most trouble adapting to high altitude. Because, in effect, they're... creating the oxygen excess by the fact that they aren't producing carbon dioxide fast enough.
**CONTEXT:** So when we're higher up, then we have less oxygen, we retain more carbon dioxide, right?

**RAY PEAT:** CO2 is our body's natural way to suppress. Lactic acid formation and progesterone and thyroid are ways to shift that balance, but many, many other things are very important. The flavonoids are coming to be recognized as protective against almost everything, anti-dementia, anti-cancer, anti-heart disease, because they promote natural mitochondrial respiration and production of carbon dioxide, and so they suppress inflammation and lactic acid production.
**CONTEXT:** So, could that be the connection then between some low thyroid and maybe some heart unhappiness because of the lactic acid, and hence Cowan's work with the Strophanthinus or Wabanine? That lowers the lactic acid?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, holding your breath is therapeutic. It retains carbon dioxide, right? But doesn't it retain carbon dioxide when we just... Yeah, it's funny, you can really learn how to just not breathe as much. You know, you can really teach the body how to just...
**CONTEXT:** Are you familiar with this idea of Buteyko breathing?

**RAY PEAT:** Anxiety makes you over breathe. Yeah. And that produces lactic acid, which creates anxiety. And it's a vicious circle. An episode of something that makes you anxious will increase your lactic acid and tend to prolong the anxiety and over-breathing. And so breathing in a paper bag is the quick and easy way to do it. To retain more carbon dioxide. Re-breathe until it feels like you're suffocating and then breathe normally for a while and then repeat the bag breathing. It takes a minute or two of bag breathing to reach that state. But I've seen people just bag breathing three or four times a day lower their blood pressure by 10 or 20 points.
**CONTEXT:** Exactly. Anxiety makes you over breathe.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when it's very uncomfortable you stop and breathe fresh air. And it's carbon dioxide. Halt stain in the body. Yeah, and you can absorb carbon dioxide through the skin. So if you fill a tub or a big plastic bag with carbon dioxide and get into it, if you're measuring it with a closed bag, for example, the bag deflates after about half an hour, showing that you've absorbed lots and lots of CO2 through your skin.
**CONTEXT:** So you're actually getting in the bag and then they have a way, do you just, like around your neck or you put your whole head in there too?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can see after. 15 or 20 minutes, usually your skin gets pinker when it gets saturated with CO2. That pinkness usually lasts for several hours after the episode. And all kinds of good things are going into your body when you're just retaining carbon dioxide without over-breathing, right? It relaxes everything. Once I was bringing a tank home and I tripped. And I knew if I broke the valve off the top it would turn it into a rocket so I clutched it to my body and fell on top of it and sort of squashed and scraped my wrist. I was falling on the concrete with a tank in my hand and immediately, like two or three minutes after it happened, I got a plastic bag, blew it up with CO2 and the purple semi-bloody spot where I'd squashed my wrist. After 15 minutes, the inflamed appearance disappeared, and all that left was a few bits of torn up skin, no bloody or purple sign of an injury left. Isn't that fun?
**CONTEXT:** So you're in this bathtub, you don't see anything, but your body's absorbing the carbon dioxide.

**RAY PEAT:** Welding shops are the most economical that I've found. The paint gun CO2 is very expensive. I'm sorry, the last part I didn't hear. What's expensive? What is expensive? Yeah, the welders use it. That's the cheapest place I've found to get it.
**CONTEXT:** And why do welding places have carbon dioxide?

**RAY PEAT:** It slightly reduces the PUFA content. And corn is pretty much like other grains as far as the minerals are concerned, but the process of soaking it in lime increases the calcium content to the extent that a kilogram of masa is almost the same as a liter of milk for the calcium effect. And there is a place online, the name is not with me at the moment, that I purchased organic nixtamalized masa. You can get, I think I bought 5 or 10 pounds or something, still have a bunch downstairs. And we were talking about the toxic effect of iron on PUFA interacting. If you get a generous supply of calcium in your diet, that works with vitamin D to inhibit your parathyroid hormone. And that inhibiting your parathyroid hormone increases your cell metabolic oxygen consumption. And that protects you against iron and PUFA. So high calcium intake protects you against calcification of arteries, nerves. other tissues.
**CONTEXT:** Mark is in New York, Dr. P.D. He wants to know if masa harina seems to be high in PUFAs and iron? Do you think the nixtamalization process takes care of this?

**RAY PEAT:** They're pleasant to eat. I think they're safe. Chayote.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. P, do you think chayote? Is okay to eat.

**RAY PEAT:** I knew someone who had extreme breast pain premenstrually, and she found that a quick application of ultrasound relieved it completely. And it's been known for quite a while that any injured tissue repairs itself faster under the influence of mild ultrasound. Bone injury heals faster, and I'm sure that would apply to tendon and ligament injury too. But you want to keep it away from your head. I don't think it's good to risk brain emulsification. by too much ultrasound.
**CONTEXT:** Could low-intensity ultrasounds for repair torn ligaments be bad in the long run? My physical therapist suggested I do it once a week for two to three months for my wrist and thumb that I injured.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's been known that damages, genes, DNA, chromosomes can be shown to break under the influence of ultrasound. They don't tell you that part, do they, Dr. B?
**CONTEXT:** What about the babies, the moms that do the ultrasound to look at the babies, is that a good idea?

**RAY PEAT:** It feels on. You're starting a level of thyroid and stress hormones. Getting your blood glucose up by eating some carbohydrate will activate your thyroid, increasing the conversion of thyroxine to the active T3. So that can increase your temperature and pulse rate if you're a slightly low thyroid. But the same thing, increasing your blood glucose, will lower the stress hormones. And if your stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol, were responsible for keeping your temperature and pulse rate up, then the carbohydrate will lower your blood glucose. Lower your pulse rate and temperature, so you can get an impression of what was responsible for your balance before eating by the effect that the carbohydrate has.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, comment on this method or your pulse as well.

**RAY PEAT:** Carbohydrate, especially if it has some sugar in it, carbohydrate is the basis for good energy production rather than fat. All kinds of fat will have some metabolic problems where carbohydrate is the ideal energy substrate better than protein. Protein can be converted to energy, but the carbohydrate has the fewest drawbacks. And especially vegetables that are very tender when they're cooked, like summer squash, it's actually a fruit and low in the harmful fibers, carbohydrates. So that's why if I cook squash, which is what I usually have in the summer, summer squash, if I just eat that, my body needs more, what, sugar? More sugar? So it's craving some kind of carbs. Not necessarily. Those are very safe and beneficial. But if you want to have a therapeutic effect, increasing your metabolic rate are more effective than those good starches are the sugars. The starch will increase, sustain your metabolic rate pretty effectively, but you can give it an extra boost with a sugar such as orange juice.
**CONTEXT:** I mean, is that just God's way of saying, Patrick, have a, I don't know, some pasta or rice or something?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think I am slightly allergic to them. Oh, are you? Tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants, and potatoes. The nightshades. Yeah, about 40 years ago, I noticed that I tended to get a headache after eating too much of any of those.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, two questions, why doesn't Dr. Pete eat potatoes?

**RAY PEAT:** Chronic tendency towards low thyroid increases the problems with the bacteria in the gut, makes the intestine more susceptible to inflammation and then that shifts the type of bacteria that are favored by the intestine. So it's a complex interactive cycle. The stress tends to create the conditions that create more stress.
**CONTEXT:** Now when something like that's happening, have you figured out over the years, is that something that's going on in the gut or just, have you figured out why that is?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that was one of the things that got me interested in high altitude because my allergies would tend to disappear when I was up around seven or eight thousand feet altitude for a few weeks.
**CONTEXT:** So having a low thyroid actually messes with the little guys in the terrain that makes everything happy.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I don't eat it that often, but well, once a week, lately I've been having it with liver. We happened to get some that the pigs had been raised on a Pufa-free diet. And so the bacon fat was very similar to butter in Pufa content.
**CONTEXT:** Does Dr. Pete think it's safe to eat bacon, maybe fried in coconut oil, several times a week if the rest of the diet is good, avoiding PUFAs, calcium-phosphate ratio good?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it was a variety of starches. and sugars, a mixed diet, simply excluding soybeans and whole grains, which contain too much Pufa.
**CONTEXT:** So Dr. Preet, even if it's an organic bacon, which you can get, we still don't know the Pufa stuff, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Poor people in Mexico often feed their pigs. Squash and whatever fruit they have in excess of. It's the same with eggs. If you feed your chickens table scraps, lots of vegetables and tortillas and everything except the grains, you'll get saturated eggs which taste better.
**CONTEXT:** So we just gotta find more people like my pig guy where he does a vegetarian diet, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, that's mostly for taste, I think. Is it? That's why my mom used to do it. Yeah, if the liver isn't entirely fresh, then onions and bacon are more important for... covering up the flavor.
**CONTEXT:** Do you think it's important or meaningful at all to fry it with onions?

**RAY PEAT:** It happens to increase the metabolic rate, the oxidative metabolism, and so if you introduce it gradually, orange juice in particular has the anti-inflammatory flavonoids which stimulate oxidative metabolism. So the combination of flavonoids and sucrose have an effect that opposes the problem in diabetes. You can create... the diabetes metabolism immediately by feeding a lot of PUFA. When your blood is loaded with fatty acids, that suppresses the ability to oxidize glucose. So, momentarily, a load of fat creates......temporary diabetes. And chronically, especially when it's polyunsaturated to a high degree, a fat diet is the basic cause of diabetes, not a sugar-rich diet. And in the late 19th century, two doctors demonstrated that......approaching a pound of sugar a day, just plain refined white sugar, added to a regular diet. There are terminal diabetes patients recovered in just a matter of two or three weeks.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, how to use orange juice or even Mexican Coke in the treatment of type 2 diabetes? Wouldn't that raise blood sugar way too high? How could that possibly work?

**RAY PEAT:** Breaking the stress cycle. Interesting.
**CONTEXT:** What these doctors were doing was giving so much sugar added to a regular diet that they were suppressing the release of fatty acids from storage.

**RAY PEAT:** No, in women that's a common way of using it. For a long time doctors have prescribed tablets or suppositories containing powdered progesterone. The powder isn't very effectively absorbed, but when it's dissolved in vitamin E, a thin application of it to any mucous membrane is very well absorbed, whether it's in the vagina membrane or the gums, it goes right in through the thin tissue into the bloodstream. So it works no matter where you put it. Yeah, but only what's in contact with the membrane is active. If you put in too much, it just falls out.
**CONTEXT:** I have a question about applying the Progest-E natural progesterone oil that you developed to the lob... is it labia? Is that how you say it? The LABIA around the vaginal opening or even to the inside of the vagina. How much would absorption compare... to applying it to the gums? Would the benefit be comparable? Is there any reason not to apply it in the genital area?

**RAY PEAT:** You don't want to do that. So if you take it, put it on the other skin. It lowers your stress reaction first and can actually increase your testosterone production by lowering the stress.
**CONTEXT:** For guys, would there be any benefit to applying a right to the testicles?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that has been tested. When you're very relaxed, the progesterone level goes up, also the testosterone. And when you exercise stressfully, your testosterone goes down. Athletes have known that for 50 or 60 years by under training, supposedly, they were getting abrir. That's why, maybe, the progesterone level went down. much better results at olympic contests rather than overtraining so that's why the burst exercise of maybe 30 seconds or even a minute full on could be beneficial so you don't spend 15 minutes breathing hard or something yeah and that's one of the effects of carbon dioxide athletes uh increase their endurance and adaptation to altitude and stress by taking a baking soda in the water the carbon dioxide is retained by the cells and you excrete the sodium so it's a way of decreasing inflammation and increasing oxidative metabolism.
**CONTEXT:** So just in general, when we chill guys and we just chill out and don't over breathe and don't over exercise, it raises testosterone level kind of naturally? Just by relaxing?

**RAY PEAT:** Before exercise. And that helps you to not breathe as uh breathe as heavy and lose carbon dioxide.
**CONTEXT:** A little baking soda, you mean before exercise or just a couple during the day?

**RAY PEAT:** It's very quickly absorbed and adjusted your stomach compensates and doesn't stay alkaline. Very long huh? Yeah and once it gets absorbed your kidneys get rid of the excess. Sodium very quickly but instead of. Leaving the Alkaline bicarbonate that the bicarbonate is turned into gaseous Co2 Which then is? dissolved into the Cells keeping them in a stable oxidizing condition
**CONTEXT:** Wow. Doesn't that that won't mess up your your gut? Doesn't that alkalize the stomach? That's okay?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is mainly produced by the biggest, oldest chemical companies, and so if you get a good brand of it, you know that it is unlikely to be contaminated. Just be careful with what you're using here. Otherwise, the effect of progesterone is immediate as a quieting anti-stress effect. The anti-stress effect of pregnenolone is not only. Quick, but it's limited. And for example, with any reasonable amount of pregnenolone, less than half a cup at a time, even a thousand milligrams isn't going to have any sedative effect or an overdose of progesterone. It will put you to sleep if you take too much.
**CONTEXT:** Currently, a problem is that there are dozens of little startup companies producing a pregnenolone and the slightest miscalculation or inefficiency in their chemistry can leave irritating or toxic toxic contaminants in it. So you have to test any particular brand of pregnenolone that you get. Watch out for any hormonal symptom at all. It shouldn't be associated with pregnenolone. Nothing but an anti-stress effect should result from pregnenolone. No uterine or breasts. Sensations. No changes of whisker growth or such.

**RAY PEAT:** The body generally detoxes every poison that goes in. Only if your liver is in very good condition. Low thyroid people, one of the big problems is that the liver slows down. And even estrogen and cortisol, which are normally excreted on the first passage through the liver, 100% of the estrogen should be excreted. But if you're deficient in nutrients or thyroid, the liver passes the toxins repeatedly, letting you accumulate the toxins and estrogen and cortisol, so that you lose the regulatory function of the liver.
**CONTEXT:** George, why wouldn't the body detoxify all of the bad things from this injection you and Dr. Pete have been talking about?

**RAY PEAT:** A good, adequate protein, B vitamins, and thyroid. Keep your thyroid happy. Yeah. And carbohydrate is essential for the thyroid to work. The thyroid, the active T3 thyroid, at least two-thirds of it derives from the liver, and the liver only converts it when it has enough sugar.
**CONTEXT:** And what are some of the best things we can do for the liver?

**RAY PEAT:** Inflammation of the bowel, sending signals to both the intestine and the liver to interfere with cholesterol synthesis. And so clearing up any bowel inflammation is the first thing. And then have adequate carbohydrates in your diet as essential so that the thyroid provides the energy needed to make the cholesterol.
**CONTEXT:** What could be keeping my cholesterol so low some years ago? A nurse told me my cholesterol was below 100. Wow. If it's anything like my metabolism back then, oh, this is a while, I'm burning cholesterol as fast as I make it.

**RAY PEAT:** A fast destroys... protein tissues very quickly, turning them into the required amount of glucose to keep your brain and immune system functioning. So, fast is very destructive to the muscles. Atrophy, for example, you lose mostly muscle tissue and thymus and immune tissue on a fast. Or on a low-calorie diet, where you're getting the carbohydrate that your brain and immune system need, you lose mostly fat. So, I think the closer you are......to a balance of calorie need, but you can increase your calorie burning by getting sugar rather than starch and supporting your thyroid function. The starch isn't quite as stimulating to the metabolic rate as sugar. So, the things that I chronically... mention in connection with the therapeutic diet happen to be ideal for a weight loss diet. Low fat milk and orange juice. Orange juice and low fat milk. Yeah. That'll get you there.
**CONTEXT:** If someone needed to lose 50 pounds. Dr. Peters, I believe, said he wouldn't eat anything for a while. Can you ask him to expand on that? Would he do an extended fast or would he just use a low-calorie approach or something else?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, very good.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, do you think consuming a couple of cups of green tea like Sencha or Matcha is......beneficial or okay.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, your peristalsis should be fast. Digestive juices should contribute to general sterility of your small intestine. And that's just not a happy environment for parasites. If you have sluggish digestion, there will be undigested food far up in your small intestine. That will give parasites a chance to get started.
**CONTEXT:** If your thyroid is not working, you will...if your thyroid is working, you would not have an overabundance of parasites? Is that true?

**RAY PEAT:** The vaginal dryness is often from other than an estrogen deficiency. Vitamin A to help you make cholesterol and progesterone along with thyroid is important for vaginal lubrication. And when you're deficient in progesterone... the... all of the enzymes, all of your tissues, fat tissues, skin, brain, liver, bones, everything, shifts over to making local estrogen. So, the absence of estrogen normal levels in the blood. Have nothing to do with the actual estrogen effect inside tissues. When your progesterone is adequate, you are inactivating the intracellular estrogen releasing it into the bloodstream. So, supplementing progesterone will seem to normalize your blood level. But it will actually be lowering the physiological effect of estrogen. So, I doubt that it's possible to have such a thing as an estrogen deficiency. Because the more stress there is, the more tissues take over producing progesterone. Even in a healthy individual, even a steady... To measure the amount of estrogen being created by the ovaries, they compared it to the amount of estrogen in the veins draining the arm of the monkey they were experimenting on. And the arm was producing as much estrogen as the ovary. So ovarian failure tends to, if anything... increase the amount of estrogen manufactured in your muscles and bones and fat and breast tissue and so on.
**CONTEXT:** Please ask doctor how to balance estrogen and progesterone. I was diagnosed with low estrogen, prolapsed uterine and vaginal dryness. I'm 56, post-menopausal. My doctor put me on an estradiol cream. I only did it for two weeks. It made my breasts hurt. What can I take to help me?

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on who is being convinced. If you take a huge portion of cholera bacteria, for example, it's almost always going to make a person very, very sick. But that's if you put it in your body, right? You'd have to scratch him or inject it, touch it? Or drink it. Or drink it. Right. Yeah. Right.
**CONTEXT:** Ray, he's having trouble with sexual activity. And he said, what could be keeping my cholesterol so low some years ago? A nurse told me my cholesterol was below 100. Wow. If it's anything like my metabolism back then, oh, this is a while, I'm burning cholesterol as fast as I make it. What could be going on?

**RAY PEAT:** People have proven it many times by taking a concentrate from a petri dish where it has been grown and inoculating it carefully. They can get essentially a hundred percent transfer. But as you know, Lenka, Cowan, Kaufman and all that say that that's not, you're not playing fair because you, they're doing monkey kidneys and antibiotics and they're starving it in a petri dish, but they can't isolate it if you just really isolate it using the term isolation as in Webster's dictionary. But you can demonstrate that the symptoms correspond to the organism. Different organisms produce very different symptoms.
**CONTEXT:** So could you show them that the germ theory is true?

**RAY PEAT:** That doesn't apply anywhere in science, really. When you identify a chemical, using a chemical test, you can do that on trace amounts of atoms and molecules. Just a few molecules can be identified, but obviously you can't isolate those, but you can do very sensitive tests to demonstrate their presence. That's all you're doing.
**CONTEXT:** So what do you say to them, these people that say if you don't isolate it, you don't have it?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the same as... analyzing traces of chemicals by the effect. But if you have a lot of chemicals in what you're doing, how would you know it's this or that? By the different effect. The same way you can distinguish iron from copper in trace amounts. They have different effects and so if you compare cholera to measles, the effect you get is specific to the substance. You don't have to demonstrate that you have a cholera bacterium to show that it has a specific cholera-like effect.
**CONTEXT:** But how do you, if you haven't divided it from the monkey kidneys and all the stuff and the antibiotics, how do you know what could possibly be hurting people? How do you know?

**RAY PEAT:** You put it in your digestive system and you get cholera symptoms. Right. But that's a bacterial thing, right? Not a viral. Yeah, but it's the same with different viruses. You get different effects, although usually there is confusion. Many viruses called respiratory viruses are actually intestinal viruses. They attack the intestine first and the inflammation producing the intestine brings on respiratory symptoms.
**CONTEXT:** And you say effect by when you put it in the person?

**RAY PEAT:** Usually, yes. The demonstration of aerial transmission is a very special and questionable route. That's what they're claiming. The people that are questioning this whole China virus idea, Lanka and those claim that you do a protein like that, a poison, and throw it out there, and it's dead on arrival before it even gets there. In other words, in other words, if you did something in a lab and try to release it in the air or whatever, their conjecture is that it just doesn't work like that. We just don't spread things back and forth from each other, and it's very unlikely we would even breathe it in and get sick, because it would be dead by the time it gets there.
**CONTEXT:** And where do these intestinal viruses come from? You can grow them in a culture medium or you can take them from a sick organism. But not through the air, you'd have to inject it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the best demonstration of possible aerial transmission is if you put a cold object under your nose and breathe on it until you have obvious condensation. Then you can do a polymerase test to demonstrate what is in that condensate, and so you can demonstrate that we are breathing out nucleic acids, exosomes and so on.
**CONTEXT:** Well, there's several people out there that are actually offering big money if you could actually prove that there's some virus-isolated corona that's making people sick. Do you know, I don't think there's ever been a Koch's postulates or an autopsy done to prove that, oh, there's that virus, has there?

**RAY PEAT:** The probability that there is no such thing as a simple certainty in science is always a matter of probability. And if you can create the symptoms of a disease by taking a sample from a person with that disease and create similar symptoms, the fact that the symptoms are the same, the probability is you're transmitting an agent specific for those symptoms. It's the same as chemical analysis. There's no question of having to isolate anything. It's a matter of probable, most likely explanation for why you get particular symptoms.
**CONTEXT:** It's the same as chemical analysis.

**RAY PEAT:** They could be detoxing like we do with a flu, right? Or a cold. They could be EMFs. They could be bad diet. They could be, they're in fear. I mean, if you're afraid of a virus, you could create anything, right?
**CONTEXT:** They could be detoxing like we do with a flu, right, or a cold.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm extremely skeptical about all of the claims of the COVID virus because they are essentially identical to traditional influenza and, in fact, traditional influenza disappeared the very week that the coronavirus took over the epidemic.
**CONTEXT:** So you're skeptical of the corona...

**RAY PEAT:** It's probably just a change of names.
**CONTEXT:** It's probably just a change of names.

**RAY PEAT:** When I frequently associated with school teachers, when their students were having an epidemic of cold, cold and flu, even chicken pox. I would tend to get cold symptoms or even chicken pox symptoms. Just talking to them? No, just being, sharing a house with a school teacher, for example.
**CONTEXT:** You know, many people are arguing, you know, that we're just detoxing when this happens, that we don't really catch some kind of virus in the air? Do you think that's possible?

**RAY PEAT:** You should detox without any symptoms at all when your liver is working. And your other protective organs are working, including your thymus and your nervous system. Detoxification should go on faster the more symptom-free you are. When you become symptomatic, your energy system decreases and you are failing to detox to the extent that you're having symptoms.
**CONTEXT:** So that would be a great argument for most Americans on a standard American diet. It's stress or whatever, smoking alcohol, EMFs, you name it. Bad water. That a couple times a year they get the flu because they build it up, right? I mean, that's the perfect argument for that, isn't it? That the body's trying to get rid of stuff, that they didn't catch anything.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, when it is getting rid of things, successfully, you're not experiencing symptoms. Right. No, I understand what you're saying. You and I, if we don't have flu symptoms, we're just detoxing all the time.
**CONTEXT:** You and I, if we don't have flu symptoms, we're just detoxing all the time.

**RAY PEAT:** The fasting knocks out your detoxifying enzymes and makes you suddenly susceptible to the poisons that are stored in your tissues. Right. So there's two ways to look at it. You can say, well, if I don't ever experience flu or cold or flu, I'm detoxing ongoing, I'm doing great. Or you could say, I have a great immune system, which I don't even know if that flies anymore. And this little virus that goes around allegedly, I just don't get because I'm strong. Two ways to look at it, isn't there?
**CONTEXT:** So there's two ways to look at it. You can say, well, if I don't ever experience flu or cold or flu, I'm detoxing ongoing, I'm doing great.

**RAY PEAT:** You can demonstrate the presence, supposedly, of the viral antigens in a very high proportion. Very healthy people. The virus can be present. They have no symptoms at all. They're perfectly healthy. Showing that it's the body weakness which allows the presence of the virus to increase their symptoms. So if you're diabetic, have autoimmune diseases, the small exposure... to either the virus or the vaccine can exacerbate your existing problems.
**CONTEXT:** So, if you're diabetic, have autoimmune diseases, the small exposure... to either the virus or the vaccine can exacerbate your existing problems.

**RAY PEAT:** It could be in the body. Yeah, and just hasn't been noticed. And so even in a person who is dying in the presence of the positive... PCR test, that has nothing to do with saying that the COVID virus is killing them. Right. It is simply present when the person is sick. Yeah, it's simply there, right?
**CONTEXT:** It could be in the body.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it's a curious thing, these bodies. Have 50% of the world, no, I won't even go to the right. Oh, now they're running the story that 50% of the world's domestic pigs died from the SARS virus years ago. Or is that fake news?
**CONTEXT:** Well, Dr. Pete, we've overstayed our welcome with you. You know, this Zoom thing worked pretty well.

**RAY PEAT:** You're an orange juice junkie now, thanks to you. I appreciate it.
**CONTEXT:** Well, you've got me. I'm an orange juice junkie now, thanks to you. I appreciate it.
