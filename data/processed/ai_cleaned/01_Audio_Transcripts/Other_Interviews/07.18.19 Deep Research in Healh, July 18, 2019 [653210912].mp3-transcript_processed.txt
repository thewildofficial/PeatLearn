**RAY PEAT:** The body is always changing to adapt to circumstances and they've done experiments with people who thought they were intolerant of lactose and by introducing an ounce or two or three or four ounces of milk per day within their tolerance, they found that in a few weeks, even lactose intolerant people, at least the ones that believed they were. For example, a thing that was done in San Francisco with Chinese, they found that they were able to drink regular amounts of milk, because the enzymes take a couple of weeks to adapt, and that applies to any food when you change to a different kind of... major energy source, your intestine takes weeks to really adjust to it.
**CONTEXT:** What changes in the body would allow someone to tolerate milk better if they previously couldn't?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you give it signals of what's happening and it starts making new enzymes to handle the new material. That happens. Most easily when you have all of the essential nutrients in adequate amounts and your thyroid is working efficiently so that you have lots of energy to do the new protein synthesis.
**CONTEXT:** What conditions are necessary for the body to adapt to new foods like milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the only major deficiency it has is iron because during pregnancy......high estrogen causes the woman to absorb iron with extreme efficiency, several, I think they say nine or ten times more efficiently than a man, extracting it from food, and that charges up the woman's body with high amounts of iron, and so the baby is born overloaded with iron stores. Their liver stores enough iron for almost a year of life living on milk, and so milk lets them adjust to that newborn state of iron excess, so it's designed to be deficient in iron, and so you can't live indefinitely on just milk. But the large, the estrogen also makes the woman absorb. Calcium very efficiently because the bones of the baby are going to require lots of calcium. And so milk has an excess of calcium for adult requirements. But it turns out that even an adult who doesn't need it for growing bones, that excess of calcium turns out to have a very powerful anti-inflammatory. Anti-stress effect.
**CONTEXT:** What are the key nutritional aspects of milk, particularly regarding iron and calcium?

**RAY PEAT:** And during the night the the lack of light uh causes a developing stress that of after about the age of 30 all of the changes related to aging uh happened during the night uh because of of the stress of uh that requires sleeping to get through it the pituitary hormones all zoom up during the night yeah uh you've heard of growth hormone and the gonadotropic hormones and cortisol rising the parasyroid hormone rises during the night and it exacerbates things because it inhibits energy production which makes you need the cortisol and the combination of parasyroid hormone and cortisol rising very steeply during the night takes your energy down and breaks down your bones so morning urine is full of the calcium that you've torn out of your bones during the night and so milk at bedtime uh... experimenters have found that that greatly lowers the night stress isn't that fascinating some of the surge of those stress hormones maybe that's where the whole idea of uh... it's been around for years i guess uh... warm milk at night and all that maybe that's where that comes from probably probably so
**CONTEXT:** How does nighttime stress affect the body, and how can milk at bedtime mitigate this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it has several differences partly it's because of the goats favored diet they won't eat everything yeah and they are stubborn and won't won't eat the stuff they make cows eat but but basically it's creamier and the cream is emulsified in a different way so it's slower to separate makes it easier to digest for a lot of people yeah yeah
**CONTEXT:** What are the key differences between goat's milk and cow's milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Well The interesting thing is that babies if the mother keeps her blood sugar up the babies make their own fat which is all saturated except for the polyunsaturated minus 9 fatty acids that are synthesized in babies liver and so babies are born with a highly saturated brain and in that state in their first few years when the brain it contains only our native polyunsaturated fats and lots of saturated fats that they have their highest metabolic rate and a tremendous rate of learning so by the age of five or six they know five or six thousand words imagine an adult trying to learn five or six thousand words in five years wow so so we humans uh how do we pony up on more of that good fat in our brain i'm sugar just like a baby it's sugar i like you white sugar okay starch and sugar both both have turned turned to fat when you eat enough of them uh-huh
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of saturated fat in infant brain development and learning, and how can adults increase their intake of this type of fat?

**RAY PEAT:** um it actually prefers saturated fat but since our diets have been industrialized the pigs now have highly unsaturated fat for about 50 years the department of agriculture published lists calling pork fat or lard calling it a saturated fat but it turned out to be extremely polyunsaturated because they feed them so much soy and corn to make them fat those polyunsaturated corn and soy oils are highly fattening where coconut oil is more like natural human fat and it's not so fattening.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference in fat composition between conventionally raised pork and pigs fed a more natural diet, and how does this relate to coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everyone used to feed their pigs that way when I was a kid. The creameries would make cheese and give away. huge amounts of whey and the farmers would mix whey with whatever apple crops or anything that was waste vegetable or fruit and that was really a kind of ideal diet milk protein and fruit and vegetables. Wow yeah and she was saying there's a huge difference between what she's doing out there and these people with these pigs and like you say what you even if you go get some kind of organic pork or something you don't know what they're feeding them really they can be feeding them organic soy and all kinds of stuff right yeah
**CONTEXT:** What was the traditional diet for pigs, and how does it compare to modern practices?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah here's an email for you dr ray pete is reduced fat ultra filtered milk lactose free good to drink reduce fat ultra filter mold luck i've seen this stuff at the store is that good to drink rights nancy uh yeah it can be if there are no serious additives in it uh-huh the lactose uh they put an enzyme in that breaks lactose down and all it does is make glucose and fructose out of the uh or glucose on them and uh another monosaccharide i forget what the name of it is but it's uh perfectly uh good sugar makes it taste sweeter
**CONTEXT:** Is reduced-fat, ultra-filtered, lactose-free milk a good option?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the only major deficiency it has is iron because during pregnancy......high estrogen causes the woman to absorb iron with extreme efficiency, several, I think they say nine or ten times more efficiently than a man, extracting it from food, and that charges up the woman's body with high amounts of iron, and so the baby is born overloaded with iron stores. Their liver stores enough iron for almost a year of life living on milk, and so milk lets them adjust to that newborn state of iron excess, so it's designed to be deficient in iron, and so you can't live indefinitely on just milk. But the large, the estrogen also makes the woman absorb. Calcium very efficiently because the bones of the baby are going to require lots of calcium. And so milk has an excess of calcium for adult requirements. But it turns out that even an adult who doesn't need it for growing bones, that excess of calcium turns out to have a very powerful anti-inflammatory. Anti-stress effect.
**CONTEXT:** What are the key nutritional aspects of milk, particularly regarding iron and calcium?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh oh no you can get fat i used to drink a gallon a day of when i was working easily a gallon day of whole milk but when i became sedentary going to school you i started getting fat on that and so i reduced it to one percent and i could drink a gallon of one percent milk without getting fat one of the virtues of milk is that the high calcium content stimulates heat production the same way both sodium and protein and sugar stimulate your metabolism and the calcium is a major factor in maintaining a high metabolic rate Yeah, is it the calcium that gets into the little mitochondria in the cells and little energy bunnies, Don?
**CONTEXT:** Does the fat content of milk matter for weight management, and what role does calcium play in metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, mostly that turns out to be a low thyroid state, and that relates to a lot of things that have become... more problematic in the national diet over the last 50 years, but even in the 30s and 40s there were people who were in a position to see a lot of problem patients and they were estimating that probably 40% of the population was practically hypothyroid, suffering some symptoms of hypothyroidism, and since then... the diet has deteriorated, so using those same standards you could say that probably 60 or 80% of the people are suffering from hypothyroidism, but the standards for measuring it since the 1940s have changed to revise the definition of normal, so that people have stayed normal by their tests despite the changing circumstances. And it turns out that the standard they use for diagnosing hypothyroidism is TSH, the thyroid-stimulating hormone made by the pituitary, and what they overlook is that the stress caused by hypothyroidism and bad diet, the stress hormones lower TSH the same way an excessive thyroid hormone would. A stressed, tired, low-energy person will have very low TSH production because of the stress hormones. The doctor is looking at it. Wow, you're good. Yeah, and quite a few people have had a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism because their TSH is so low, but then their symptoms such as water retention, fatigue. And so on hair loss. They're diagnosed by those as hypothyroidism. So several people have told me I'm both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid. It makes absolutely no sense but quite a few doctors are actually saying that. They're saying it now.
**CONTEXT:** What is the prevalence of hypothyroidism, and why are current diagnostic methods like TSH potentially misleading?

**RAY PEAT:** So on the whole panel on the thyroid is there which marker do you kind of look at that think people should pay attention to if they... you know, if they want to kind of dig into this a bit. It's good to look at all of them, but the free T3 and free T4 and TSH, each of those is ambiguous under stress. So the ones I look at mostly are, is there hemoglobin and hematocrit up to normal? Is there cholesterol above normal? And two or three little metabolic indicators like that, how are the liver enzymes, those going a little bit off center are typical of high thyroid people. And so you have to take those into account. And their temperature and heart rate are pretty good indicators. The real indicator that was abandoned after the... pharmaceutical companies took over in the 40s, they used to measure actual oxygen consumption and heat production or calorie use. And if a person was only burning two-thirds as much energy as a healthy person, not to mention the extra-vital people who burned 20 or 30 percent more than the average. Those people were given a thyroid supplement to bring their oxygen consumption up to normal, and their symptoms went away. Their cholesterol went down, temperature came up, heart rate was normalized, blood pressure came down if it was high, came up if it was low. So looking at oxygen consumption and calorie consumption, a person just by keeping... their own records of what they're eating and drinking, can get a good impression of their calorie consumption. Women who diet a lot, they have been found, instead of the textbook, 1700 calories per day that used to be published, they were found to be able to maintain their weight on 700 calories a day because of low thyroid function. Fascinating.
**CONTEXT:** Beyond TSH, free T3, and free T4, what other markers are important for assessing thyroid function, and what was the historical method for measuring metabolic rate?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and low thyroid people chronically have anxiety because when your energy production goes down, it happens to everyone during the night. It compensates with increased adrenaline and cortisol to counteract the stress of low thyroid. But when your thyroid is chronically low, you run around in the daytime with elevated adrenaline and cortisol. Cortisol, yeah. Yeah, I've seen people with several times the normal amount of adrenaline production and even where that would make a normal person seem... very agitated and anxious. Some people can function normally with four times as much adrenaline production as normal. And that's why some low thyroid people tend to sometimes get anxious or AFib and that kind of thing. Yeah, and especially at sunset when the stress hormones are normally rising, a low thyroid person... can go into a very anxious worrying state chronically. Every night they start worrying.
**CONTEXT:** Why do people with low thyroid function experience chronic anxiety and elevated stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Experiments on rabbits in Leningrad, they found that as soon as the lights returned out, the mitochondria started swelling a little. The nights there in the winter are about 16 hours long, and so halfway through the night the mitochondria were extremely enlarged. About 3 or 4 in the morning they started exploding and collapsing and stopping energy production altogether. They found that generally at the end of winter... Because of these very long nights, their mitochondria had been seriously deteriorated. The way an old person's mitochondria are...the DNA is lost, for example. But because their summer days are extremely long, rabbits and people have more opportunity to restore their mitochondria. And certain kinds of exercise in old people......can do the same thing that very long days do for rabbits and people in Lennon Crab. You can restore even the DNA. Few surviving mitochondria with good DNA will multiply quickly under prolonged light and good exercise. In humans, there was a study in which they... put a tube in their arms so they could take a blood sample every 15 minutes during the night. And they found that when they turned the lights out, within 15 minutes there was a rise in cortisol, which continued giving them an extremely high morning cortisol. But the ones who went to sleep, the rise was much lower than if they stayed awake. So sleep... is a way of reducing our need for cortisol.
**CONTEXT:** What is the impact of prolonged darkness on mitochondria, and how does sleep affect cortisol levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. People who have spent the summer months in Antarctica where the daylight is constant have said they felt the best of their lives didn't. feel any of that nighttime stress but getting to sleep early so that you're minimizing the stress of nighttime is very helpful to the body.
**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of constant daylight, such as experienced in Antarctica, on well-being, and how does early sleep benefit the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Infrared is basically a heat and it's good to help keep your metabolic rate up just by staying warm. Yes. Like old people sleep better if they wear a wool hat, wool socks at night, or even take a warm bath before bed. But the warming effect is one thing, but different wavelengths. Infrared penetrate differently. Most of it is just warming, warming the water and then so it's highly absorbed by your tissue. Red light at the fairly narrow band from orange to red is not absorbed by most of the things in the tissue. It passes right through water without heating it. But when it runs into a blue protein, blue enzyme. Which we have quite a few of those containing copper that makes them blue. Under stress, the free radicals and free electrons reduce that blue copper, turn it red. And the red light being absorbed by those copper containing enzymes at times changes the state. It reoxidizes the copper. It favors the oxidized and oxidizing state of the copper rather than the reduced state. That puts the mitochondria back to work because the copper enzymes are the final enzyme of the mitochondrial energy producing system.
**CONTEXT:** How do different wavelengths of infrared and red light affect the body, particularly concerning mitochondria and copper-containing enzymes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they can, within just a minute or two, restore the enzyme activity and they've measured rats' cognitive ability and oxygen consumption in their brains, just shining red light through their head. It restores their mitochondrial oxidation very quickly. And then it will continue on its own for a bit without the light. Yeah, it has a certain momentum before the stress knocks it out again. So about every 10 or 15 minutes having a little flash of light on your body would probably help. You'd almost put a red light thing on your bed and put it on a timer or something like that might be fun.
**CONTEXT:** What are the immediate and sustained effects of red light on brain function and mitochondrial oxidation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, 600 to 700 is the most important band. Can you put that in your eyes as well, shine in your eyes? Yeah, there were experiments with, for example, welders who burned their eyes with ultraviolet light and were found to have instant pain relief almost when they looked at red light. Experimenters with deadly amounts of gamma rays that would kill a frog from radiation sickness in the first few hours after exposure, just a gigantic dose, when they gave them red light immediately after the radiation, it didn't kill them. It had the same effect on the electrons which had been knocked out of their proper... condition by the gamma rays. The red light restored the enzymes that would have led to fatal inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** What is the optimal range of red light for therapeutic benefits, and what are the effects of red light on eye health and radiation exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the anti-stress hormones, all are helpful, but one of the crucial things, you've probably heard the connection between hair loss and heart disease, there is an association and that's because of the stress hormones and one of the basic......stress producers is the parathyroid hormone interacting with the bones and the mitochondria and it happens that the high parathyroid hormone is very destructive to the hair follicle and so lowering the parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and calcium in the diet is......probably the single most protective thing that can be done both for heart disease and the hair follicle because that will help to restore your thyroid function which helps to restore progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA and so on, lowers the stress.
**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between hair loss, heart disease, and parathyroid hormone, and how can vitamin D and calcium help?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the same thing that causes the heart disease and hair loss and so on. The mitochondria are the first thing poisoned by misplaced. Calcium. And what parathyroid hormone does is to block mitochondria metabolism, turn on lactic acid production, and lactic acid is essential for taking calcium out of your bones where it should be, and in the process it shifts the balance in a way that makes it tend to deposit in soft tissues where it shouldn't be. And parathyroid hormone rises when your diet doesn't have enough vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium. And so increasing your calcium in your diet will lower the parathyroid hormone and protect you against blood vessel calcification and other improper calcifications.
**CONTEXT:** How does misplaced calcium affect mitochondria, and what is the role of parathyroid hormone in calcium deposition and bone health?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you don't get a headache or asthma or diarrhea or something from the supplement. And how about the zinc? If somebody wanted to take zinc for some reason, is there a better kind than others? I don't really think gluconate is okay, but I don't think... doses above 10 milligrams per day are safe. Oh, so just stay below 10 milligrams for the zinc.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential side effects of magnesium supplements, and what is a safe daily dosage for zinc?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, Joseph Priestley who discovered both oxygen and how to make carbonated water. At that time, people quickly put this carbonated water and pure carbon......dioxide gas to use in various diseases. They found that alleviated breast cancer, for example, and they described patients who were kept in a relatively healthy condition, healing the ulcer of a cancerous breast, for example. The ulcer would close up when they were exposed to carbon dioxide, so they were given CO2 enemas......and douches, and applying it locally to injured tissue as early as the 1790s. They were writing about its therapeutic properties, and the Japanese are currently using it experimentally against cancer.
**CONTEXT:** What were the early therapeutic uses of carbonated water and carbon dioxide gas, particularly for conditions like breast cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** There has been very little study of that because it's counter... cultural... counter-cultural, yeah. Very, very thin line of research suggesting that we can... our dehydrogenase enzymes that feed energy into the mitochondria probably can assimilate this gaseous hydrogen right from the environment, turning it into energy. Yeah. But the amount of research... on that has been very thin over the last 50 years.
**CONTEXT:** What is the scientific basis for hydrogen's therapeutic properties, and why has research in this area been limited?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I'm thinking my next newsletter is something to do with energy and serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** What is the topic of Dr. Peat's next newsletter?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, to subscribe, it's at raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com. I'll put that in, you know. Yeah, for emailing information on how to subscribe, it's $28 for two years every other month. That's great. $20 for two years. You can't email. That's right. Ray Peats newsletter at gmail.com.
**CONTEXT:** How can one subscribe to Dr. Peat's newsletter?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there were studies in the Pacific Islanders. They found that they were eating nothing but potatoes for... 50 or 51 weeks of the year and then at the end of the year they had a festival where they would eat pork But they were very healthy Well muscled people 50 weeks of the year pure potato diet, so they did experiments and found that potatoes By analysis. They seem to have a very low protein content, but with animal feeding experiments they the protein turned out to be higher quality in terms of biological effect higher quality than egg yolk protein which was defined as the perfect protein so what was happening was that in the juice there are amino acid, keto acid versions of the essential amino acids not protein, not even amino acids, but a ketone equivalent. As soon as the body absorbs it, any ammonia that's available can be attached to this keto acid, turning it into an essential amino acid. And so what was invisible to chemical analysis suddenly in the body functions, making it a higher quality protein than a perfect protein, just because the... they weren't able to measure what was present. And he's asking about the vitamin C content of potatoes? Yeah, these people who ate a pure potato diet had no vitamin deficiencies at all. Interesting. It isn't just vitamin C, but everything except vitamin B12 and they're low in iron 2 and vitamin A. That actual animal form of vitamin A is not there, but other than that they're a good source of the B vitamins and most of the minerals. Very interesting.
**CONTEXT:** What is the protein and vitamin content of potatoes, and why is their protein quality considered superior to egg yolk?

**RAY PEAT:** They vary quite a bit in composition. Sweet potatoes often have keratin that makes it harder to digest, interferes with the enzymes. And the others, some potatoes are very watery, some very starchy, but if it tastes good basically it's going to have some of that high quality protein value.
**CONTEXT:** How do different types of potatoes vary in composition, and what makes them digestible?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the next best thing to milk as a source of calcium, milk and cheese, and then eggshell, and then the next would be oyster shell. It's calcium carbonate in a very pure form, and if it isn't finely ground, it is irritating to some people's stomachs, so you have to watch out for your reaction. In milk drinkers, there's no harm in getting thousands of milligrams of calcium per day. With eggshell, if you had 5,000 milligrams of it, 5 grams would be a pretty massive chunk of eggshell to have going through your intestine. It would be irritating. The effect on your digestion is the main thing because if you absorb it, then it's going to have an anti-inflammatory effect.
**CONTEXT:** What are the best sources of calcium, and what are the considerations for taking eggshell calcium powder?

**RAY PEAT:** The anti-stress hormones, all are helpful, but one of the crucial things, you've probably heard the connection between hair loss and heart disease, there is an association and that's because of the stress hormones and one of the basic......stress producers is the parathyroid hormone interacting with the bones and the mitochondria and it happens that the high parathyroid hormone is very destructive to the hair follicle and so lowering the parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and calcium in the diet is......probably the single most protective thing that can be done both for heart disease and the hair follicle because that will help to restore your thyroid function which helps to restore progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA and so on, lowers the stress.
**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between hair loss, heart disease, and parathyroid hormone, and how can vitamin D and calcium help?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when I was teaching nutrition, I had my students think of the simplest foods that you could get all of the nutrients from and eggs and orange juice they found that you could get all of your essential nutrients just from those in the right quantities. And with milk, eggs and orange juice and assorted other things, it's very easy to get all of your required vitamins in more than required events.
**CONTEXT:** What are the simplest foods from which one can obtain all essential nutrients?

**RAY PEAT:** The stress hormones will cause testosterone to be turned to estrogen very quickly. And that's why testosterone declines with aging as estrogen rises. And getting the stress hormones down, progesterone and pregnenolone, are the two main things for stopping the formation of estrogen from... testosterone. So, a large dose of progesterone will have an anti-androgen effect. If you take like 100 milligrams, you can notice a temporary neutralizing of testosterone. But at small doses, its only effect is to free up the natural functions of testosterone by blocking the stress conversion to estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones affect the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and what is the role of progesterone and pregnenolone in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've taken 100 milligrams. Twice I did that for a migraine headache and the headache stopped within one or two minutes. But the following day I didn't have any whisker growth. Yeah, that's funny. So your testosterone wasn't happy. Yeah. Yeah, just totally new to us. But I guess on that company you mentioned they probably dose it out pretty cleanly and tell you what to take. No. You can't overdose if you use it only on your skin. Right. And so this is a cream, this Kinogen thing? An oil. It's an oil. Cool. You can't overdose if you do it on there. Yeah. But not orally. You can overdose orally. I see.
**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of high-dose progesterone on migraines and testosterone, and what are the safety considerations for topical versus oral administration?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, these people who ate a pure potato diet had no vitamin deficiencies at all. Interesting. It isn't just vitamin C, but everything except vitamin B12 and they're low in iron 2 and vitamin A. That actual animal form of vitamin A is not there, but other than that they're a good source of the B vitamins and most of the minerals. Very interesting.
**CONTEXT:** What vitamin deficiencies are avoided by a pure potato diet, and what nutrients are potatoes lacking?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, slow digestion, and when you have bacteria living where they shouldn't, they should stay in the colon, but when your digestion is poor... and slow, they can move up. A very hypothyroid person sometimes has bacteria and yeast living in the stomach. You've heard of the stomach cancer and ulcers caused by bacteria living there. Sometimes various microorganisms can occupy the upper parts of the intestine, and when you have bacteria in the small intestine, they will eat... anything that they contact. So sugar, which should be absorbed very quickly in your stomach and very early part of the upper intestine, the bacteria can get to it before you can absorb it. So sugar can very quickly produce gas. Ordinarily, the slower digesting vegetables with starches that are intertwined. With fibrous cellulose type material, lignans, those are the things that normally cause bloating and feed bacteria in the lower small intestine. Beans, even in the colon, the fibrous material in beans very commonly will cause gas, but other vegetables if your digestion is slow. So the first thing is to accelerate. The transit of your food and thyroid is the main thing behind that energetic quality of the intestine. So you're talking about this whole SIBO thing that people talk a lot about, this small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
**CONTEXT:** What causes bloating, and how does thyroid function relate to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, since I was a little kid, they would put a drop on a sugar cube, for example. Oh, so you know about that, yeah. I always loved painting with turpentine as the solvent. I like the smell of it. And I think it's basically harmless. If you look at the internet, you'll see thousands of... Sure, we're done shows on, yeah. It's harmless, yeah. Yeah, you can... become very allergic to it. And so you'll know if you're allergic to it. And it's the same with the citrus thinners that they're selling to replace turpentine. They can become extremely allergenic, especially if they're aged. And if you're hearing this for the first time, you want to make sure that you're using like pure gum spirits of turpentine and not the, you know, just an old can off of Home Depot. Just get the real deal. And we have one in our store that's just pine trees. That's all they do. They just zap and cook it. Yeah. Some of the companies are selling stuff in their old, pure gum spirits, pine turpentine cans. And it turns out to be gasoline. Oh my goodness, selling it for $25 a gallon instead of $3 and a half. Be careful. I would do the Diamond G Forest products. You can go on Amazon or I think we have it on our store still. Diamond G Forest products. We've talked to those people. They just tap a pine tree. They take out the sap and they cook it. That's all they do. That's it. Pretty cool.
**CONTEXT:** What is the safety and efficacy of using turpentine for health, and what are the considerations for sourcing pure turpentine?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Milk, for example, is a good source of iodine, because the cows won't give milk if they're iodine deficient. Chickens will stop laying eggs if they're iodine deficient, so milk and eggs are guaranteed sources of iodine. And seafood, any kind of ocean fish, oysters, crab, cod, whatever, is going to provide enough iodine, along with the associated selenium, which is an essential nutrient for thyroid function. Can we get enough selenium with Brazil nuts and other foods? Yeah, those are fine. Good.
**CONTEXT:** What are good dietary sources of iodine and selenium, and are Brazil nuts sufficient for selenium intake?

**RAY PEAT:** Some digestive aids like pancreatic enzymes can be extremely helpful. But you want to watch that they aren't made from just a fungus. If they're including a lot of strange enzymes, they're probably from a fungus. They can contain allergens, so you want to be cautious. Some people can have very intense reactions to them.
**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations when choosing digestive enzyme supplements, particularly regarding their source and potential allergens?

**RAY PEAT:** Not really. There were experiments with the pancreatic enzymes and stomach acid in a test tube. They found that they were extremely slow when they mixed up a protein with acid and the pancreatic proteinases. But when they added, they took a piece of intestine, fixed it with formaldehyde, so it was totally dead, but dropped this fuzzy piece of intestine lining....into the solution of acid, enzyme, and protein, and suddenly the reaction went at top rate. It's because the enzymes in a free solution don't contact the proteins that they're supposed to digest, but if they're laid out in the proper arrangement on the fuzzy lining of the intestine, they... that's where the... any substrate protein tends to fall against this flat surface, be bound, adsorbed to the surface, and then you get instantaneous protein digestion. So, it doesn't... a baby, for example, in the very first few months, does assimilate protein. From the liquid phase, but with maturation, the lining of the intestine becomes at least 90% of the digestive activity for proteins.
**CONTEXT:** Why is protein digestion so much more efficient within the intestine compared to a test tube, and what is the role of the intestinal lining in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** The kind that I designed and have been using for about 50 years was Progest-E. For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov What's the source of that? Is it the yam stuff? It can vary. I don't know what the company, it's an American company that makes the actual progesterone, but I don't think it matters at all what the original material was because there are about 20 chemical reactions in between the yam and the progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended source of progesterone, and what is the significance of the starting material (e.g., yam)?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the stress hormones will cause testosterone to be turned to estrogen very quickly. And that's why testosterone declines with aging as estrogen rises. And getting the stress hormones down, progesterone and pregnenolone, are the two main things for stopping the formation of estrogen from... testosterone.

That actual animal form of vitamin A is not there, but other than that they're a good source of the B vitamins and most of the minerals. Very interesting.

**CONTEXT:** What vitamin deficiencies are avoided by a pure potato diet, and what nutrients are potatoes lacking?

**RAY PEAT:** They vary quite a bit in composition. Sweet potatoes often have keratin that makes it harder to digest, interferes with the enzymes. And the others, some potatoes are very watery, some very starchy, but if it tastes good basically it's going to have some of that high quality protein value.
**CONTEXT:** How do different types of potatoes vary in composition, and what makes them digestible?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the next best thing to milk as a source of calcium, milk and cheese, and then eggshell, and then the next would be oyster shell. It's calcium carbonate in a very pure form, and if it isn't finely ground, it is irritating to some people's stomachs, so you have to watch out for your reaction. In milk drinkers, there's no harm in getting thousands of milligrams of calcium per day. With eggshell, if you had 5,000 milligrams of it, 5 grams would be a pretty massive chunk of eggshell to have going through your intestine. It would be irritating. The effect on your digestion is the main thing because if you absorb it, then it's going to have an anti-inflammatory effect.
**CONTEXT:** What are the best sources of calcium, and what are the considerations for taking eggshell calcium powder?

**RAY PEAT:** The anti-stress hormones, all are helpful, but one of the crucial things, you've probably heard the connection between hair loss and heart disease, there is an association and that's because of the stress hormones and one of the basic......stress producers is the parathyroid hormone interacting with the bones and the mitochondria and it happens that the high parathyroid hormone is very destructive to the hair follicle and so lowering the parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and calcium in the diet is......probably the single most protective thing that can be done both for heart disease and the hair follicle because that will help to restore your thyroid function which helps to restore progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA and so on, lowers the stress.
**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between hair loss, heart disease, and parathyroid hormone, and how can vitamin D and calcium help?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when I was teaching nutrition, I had my students think of the simplest foods that you could get all of the nutrients from and eggs and orange juice they found that you could get all of your essential nutrients just from those in the right quantities. And with milk, eggs and orange juice and assorted other things, it's very easy to get all of your required vitamins in more than required events.
**CONTEXT:** What are the simplest foods from which one can obtain all essential nutrients?

**RAY PEAT:** The stress hormones will cause testosterone to be turned to estrogen very quickly. And that's why testosterone declines with aging as estrogen rises. And getting the stress hormones down, progesterone and pregnenolone, are the two main things for stopping the formation of estrogen from... testosterone. So, a large dose of progesterone will have an anti-androgen effect. If you take like 100 milligrams, you can notice a temporary neutralizing of testosterone. But at small doses, its only effect is to free up the natural functions of testosterone by blocking the stress conversion to estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones affect the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and what is the role of progesterone and pregnenolone in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've taken 100 milligrams. Twice I did that for a migraine headache and the headache stopped within one or two minutes. But the following day I didn't have any whisker growth. Yeah, that's funny. So your testosterone wasn't happy. Yeah. Yeah, just totally new to us. But I guess on that company you mentioned they probably dose it out pretty cleanly and tell you what to take. No. You can't overdose if you use it only on your skin. Right. And so this is a cream, this Kinogen thing? An oil. It's an oil. Cool. You can't overdose if you do it on there. Yeah. But not orally. You can overdose orally. I see.

And with milk, eggs and orange juice and assorted other things, it's very easy to get all of your required vitamins in more than required events.
**CONTEXT:** What are the simplest foods from which one can obtain all essential nutrients?

**RAY PEAT:** The stress hormones will cause testosterone to be turned to estrogen very quickly. And that's why testosterone declines with aging as estrogen rises. And getting the stress hormones down, progesterone and pregnenolone, are the two main things for stopping the formation of estrogen from... testosterone. So, a large dose of progesterone will have an anti-androgen effect. If you take like 100 milligrams, you can notice a temporary neutralizing of testosterone. But at small doses, its only effect is to free up the natural functions of testosterone by blocking the stress conversion to estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones affect the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and what is the role of progesterone and pregnenolone in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've taken 100 milligrams. Twice I did that for a migraine headache and the headache stopped within one or two minutes. But the following day I didn't have any whisker growth. Yeah, that's funny. So your testosterone wasn't happy. Yeah. Yeah, just totally new to us. But I guess on that company you mentioned they probably dose it out pretty cleanly and tell you what to take. No. You can't overdose if you use it only on your skin. Right. And so this is a cream, this Kinogen thing? An oil. It's an oil. Cool. You can't overdose if you do it on there. Yeah. But not orally. You can overdose orally. I see.
**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of high-dose progesterone on migraines and testosterone, and what are the safety considerations for topical versus oral administration?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people who ate a pure potato diet had no vitamin deficiencies at all. Interesting. It isn't just vitamin C, but everything except vitamin B12 and they're low in iron 2 and vitamin A. That actual animal form of vitamin A is not there, but other than that they're a good source of the B vitamins and most of the minerals. Very interesting.
**CONTEXT:** What vitamin deficiencies are avoided by a pure potato diet, and what nutrients are potatoes lacking?

**RAY PEAT:** They vary quite a bit in composition. Sweet potatoes often have keratin that makes it harder to digest, interferes with the enzymes. And the others, some potatoes are very watery, some very starchy, but if it tastes good basically it's going to have some of that high quality protein value.
**CONTEXT:** How do different types of potatoes vary in composition, and what makes them digestible?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the next best thing to milk as a source of calcium, milk and cheese, and then eggshell, and then the next would be oyster shell. It's calcium carbonate in a very pure form, and if it isn't finely ground, it is irritating to some people's stomachs, so you have to watch out for your reaction. In milk drinkers, there's no harm in getting thousands of milligrams of calcium per day. With eggshell, if you had 5,000 milligrams of it, 5 grams would be a pretty massive chunk of eggshell to have going through your intestine. It would be irritating. The effect on your digestion is the main thing because if you absorb it, then it's going to have an anti-inflammatory effect.

**RAY PEAT:** The anti-stress hormones, all are helpful, but one of the crucial things, you've probably heard the connection between hair loss and heart disease, there is an association and that's because of the stress hormones and one of the basic......stress producers is the parathyroid hormone interacting with the bones and the mitochondria and it happens that the high parathyroid hormone is very destructive to the hair follicle and so lowering the parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and calcium in the diet is......probably the single most protective thing that can be done both for heart disease and the hair follicle because that will help to restore your thyroid function which helps to restore progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA and so on, lowers the stress.

It's calcium carbonate in a very pure form, and if it isn't finely ground, it is irritating to some people's stomachs, so you have to watch out for your reaction. In milk drinkers, there's no harm in getting thousands of milligrams of calcium per day. With eggshell, if you had 5,000 milligrams of it, 5 grams would be a pretty massive chunk of eggshell to have going through your intestine. It would be irritating. The effect on your digestion is the main thing because if you absorb it, then it's going to have an anti-inflammatory effect.
**CONTEXT:** What are the best sources of calcium, and what are the considerations for taking eggshell calcium powder?

**RAY PEAT:** The anti-stress hormones, all are helpful, but one of the crucial things, you've probably heard the connection between hair loss and heart disease, there is an association and that's because of the stress hormones and one of the basic......stress producers is the parathyroid hormone interacting with the bones and the mitochondria and it happens that the high parathyroid hormone is very destructive to the hair follicle and so lowering the parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and calcium in the diet is......probably the single most protective thing that can be done both for heart disease and the hair follicle because that will help to restore your thyroid function which helps to restore progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA and so on, lowers the stress.
**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between hair loss, heart disease, and parathyroid hormone, and how can vitamin D and calcium help?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when I was teaching nutrition, I had my students think of the simplest foods that you could get all of the nutrients from and eggs and orange juice they found that you could get all of your essential nutrients just from those in the right quantities. And with milk, eggs and orange juice and assorted other things, it's very easy to get all of your required vitamins in more than required events.
**CONTEXT:** What are the simplest foods from which one can obtain all essential nutrients?

**RAY PEAT:** The stress hormones will cause testosterone to be turned to estrogen very quickly. And that's why testosterone declines with aging as estrogen rises. And getting the stress hormones down, progesterone and pregnenolone, are the two main things for stopping the formation of estrogen from... testosterone. So, a large dose of progesterone will have an anti-androgen effect. If you take like 100 milligrams, you can notice a temporary neutralizing of testosterone. But at small doses, its only effect is to free up the natural functions of testosterone by blocking the stress conversion to estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones affect the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and what is the role of progesterone and pregnenolone in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've taken 100 milligrams. Twice I did that for a migraine headache and the headache stopped within one or two minutes. But the following day I didn't have any whisker growth. Yeah, that's funny. So your testosterone wasn't happy. Yeah. Yeah, just totally new to us. But I guess on that company you mentioned they probably dose it out pretty cleanly and tell you what to take. No. You can't overdose if you use it only on your skin. Right. And so this is a cream, this Kinogen thing? An oil. It's an oil. Cool. You can't overdose if you do it on there. Yeah. But not orally. You can overdose orally. I see.
**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of high-dose progesterone on migraines and testosterone, and what are the safety considerations for topical versus oral administration?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people who ate a pure potato diet had no vitamin deficiencies at all. Interesting. It isn't just vitamin C, but everything except vitamin B12 and they're low in iron 2 and vitamin A. That actual animal form of vitamin A is not there, but other than that they're a good source of the B vitamins and most of the minerals. Very interesting.
**CONTEXT:** What vitamin deficiencies are avoided by a pure potato diet, and what nutrients are potatoes lacking?

**RAY PEAT:** They vary quite a bit in composition. Sweet potatoes often have keratin that makes it harder to digest, interferes with the enzymes.

But I guess on that company you mentioned they probably dose it out pretty cleanly and tell you what to take. No. You can't overdose if you use it only on your skin. Right. And so this is a cream, this Kinogen thing? An oil. It's an oil. Cool. You can't overdose if you do it on there. Yeah. But not orally. You can overdose orally. I see.
**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of high-dose progesterone on migraines and testosterone, and what are the safety considerations for topical versus oral administration?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people who ate a pure potato diet had no vitamin deficiencies at all. Interesting. It isn't just vitamin C, but everything except vitamin B12 and they're low in iron 2 and vitamin A. That actual animal form of vitamin A is not there, but other than that they're a good source of the B vitamins and most of the minerals. Very interesting.
**CONTEXT:** What vitamin deficiencies are avoided by a pure potato diet, and what nutrients are potatoes lacking?

**RAY PEAT:** They vary quite a bit in composition. Sweet potatoes often have keratin that makes it harder to digest, interferes with the enzymes. And the others, some potatoes are very watery, some very starchy, but if it tastes good basically it's going to have some of that high quality protein value.
**CONTEXT:** How do different types of potatoes vary in composition, and what makes them digestible?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the next best thing to milk as a source of calcium, milk and cheese, and then eggshell, and then the next would be oyster shell. It's calcium carbonate in a very pure form, and if it isn't finely ground, it is irritating to some people's stomachs, so you have to watch out for your reaction. In milk drinkers, there's no harm in getting thousands of milligrams of calcium per day. With eggshell, if you had 5,000 milligrams of it, 5 grams would be a pretty massive chunk of eggshell to have going through your intestine. It would be irritating. The effect on your digestion is the main thing because if you absorb it, then it's going to have an anti-inflammatory effect.
**CONTEXT:** What are the best sources of calcium, and what are the considerations for taking eggshell calcium powder?

**RAY PEAT:** The anti-stress hormones, all are helpful, but one of the crucial things, you've probably heard the connection between hair loss and heart disease, there is an association and that's because of the stress hormones and one of the basic......stress producers is the parathyroid hormone interacting with the bones and the mitochondria and it happens that the high parathyroid hormone is very destructive to the hair follicle and so lowering the parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and calcium in the diet is......probably the single most protective thing that can be done both for heart disease and the hair follicle because that will help to restore your thyroid function which helps to restore progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA and so on, lowers the stress.
**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between hair loss, heart disease, and parathyroid hormone, and how can vitamin D and calcium help?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when I was teaching nutrition, I had my students think of the simplest foods that you could get all of the nutrients from and eggs and orange juice they found that you could get all of your essential nutrients just from those in the right quantities. And with milk, eggs and orange juice and assorted other things, it's very easy to get all of your required vitamins in more than required events.
**CONTEXT:** What are the simplest foods from which one can obtain all essential nutrients?

**RAY PEAT:** The stress hormones will cause testosterone to be turned to estrogen very quickly. And that's why testosterone declines with aging as estrogen rises. And getting the stress hormones down, progesterone and pregnenolone, are the two main things for stopping the formation of estrogen from... testosterone. So, a large dose of progesterone will have an anti-androgen effect. If you take like 100 milligrams, you can notice a temporary neutralizing of testosterone. But at small doses, its only effect is to free up the natural functions of testosterone by blocking the stress conversion to estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones affect the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and what is the role of progesterone and pregnenolone in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've taken 100 milligrams. Twice I did that for a migraine headache and the headache stopped within one or two minutes. But the following day I didn't have any whisker growth.
