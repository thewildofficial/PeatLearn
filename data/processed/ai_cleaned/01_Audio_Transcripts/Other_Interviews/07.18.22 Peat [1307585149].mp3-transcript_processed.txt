**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and for several years, surgery was the only thing. I think it was a 300-fold increase in prolactin surgeries in just a few years. And it turned out to be the onset of the birth control pill was causing this terrible epidemic of surgeries for the pituitary. And after several years, probably a little over 10 years before, doctors really would consider using a drug such as bromocriptine to change the hormones away from the estrogen prolactin effect. And so it became a more manageable problem when they realized a fairly safe drug could do it. But that was sort of all there was to it. It was swept under the rug that had been a purely iatrogenic problem because of the massive use of esters and treatments for menopause and birth control. But then, yeah. The background of the problem started being discussed. People working in the salmon industry realized that the natural physiology of salmon and other migrating fish involved some radical changes from prolactin and the shifts from high salt intake in the ocean to a very low salt intake, high water intake, turned on the prolactin, which is a water regulator. Yet helping to get rid of excess water, and that's the essence of estrogen poisoning. It causes excess retention and poisoning by water. And so the Simon effect on prolactin is also the estrogen effect. The fish coming in from the ocean aren't really edible for good tasting, safe fish. They're very deteriorated. The flesh becomes mushy and unpleasant. And the bears can thrive on them and so on. But what is happening is if you look at the progress of the salmon going up the river as the meat deteriorates, the salmon is preparing to ovulate and die. And the process of ovulating is part of the process of keeping adapted to this excess of bone water. And the process that keeps the fish from dying from water shock, the progesterone, the prolactin is fighting off the high water pressure, but at the extent of destroying the bones. And this involves the parathyrodormons, as well as the whole estrogen reproductive system. And the... That is to cause kyphosis, which is the bending of the spine. The salmon doesn't have to hold itself in an erect posture the way old people do. But they call it kyphosis, whether it's either in salmon or in old women. The upper part of the spine turns sharply forward. In the case of women, they talk about it as if it's gravity pulling you forward, causing your spine to bend into a hook shape as you form osteoporosis. But in salmon, the salmon floats at both ends, and so there's nothing causing gravity. In fact, it's nothing but the destruction of the skeleton, the parathyroid hormone, loss of calcium, and force of the water regality minerals. So the sudden onset of death and prolactinoma and the whole aging syndrome in salmon exactly corresponds to the aging effect associated with estrogen and osteoporosis."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the connection between salmon, aging, and fatty liver.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, exactly. Which is why you don't want to eat salmon every day or anything. You don't want to eat salmon every day then. Oh no, I stopped eating it all together when I learned about the high PUFA content and the association with high estrogen prolactin."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the high omega-3s in salmon and their connection to early aging and fatty liver.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ancel Keys, do you know of him? What was his story? He seemed to be an honest but misinformed biologist."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Ancel Keys and if he spread misinformation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, he was just inclined in the wrong direction by propaganda, which practically everyone is in biology. A project of mine for the last few weeks has been to, in doing my searches, in effect ask people alternate forms of the different question. But the seemingly innocent intent of finding out what people believe is the cause of aging and which things cause better oxidation and which things cause worse oxidation. And I found that if the PubMed was an individual, but I've also done it with individuals, to in effect lead the PubMed or the person to lead them to say something. That seems obvious and intuitive to them, but if I innocently seem to change the way I ask a question, what is the factor that causes the aging, you can lead people very easily, even close. That seems to be the objective database. You can lead PubMed responses to be predominantly incriminating fat in aging or predominantly incriminating sugars and carbohydrates in aging. It just depends where the motives or the preconceived notion of the person doing this. Yeah, I did the same thing for the oxidation in general as well as for aging. And you can lead what seems to be the objective result of looking at hundreds and hundreds of responses when you get a very high proportion shifting your responses. What is the cause of age-oxidated deterioration? You can say it's caused by fat or by carbohydrates, and it all comes right out of the same database. So if you look at it without suspicion, just because you innocently were focused for some reason on fat-eating or sugary, it can lead you innocently to 180 degrees."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Ancel Keys and his influence on dietary beliefs, and Dr. Peat explains how research can be biased by the framing of questions.

**RAY PEAT:** "There has been a change in the time drift of answers, so when you see the change over time, it's gotten more from blaming things on sugars to more blaming them on oxygen. That can give you the opinion that it's objective and historical. But when I looked at just the issue of immunity. What are the things that cause immune system failure or activation? The same thing happened. In the 1990s, with a series of absolute-looking articles, and especially Science Magazine, the very top-prestige magazines were blaming the immunological changes in insulin. And roundworms had been identified as causing aging by mutating their quality of their diabetes molecules. They were producing too much, too active insulin. And so insulin, back in 1998 to 2000, the great stress was suddenly discovering that high insulin or high glucose would cause rapid aging, premature death. But then, just in 20 years, the different way of asking questions, is diabetes the cause or is it preventive? And it turns out that now the failure of good glucose function, good insulin response, is the essential, not the objective, but the preferred apparently objective answer."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the shift in scientific focus from sugars to other factors in aging and immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, and the culture, the simple advertising, publications in medical journal, on television, huge influence of television on what to expect from the pituitary tumors or carbohydrate. Yeah. Or not enough insulin or too much insulin."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the reliability of studies based on people filling out forms and the influence of external factors.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, it means your insulin is working and providing ATP for your cells. The drift of thinking now is very well objectively supported to show that it's the ATP provided to the tissues that prevents aging. ATP to the tissues. And what provides ATP more directly to the tissues than glucose? And so, glucose, ATP, anti-aging......is now very clearly a matter of simple availability of energy. Energy has always been the life factor. And that has slipped by people."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a lower fasting blood sugar is preferable.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, when you're failing to make good insulin, or you're producing or eating too much fat, the fat is blocking your insulin. Then you have accelerated aging, so it can be genetic distortion of the insulin, or it can be just too much fat in the diet. Too much fat. Causing insulin resistance. And I was... The insulin is resisting because? Your insulin is resisting getting into the cells? Yeah, they each are blocking the ability of the cell to oxidize glucose directly to get at the ATP."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how insulin and blood sugar levels relate to ATP production and aging, and Dr. Peat explains the role of fat in blocking insulin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, just layers and layers of that kind of effect. Layers and layers. So, what's Prufu doing? Well, it's activating estrogen effects, serotonin effects, lowering body temperature, interfering with thyroid function. All of the above. Mm-hmm. And more. All the different enzymes that you could involve."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if PUFA inhibits thyroid hormone by lowering body temperature or directly inhibiting thyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "That involves calcification, as well as fats, not just pure cholesterol. In tissues like that, the cholesterol is partly a protective attempt to defend the system. It's very clear that the first reactions of cholesterol are to combine with the toxic effect of the PUFA that's already taking effect. When it fails to be sufficiently anti-toxic, then it gets the blame. The age-pigment development of the lipophagous accumulated PUFA causes a problem. The senile brain has much more total cholesterol. than the healthy young brain. A situation very close to the senile artery, the detoxifying effect of the binding of cholesterol to the ape's pigment. As that fails, you get more cholesterol in your blood vessels. As it fails to protect your brain, your brain gets close to twice as much accumulated total......progesterone at the non-senile young brain. But the amount of free, protective, interactive insulin, which is in the process of removing the toxic pigment as the senile brain loads up on more total cholesterol, the amount of functional free cholesterol decreases radically. So a sentinel brain full of cholesterol is really a way of talking about a brain whose detoxifying system has failed tremendously to the point that it has accumulated undermining quantities of polyunsaturated fat, and in the process has knocked out the protecting function of the cholesterol."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Arcus Sinilis (cholesterol rings) and why they develop in young people.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's possibly doing something good by blocking apparently good functions. The basic mechanism is blocking what you would think is a protective pedestrian use, but still the effect is to protect against PUFA just as much as against cholesterol. So that's the anti-aging potential benefits protecting against PUFAs? Yeah, by wasting cholesterol it seems to also take down cholesterol."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's opinion on metformin as an anti-aging drug.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, but everything about metformin seems sort of surprising and perverse because it's one of the original anti-diabetic drugs that always impaired the mitochondria. It ended up increasing lactic acid and killing people more than protecting them. I found one of these things, one of these diabetes drugs that turned out not to be more deadly than the disease, and so although it does occasionally, sometimes it's very dangerously our cause, lactic acid edema. The average benefit seems to be good."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if we necessarily need to lower cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the thing to pay most attention to are the statistical effects, how often is which thing beneficial. And in many people a low-carb diet leads to depressed metabolism. Depressed metabolism? Yeah, lower thyroid function. I think."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how people on low-carb diets and fasting can live long, healthy lives, citing Dr. Wolfgang Lutz.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it should be a matter of symptom relief, everything else being similar. If you can control the diarrhea and constipation, the total effects of progesterone is going to be anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic, but if the overall effect is causing diarrhea or constipation, you have to take that into account."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions for a person with carcinomic liver cancer and constant diarrhea, and if progesterone is beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. I think it should be a matter of symptom relief, everything else being similar. If you can control the diarrhea and constipation, the total effects of progesterone is going to be anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic, but if the overall effect is causing diarrhea or constipation, you have to take that into account. So what are some other things she could do for this, this liver cancer? Any ideas? Oh, have you heard about the several studies in China in which they were using, well, two different drugs, but cipro-hepsidine. Oh, cipro-hepsidine, I know that one. Yeah, cause in just two or three weeks, they cause an end to metastatic liver cancer. Really, cipro-hepidine, didn't you tell me about that years ago? I thought you, I think I even have some for histamine, is that the same thing? The lower histamine levels? Both anti-histamines and anti-serotonin. Wow. The drugs are protective against cancer in general, but this, just two or three or four weeks and metastatic, several cases cleared up right away. No kidding. Wow, that's interesting. They're doing that mainly in the orient, using that in the orient? Yeah. Other surprising systemic results come from using other anti-inflammatories, such as local anesthetics, lidocaine, for example. So it's an inflammatory thing, this cancer. Yeah. Yeah."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for further suggestions for liver cancer and mentions ciproheptadine.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think progesterone is the most basic anti-cancer agent for progesterone-related cancers. Originally, everyone wanted to find the progesterone receptor, what is really causing the action of progesterone. But they couldn't find that in most tissues, or they couldn't identify what it might really be doing. Well, maybe they stopped. Assuming there should be specific progesterone receptors for every function because empirically they saw that progesterone had general functions that always seem to be in the same line. Always protective, always anti-inflammatory. And finally it occurred to someone, maybe they're looking for the wrong thing in the case of progesterone. How can it have two or three different receptors supposedly having different actions if they're all going to act in the same direction? And so when they stopped looking for a specific pair of actions that never showed up, they saw that there was a......generalized action, without exception, cells became responsive to progesterone, so they had been creating an illusion that there was this mysterious, why did both kinds of progesterone function. Why did they have such similar actions? It turns out that when you look for it, it's the mitochondrial... Uh, melanin. Uh, sensitive, uh, so-called progesterone receptor, uh, but it's really, uh, the, uh, energy for producing property of the, uh, mitochondrial substance. The mitochondrial progesterone receptor is, in effect, the mitochondrion function itself. The mitochondrial progesterone receptor is, in effect, the mitochondrial progesterone receptor."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about progesterone's role in cancer and its mechanism of action.

**RAY PEAT:** "So, all of the anti-inflammatory things, especially the antihistamines, anti-serotonin drugs, the vitamin D as a general anti-inflammatory, pro-energy, progesterone and thyroid to get your energy back up and working. So, she has to get her metabolism and everything back up and working after that."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for strategies for a woman recovering from Lyme disease with chronic pain.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there's a constant opposition between the availability of energy as ATP derived from glucose and all of the anti-inflammatory constructive functions. So it's energy versus inflammation."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between energy and inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ciproheptadine, yeah, that's the one, ciproheptadine. So do you take that sometimes? You can tell when you don't take it? Oh, sure. The irritation, the tendency to cough is just tremendous. But it's the surest way to stop background inflammation. Background inflammation, ciproheptadine."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the antihistamine ciproheptadine and its effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, thyroid hormone can sometimes bring back your balance between estrogens and the anti-analympic thyroid. But keeping in mind all of the inflammatory things is important."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if thyroid hormone can help with metastasized cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oxalates? No, they can contribute to our kidney stones. Uh-oh. No, I don't think it has much effect. You're going to get them either way, huh? Mm-hmm. Do you think the oxalates in a baked potato are worth avoiding baked potatoes? No, I think it takes a diet fairly high and consistent to see any effects. Oh, so you'd have to eat a whole bunch of them. To have some oxalate issues, you say? Yeah, the sort of astringent leaves and potatoes are, in total I think so. Yeah. Yeah, I think one of the high ones, what, um, highest ones in oxalates, I used to know, chard, chard's really high, and spinach, right, still? Oh, yeah, but, uh, occasional. Uh, chard, chard is so tasty. Yeah. It's pretty good, yeah."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if milk or butter helps lower oxalate intake with potatoes and black tea.

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on the balance between vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcium and magnesium. But really it should be at least a thousand milligrams. Generally about a thousand, and that's pretty easy to get with food, right? Yeah, milk and cheese and some vegetables."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for the minimum milligrams of calcium needed to prevent osteoporosis in sedentary people in their 70s and 80s.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, Simoncini really had some effects, but his silly talk about that showing that cancer was a fungus just didn't make sense. In fact, there's a very powerful, very widespread effect of both carbon dioxide and baking soda on suppressing cancer development. Carbon dioxide too."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about using baking soda for cancer and its dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I've done it twice in the last two days. Oh, been doing it more often. I'm going to try it. I'll let you know."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat has recently used carbon dioxide baths.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's an analogous process to endotoxin poisoning and estrogen. Glyphosate is a watery disruptor of the anti-estrogen, anti-endotoxin processes. She's often talked about, too, how it really tangles up the whole sulfur cycle as well, which inhibits people to get toxins out of the body."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about solutions for heavy metal and glyphosate toxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, well, MDs invented the problem many years ago. Levothyroxine is simply not the thyroid hormone. It's a drug alternative that doctors unthinkingly are kind of forced to prescribe. They can actually lose their license if they question the appropriateness of Levothyroxine or even the propriety of... of questioning the proper level of TSH. Libosyroxine is pretty good at lowering TSH, but it doesn't necessarily have all of the thyroid, anti-thyroid or thyroid defects. So you can lower your TSH with it and get some benefit, but just lowering the TSH might not be enough to get the benefits. Because you actually need the ability to convert. The T4 levothyroxine to convert it into the active T3 as well as to lower the TSH. So she might be on the right track with low inner dosage of the levothyroxine. You really should look at, every time you have a test, you should check to see that your TSH is appropriate for the level of levothyroxine."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an explanation of a person's positive results from a thyroid support supplement while reducing Levothyroxine dosage for Hashimoto's.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, it could be that they would run into good advice in the hospital."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for advice for a recovering alcoholic with heart and liver issues and a colostomy bag.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the dog killed a squirrel. And that's when all this started. I don't know how that would work, but... I should check, if he had a change in bowel function, he might have been exposed to, uh, microbes. Yeah, yeah, that's what it sounds like, cause he's, this, he says that the dog had this diarrhea once or twice a week, and he wouldn't eat for a while, so, this squirrel was full of something, right, that he just didn't, was not happy. Yeah, I'm not a vet, but to this person, I would say put him on raw meat, I think that's your best choice for a carnivore, dogs, I think, for what it, well, I think that's the best way to go, and he's probably going to find his way out of that one."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an explanation of a dog's illness after killing a squirrel.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it sometimes brings back your balance between estrogens and the anti-analympic thyroid. But keeping in mind all of the inflammatory things is important."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if thyroid hormone can help with metastasized cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the whole pattern leading to serotonin access should be taken care of. More thyroid, more anti-estrogen consideration, pro-progesterone and so on."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for strategies for carcinoid syndrome.
