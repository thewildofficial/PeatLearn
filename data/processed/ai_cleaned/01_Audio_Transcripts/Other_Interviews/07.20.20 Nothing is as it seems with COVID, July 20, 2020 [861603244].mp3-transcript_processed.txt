**RAY PEAT:** During the night we use up almost all of our stored glucose stored as glycogen. That's why almost everyone has very high cortisol in the morning, the stress hormone. And that's because it begins turning our good tissues, everything from the bones to the skin, starts breaking down as dawn approaches because we're using up our stored sugar. And we need sugar to keep the brain alive and the blood cells. So the stress hormones come up near dawn and start breaking down our tissues to feed the brain.

**CONTEXT:** What happens to the body during the night regarding glucose and stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** The biggest group of people, low blood sugar happens around 3 to 4 or 5 a.m. And that starts the intense surge in all of the stress hormones, not just cortisol, but rising serotonin, histamine, parathyroid hormone, everything related to stress and breakdown of tissues. Women starting around menopause start losing almost all of their daily bone loss starts in the early morning hours. And when they start eating sugar and get the blood sugar back up to lower the stress hormones, the rest of the day, they don't lose a significant amount of bone or other tissue.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between low blood sugar in the early morning and stress hormones, and how does this affect bone loss, particularly in women?

**RAY PEAT:** The bone loss is just an easily measured sign that your body is being torn down. It happens to your skin and everything that isn't protected by hormones like testosterone and progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** How does bone loss serve as an indicator of tissue breakdown, and what other tissues are affected?

**RAY PEAT:** You want to get your muscles, liver, and brain well supplied with glucose, glycogen. And so carbohydrate as your late afternoon or early evening meal is very important. And right at bedtime, a big surge of calcium such as a glass of milk helps to hold down the parathyroid hormone, which specializes in bone destruction, mobilizes the calcium and coming out of the bone. The calcium then activates the breakdown of your blood vessels and skin and tends to calcify blood vessels. So the calcium coming out of your bone doesn't just innocently get into the urine, but on the way there, it is exciting, helping to break down and age all of your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary strategies can help mitigate the morning breakdown of tissues due to low blood sugar and stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Nothing is as good as milk because milk is very specialized for stimulating and optimizing the absorption of calcium and magnesium. Not only the lactose but the various proteins in milk prepare the lining of the intestine to very efficiently absorb the calcium and magnesium. You can absorb it if you have orange juice and, for example, either the juice or the cooked leaf of kale, for example, is very rich in calcium and magnesium. So if you have a big serving of cooked kale and a glass of orange juice, that won't be as good as milk or cheese, but it's the next best thing.

**CONTEXT:** What are suitable alternatives to milk for bedtime consumption if someone is dairy or lactose intolerant?

**RAY PEAT:** I think camel and sheep milk are kind of a sick high-end energy and fat. They would work, but you would get fatter than low-fat cow milk. One percent cow milk or reduced-fat goat milk is probably the best source for most people. Because if you're working all day on a farm, for example, it's fine to drink a gallon of whole milk because you're spending so many calories. But even drinking two quarts a day of whole milk, the average sedentary person is going to get fat.

**CONTEXT:** What is the difference in suitability between whole milk and lower-fat milk for different activity levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and if you look at the culture, it's getting fatter and fatter, and milk happens to be the best weight-loss food there is, because the high calcium assimilation from it increases our metabolic rate. The combination of protein and calcium and magnesium is ideal for increasing our ability to burn calories.

**CONTEXT:** How does milk contribute to weight loss and increased metabolic rate?

**RAY PEAT:** The fat has to be adjusted here to activity level. If you're burning 5,000 calories a day, you can handle the fat of something like whole milk. But I found when I was in graduate school that drinking a gallon a day of 2% milk, I was starting to get fat. So I changed to 1% and have stayed the same weight ever since.

**CONTEXT:** How does fat content in milk relate to an individual's activity level and potential for weight gain?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, very well. I usually use a glass of milk with a spoonful of sugar in it, but orange juice is fine. I've even used Coke. When I was traveling and woke up at 3 a.m. and needed sugar, and Coke worked all right.

**CONTEXT:** What are effective remedies for waking up with low blood sugar in the middle of the night?

**RAY PEAT:** Starting in the first week of January of this year, the numbers of weekly deaths, they consistently over the last many years, they've completed their national compilation of deaths throughout the country within two weeks of the reference week. And so, starting in the third week, I was writing down the finished numbers for the first week of the year, and then comparing those numbers to the previous week in 2019. And after I'd done this for two or three months, I noticed that someone on the internet had been doing the same thing, only more thoroughly, going back several decades. What I was seeing was a sharp drop in the weekly mortality, referring to the previous year, a sudden drop of 10 to 15 percent from last fall, and I couldn't find any historical precedent. And this person who has a website, I think his name is Joe Hoft. Anyway, he did it for previous decades and came up with the same results. The mortality peak in last fall started its steep rise, exactly like every preceding year, the winter pneumonia deaths. But then suddenly, around January 1st, there was a crash in the deaths all around the United States. People were dying less often from all causes. And that went on through March. There is this weird, it's like a volcano collapsing and making a crater. A historically unique mortality curve. And then, if you look back at 10 or 15 percent unhistorical lack of deaths, suddenly the first week of April, all of those missing deaths reappear in a gigantic, again, unhistorical peak, which they called the COVID Death Peak. And, basically, there's no way that can happen, even if the Bubonic Plague started up. You just can't get a historical collapse of more total mortality all around the country that way. I think the only way a criminal prosecutor could interpret it would be that someone was fiddling the numbers with foreknowledge that they were going to want a lot of deaths to report. So they trimmed, impossibly, the total mortality to have a big pile of deaths to report in April.

**CONTEXT:** What anomalies were observed in mortality data at the beginning of the year, and what could be the implications of these anomalies?

**RAY PEAT:** The death curve was perfectly normal right through December. And then it was just about the first week of January that, if you plot their own numbers, you see this, it looks like a volcanic crater forming. A piece starts up and then collapses and then comes up super sharp on the other side.

**CONTEXT:** Can you describe the specific pattern observed in the mortality data that suggests manipulation?

**RAY PEAT:** The rise in the daily tests given exactly corresponds to the rise in the daily diagnosed COVID deaths. And you can't really diagnose for sure that someone has the virus unless you do the test. And if the number of diagnosed people rises exactly as the number of tests administered rises, then you have no evidence that anything at all is happening.

**CONTEXT:** How does the correlation between the number of tests administered and diagnosed COVID deaths suggest a lack of evidence for widespread viral activity?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, any virus is likely to be communicable, and if you're in a very particular weakened state, just about any virus can be deadly. Any old cold virus or just the most trivial sort of virus can push a very sick person over the edge. But the PCR test will find even if you have just sitting on your mucus harmlessly, you could have rabies virus or whatever, one of them sitting on a piece of a spare of mucus, the PCR test would find it and say you had rabies. But that virus might never have reached your living tissue.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the PCR test's ability to detect even harmless viral presence, and how does this relate to actual illness?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the antibody, if their antibodies are truly specific for that particular antigen, that's a very different thing from the PCR test. The PCR test will amplify the most trivial amount of viral information, but to form antibodies that are more or less specific to that virus means that your immune system was exposed to it, but it doesn't mean you ever got sick from it.

**CONTEXT:** How does the presence of antibodies differ from a positive PCR test in indicating actual illness?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it means that you've been exposed to it. But you might have had sniffles from it or not even noticed that you had anything, and you can still form antibodies when, like when you eat a new food, you're likely to form antibodies. Your immune system is testing foods that you've eaten and checking them and preparing antibodies so that you will be tolerant to that food. It prepares to block any irritation from that food if your immune system is good. So the antibodies means you're safe from that particular antigen. It's a barrier against any further action by that particular thing.

**CONTEXT:** What does the presence of antibodies signify, and how does the immune system's response to food relate to antibody formation?

**RAY PEAT:** For a time, the CDC was listing the numbers all mixed together. So for weeks, their numbers were totally meaningless because they were blending everything together and saying that these are the numbers of people with COVID, but absolutely different tests mixed together don't mean anything.

**CONTEXT:** Why were the CDC's reported numbers for COVID cases considered meaningless for a period?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it's accurate in the sense that they have a positive result, but it doesn't mean that the people were at all sick, or if they were sick, it doesn't mean that if they died, it might have been a stroke or heart attack or trauma from falling out a window or something. If they had the presence of the virus, they were put down as a COVID death.

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of classifying anyone with a positive test result as a COVID death, regardless of the actual cause of death?

**RAY PEAT:** About two or three months ago, Deborah Birx, who used to appear in all the press conferences with Fauci and Trump, she said the government is listing everyone positive for a COVID test as a COVID test. She expressed what I was just saying, that and she no longer appears in the press conferences every day, right after making that sort of incriminating statement that there's no rational basis for what they're saying.

**CONTEXT:** What statement did Deborah Birx make that suggested a lack of rational basis for COVID-19 reporting?

**RAY PEAT:** The Bulgarian is exactly right about the impossibility of making a vaccine. They've tried to make vaccines for the coronavirus, which is the common cold's main cause, for decades. They've found that the virus mutates within a few months to become resistant to any vaccination. And there's, being an RNA virus, all of these coronaviruses mutate about a hundred times faster than DNA viruses and about a million times faster than mammalian DNA, a very, very fast, constant mutation rate. He's right on the impossibility of a vaccine, but his comment about the specific antibody he's using, the specificity of an antibody in a particular way that isn't correct for general immunology. You can have specificity as a composite of half a dozen different molecules that each one is roughly specific for the virus. So you don't have to have one absolutely specific antibody. He's thinking about the monoclonal specific antibody, but you don't need that kind of specificity to have a vaccine.

**CONTEXT:** Why is it impossible to create a lasting vaccine for coronaviruses, and what is the significance of viral mutation rates?

**RAY PEAT:** How do you prove that death was caused by a virus? In the case of hospital deaths, just recently news came out that the intensive care units have, since the first months of the so-called pandemic, mortality has dropped by 30 percent. What has happened around the country, they've discovered that when they intubate someone, the process of putting the tube in them and giving them powerful drugs to make them unconscious and relax their reflex muscle contractions, those drugs combined with forced respiration kill almost 100% of the people within a few weeks. So they were killing 100% of their patients practically, 80 to 100%, simply by the treatment they were giving them. That came to be realized now simply by reducing the number of intubations for which the government was paying them $48,000 per patient tubed and killed. Simply by reducing their greedy uptake of government money, they've cut intensive care unit mortality by a third.

**CONTEXT:** How did the treatment protocols in intensive care units contribute to high mortality rates during the pandemic, and what led to the reduction in these rates?

**RAY PEAT:** One doctor in Europe compared two nearby hospitals in Germany. He was working with one of them and he explained why the tubing was killing patients because it was irrationally disturbing their oxygen-carbon dioxide balance. So he just adjusted a nasal cannula, no drugs to relax them or stuffing tubes down their trachea. His hospital mortality went to zero while the adjoining hospital continued to have 100% mortality. An absolute all or none difference just by a conservative using standard nasal cannula gas mixing recipes. And he wasn't even recognizing the importance of having the proper balance of carbon dioxide, but still, he was not killing any of his patients.

**CONTEXT:** What was the key difference in treatment between two German hospitals that led to a stark contrast in patient mortality?

**RAY PEAT:** When you artificially ventilate someone, you override their regulating system. And if you slightly exceed the oxygen dose, you drive out the carbon dioxide, which is needed to deliver oxygen to the tissues. And even the open capillaries, you shrink the blood vessels in the brain, for example, and starve the brain for oxygen because you're getting too much oxygen.

**CONTEXT:** How does artificial ventilation, particularly with excessive oxygen, disrupt the body's natural oxygen delivery system?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, and different from using oxygen therapy, but because this is putting it inside the body through unnatural means with a tube. And you can give too much. For example, just the difference in altitude, if a person is having a regulatory problem, even at sea level, keeping their carbon dioxide up because they're forming lactic acid, there's a natural competition between lactic acid and carbon dioxide. A person tends towards stress or diabetes, for example, their background lactic acid will indicate the appearance that they're under chronic exercise or something, residual lactic acid level. And if you add carbon dioxide, that will suppress glycolysis that makes the excess lactic acid, so you can correct those signs of incipient diabetes and stress by adding some carbon dioxide. And if you rise in altitude and are healthy, your body under lower oxygen pressure is able to regulate itself to maintain higher carbon dioxide than at sea level. So adapted people, they've known for at least 50 years, more like 70 years, that they call it the lactic paradox, or the lactic acid paradox, that when you're adapted to high altitude, you can work full force, and you make much less lactic acid than you would doing the same proportion of work at sea level. So the altitude stops your excess lactic acid production because of the retained carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide play a role in regulating lactic acid production, particularly in relation to altitude adaptation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and some of the doctors have, one of the earliest New York City doctors reported that they weren't low in oxygen, especially, but they were low in carbon dioxide. And that lets the lactate rise and the lactic acid, even in the presence of normal amounts of oxygen, the presence of lactic acid, it creates what they call pseudo hypoxia, or reductive stress, which is similar to sepsis and all of the mortality-associated features of COVID. It's all basically a stress syndrome, which is intensified by the treatment and the COVID has a very small role in triggering that in people who actually have a very intense respiratory infection.

**CONTEXT:** How does a deficiency in carbon dioxide lead to increased lactic acid and a state of pseudo-hypoxia, mimicking symptoms of sepsis and COVID-19?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's when you're called fit. That's when you're fit or well-adapted. You're making lots of carbon dioxide because you're really using your oxygen. And using the oxygen without over-breathing.

**CONTEXT:** What does it mean to be "fit" or "well-adapted" in terms of breathing and carbon dioxide production?

**RAY PEAT:** A person who isn't fit produces lactic acid very easily, even with hardly any activity. Their lactic acid begins to rise. Because they're over-breathing, just breathing too much. Yeah, a perfectly healthy person, if they just sit still and pant for two or three minutes, they'll have a surge of lactic acid. Really? Because the carbon dioxide that suppresses it is gone, and they'll produce a poisonous amount of lactic acid, and that will cause edema. You get cramps as an early sign of over-breathing, your hands will drop, and that's an indication of loss of carbon dioxide. And along with that, your capillaries and arterioles start becoming edematous, swelling up and losing the ability to transmit oxygen. So you can potentially kill yourself by intense over-breathing.

**CONTEXT:** How does over-breathing lead to lactic acid buildup, edema, and potential self-harm?

**RAY PEAT:** Not necessarily. A person with a very high fitness, the most intense metabolism, they need lots of fuel and oxygen. They can sit still and productively burn 3,000 maybe 4,000 calories just because their body is running at high perfect metabolism, so they need both lots of calories and lots of oxygen. So you have to look at the body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, everything to know what the respiration rate means.

**CONTEXT:** Why is simply reducing breathing rate not always indicative of good health, and what factors determine the meaning of respiration rate?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think it is necessarily. You have to look at the whole thing. How many calories are you able to burn? How much oxygen can you dispose of in burning those calories? And the most fit person is running at a high rate, even at rest. So they can't get fat on, even if they sit around, just because they're burning calories because they're fit. That's why they stay fitter, just by burning.

**CONTEXT:** What defines a "fit" person in terms of metabolic rate and calorie expenditure, even at rest?

**RAY PEAT:** I was in my 40s, at 48, when I first tested it, and the result was so absolute that I experimented with different amounts and I found that one dose of 300 milligrams would last me for 10 days and then my symptoms came back, or that would work out to 30 milligrams a day. And I found many people, 10 or 20 milligram dose. I had two or three experiences of two extremely depressed men, for example, that they happened to be sipping a glass of wine and being very gloomy and talking about giving up their profession. I dropped 10 or 20 milligrams on their wine, and when they had consumed that, their face got red hot, pink instead of gray, they started grinning and making plans for improvements in their business. Just in 15 minutes, you could see a change from that very, very small amount of pregnenolone.

**CONTEXT:** What are the effective dosages of pregnenolone, and what are the observed effects at these dosages?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so it acts as a catalyst and can get your own production going. For an experiment, I took 3,000 milligrams a day for a year and felt fine, but it was very expensive and wasteful. So then I found that I didn't need any because it had repaired my system. And animal studies are similar. They gave rats a stomach full, I think it was a 10 gram wad, which would be like about a pound for a person to eat at once, and it didn't have any hormonal effects at all unless they were under stress to begin with, and it normalized, prevented excess cortisol production. So that's why some people recommend even for guys to have a little dab of this pregnenolone, this natural stuff, every day.

**CONTEXT:** What are the long-term effects of high-dose pregnenolone, and what do animal studies suggest about its safety and efficacy?

**RAY PEAT:** Lots of people have been reporting hormonal reactions from it. That means it isn't good pregnenolone. There should be absolutely no so-called hormonal effect. It should simply normalize things, lowering your ACTH and cortisol if they're too high, bringing them up if they're too low. So you shouldn't feel anything. And maybe just feel a little bit better or a little. Yeah, yeah, there should be. If you're feeling depressed or weak or something, if it's what you need, and often it is when you're in your 40s, the effect happens in less than an hour and is a day or night sort of change.

**CONTEXT:** What indicates that a pregnenolone supplement is of poor quality, and what are the expected effects of high-quality pregnenolone?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it doesn't matter where it's made from as long as it's made by someone that knows what they're doing. But in the last 15 years or so, it has become popular. And there are dozens of little chemical companies popping up. And there are no regulations. It's not regulated as a drug or hormone or anything. So you absolutely can't know without doing about it a $3,000 analysis showing the absence of any of the antagonistic hormones like estrogen. Oh, that could be in the product itself as an impurity from manufacturing.

**CONTEXT:** What are the challenges in sourcing quality pregnenolone, and what factors contribute to potential contamination?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's the paint thinner, I think. Oh, come on. It used to be sold for 25 cents a quart or something as a paint thinner. And very non-toxic, but a very powerful paint remover. And the FDA has this policy of knocking traditional safe drugs off the market, and licensing, even things that have been used for hundreds of years, licensing them to a single artificial monopoly, so that company can raise it from a dime a dose to a hundred dollars a dose, which they've done for treating narcolepsy with GHB.

**CONTEXT:** What is GBL, and how has the FDA's policy affected its availability and cost?

**RAY PEAT:** It was used previously for relaxing people before surgery. It was a very safe sedative effect. You could even anesthetize people with it safely. It didn't have the after-effects that the common anesthetics have. But the FDA monopolized it and took it off the market.

**CONTEXT:** What were the historical uses of GHB, and why was it removed from the market?

**RAY PEAT:** If you eat passion fruit, you get a small, measurable amount in the tasty passion fruit juice. Namely, restoring health to a person by restoring proper autonomic nervous system balance by the sympathetic and parasympathetic components that comprise the system.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between passion fruit consumption and the autonomic nervous system?

**RAY PEAT:** Kelly got his idea from John Beard. John Beard was a doctor at the beginning of the 20th century who theorized that cancer is an embryonic process gone wrong and that the pancreatic enzymes digest proteins and are present in the blood. The same pancreatic enzymes used to digest food by excreting them into the intestine are in the blood. In the Beardian Hypothesis, a deficiency of pancreatic enzymes was involved in cancer. So Kelly started taking, I think it was pork pancreas, dehydrated pork pancreas or beef, either way. The only drawback is that they have to be dehydrated but unsterilized. So if there was any infection, bacterial or parasite or whatever in the animal, you can't sterilize it because you're eating the powdered pancreatic tissue. But Kelly had very good results. I was acquainted with him and followed his work and added to his nutritional program.

**CONTEXT:** What was John Beard's theory on cancer, and how did William Kelly adapt it?

**RAY PEAT:** Someone convinced him to put the glutamate in his supplement, and as soon as he made those additions, magnesium glutamate and other mineral glutamates, he began having epilepsy attacks every day starting that January, and he contacted me in spring or early summer. What could be causing his seizures every day, and I looked at the changes in his formula and explained that the glutamates are brain toxic, excitatory, and he stopped eating his supplement, and the seizures stopped the very day he stopped his glutamate consumption.

**CONTEXT:** What adverse effects did the addition of glutamates have on William Kelly's supplement, and how were these effects resolved?

**RAY PEAT:** With that success, from my suggestion, he decided to add Pregnenolone to his total vitamin supplement. His lawyer said, "Since it's not a hormone, you can put it in anything." So it was just added to his vitamin, mineral, nutritional supplement. And then his clients started having other health benefits, not just the enzyme effect on whatever cancer they might have, but general health benefits such as eye problems and muscle problems and all of the things related to a steroid imbalance.

**CONTEXT:** How did the addition of pregnenolone to William Kelly's supplement lead to broader health benefits for his clients?

**RAY PEAT:** Absolutely. Some of the quantities are enough to seriously imbalance our amino acid intake.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential consequences of consuming certain quantities of glutamate in supplements and foods?

**RAY PEAT:** Oxidation is disease. If there's no oxidized biomolecules, you don't have a toxin. The toxic effect is oxidation of biomolecules. That's the entirety of it.

**CONTEXT:** How does oxidation relate to disease, and what is the fundamental toxic effect?

**RAY PEAT:** First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than vitamin C, things like that. So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your body and go right into the very DNA and repair it. So now it makes sense why George was able to say this back in August 2019 with such conviction. The body accepts that gas and uses it to heal everything. It's like the fountain of youth. It's astonishing the amount of ailments. In fact, in scientific studies, and they have over a thousand scientific studies now, they are showing that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly from virtually every ailment that ails any water-based life form.

**CONTEXT:** What makes hydrogen a unique and powerful antioxidant, and what is the extent of its healing capabilities?

**RAY PEAT:** In Japan, it's a traditional therapy of heart disease to even sick heart patients. To sit for fifteen or twenty minutes in an infrared sauna, then lie down and rest and hydrate for about half an hour. They call it WAON, which means soothing heat. And they've done research studies, like thirty of them in humans, anti-aging your arteries and improves the strength of your heart and may actually prolong survival in sick heart patients. Anybody can just again go to the internet. Read about infrared sauna heart disease or put my name there because I've written many articles about it. Now there's data coming out of Sweden and Finland because they've published some amazing data. That number of times a week you're in a sauna, number of minutes each time, you can just track out how long you're going to live. So very powerful therapy by being in my favorite is an infrared sauna.

**CONTEXT:** What are the cardiac benefits of infrared saunas, and what is the Japanese therapy known as WAON?

**RAY PEAT:** The high fat content is for high work, high energy expenditure. And if you aren't spending 5,000 calories a day doing hard physical work, it's necessarily going to be stores fat.

**CONTEXT:** Why does high fat content in food lead to fat storage in sedentary individuals?

**RAY PEAT:** The details have been sketched out years in advance. May of 2019, Eric Schmidt, who was chairman of Google for a long time, he went to work for the Pentagon, head of the defense committee on artificial intelligence. In that, he said that for the sake of getting ahead of China, we're going to have to destroy the present economic system, move rapidly to automation using artificial intelligence, for example, in shopping. He said the online shopping is a great experience, especially if you can't get it in the stores. And that online computer remote medicine is going to be better than contact between patient and doctor, and you won't spread a disease that way. Digital money, so you don't spread disease. Digital education, so you don't waste time going to school and having actual interaction between student and teacher. And incidentally, the best artificial intelligence programs are owned by Google. And that will monopolize education, and money will be poured into the systems of virtual reality to give even poor kids the same fine curriculum that the rich kids get, and the taxpayers will subsidize this monopoly system of uniform remote education.

**CONTEXT:** What was Eric Schmidt's vision for the future of the economy and society, as outlined in May 2019?

**RAY PEAT:** May of 2019, and in, I think it was May of, May or, yeah, yeah, May of 2020, that he went to work with Governor Cuomo in New York to start revising New York's education, public health, and other systems in line with his plan that was worked out in the Pentagon a year before the pandemic.

**CONTEXT:** How did Eric Schmidt's Pentagon plan influence New York's public systems in the lead-up to the pandemic?

**RAY PEAT:** If you're adding oxygen, your lungs are at risk. An increase over the atmospheric 21% can basically inflame your lungs, do the same things starting to your lungs that the intubation over-breathing does to all of the tissues, starting with the lungs, starting with inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** What are the risks associated with inhaling oxygen at concentrations higher than atmospheric levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but I don't know of any value from adding a higher concentration of oxygen during the exercise. Adding a little CO2, I would think, would be more protective. More protective, yeah. You're churning a lot of oxygen through your lungs when you're breathing very hard, and I think that tends in itself to create lung inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** What is the potential benefit of adding carbon dioxide during exercise compared to increased oxygen concentration?

**RAY PEAT:** Either a deficiency or a great excess of vitamin A. Acts the same. If you're deficient in all of the antioxidant things, all of the stabilizing factors, of which vitamin E is just one. If you're deficient in those, an overdose of vitamin A leads to autoxidation. The vitamin A starts catalyzing its own breakdown. And the supplements of retinoic acid, there are three forms of it. Two of them are extremely toxic. The third one, it's a matter of having it in great excess. All of those forms of retinoic acid normally are toxic. Locally derived in very particular tissues, for example, the developing embryo is the most noticeable place where you use retinoic acid to create tissues such as the eye. But if it's out of place, then it has a toxic effect and leads to the breakdown of the basic safe form, retinol, which is the form that occurs mostly in foods. The retinol begins to be destroyed when you've started catalyzing the breakdown. So it's very hard to know whether to use any supplement at all. So I would suggest if you have those symptoms to rely only on foods such as milk and eggs for your vitamin A rather than a supplement.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors, specifically related to vitamin A, can cause chronic chapped lips and seborrheic dermatitis?

**RAY PEAT:** It could be getting too much. Yeah, because the system once it starts down that path, you need something to interrupt it. And vitamin E and progesterone are things that are known to help to interrupt the process. You might try a lotion of something containing either vitamin E or progesterone on the lips directly to see if that can stop the chapping process, which means your proteins are not being synthesized properly, cells are being formed and dying prematurely from developing and stop the unhealthy fibrosis and disease the doctors mislabel as aging.

**CONTEXT:** What interventions can help interrupt the process of vitamin A toxicity and its associated symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** The inability to use oxygen properly tends to go with a deficiency of carbon dioxide and lactic acid formation. If you even inject lactic acid, it will start this systemic inflammation. So lactic acid is really the fundamental agent of all of these degenerative inflammatory processes. So you want to keep your lactic acid, if possible, below the so-called normal range on the blood tests. If you have a blood test for it, it should be at the extreme bottom of the test range, because in proportion to the presence of lactic acid, you're moving in the direction of the degenerative diabetes cancer-like metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** How does lactic acid contribute to systemic inflammation and degenerative processes, and what is the ideal level of lactic acid?

**RAY PEAT:** Excess fatigue is one of the traditional signs. But edema is probably the next. After fatigue, all of the nerve, muscle, digestive failures or inflammatory processes, all of these will be brought on by lactic acid. At an extreme surge of lactic acid, panic attacks are becoming much more common. High percentage of people are starting to have a panic attack, which means they're having a surge of lactic acid.

**CONTEXT:** What are the common symptoms associated with excess lactic acid, and how does it relate to panic attacks?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and a lot of people find that having even half a teaspoon of baking soda in a couple of ounces of water helps to break an anxiety or or panic attack.

**CONTEXT:** How can baking soda be used to alleviate anxiety and panic attacks?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when you absorb the baking soda, the immediate effect increases your alkalinity, but the kidneys just very quickly, it has a diuretic effect and so the sodium goes out very fast, leaving the bicarbonate, which by itself is turned into carbon dioxide, which goes into cells and restores their normal, relaxed, slightly acidic pH. Just a little teaspoon of baking soda. Anything on that order. Half a teaspoon will sometimes make a difference.

**CONTEXT:** What is the physiological mechanism by which baking soda helps to restore cellular pH and alleviate panic attacks?

**RAY PEAT:** If you're low thyroid, you're basically always hyperventilating. Really? You would be doing it but not knowing it? Knowing it? Yeah, because the cell isn't producing carbon dioxide at the normal rate. Oh. And if it isn't producing carbon dioxide, you're not taking it in from the outside, then any little need for energy, the cell will burn some sugar, turn it into lactic acid without burning it all the way to carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does hypothyroidism lead to hyperventilation and impaired carbon dioxide production?

**RAY PEAT:** Checking your temperature is the next best thing to measuring your oxygen consumption and CO2 output. First thing in the morning, we went around the 98.6. Well, 97.8 is okay early in the morning, but then it should after breakfast get up to temperature.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of body temperature in assessing metabolic function, and what are the ideal temperature ranges?

**RAY PEAT:** The mercury in the mouth is very, very absolutely accurate. The infrared in the ear or the instrument is well-designed. That's very quick and handy to use and accurate enough.

**CONTEXT:** What are the most accurate methods for measuring body temperature?

**RAY PEAT:** You can find drugstores on the internet that sell them and check the price. The more people buy, the more likely you are to find rip-off prices. They should be in the vicinity of $15 a bottle.

**CONTEXT:** Where can one find affordable thyroid hormone medications like Cynoplus and Cytomel?

**RAY PEAT:** No, one is a good balance of T4, T3 that imitates the old 40-year-ago standard of Armour Thyroid or Thyrolar, which was the Armour company's synthetic, and that exact formula was taken up by Xenoplus, and I've been, since the Armour company sold to a cosmetic company, and then it has gone through ownership changes and price increase from a penny a pill to a dollar a pill. I, in the 90s, started using Xenoplus and Xenomil.

**CONTEXT:** What is the composition of Xenoplus and Xenomil, and how do they compare to older thyroid medications?

**RAY PEAT:** Xenomil is only the active hormone, and its activity peaks in an hour and a half roughly after you take the pill, and then it starts down. And it's half gone within about 12 hours. So if you try to take one T3 pill in the morning, like the drugist will often tell you, by 12 hours later, at bedtime, you're hypothyroid.

**CONTEXT:** What is the pharmacokinetic profile of Xenomil (T3), and why is it important to take it multiple times a day?

**RAY PEAT:** In the late 1940s, when they were starting to synthesize T4 companies that became the major producer of Synthroid synthetic thyroxine, they tested their synthetic on 25-year-old male medical students, the healthiest population imaginable. They compared the glandular armor product with their synthetic and they said it worked exactly the same as the natural thyroid. So that was the basis now for 70 years, substituting for the natural, which had established all of our knowledge about thyroid hormone function. It was done on the basis of natural thyroid. The fact that it lowers cholesterol, for example, immediately, there's no cholesterol excess problem if you don't have a thyroid problem. But since that idea that 25-year-old males respond to the synthetic the same way to do the natural, they failed to take into account the experiments that had already shown that estrogen blocks the ability to convert thyroxin into the active hormone. And so they didn't test their product on even 25-year-old females, much less 38-year-old women, at the peak of their estrogen. In a very high proportion of middle-aged women, thyroxine, if it accumulates, can even have an antithyroid action by suppressing your pituitary, showing zero TSH, and so no stimulation of the thyroid gland, and so no formation of T3.

**CONTEXT:** Why is synthetic T4 (Synthroid) potentially problematic, especially for women, and how does estrogen interfere with thyroid hormone conversion?

**RAY PEAT:** At the University of Oregon Medical School in the 1970s, a doctor had prescribed a hundred micrograms, which was a moderate dose of thyroxin, to a hypothyroid woman, and after a few months she didn't improve, so he increased the dose to 200, over months got it up to 400 micrograms of thyroxin per day, and she went into a myxedema coma. And was taken into the medical school hospital, where they found she had absolutely no detectable T3 in her body, explaining the coma. Her brain simply wasn't making carbon dioxide or energy. So they gave her intravenous T3 immediately, came out of the coma. Recovered from the massive edema, myxedema, and they put her on a mixed product containing T3 to maintain her, and there was no problem. But there are milder cases like that, millions of them around the country, women being prescribed Cyroxin, and the response being measured in terms of how much they're TSH is being suppressed, and it's totally ignoring their body temperature, their symptoms, their cholesterol, all of the basic absolute indicators of what the thyroid is doing and how much is needed.

**CONTEXT:** What case study illustrates the dangers of high-dose synthetic T4 and the importance of T3 in treating hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** The Framingham study found that basically no one who had their cholesterol well over 200, very low incidence of dementia, if they kept their cholesterol up over the age of 50, but those who were below 200 had an extremely high dementia incidence. That's explained because your gonads and adrenals depend on the amount of cholesterol in the blood for making the protective steroid hormones.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between cholesterol levels, dementia incidence, and the production of steroid hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** In an experiment with an isolated ovary, for example, they measured the amount, keeping the thyroid hormone level, they measured the amount of progesterone coming out of the vein from the ovary and they varied the amount of cholesterol going into the artery to the ovary. And as they increased, they measured the amount of progesterone coming out of the vein from the cholesterol in the blood going in, the amount of progesterone coming out of the ovary corresponded and increased. So rising cholesterol is adaptive, keeping your brain steroid hormones up, keeping your ovarian systemic hormones up, your adrenal hormones, everything, your brain especially depends on the adequate amount of cholesterol in the blood. And if your thyroid is low, that means you require more cholesterol in the blood to keep your brain supplied with steroids. And so hypothyroid people properly and adaptively have a proportionally high cholesterol.

**CONTEXT:** How does cholesterol availability directly influence the production of progesterone and other steroid hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it depends on your age. The Framingham study found that basically no one who had their cholesterol well over 200, very low incidence of dementia, if they kept their cholesterol up over the age of 50, but those who were below 200 had an extremely high dementia incidence.

**CONTEXT:** What are the optimal cholesterol levels for preventing dementia, particularly in individuals over 50?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's biologically crazy. It's making it impossible to make the brain steroids.

**CONTEXT:** Why is lowering cholesterol to very low levels considered biologically detrimental?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, exercise is always safest in the afternoon. Someone did a study of having people jog before breakfast and then after breakfast and took a blood sample and found broken chromosomes in their blood cells if they jogged before breakfast, when blood sugar was not adequate. After breakfast, there were no broken chromosomes caused by the stress of running or the increased lactic acid. Other experiments show that later in the day, your ability to resist stress damage is at its highest of the day.

**CONTEXT:** Why is exercising in the afternoon considered safer than exercising before breakfast, and what is the significance of stress resistance later in the day?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it's slightly better nutritionally, very easy to digest, and you don't risk the carcinogens produced by overheating it. But the thing that keeps me from eating it, either rare or raw, is the possibility of various kinds of infections, bacterial or protozoal or whatever. That's why I think some of the raw meat people, they sear it everywhere pretty good to kill anything on the outside. But it could still be on the inside though, right? Yeah, if the animal has a disease, you're being exposed to it, and a healthy digestive system can handle it, but I prefer to cook it rather than trust my digestive system.

**CONTEXT:** What are the nutritional advantages and disadvantages of eating raw meat, and what is the primary concern regarding its consumption?

**RAY PEAT:** Haven't seen these videos, but any way you take in an anti-inflammatory substance since the essence of the COVID symptoms of mortality, the essence is inflammation. All kinds of anti-inflammatory things are going to be helpful. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, the combination studies of those two, they're ridiculed by the know-nothing doctors because they say neither of them killed viruses, one is an antibiotic and the other is for autoimmune conditions. Those are anti-inflammatory. The azithromycin and erythromycin happen to be very effective anti-inflammatory agents. And so they're missing the point that they are extremely therapeutic. Anything anti-inflammatory is helpful. Carbon dioxide is our simplest, most basic anti-inflammatory substance. Aspirin, progesterone, cortisol, a thousand different safer things. The synthetic glucocorticoids used for asthma inhalants will immediately protect you against the inflammation, but they have the long-range problems of tissue breakdown.

**CONTEXT:** How do anti-inflammatory substances, such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, address the core issue of COVID-19 symptoms, and what is the role of carbon dioxide as an anti-inflammatory agent?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but at least the pandemic, the founding chairman of the World Economic Forum announced the theme of their January 2021 World Conference will be the great reset, and he said the global warming thing was helping us to eliminate the old fossil fuel economy, but that has been coming along very slowly, and luckily we now have the pandemic allowing for almost instant change, shutting down the old economy by fiat rather than gradual legislation.

**CONTEXT:** How has the concept of a "great reset" been linked to global warming initiatives and the pandemic response?
