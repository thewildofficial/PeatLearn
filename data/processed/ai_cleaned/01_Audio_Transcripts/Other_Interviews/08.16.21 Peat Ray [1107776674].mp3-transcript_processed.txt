**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for about 80 years they were trying to make vaccines against the common cold, most of which were coronaviruses. And the problem was, as soon as they would get a vaccine that would make you immune to the cold, you had last season, the virus would change enough that the vaccine didn't work. And so, for all of these years, they were having failures making vaccines that worked against coronaviruses. And someone came up with the idea that if you made the crucially toxic part of a coronavirus and had your own body make that, that would supposedly make you stay immune to some part of any virus of that family, no matter how the rest of it changed. But that just isn't the way the immune system works. We do make antibodies against everything, all the different parts, even the little piece of RNA they picked out. Our bodies make a variety of antibodies. Especially if it's pure, they would make a certain range of antibodies. But that's only an extremely trivial, superficial part of the immune system. The reason medical immunology got stuck on the idea that antibodies are immunity is that the drug industry, Paul Ehrlich and his first mercury and then arsenic treatments of syphilis were at the basis of, he called it the magic bullet. His theory of why his patent medicine would kill a disease such as syphilis was that it was specific, absolutely a magic bullet that was only going to kill that organism and not hurt the rest of your body. Of course arsenic and mercury hurt everything. Nothing specific or focused about it, but it was his advertising campaign, the magic bullet is not only his patent medicine, but he sold the idea that our immune systems work that way, that our antibodies are like magic bullets that only attack one particular thing, the invading organism. But he shared the Nobel Prize with an actual biologist who studied the ground level of the immune system, the phagocytes, which really think of the invading material as potential food, but their real job is to maintain the continuity and health of the organism. And they scrape up the invaders as part of their job of keeping the organism healthy. Anyway, the money was behind Paul Ehrlich's magic bullet idea, and that took off in medicine. And we had magic bullets and antibodies which were... the immune system and that propagating it through medical schools supported by drug industry money. It wasn't enough. They drove the concept by a series of Nobel prizes to any sort of junk science that supported the idea of specific antibodies as the essence of our immune system. So that stupid idea to sell mercury and arsenic drugs of Paul Ehrlich's got taken up all the way up to the Nobel prize committee. So often times they give a Nobel prize to run out a particular mean that they want. Always, I would say, with Ehrlich's. Didn't Carey Mullis get a Nobel prize for the PCR test? Yeah, that was so valuable to the industry that they thought he was a harmless crank.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the concept of viruses and vaccine efficacy, Dr. Peat explains the historical challenges with common cold viruses and the flawed "magic bullet" theory of immunology.

**RAY PEAT:** No, there's this other idea of detoxification. That's another medical industry trick that goes back hundreds of years. The doctor would give you a poisonous toxin, a poisonous remedy. And you would get sick when you took your... Mercury diuretic, for example, and the medical story was you got sick, that's your body healing itself, throwing out the evil substances making you sick, so you get sicker before you get better. Which is the detox model, right? Yeah, and it really hit its peak with the Hertzheimer reaction where, in treating syphilis, they would almost kill you with mercury fumes, and you would just fall apart, and they would say, that's the healing reaction, you're detoxifying. It was 100% the poison that they were giving you, and they said, it's the germs diet. And throwing off their toxins, or it's your body destroying the tumor, for example, and you're suffering the detoxifying effect of getting that poisonous tumor or germs out of your body. But basically that Herxheimer reaction is just an old medical trick to say, we'll get you well, but you have to get sick first.

**CONTEXT:** When asked if colds and flus are simply detoxification processes, Dr. Peat debunks the "detoxification" model, tracing its origins to historical medical practices involving toxic remedies.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, they were working on that 80 years ago, but they didn't have electron micrograph images of it to show that it had corona attachments all around it, attachment proteins, but it was an antigenically recognizable family of viruses. The detoxifying idea has been put to the test in various ways. When cows are rounded up to be slaughtered, they check the toxins, pesticides and things in their urine and in their bloodstream. And some of these studies found that essentially 100% of them had circulating toxins in their blood or urine. And if they would stop poisoning them for just a day or two when they were slaughtered, they found that the liver had none of the toxins and that the toxins were residing in the fat tissue, mostly somewhat in the muscle tissue. But the liver as the organ of detoxification was essentially 100% clean in these well-poisoned animals. If you just reduce the inflow of poison, the liver was passively working on expelling it from the body, putting it out in the urine.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms the existence of viruses like coronaviruses and contrasts this with the flawed detoxification theory, citing studies on toxin levels in animals.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, those things all contribute. The environment is full of toxic junk, varying as industry finds new poisons to sell. So those are factors in everything, but the type of cold or flu going around has statistical properties. A certain type will predominate in a large part of the people in the next flu season. It'll be slightly different.

**CONTEXT:** Addressing the role of environmental toxins and lifestyle factors in illness, Dr. Peat acknowledges their contribution but emphasizes the statistical patterns of specific circulating illnesses.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure, sure. Where would viruses come from? Where else would they come from? They have to come from us, right? Or other higher organisms. A virus doesn't just make itself, it's structured. So what would be another higher organism? Oh, well, the standard theory is that bats and pigs and monkeys and all sorts of animals that are under stress are going to be putting out more of their exosomes or viruses, but it depends on how those stressed animals interact. A stressed pig farm, for example, is a powerful source of exosomes or so-called pig viruses.

**CONTEXT:** When questioned about the origin of viruses and the possibility of them being shared exosomes, Dr. Peat suggests they originate from higher organisms, particularly stressed animals.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, no one has suggested a better explanation for where they come from. How can a virus originate without the elaborate organisms that have the machinery for constructing these little encapsulated bits of nucleic acid? So we're sharing these exosomes and then people that are stressed out or poisoned or in fear or whatever, they can have a reaction to the exosomes that we're sharing.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the origin of viruses, questioning how they could arise without the complex machinery of living organisms and suggesting they are shared exosomes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so a person who falls down the stairs, for example, is going to have damaged tissues and will put out an alarm to make exosomes for all kinds of things. And so some of the... cold or influenza-like exosomes might have been sitting around harmlessly that they picked up maybe even in a previous season, but with the trauma that loosens things up, then among many different, hundreds of different exosome types that the trauma brings on, then they might bring up influenza-like influenza or herpes or whatever.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how trauma can trigger the release of exosomes, potentially leading to illness symptoms from previously harmlessly acquired exosomes.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, there are thousands of variations. You can start giving them names. I think, how can you even test for something that's changing so fast? Yeah. If they have five major variants now with their different names, who's testing to see if one of those is making you sick or not? Yeah, and then to create a vaccine for that would be just, I mean, it's just incomprehensible, isn't it?

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses skepticism about the concept of rapidly changing virus variants and the feasibility of creating vaccines for them.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but even once you accept the idea that a vaccine can prevent one particular kind of influenza, for example, there were several studies a couple of years ago looking at people who were vaccinated for influenza the previous season and this season when they got a respiratory infection, they checked for what type of pathogen was present and they found there were fewer people with the influenza pathogen, but many more with the coronavirus causing their respiratory disease. So it's been known, well-documented a couple of years ago, but it's been known for decades that every time you activate your immune system, you are narrowing its range. Just on the level of antibodies, people don't realize that when you say you introduce a piece of ground-up slurry of pork roast and produce antibodies to pork roast, those antibodies circulate in your body and the same thing that recognizes pork roast recognizes your new antibodies to pork roast and will produce antibodies to those and those are something that wasn't there before and you'll produce antibodies to those. So every time you produce antibodies, you don't just stop with those antigen antibodies, but you create waves of reactions forming antibodies to the antibodies and antibodies to those. Just the antibody people have a grossly fantasy-based idea of what they're doing. What they're doing? You're disrupting the system far down the line in somewhat unpredictable ways, but you're you're occupying that part of your immunity and draining energy and potential, developmental potential of your whole organism is being drained down into that chain of antibody reactions.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights studies showing that influenza vaccination can lead to increased susceptibility to other viruses and explains how activating the immune system, particularly through antibody production, narrows its range and drains energy.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Kind of? Yeah. And the purpose of that is to what? Why did God and nature, why are we doing this? It's probably some sort of a biological, cooperative, self-sustaining and balancing ecological process. An ecosystem, the ecosystem achieves some stability, meaning that your environment is being detected, not just through what eats what, but through what subtly modifies other things. Each organism, if we modify it a little bit, it's almost like a genetic update that we share with each other. Yeah, a complex sensing of your environment, not just what you ate for breakfast.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that the sharing of exosomes is a biological, cooperative process that contributes to ecological stability and acts as a form of genetic update.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, since the 1940s and 50s, people have been seeing this sharing of genes horizontally as a very powerful part of evolution and maintenance of our physiology and ecosystems.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat notes that horizontal gene sharing, facilitated by processes like exosome exchange, has been recognized as a significant factor in evolution and physiological maintenance since the mid-20th century.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, basically, yeah. That idea that it's all reducible to one pathogen, or the pathogen is always just part of a complex ecological process. And, for example, if you don't have enough food, then the dirt in your environment is going to become a potential pathogen. And then why do some people get flu symptoms once a year or whatever, or cold symptoms? What's the difference between those that do and those that don't? Partly, there's a tough period when the immune system is being adjusted, and the farther out of a balanced society and ecosystem we are, the harder those challenges are. So, probably, there were cultures and societies in which people didn't even notice having childhood sicknesses. But then, for several generations, the childhood sicknesses took care of most of the epidemics, and those things got more specialized and deranged than those things that were managed in a subtle way, more or less unnoticed. So, those things started creating bigger imbalances of epidemics, and then you would get a childhood disease that would run its course for two or three generations and then fade out. And all of the famous childhood diseases that existed in the period of vaccinology, they had all run their statistical course, rising, peaking, fading away to almost nothing. By the time the vaccines came in, and then the vaccines took credit for the natural history of our adjustment to our environment.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat critiques the germ theory, suggesting that pathogens are often part of a complex ecological process and that childhood illnesses have historically followed a natural course of rising, peaking, and fading, with vaccines often taking credit for this natural decline.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that, besides the fact that the hypodermic needle was... invented a couple hundred years ago, and doctors found that they could more easily monopolize... drug treatments, instead of making a tea out of your drugs, they would make a potion and then inject it into you. And so medicine took over the idea of treating by injection, and there were... the paralytic polio, if you... you can find on the internet a lot of good historical articles showing the... no matter what the doctors were injecting, the paralytic polio would concentrate on whichever part of the body received the injection. Even injected vitamins would predispose that arm or leg to become paralyzed. So, if you were perfectly healthy, I mean, the most healthy person on the planet, and you breathed in some exosomes from me that... I don't know, that I was trying to update your gen... I mean, you couldn't die from it, right?

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the historical shift towards injections in medicine and presents evidence suggesting that injected substances, including vitamins, could predispose individuals to paralysis, as seen in cases of polio.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are several very good investigators with an hour or more explanation on the internet. David Martin, as one goes into the history, Michael Yeadon very recently had an hour full interview in which he dissects the official story, shows that no part of the official pandemic story and vaccine story has any basis in fact, absolutely no part of it is what they say it is.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat references investigators like David Martin and Michael Yeadon who have critically examined the official narrative surrounding the pandemic and vaccines, finding no basis in fact.

**RAY PEAT:** Very slightly. But why wouldn't you? Don't we need the updates from everybody? Basically, it's beneficial to get your little exosome updates.

**CONTEXT:** When asked if masks would block exosomes, Dr. Peat suggests they offer minimal protection and questions the rationale for blocking beneficial exosome updates.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all the way back the one vaccine that was used for hundreds or thousands of years turned out to be used in an organized way the smallpox vaccine finally having eradicated it in most of the countries of the world, they finally got together and used the vaccine in an intelligent way finding outbreaks closing in encircling those outbreaks and using the vaccination only in those areas until there was no more smallpox left in the world, but the that wasn't at all good for the vaccine industry. There was no more need for a smallpox vaccine when they used it intelligently to eliminate that particular strain of the problem.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the historical use of the smallpox vaccine, noting that its intelligent application to eradicate outbreaks led to a decline in demand, which was not beneficial for the vaccine industry.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, from cows. From cows. Wow. So... so do you think that somebody could create... some kind of a make-believe virus in a lab, you know, the whole China-Wuhan thing, somehow release it in the air, I don't know, and then people could share it? I mean, is that possible? Doesn't sound illogical, does it? I mean...

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses skepticism about the origin of viruses, questioning the possibility of lab-created viruses and their release.

**RAY PEAT:** The US Department of Defense... they adopted... the biological toxin researchers, both from Japan and Nazi Germany, at the end of the war, or even during the war, and created their own ongoing biological warfare lab, which nominally Richard Nixon terminated with destruction of the germ warfare material, supposedly in 1969. But through the 1940s, for example, the army in Boston, in particular, and Fort Detrick, and two or three test sites around the country, they were testing aerosols of many different organisms, including the potential of aerosolizing polio. And one of the people working on that project became paralyzed and dropped out of the military program of aerosol germ research and went back to the University of Mississippi to teach medicine and wrote the most famous, extremely ignorant physiology textbook, A.C. Guyton, the most famous medical book in history. But he turned to textbook writing because he was unable to continue his work in germ warfare research. But that was the business for 20 or 30 years of our government creating aerosols to see how effective it was to spread disabling bacteria and viruses and other things.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reveals that the US Department of Defense engaged in biological warfare research, including testing aerosols of various organisms, and notes the involvement of individuals who later contributed to influential medical textbooks.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, if you want to kill somebody's crop that you were one of your enemies. Yeah. So to really get something poisonous in your body, you almost have to get it injected. Or in your food. Or in your food. Eat it. Take it in. They have carcinogenic bacteria, for example, that are a combination of a viral nucleic acid and the bacteria to make it spreadable through food. So it can give you cancer of the digestive system very quickly and predictably. So that's a little poison that you have to ingest. Yeah. And those have been put to use at least as attempted assassination tools.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the use of biological agents, particularly crop diseases, and notes that poisonous substances often need to be ingested or injected to be effective, mentioning carcinogenic bacteria as an example.

**RAY PEAT:** Well the intent was there. We know what Ralph Baric was doing in Fort Detrick, at least on the surface, the things he admitted, and what he admitted are horrendously criminal, and so you have to wonder if......classified things might not have been even worse than designing viruses intended to attack humans. Things he took out of bats and modified, added parts of other genetic material, and engineered the genes until they were able to infect human beings. That's what Ralph Baric's contribution was.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat points to the work of Ralph Baric at Fort Detrick, suggesting that his research involved modifying genetic material from bats to create viruses capable of infecting humans, and describes these actions as "horrendously criminal."

**RAY PEAT:** No. When someone dies, you can test their lungs or blood, and you can often find several different things that are potentially harmful enough to contribute to their death. Sometimes you can't find any cause of the influenza-like... condition. Sometimes it's because your intestine, under stress, leaked toxins. And it's simply the bacterial toxins from your own intestine that killed you and created the influenza-like symptoms. So if a person is dying from stress and their endotoxemia and you happen to find some of the COVID organisms in their nose, for example, you can't say that that was the cause of death when there are so many other unexamined potential causes.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that when someone dies, multiple factors can contribute to death, and the presence of a specific organism like "COVID organisms" in the nose does not necessarily mean it was the cause of death, especially when other factors like endotoxemia are present.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. As people age, in our present types of environment, we accumulate things that weaken our resistance in general. Yes. Not just the immune system, but all of our adaptive things. Polyunsaturated fats and iron happen to... each one triggers in different ways our attempt to adapt and survive. But those attempts to adapt and survive cause us to take up more of the iron and PUFA into our systems. And so it becomes a self-propelling decay process just because of the nature of our defensive reactions interacting with the environments that provide too much iron and too much PUFA. Kind of the classic model for aging in planet Earth these days. Yeah, that seems to be it.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes aging as a process of accumulating weaknesses due to defensive reactions to environmental factors like polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) and iron, which paradoxically lead to further decay.

**RAY PEAT:** The problem with migraine starts at the nutritional and hormonal level, and sometimes just a dose or two of progesterone can activate your thyroid to the point that it regulates your digestive and nutritional processes and takes care of the migraines permanently. Other times, the progesterone might be enough to alleviate the headache, but not to get your thyroid and digestion back on track. So it's really important to look at problems in your diet and check your temperature and pulse, have your blood tests for TSH and vitamin D in particular.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that migraines often stem from nutritional and hormonal imbalances, and while progesterone can help, addressing thyroid function and digestion through diet and monitoring temperature and pulse is crucial for permanent relief.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's almost always in the long run that's effective and not too much.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that 5,000 units of Vitamin D daily is generally effective and not excessive.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for a man, 100 milligrams of progesterone is a very powerful dose that will usually knock out even a migraine. Women, if their estrogen is extremely high, sometimes won't get an effect from a dose as big as 100 milligrams. For them, it's important to start correcting right at the foundation with your thyroid and your avoiding irritating foods. And then ongoing though for men and women, you're more in the 50 range or 25 milligrams? Yeah, daily 20 or 30 milligrams during the luteal phase of their cycle. That's considered a full replacement dose. Similar with pregnenolone, about 20 or 30 milligrams per day for both men and women will help to keep the stress hormones down.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides dosage guidelines for progesterone, noting that 100mg can be effective for migraines, while daily doses of 20-30mg are more typical for maintenance, and similar doses of pregnenolone can help manage stress hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, working on your system in general to reduce inflammation, the first thing is to make sure you aren't going into a stress condition every night. And keeping your blood sugar steady is essential for that. That's what you need. Good nutrition, plenty of calcium relative to phosphate, enough vitamin D to handle the calcium, which keeps your energy system running, supporting the thyroid function. And the thyroid vitamin D and calcium are sort of a kernel of energy support substances. It will steady your blood sugar and keep down the inflammatory processes in general.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises that to reduce prostate inflammation, one should focus on stabilizing blood sugar, ensuring good nutrition with adequate calcium and vitamin D to support thyroid function, as these are foundational for energy and reducing inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, in the case of orange juice, there are many anti-inflammatory substances in the orange juice. The potassium and sugar are a big part of reducing the inflammation, but these bioflavonoids of the orange are very powerful, reducing the inflammation caused by iron and prostaglandins, for example.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that orange juice's anti-inflammatory properties are due to potassium, sugar, and potent bioflavonoids that combat inflammation caused by iron and prostaglandins.

**RAY PEAT:** For example, meat, fish, shellfish, grains are fairly bad sources for iron, but mostly meat fish and shellfish are. One class of shellfish is very low in iron. The shrimp, crab, lobster, scallop, squid type are high in copper and low in iron. Scallops have a lot of copper rather than iron, so that's a good choice. They taste good too. But if you like fish, can you put something on the fish to balance out the high iron in them? Having coffee with your meat or fish helps to block the absorption of the iron. What's in the coffee? Partly it's the phosphate, but a lot of the polyphenols, similar to what's in orange juice, but tea and coffee have a group of chemicals that are very good for blocking iron absorption.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies meat, fish, and shellfish as high-iron sources, recommending copper-rich shellfish like scallops and suggesting coffee with meals to block iron absorption due to its phosphate and polyphenol content.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah. If they have red blood, they have to have iron. And shellfish, like squid and scallops... And lobster, they've got the blue blood, right? Yeah, they have blue, copper-based blood. How about oysters? They happen to accumulate very large amounts of iron as well as copper. Oh, they do.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that red-blooded animals require iron, and discusses copper-based blood in shellfish like squid and scallops, noting that oysters accumulate both iron and copper.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the things that are potential excitants, the presence of iron risks excitatory excess. And that facilitates the uptake of calcium, which is another excitation sustainer. And together with aging, the tissues take up a mixture of calcium sulfate and iron.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that iron can lead to excitatory excess, promoting calcium uptake and contributing to tissue aging through the accumulation of calcium sulfate and iron.

**RAY PEAT:** The vegetable substances, some of the things in orange juice like ascorbic acid stimulate iron absorption. The bioflavonoids which you can get from many other fruits and vegetables block iron absorption.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that while ascorbic acid in orange juice can stimulate iron absorption, bioflavonoids from fruits and vegetables can block it.

**RAY PEAT:** Things that reduce stress and inflammation help to get oxidation of sugar going and vitamin D and calcium are crucial in that. Vitamin D and calcium to help reduce stress? Working to keep your mitochondria responding to the thyroid hormone so that they can oxidize glucose.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat states that vitamin D and calcium are crucial for reducing stress and inflammation, enabling mitochondria to oxidize glucose effectively under thyroid hormone influence.

**RAY PEAT:** There was one study in which they found in relation to their TSH scores they found that the higher the TSH in the group was the more risk of thyroid cancer they had and in the group completely without thyroid cancer they were below 0.4 on the TSH scale and the areas that are supplemented with iodine even the salt the amount of iodine in salt is sometimes several times higher than our requirement for iodine and in those populations thyroid disease and thyroid cancer is very seriously increased just from that slight chronic anti-thyroid effect of the chronic excess iodine. So that's why you're not you've not supported as long as I've talked to you I believe you don't like taking supplemental iodine at all you think it's unnecessary and dangerous and dangerous wow and so what if we're doing this I think it's just pure salt I think it's the uh what do they call it um. you know what i mean it's a morton salt but it's pickling and canning right it's just oh yeah yeah that's the one i use that's when you use yeah so there's no iodine in there there's a little there's enough but it's not too much yeah there were studies a few decades ago of the americans iodine intake and because of of the iodized salt and other use of iodine in food additives uh there was essentially no iodine deficiency in the u.s but lots of iodine excess lots of excess wow

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat cites studies linking higher TSH levels to increased thyroid cancer risk and notes that excessive iodine intake, even from iodized salt, can have an anti-thyroid effect, leading to thyroid disease and cancer. He expresses concern about excessive iodine intake.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's very clean stuff. It's clean stuff. Yeah, just pick and it's cheap too It's what is it a buck and a half or two bucks for a big box of it Uh, yeah, I think it's over two pounds Really big bucks. And so it's just pure salt nothing else. Yeah. Yeah, wow

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat endorses pickling and canning salt as a clean and inexpensive option, noting its purity and affordability.

**RAY PEAT:** As your body temperature goes up and your thyroid function and vitamin d Go up Your parathyroid hormone goes down and parathyroid hormone is an antagonist to oxidative respiratory metabolism And so by suppressing your parathyroid hormone You're freeing up your oxidative thyroid ability to oxidize glucose And so your body temperature Is likely to increase? under the influence of calcium vitamin d and thyroid And getting enough salt as part of that Salting your food to taste And so your body temperature goes up and you're using the glucose So it really doesn't matter very much what your Average Blood glucose is as long as you don't drop it Too low too low

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that increased body temperature, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels lead to decreased parathyroid hormone, which in turn enhances the thyroid's ability to oxidize glucose, thus lowering blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** I was checking your temperature later in the day after eating And your pulse rate lots of people will wake up with a the 98 degree temperature and sometimes their their pulse rate will be slower or fast, but after eating a good breakfast including plenty of carbohydrates Their temperature will often fall very low I've seen it go from 98 down to At 96 by 11 o'clock in the morning And that means that their temperature at waking Was held up by the stress hormones Mostly cortisol sometimes a mixture of cortisol and adrenaline which you can tell by The pulse rate as well as the temperature and then the Getting your blood sugar up by by eating enough carbohydrate lowers the cortisol and or adrenaline And you'll see that you're in the absence of stress Your body temperature is very low

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat notes that stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline can elevate morning body temperature, and consuming carbohydrates after waking can lower this temperature by reducing stress hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when your TSH is and your parathyroid hormone are both at the bottom of the scale, that means your cells are running autonomously at a higher energy level. And so just sitting at rest, you're burning a lot of sugar and oxygen that will keep your temperature and pulse rate up. And why is it good to have that pulse rate there? What's it telling you? You're making carbon dioxide at a high rate and running energy through the system as you increase mitochondrial oxidation, you decrease free radical oxidation. The oxygen that isn't producing much heat or CO2 will even at rest be churning out the lipid peroxidizing type of oxides. And as you run the mitochondrion faster, burning sugar, producing CO2 and making heat, you will turn off the pro-inflammatory lipid peroxidizing random electrons. They're being sucked up by the properly used oxygen.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that low TSH and parathyroid hormone levels indicate cells are operating at a higher energy level, leading to increased temperature and pulse rate due to efficient sugar and oxygen utilization, which also reduces free radical damage.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the heart is smaller. Ah, really. So they, they generally have, is it 5 to 10 beats more than men? Something like that.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that women generally have a faster pulse rate than men due to their smaller heart size.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. There's usually paraffin, sometimes talc, in the tablet, and until I was able to get the bulk, I would always pour boiling water over an aspirin tablet and let it disintegrate so that the paraffin would float to the surface and the talc would sink to the bottom. Wow. So, Bayer, just a little Bayer, they have these little excipients in there? Bayer aspirin? In the tablets? The cleanest aspirins were usually the ones you get with the supermarket's brand name. No kidding. They're the fewest harmful excipients, but you can get clean USP, just the same quality of aspirin that you would get in the tablets, you can, in bulk, sold for horses, for example, then you can trust that it doesn't have the excipients.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises that bulk aspirin is preferable to tablets due to the presence of excipients like paraffin and talc in tablets, which can be removed by dissolving them in boiling water. He notes that supermarket brand aspirins often have fewer harmful excipients.

**RAY PEAT:** I try to remember to take some every night. Really? How many milligrams? About 300. It would be like one Bayer, right? Yeah. And what is that, does it help you sleep? I just do it on general principles. Just general principles. So aspirin's a pretty interesting, is it really from the willow bark thing, is that where it came from? It's the same stuff that they used to get from natural sources like bark, but the stuff you buy is even cleaner. It's a very simple chemical that doesn't have manufacturing impurities like a lot of chemicals do.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat takes approximately 300mg of aspirin nightly for general principles, noting its origin from willow bark and its purity as a simple chemical.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, with the homeopathy? Yeah, the homeopathy guy, yeah. Yeah, the basic orientation was that you trusted your immune system to do the right thing. And when I was about ten years old I read some of the old homeopathy books my grandparents had and saw that homeopathy in that sense was very sensible. It just meant not intervening with toxic chemicals like mercury and arsenic, which had been very, very common. Women were commonly given arsenic because of supposed anemia. And in general, is aspirin anti-inflammatory? Aspirin, yes, very important. Anti-inflammatory, right.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat acknowledges Samuel Hahnemann and homeopathy's sensible approach of trusting the immune system and avoiding toxic chemicals like mercury and arsenic, and confirms aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, no, I think all honey is roughly half fructose and half glucose. And the thing with honey you have to watch out for is whether the bees were eating industrial chemicals or allergens, the allergen that the bee eats can be passed into the honey. And with bees, you don't really know exactly what's going on and what they're eating, do you? I mean, they claim some honey is organic, but how do they know where they go? You have to have lots of land. They're devoted to organic farming before you can tell that the bees have a range of how far they can fly. They can go quite a distance, but after a speed, they have a definite radius for every hive. And I think that New Zealand has some good standards that they claim that some of the best where they, you know, you got to have like 5 or 10 miles or something of no chemicals and stuff.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat states that all honey is roughly half fructose and half glucose and warns about potential contamination from industrial chemicals or allergens consumed by bees, emphasizing the difficulty in verifying organic claims due to bees' flight range.

**RAY PEAT:** You should have an occasional blood test if you're taking large amounts like that. I don't know of a toxic level being reached with about 30,000 per day. But it's conceivable, so maybe twice a year would be good to check your level. And then if you get out in the sun a lot, I guess it would be reasonable to think that you could get too much, right? No, no one is known to have raised their vitamin D from the sun to a dangerous point. People working shirtless in the sun hours a day will typically have well over 100, 150 is common. On a blood test. But it's not a problem though, it's not a problem. Not at all. Not at all, good.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises occasional blood tests for those taking high doses of Vitamin D (around 30,000 IU daily) and clarifies that sun exposure does not lead to dangerous Vitamin D levels.

**RAY PEAT:** Milk and orange juice is good, I like it. You can throw in an occasional egg and scallop and be sure to have fiber. Raw carrot or cooked mushrooms or bamboo shoots or oat bran cereal for example.

**CONTEXT:** For weight loss, Dr. Peat recommends a diet including milk, orange juice, eggs, scallops, and fiber sources like raw carrots, cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots, or oat bran cereal.

**RAY PEAT:** Usually with men in particular, the inability to put on a normal amount of mass, especially muscle, is from having a thyroid problem. And the thyroid interacts with, it makes you able to retain magnesium which lets your cell shift over from mere energy production to anabolic muscle building. Muscle building, yeah. And so the combination of an adequate magnesium in your diet and sometimes a thyroid supplement will suddenly let a man put on muscle. Put on muscle, huh. So back to that old pesky thyroid again.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that difficulty gaining muscle, particularly in men, is often due to thyroid issues, as the thyroid influences magnesium retention, which is crucial for shifting from energy production to muscle building.

**RAY PEAT:** Some people have a problem with manufactured gelatin, and they might call it collagen, but collagen has to be extracted at a mild temperature and usually costs something like $10 a gram. Very expensive work. They're really getting gelatin, and the gelatin causes many people to get gas. The gelatin does? Yeah, partly because they might be taking too much, or not dissolving it totally enough, so that it is incompletely digested by your digestive enzymes, letting bacteria live on what you don't digest.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that bloating can be caused by manufactured gelatin, often marketed as collagen, which may be incompletely digested, leading to gas production by bacteria.

**RAY PEAT:** Chlorine dioxide. Yeah, also known as miracle mineral supplement, you know that one. Yeah, even when it's been studied as an additive to treat city water, it has a slight carcinogenic effect. Chlorine compounds are always risky. Yeah, so you're just not a fan of using that at all. No, the prolonged general use, even at a very low level, do increase the rate of mutations in cancer.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses strong disapproval of chlorine dioxide (MMS), citing studies showing its carcinogenic potential even at low levels used in water treatment and warning of increased cancer mutation rates with prolonged use.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, ascorbic acid. It is not vitamin C at all, right? Yeah, and the manufactured things, ascorbic acid and citric acid, and I think all of those supposedly simple sugar-based food additives, the way they're manufactured makes them very different from the natural substance. I, years ago, found that I could detect the small amount of ascorbic acid that was added to breakfast cereal, bread, canned vegetables, bologna, places you would never expect it would cause migraine-like symptoms. And still, I could drink a gallon of orange juice or other natural source of vitamin C every day with no reaction. No, no issues.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies ascorbic acid as distinct from natural Vitamin C, stating that manufactured versions, often found in processed foods, can cause migraine-like symptoms, unlike natural sources like orange juice.

**RAY PEAT:** If you're going to drink two quarts and more per day, you're going to get fat most likely on full-fat unless you're working on the farm. But for me, though, if I wanted to gain a little, it's okay. I just do the full-fat stuff, right? I'm pretty sure it's a good source of vitamins. Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that consuming large quantities of full-fat milk (two quarts or more daily) can lead to weight gain unless one is very physically active, but it is acceptable for those aiming to gain weight and is a good source of vitamins.

**RAY PEAT:** I think, as in people, it's basically a metabolic thyroid problem, and again, the calcium and vitamin D as support for your thyroid metabolism are probably going to be helpful. So get more calcium in the dog's diet, which would be bones, right? Maybe bones? Bones come with too much phosphate, and very often, lead, cadmium and other things go into the bone. So cottage cheese is something dogs almost always like. Oh, cottage cheese. That'll get more calcium in there. And what was the other substance that we liked for lipomas? Some vitamin D. So you could give a little bit of the vitamin D supplement that we take ourselves to them.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that lipomas in dogs are likely a metabolic thyroid issue, recommending calcium and vitamin D supplementation. He advises against bones due to phosphate and potential heavy metal contamination, instead recommending cottage cheese for calcium and Vitamin D.

**RAY PEAT:** Very expensively. You get those same minerals just eating a regular diet.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat states that homeopathic mineral salts are an expensive way to obtain minerals, which can be obtained more affordably through a regular diet.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that was discovered as an impurity in vitamin E in the 1950s and 60s. It's very good for endurance and for regulating blood lipids and so on. And you get it in sugarcane wax. Very few people choose sugarcane. So another source is the leaf, the wax on green leafy vegetables and on the cereal bran it's coating, waterproofing on plant material.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that policosanols, discovered as an impurity in Vitamin E, are beneficial for endurance and blood lipid regulation, and are found in sugarcane wax, leafy vegetable wax, and cereal bran coatings.

**RAY PEAT:** That's just another myth. Our brain can metabolize fructose. Well, I tell you what, if I wake up in the middle of the night, which is often, nothing like a fresh squeezed orange juice, and boy, that puts me back to Gaga Land pretty quick.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat dismisses the myth that fructose from juice or fruit causes fatty liver, stating that the brain can metabolize fructose and that fresh orange juice is beneficial for quick recovery during nighttime awakenings.

**RAY PEAT:** The potassium is one of the things that help us use the glucose oxidatively, and so it stabilizes our blood sugar. Mm-hmm. Well, it's hard to find. Do you squeeze your own organic oranges? What do you do? When we can get sweet organic oranges, otherwise we'll use unorganic, and just be very careful about the peelings, to not get any of the peeling material crushed into the juice. Oh, so you think most of the cooties are in the peelings and not in the orange itself? Most of it, yeah. Wow. Well, that's good news, because you can get unconventional or conventional fresh juice a lot of places. It's hard to find organic fresh juice. Interesting. Yeah, and often the organic oranges, because of the higher demand, they'll often be unsweet. Unsweet, yeah, yeah. So we like the sweet ones.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights potassium in orange juice as a factor in oxidative glucose utilization and blood sugar stabilization. He advises being careful to avoid crushing the peelings of non-organic oranges into the juice, suggesting most contaminants are in the peel. He also notes that organic oranges are often less sweet.
