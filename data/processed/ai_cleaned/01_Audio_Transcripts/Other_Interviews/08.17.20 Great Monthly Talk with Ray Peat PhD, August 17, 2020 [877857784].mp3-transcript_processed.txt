**RAY PEAT:** "That's close to what I believe. It's not at all accepted by contemporary biologists, but in the 1950s, a friend of mine, who was giving all of the background, supporting that idea that organisms of all sorts are emitting particles like that. They weren't called exosomes at that time, but this person, Carl Lindegren, gathered up evidence that biologists hadn't accumulated. really couldn't be explained any other way except for shared DNA. And there's a lab in Germany now that for several years has been showing that human cells actually incorporate a certain portion of the DNA from the foods that we eat. The particles... You know the phenomenon of persorption, in which fairly big particles, as big as a blood cell, for example, can pass from the intestine directly into the bloodstream, and exosomes are many times smaller than a cell, so easily things that we eat if they contain exosomes are very likely to get into our bloodstream. And once they're, according to this German lab, the cell can take them up and incorporate them, possibly at some point use them, integrate them into the functioning DNA, which is a very, very large part of our......genome, so-called, well, of the DNA inside the cell, our functioning genome is only a small percentage of the total DNA and the theory that we're absorbing DNA all the time would account for why there's all this non-functioning DNA present."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the concept of exosomes and their potential role in inter-organismal communication and DNA sharing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but across species too. Across species too? Everybody? So animals too? Yeah."
**CONTEXT:** The host inquires if this DNA sharing extends across species.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, I read that book over 50 years ago and it was very well documented, but nothing easy to prove, but very plausible."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat believes in this cross-species DNA sharing.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think sometimes the... You know, Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize guy from the HIV virus dispute with the United States, he believes that organisms communicate basically by something like radio waves that resonate. I've spent a lot of time. Studying the idea of resonance between organisms, Montagnier believes it's electromagnetic waves. The DNA is tuned into, I've spent most of my time thinking about the crystalline or liquid crystalline structure of the cell. The idea of liquid crystals was developed in the 30s and 40s....with evidence that there's long-range order within the cell. It isn't just ordinary water, but it's liquid crystal-like water. And the way you can operate, for example, a liquid crystal display screen, that's done by the electrical control of the... order in the crystal. But on a more delicate level, the order in this water-based crystal can resonate. It's easy to demonstrate that it resonates to sound waves. The sound waves are not at all distinct from electronic fluctuations and when you have an electrically active polarized molecule organized over the whole length of a cell, then you have the perfect conditions. to resonate electronically not just by sound waves and that sort of resonance, there is a man in the U.S. who has a website called Cell Intelligence who has been demonstrating the intelligent behavior within a cell and not only of the whole cell but the highly organized structures of the DNA and he argues that this liquid crystalline ordering system in the cytoplasm extends right into the DNA and represents the way that the needs of the cell can draw out exactly the part of the genome. that is needed at that moment for those conditions."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if viruses are essentially exosomes and if "catching a cold" is an internal process rather than an external infection.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and normally that's probably going on in a constructive way. All the time. But sometimes, for example, energy deficiency. If you're badly nourished, your cell can't get the energy it needs either to... maintain this very extensive organized crystal structure or to drive the selective process to pull out the DNA and to make it properly. Yes. Without the nutrition, without the basic building blocks that we talk about. Yeah, then it's beneficial communicating. Processes can go wrong, and instead of catching something useful, you catch a cold."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if this cellular communication process can go wrong, leading to illness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but the whole environment of the person governs or interacts with their energy state. So if you're working in a stressful environment. That stress increases your risk of something going wrong."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if stress contributes to this breakdown in cellular communication.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, except there are so many factors working against all of those basic things. Good quality food, good quality air and water. Yeah, what does that mean really? Yeah, and then beside that, you have the direct stresses, like when you immobilize an animal, just keeping it confined. The more confined it is, the more it goes into the depressed, helpless condition. And people have been confined so long by a restrictive, highly demanding economic environment that people are getting into this stress, helpless condition. And animal studies show that you can bring the animal out of that....helpless state, which greatly increases the likelihood of the animal giving up during a problem instead of exerting the energy that they do have. A psychological giving up and failing to use the right resources that are there."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a simple approach of good food, sunlight, water, and exercise is sufficient for health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I experimented drinking a gallon of orange juice and eating guavas and other extremely high vitamin C foods. And no trace of an allergy, but as little as two or three milligrams of the synthetic stuff would set off the allergies. And the chemist analyzed the traces. I think iron was the one he analyzed, but he said there were similar amounts of other... catalyst, catalytic heavy metals, just takes a few atoms of the wrong heavy metal to activate vitamin C and make it toxic. And when it's produced by plants, the plants couldn't maintain it, it would decompose in pre-radicals if they allowed. Even trace amounts of these heavy metals so somehow the plants protect their vitamin C and if you eat it from a plant source it goes right into your own tissues beneficially rather than harmfully."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's personal experience with vitamin C and allergies, and what might be causing the allergic reactions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the iron is reduced, the opposite of oxidation, but it takes the electron from the vitamin C and that puts the iron in a highly reactive toxic condition, right? The iron can then give its electron directly to water, breaking down the water molecule producing the the hydroxyl radical, which is the the worst indiscriminate destroyer free radical that's wow."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on the interaction between synthetic vitamin C, iron, and oxidation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the iron becomes the active ferrous form, where the ferric form can be safely stored. And the ferrous form creates the hydroxyl radical, the most toxic free radical. And then that damages our DNA. It creates effectively mutations and it turns on the whole inflammation process."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the connection between stress, iron, and the production of free radicals.

**RAY PEAT:** "Copper is a stronger oxidant than iron is and so when stress creates the ferrous form of iron, copper can turn it back into ferric iron. So, copper defends against activated iron by putting it back into the passive storage form."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between iron and copper.

**RAY PEAT:** "It probably does by competition, but the stress... I think it's more likely that stress is causing you to be unable to retain the copper efficiently, giving the iron a chance to butt in and knock the copper out of the place it should be. So it's both too much iron and too much stress that makes us lose copper. When you start a free radical type of stress, we put out a protein called metallothionein that has sulfur in it that sticks to heavy metals. And we put that out to defend against all of these toxic heavy metals, but in the process it tends to carry away the good copper as well. Copper binds strongly, so if you're poisoned by mercury, you'll produce metallocyanin and it will also carry out some zinc and copper, which is not good."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if too much iron can lower copper levels and how stress contributes to copper loss.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, men steadily accumulate it through life. The exceptions are starving in famine zones, for example, where no one gets any meat or eggs or seafood. But... Everyone eating a good, normal diet. The men steadily accumulated, and the incidence of heart attacks and heart disease, for example, correspond directly to the level of accumulated iron. So, men are well ahead of women, up to the age of 50 or so, because women are getting rid of some iron every month. Just an ounce or so of blood is enough to keep the iron down. But after menopause, women start accumulating iron like men, and they actually catch up with men because of the slight difference in the hormones. Estrogen makes you accumulate iron. Up to ten times as fast as a man does."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if most people have too much iron in their bodies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Iron, um, meat, meat is always a very rich source of iron. And, um, so if you eat any meat every day, it's likely to be adding to your iron excess. And meat also has too much phosphate relative to calcium and magnesium. And the combination of high phosphate and high iron... tend in the same direction to produce stress and pre-radical damage."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks where excess iron comes from, especially if not consuming iron-enriched foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's almost entirely the same thing. The free radical chemists thought that when you're under stress, you don't need the vitamin C as a catalyst. There are many other sources of electrons. In fact, anything that interferes with oxidation is going to tend to put any iron stores that have been tucked away safely in your cells. When you don't have oxygen sucking up all the stray electrons, a stray electron will activate iron that had been harmless. So the stress creates electrons that activate the iron the same way synthetic vitamin C activates the iron."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the connection between excess iron and heart issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several studies have found that people are healthier who give blood occasionally. Occasionally."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of giving blood.

**RAY PEAT:** "After a certain age, they can start having an age-promoting effect rather than a reparative effect. And so losing some of your old exosomes is probably part of what happens when an old person donates blood."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if donating blood might remove older, potentially age-promoting exosomes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, stopping eating is the most important thing. Oh, stop eating iron-enriched foods and... Yeah, and cut way back on meat. Meat. One or two eggs a day will provide the essential iron that you need. And emphasizing milk and cheese, for example, are notoriously iron deficient. Oh. And so the extent to which you're... Major calories come from cheese and milk. You're effectively subtracting iron from your body."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to get rid of excess iron in the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's probably helpful. You don't want to combine copper with any reductant, vitamin C or otherwise, in your stomach. Copper or iron can oxidize fatty acids, vitamins, other essential nutrients. So you don't want free copper combined with food, in the form of pure water on an empty stomach. Do it on an empty stomach and leave it alone for a bit."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the practice of drinking water that has sat in a copper vessel.

**RAY PEAT:** "I tested myself when I stopped taking any synthetic vitamin C. I found that my urine contained around 3,000 milligrams per day, months after I had stopped any supplement. Really? And I realized that the only foods that don't contain any vitamin C are grains, seeds, and nuts, everything else basically. All the way from algae and potatoes, clams, turnip greens are a great source, all living forms basically, except humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees produce their own vitamin C, so seafood and vegetables and fruits all contain. as much as we need."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's advisable to take food-based vitamin C supplements daily.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, oysters are a very good source of copper."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if shellfish are a good source of copper.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the most studied is heart disease symptoms but any of the degenerative things are activated by an inflammation inflammation loss of muscle mass for example"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about symptoms of excess iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "But when something like ferrous iron in the cell contacts water, it creates a free hydroxyl radical. An attached hydroxyl radical is part of everything normal, like sugar is full of attached. Hydroxy particles and inside the cell about a ratio of 8 to 1 of the vitamin C isn't in the form of ascorbic acid at all. The cell turns it into dehydroascorbate and so about, probably, about 1.5 to 1.5 of the 80 or 85 percent of the vitamin C in our bodies doesn't show up in a test, so it gives people the impression that meat and seafood and some plants don't contain any vitamin C when it's actually there in the form of dehydroascorbate. And dehydroascorbate works like oxygen to... protect against the excess electrons. So if you take in a huge amount of any reducing material, which could be ascorbic acid, or the various things that have been advertised as supplements, antioxidant supplements, those contribute. Potentially toxic electrons that can produce the hydroxyl radical if they reach an excess level in your stomach and bloodstream because where they're really going to do their work is inside the cell in the oxidized form. Many of these are flavonoids. Chemicals in oranges, for example, and guavas and vegetables and fruits, the colored yellow pigmented or orange pigmented molecules, historically they've been called antioxidants like vitamin C, but like dehydroscorbate, when they get in the cell, they are functioning as oxidants working with oxygen to defend you against the stress-induced free radical excess electrons."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on hydroxyl radicals and their relation to vitamin C and malaria drugs.

**RAY PEAT:** "If it agrees with you, then the chemicals are probably pure. You don't want a very large amount of potassium chloride because an overdose... can give you low blood pressure or even stop your heart. So the potassium chloride is one you want to not overdo. But athletes, to improve their endurance, can take a tablespoonful of baking soda in a glass of water before they are going to bicycle 20 or 50 miles or something. To improve their use of oxygen and sparing their glucose for energy."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the pros and cons of a concoction of potassium chloride, sodium chloride, baking soda, and Epsom salts.

**RAY PEAT:** "A lot of stress-inducers can cause, like I mentioned, the metallothionein protein is increased by stress of any sort. And among the things that it can carry out of the body and produce a deficiency of. Zinc is one of those and the deficiency of zinc has been connected with loss of smell and probably taste."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if COVID could be causing loss of taste and smell.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. Oyster shell and egg shell, calcium carbonate is very safe. If you take too much, just any pure chemical is going to be rejected by your stomach and intestine. Umm... Concentrated calcium or potassium chloride tablet, for example, has been known to effectively burn a hole into the stomach or intestine because the potassium chloride relaxes the intestine and then the concentrated pill sits there disturbing the water balance of the cells. Any concentrated large dose of table salt or vitamin B1 and anything in a high concentration can disturb your stomach and intestine fairly seriously."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if supplementing with calcium sources like oyster shell or eggshell is safe and if there's a risk of imbalance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're almost always crazily overpriced with an ultraviolet, a very strong ultraviolet lamp. If you don't look at it, it will produce some ozone and destroy viruses and bacteria in the air. And to a certain extent, detoxify some of the organic toxins if it's a fairly small space. And having a fan and a filter combined with a strong ultraviolet bulb, that's the basis for some of these air cleaning things that they often sell for $1,000. You can do it yourself."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effectiveness of air purifiers.

**RAY PEAT:** "If the baby is still nursing, sometimes it's the mother's. A diet that contains an allergen that gets into the milk and creates a skin problem in the baby. So if she's breastfeeding, the mother should carefully check her diet. And if the baby is eating foods, consider going through a......eliminating one food at a time for a week or so, and see if that clears it up."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for advice for a 14-month-old with eczema.

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends. If you're over 50, for example... You don't want to overdo the liver because of the high iron content. And for those people, shrimp, squid, clams, lobster, crabs... Those kind of things, yeah. All the shellfish, their blood consists of copper protein rather than iron containing hemoglobin. So they're a reliable source of a high concentration of copper. But it's interesting, some of the iron people talk about eating the beef liver because it's so high in copper which will lower the iron, but you said it's high in iron as well. Yeah, so you don't want to, I think something like two or three ounces a week is about all an older person would want."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how often one should eat beef liver for copper and nutritional requirements.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know of anything that precise in time but there have been some good evidence of that. Physicists who have looked at the solar cycles and the annual changes in heat production coming out of the sun and for many years the basic sun science has tended to predict an oncoming ice age with occasional fluctuations. Overheating sunspot cycles affect the heat output of the sun, but the general drift of predictions has been that the sun is going to cool off for hundreds of years, starting any time in the next several years."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about potential monumental events related to the sun and planets affecting the world in the coming fall.

**RAY PEAT:** "Keeping your blood sugar steady is the basic thing for regulating the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic. Every day, around sunset... but especially if we lie down in the dark, the nervous system shifts strongly to the parasympathetic side, and then at sunrise, for various reasons, it shifts back to the sympathetic or adrenaline-dominated side. And with old age, the tendency is to... exaggerate the downturn of the parasympathetic side, and it happens that many tumors grow fastest during the night and are stimulated by the hormones that control the parasympathetic side. And that's one of the things that the Kelly-Beard program does working on the pancreas. They emphasize the proteolytic enzymes as getting into the bloodstream, not just into the intestine. But it's now confirmed that proteolytic enzymes secreted into the intestine, a significant amount of that is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. So a well-functioning pancreas is producing. An increase of proteolytic enzymes in the bloodstream that according to their approach protects against the incipient cancer, especially in the reproductive system. That was Beard's approach that Kelly based his thinking on. But the fact that the parasympathetic system increases cell division. It produces conditions that exacerbate inflammation. For example, any pain syndrome usually is most intense between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Mortality is generally greatest in the early morning hours because of that shift towards excessive. Parasympathetic activity and keeping your pancreas under control so it doesn't produce too much insulin is a very important part of avoiding that age-related nocturnal inflammation."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to balance the autonomic nervous system through diet and supplements, referencing the work of Kelly and Gonzalez.

**RAY PEAT:** "Partly, but it's generally that... something is causing a block to the oxidation of the glucose. And too much fat in the diet, especially polyunsaturated fat. Ah, the poofers. Yeah, the fats compete with the sugar. And stress increases the release of fat into your bloodstream. And that happens at night. At night, always the falling blood glucose calls out. From storage, the free fatty acids, and those, that's one of the reasons darkness and long nights of winter, why aging happens, almost all human aging happens during the night. And when the nights are long in the winter, the aging process has more hours every day to act. And the lowering of the blood sugar and increase of free fatty acids during the night is part of what drives that degenerative stress. And so if you wake up after four hours of sleep, for example, and renew your muscle and liver glycogen stores and brain glycogen. With a glass of milk and orange juice, for example, that will interrupt the stress and like to get back to some restorative sleep."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about imbalanced blood sugar and pancreas issues, and how sugar intake relates to this.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it happens that orange juice has several things that reduce the work of the pancreas. The high potassium concentration, for example, in orange juice takes care of the insulin problem. Your pancreas doesn't have to make... much insulin at all if you're drinking orange juice because the the potassium handles it instead of needing insulin. And then there are all of these flavonoids, the yellow pigments, that block stress reactions and work like oxygen in the tissues. One of the functions of insulin is to keep your fatty acids in place in your tissues so they don't block your ability to oxidize glucose. And these flavonoids have exactly that function. They keep the cell able to keep oxidizing glucose."
**CONTEXT:** The host shares their experience of stable blood sugar while drinking orange juice and asks where the sugar is going.

**RAY PEAT:** "Your stress obviously would be one, I guess. Calcium is the other. Salt to a certain extent. You don't want to take a spoonful of salt. That would hurt your stomach. But just some salty things like pork rinds or salty tortilla chips or something at bedtime. And a glass or two of milk. Both calcium......and sodium help to activate the oxidative, proper oxidative energy production in the cells which normally they're impeded during the night by the free fatty acids and the combination of sodium and calcium will lower the stress hormones, especially parathyroid hormones. And those parathyroid hormones, every night it rises and blocks your mitochondrial oxidative processes, so the milk is, if you have enough vitamin D in your system, the calcium from the milk is in effect activating your mitochondria, restoring their ability to keep running, even in the presence of some fatty acids."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks what causes free fatty acids to impede energy production at night and what can be done about it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, those work together to hold down the stress hormones and let your mitochondria function. Darkness, in all animals that have been studied, the longer the darkness. The more the mitochondria deteriorate and that's a combination of many things but especially the rising fatty acids and parathyroid hormone. So the longer, so if people tend to sleep more during the winter just because it's dark, it's actually, they're not getting a lot of benefit out that are they? Well... Being awake during a long winter night, it's worse than being asleep. Oh, is it? Yeah, if you're going to have several hours of good, restful, deep sleep, that minimizes the damage to the mitochondria. I see. If you have to work during the night, you don't get the protective effect of... deep sleep. So it's still going to cause damage to the mitochondria to be in the dark, but it's better to pass the darkness in sleep."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if salt and calcium before bed are beneficial and how darkness affects mitochondria.

**RAY PEAT:** "But the short version is that when you ingest a highly polyunsaturated oil, it's like the problem with taking in a large amount of synthetic ascorbic acid. Any... reducing and oxidizing catalysts that are present are going to cause an explosive degrading oxidation of these highly oxidizable molecules. Studies have found that by the time fish oil gets into your bloodstream, it's already highly oxidized and it's these oxidized... free radical breakdown products of the fish oil that suppress the white blood cells and knock down your immune reactions. So for the first six months usually you get these anti-inflammatory effects that seem very beneficial. But you've probably heard of the radon baths. It's causing immediate relief from arthritis and they used to give x-ray treatments actually to a sore knee joint. And you'd get immediate knockdown of the inflammation in an arthritic joint from the ionizing radiation. But the anti-inflammatory effects of a big dose of... highly oxidizable fish oil is working by the same mechanism, knocking out the inflammatory white blood cells. But the effect, six months later, the process starts showing up the harmful effects. The radiation damage continues for 20 or 30 or 40 years later. And there haven't been such studies with the polyunsaturated oil overdoses, but the same kind of damage occurs. And so you would expect the long-range damage. What they see is that immune deficiency begins setting in after about six months of continuous supplementation of things such as fish oil. And part of the argument in relation to the brain is that the brain contains a lot of these highly polyunsaturated fats. But when you look at either humans over a period of several decades or in animal studies during a few years of an animal's development, when a cow or a person... or a dog or rat is newborn, the brain has been highly protected against fatty acid absorption. The brain makes its own polyunsaturated fats as needed from sugar. The brain first produces saturated fatty acids and then creates an omega minus nine. And then that can be further unsaturated, desaturated to produce the highly unsaturated omega nine series which are used in the brain. So those are the only PUFAs that the newborn brain contains. It's hard to find those deficient. in essential fatty acids, but really that's the state in which the brain has its greatest metabolic energy and its greatest capacity to learn. With aging, the brain gradually accumulates more and more polyunsaturated fats from the environment. And as it does that, it's......metabolic rate slows down exactly in proportion with its ability to learn."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks why Dr. Peat has a negative view of fish oil, given its perceived benefits for athletes and brain injury recovery.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's one of the benefits of addressing your carbohydrate....intake very carefully so that you get as much as 100% of your energy supply from carbohydrates so that you don't draw down free fatty acids. And that allows you to, when you do take in some environmental PUFA, you can oxidize that small amount safely. So if you keep just your general fat intake as low as possible, maybe 15% if possible of your diet as fat, but getting most of the rest of your energy from carbohydrates, not too much protein and as little fat as you can manage while still keeping a palatable, pleasant diet."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks what can be done to remove PUFAs from the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's two degrees Fahrenheit below normal. And that's enough to slow all of your biological processes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a basal temperature of 96.5°F is indicative of low thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's just closer to red light is what the near means. Yeah, close. But the body is always emitting infrared radiation, near-infrared and far-infrared. Broadcasting in the range that TV stations and cell phones use, some of our, 70% of our biological energy goes out as radiation, much of it in the roughly infrared spectrum. And if you surround yourself with an insulator and reflector, you quickly overheat, because... We count on losing two-thirds of our energy into the environment as radiation. Wow. And the problem with a natural or environmental heat added to the system like a hot bath, if you don't have your orange juice or milk before and during a prolonged heat wave. Hot baths, you might faint from the consuming your glycogen storage too fast because it does rev up your whole metabolic system and you need to feed it at a higher rate. So that's the only risk of something like... like saunas, near-infrared, far-infrared."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential counterproductive effects of near-infrared saunas for joint issues and for Dr. Peat's top three diet choices for joints.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's very protective. Oh, cool. And the great thing about orange juice, Dr. Pease, is it tastes so good. I mean, shoo, man. The body really knows what it's worth. It really knows, right. Yeah, you drink it and you go, boy, this really tastes good."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if drinking orange juice before a sauna is beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you should never experience prolonged pain. And where there's pain, there's inflammation. And if it proceeds too long, the inflammation will tend to produce fibrosis or excess collagen deposition....eventually atrophy of the good tissues. So stopping the pain is really not just symptom relief, but it's actually changing your biology. For example, aspirin and the anthotensin receptor blockers are working not just against the pain or immediate inflammation and hypertension or whatever, but they're stopping the... problem actually reversing or blocking the preceding degenerative processes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if chronic spine pain is solely due to inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Too much progesterone in a boy around puberty is able to interfere, prevent the testosterone production that will start around the age of nine or ten. The testosterone starts rising slowly and so you don't want to... be exaggerated in the youth, but it does help to protect an atrophy process such as dystrophy of the muscles."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the best approach for an 8-year-old boy with muscular dystrophy and if progesterone is safe.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. If they are watching their thyroid......and protecting their liver, the main thing is to not let estrogen production get out of control, because aging, menopause, all of the stressful changes tend to activate the process of estrogen inside cells, not in the ovaries, but inside every cell of the body. That stress turns on the......local production of estrogen, which isn't going to get measured in your bloodstream, but if you took out a piece of tissue from a stressed person over the age of 55 or so, you're going to find a higher amount of internal estrogen and the aromatase enzyme that produces it. And if your cholesterol......blood level doesn't increase steadily with age, your ability to produce your own progesterone and testosterone is going to be limited in proportion to the lack of available cholesterol."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if women going through perimenopause need testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "There have been several studies in which an electrical shocking device applied to the bite area will cause some kind of reaction that detoxifies the poison at the site. Otherwise, I would... I don't know what the specific treatment is, but veterinarians would probably have an anti-serum to it."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for advice for a dog bite.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, there are lots of confirmed damages that can happen. You were talking about exhaling exosomes. Those become concentrated even if they're your own exosomes. You're going to concentrate them and re-breathe them and any environmental stuff instead of escaping normally with each breath they're going to the extent that the You The mask does any filtering at all. It's going to also concentrate the debris inside the mask so that every breath is a little more concentrated in the stuff that failed to be filtered out by the mask. But you breathe it in and then there's a certain filtering effect that keeps it from going away."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the negative effects of wearing face masks.
