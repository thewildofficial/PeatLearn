**RAY PEAT:** "The flow of energy ultimately derived from the sun in the form of the sugar made by plants. And then the sugar which the mother consumes is provided to the fertilized ovum and in proportion to the oxygen and sugar, basically the source of energy and the recipient of the energy on oxygen. It's that flow from glucose to oxygen that shapes the human organism or any animal organism. And it follows that same principle that the flow of energy through the system creates order."

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental principle governing the development of organisms from conception to adulthood?

**RAY PEAT:** "The basic horrible assumption is that the universe is random. How random? That variation happens only by chance. And so they see evolution as something involving... roughly a billion years. But Sidney Fox, a biologist about 40, 50 years ago, doubted that time scale had any reality. And he put, instead of thinking of random changes in a primordial soup of an ocean, he said, what if it was just volcanic energy, like these volcanic vents under the ocean, teeming with life at very high temperature. He took some hot lava and dropped some amino acids on it, and then splashed water on the hot rock on the amino acids, and looked under the microscope, and he had what looked like bacteria. And in an afternoon, he developed a process so that high school students could create self-replicating, energy-consuming cell-like structures in an afternoon lab class. And so basically he demonstrated that chance is not at all involved in making proteins and DNA. He added the bases that are used in making up DNA and RNA and these protein microspheres, self-organizing....integrated and made chains, made DNA-like chains out of the base precursors. So, it's a sort of a self-guiding. Cosmically guided process rather than random chance over time."

**CONTEXT:** What is the flaw in the neo-Darwinist view of evolution, and what alternative perspective on the origin of life has been demonstrated?

**RAY PEAT:** "No, but they can coexist with us harmlessly. One of the people I got interested in in the 1940s, one of these anomalies that has been excluded from biology and medicine, was Frederick Koch, and he developed a cancer treatment about 1915 to 1920. He was a professor at the University of Michigan. And the AMA didn't like his attitude, and so after one or two papers were published describing his work treating cancer successfully, no one would publish any more of his papers. He lived decades after that doing his own work, but he was written out of science and medicine, and he showed that the treatment that he used for cancer patients worked for infections, and it worked simply by activating the oxidative energy system, restoring mitochondrial energy production, which activated the immune system. And prevented inflammation, and in the process it made any bacteria which were present, made them harmless by providing them what they needed, preventing stress to the bacteria, at the same time that it prevented stress to the host organism. And some of his followers in Canada tested his materials on cows with infected udders, mastitis, and showed that they could demonstrate the infecting organisms coming out in the milk, and when the cow was treated their oxidative metabolism improved and the infection disappeared, their udder became unenflamed and normal, but the number of bacteria present increased. The bacteria had become harmless and thrived without hurting the organism at all."

**CONTEXT:** How can the presence of bacteria be managed in a way that is beneficial to the host organism?

**RAY PEAT:** "So what does that mean for us when we think about oxidative stress? It's exactly the wrong idea. People in the 1960s had already demonstrated that it was a wrong approach, but for 50 years the mainstream has gone crazy on the idea of preventing oxidative stress with antioxidants. Vitamin C was sort of a cultural icon, the basic antioxidant, but in cells it is present in an oxidized form. I experienced this myself in the 1960s. I decided to stop eating all vitamin C rich foods or supplements and analyze the amount of vitamin C in my urine. It dropped slightly, but I was still putting out 2,000 milligrams a day in my urine weeks after I stopped eating any. That got me interested in what's going on energetically and oxidatively with the vitamin C. Where was it coming from? Meat and milk turn out to have a lot of vitamin C in them, but it isn't present in the form that the ordinary tests can detect. In meat, it's almost all 10 times more vitamin C is present in the form of dehydroascorbate, a fully oxidized form of the molecule rather than ascorbic acid. So the tests simply are blind to the amount of vitamin C in our diet. Because they think it should be in the reducing antioxidant form, but it functions in the cell as an oxidant protecting against oxidative damage by maintaining normal oxidation, which is the flow of electrons all the way down to oxygen. As long as the oxygen is sucking up the excess electrons, they won't go wrong and produce damage. So you want to intensify normal oxidation. And if you cut off the oxygen supply, that's where you get the so-called oxidative damage. Because the reductive pressure, the excess of electrons, shifts centers like iron atoms. It reduces them, gives them an extra electron, which they will donate to just about anything, including water, making the water toxic. So when you cut off the oxygen as the oxidizing source, then water becomes a random oxidizer, and you get what they call oxidative damage. But it's really the result of just exactly the opposite, too much reduction for our oxidative capacity."

**CONTEXT:** What is the true function of Vitamin C in the body, and why is the concept of "oxidative stress" often misunderstood?

**RAY PEAT:** "No, but we're getting it from unsuspected sources. Unsuspected sources, like the meat and milk? Yeah, meat and milk and eggs, the organism is making it themselves and having it right inside their cells, but in an oxidized form, which is stabilizing their oxidative system. So it's stabilizing their oxidative system, and it goes in as an oxidative form. So that is no way detrimental to us, right? No, that's the form we use. That's the form we use. Mm-hmm. But that's not the form that the scientists say you got to have so much vitamin C and blah, blah, blah, and oranges and whatever. Yeah, they're saying it acts as an antioxidant, but its real function is as an oxidant. The system where proteins are put together in the cell, they call it the endoplasmic reticulum, but it's just a location or system that forms proteins. One of vitamin C's main functions is to keep the oxidized state there for folding the proteins properly, keeping the sulfur atoms in the proteins in a ready-to-be oxidized state to lock the protein into a stable condition. Without the vitamin C, the protein folding goes wrong. And too many electrons, too little oxygen, will overwhelm that oxidizing function of the vitamin C."

**CONTEXT:** Where do our bodies obtain Vitamin C, and how does its form in meat and milk differ from the commonly understood "antioxidant" form?

**RAY PEAT:** "If it's the right amount in the well-nourished person, it goes into the cell and is used as a dehydroascorbate. And some of it circulating as the reduced form will protect as an antioxidant. It will, for example, put mercury into a reduced form, which isn't dangerous. But it also can put iron and copper into a reduced form, which is dangerous in those molecules."

**CONTEXT:** What happens when individuals supplement with ascorbic acid or other forms of Vitamin C?

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I stopped in 1967 or 8. Yeah, you used to stop, nothing at all? No. And I stopped having a habitual cough right after I stopped taking the vitamin C. And so after that one, I would see someone with a habitually runny nose or cough. I would suggest they stop vitamin C. And it generally worked almost always."

**CONTEXT:** Do you personally supplement with Vitamin C, and what have you observed when advising others to stop taking it?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think she's very wrong and he's very right. Oh, really? Okay. He has pretty much turned the culture around on the issue of vitamin D. And I think its main function, not the calcium-borne building function that they talk about, but I think its even more basic function is that it reduces the parathyroid hormone. And the parathyroid hormone is an activator of the kidney production of what they call activated vitamin D, 1,25 hydroxy. The one they measure, the one they measure on the blood test. Well, sometimes they measure that, but the usual one they measure is 25 hydroxy. Oh, 25, right, yeah. And they called the one made in the kidney the activated vitamin D. And people who study that go off on a separate line of thinking. But several years ago, a mutant mouse was found that aged very fast in all of the standard ways, osteoporosis, dementia, wrinkles, gray hair, and so on. And the mutant gene. It was called Clatho or Clotho after a Greek goddess or some mythological figure. And the Clatho gene now is recognized as a regulator of calcium metabolism and it has an anti-parathyroid. Hormone effect in many parts of the system and the vitamin D that we take or that we get from the sunlight works to reinforce Clatho, the anti-aging gene or protein and at the same time it's lowering the parathyroid hormone. And in the process it lowers the so-called active vitamin D and I think the failure to look at the relation of the so-called active vitamin D to the circulating 25 hydroxy form and see how that compares to all of these indicators of health that have been neglected, not just the bones, but the rate of aging and that will help people to unravel things and see why the strange range of health issues that Halek talks about, how they really fit together and it all has to do with this reductive oxidative balance, the flow of energy and the parathyroid hormone rises when we're deficient, when our diet is deficient in calcium and magnesium and vitamin D or we aren't getting enough sunlight. And it's part of an emergency system that creates tissue repair and regeneration on an emergency scale, but that diverts energy from the long range purpose of the organism. The overriding large purpose is to be conscious. The emergency purpose is to repair tissue damage and these hormones such as parathyroid hormone are working on the emergency scale and diverting energy from our big biological function consciousness."

**CONTEXT:** What is the primary function of Vitamin D, and how does it relate to aging and parathyroid hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, 50 to 80 I think there's pretty consistent evidence that that's good."

**CONTEXT:** What is the optimal range for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels?

**RAY PEAT:** "The older you get the less cholesterol there is in your skin. Oh, cholesterol. Yeah, it's basically a cholesterol deficiency in the skin that makes older people need much, much more sunlight."

**CONTEXT:** Why do older individuals require more sunlight for Vitamin D production?

**RAY PEAT:** "It's on one side of the research, it's helping the cloto protein to work. But the side that I've been paying more attention to is lowering the parathyroid hormone, which is the other side of the rising function of the cloto. And all kinds of stress increase to a toxic effect, the parathyroid hormone, a deficiency of salt or sodium in your diet, or the inability to retain sodium properly causes the parathyroid hormone to rise the same way a calcium deficiency does. And so the adrenals under stress, or especially in a sodium salt deficiency, the adrenals produce aldosterone at a higher level. And aldosterone directly blocks your mitochondrial energy production and increases the parathyroid hormone activity, which itself. functions by blocking your mitochondrial oxidation and making up for it with glycolytic energy production, which shifts you over into the reductive stress, the failure of oxidation."

**CONTEXT:** What are the physiological effects of optimal Vitamin D levels (50-80 ng/mL) on the body?

**RAY PEAT:** "TSH is increased by stress hormones. So a person with low thyroid doesn't make their oxygen turn into carbon dioxide. They don't have the carbon dioxide needed to retain sodium, and so they lose sodium. That activates the adrenals to produce aldosterone, and the aldosterone interferes with the mitochondria and increases parathyroid hormone. The TSH being activated by stress is one of the, in itself, it is a signal of stress as well as being a product of stress, and the TSH goes around irritating or creating inflammation, for example, in the blood vessels. Tending to work with parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone is what shifts calcium out of the bones into the blood vessels, and TSH in excess works in that same direction calcifying the blood vessels, increasing blood pressure, so the traditional recognition that hypothyroid people. With the diagnostic high TSH, hypothyroidism goes with a great risk of hypertension and related diseases. But it turns out that it's the TSH directly creating much of that. Damage to the circulatory system and it has inflammation promoting effects in the bone marrow. Everywhere it has been studied it has a tissue irritating effect. So the stress condition creating more adrenaline and cortisol, for example, these will compensate the hormones will suppress the TSH and reduce inflammation. So the stress which is creating the hypothyroid need for more thyroid production, tending to increase TSH. It will also produce more cortisol and adrenaline to lower the TSH defensively. So in the defensive condition, you will look like your thyroid is normal because the cortisol is holding the TSH down, protecting against inflammation. But it makes TSH useless as an indicator of your thyroid status because it's just as much an indicator of your stress status."

**CONTEXT:** How are TSH levels related to parathyroid hormone and thyroid function, particularly in the context of stress?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's good to have close to zero on TSH as long as everything else is going smoothly. And how do you know if everything else is going smoothly? Stable blood sugar, feeling good, all the good functions, good sound sleep, for example, takes energy to the brain to make the brain relax and go to sleep."

**CONTEXT:** What is the ideal TSH level, and how can one assess if their thyroid function is optimal?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, traditional thyroid doctors like Brenda Barnes usually started with 30 milligrams of a well-standardized product like at that time it was armor thyroid but I have seen two people who reacted very surprisingly to 15 milligrams, a fourth of a grain, with heart problems. And I realized what's happening is that your cells, especially your big muscle cells, retain magnesium and calcium in a balance. Magnesium is a relaxant and thyroid is needed for the muscles to retain the proper amount of magnesium and your heart has that same magnesium retaining stabilizing effect when your thyroid is good. But if you're suddenly increasing the thyroid when you've been deficient your muscles, your leg muscles, will compete with your heart muscle for that trace of magnesium in your diet and your heart arteries will constrict and you'll get a heart pain. So it's very important to make sure that your diet includes plenty of magnesium when you're starting to use thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** What precautions should be taken when starting thyroid supplementation, particularly regarding magnesium intake?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, about 30 years ago, the standard for almost 100 years was Armour Thyroid, but... The Armour Company sold their trade name and business, and immediately the formula started changing. It went through about 10 years of periodic changes of the recipe, and so I lost confidence in that one. Before that happened, there had been several thyroid products sold through pharmacies for about 30 or 40 years, and someone sent 10 of these products to an analytical lab that could detect tissue, an immunological test, and they found that 8 of the 10 samples bought in a drugstore as prescription thyroid, USP, 8 of the 10 contained no thyroid tissue at all. Really? Wow. And that was probably deliberate fraud, but it's somewhat of a refined technology of making good thyroid product. You have to know that you're getting the actual thyroid gland. I've seen people mistake lymph nodes for a thyroid gland, so you have to know that the person producing the thyroid gland crude product knows what they're doing. Then you have to know that it's being processed carefully, simply removing the fat with a solvent so that it's... stable, doesn't deteriorate with oxygen exposure and then that they don't extract part of the chemistry before they sell it as a thyroid product. Some of the companies are taking out thyrocalcitonin, which is one of the natural hormones that should be in the thyroid product. But almost all of the thyroid products made in the U.S. now claim that they contain a certain amount per grain, a certain amount of T4 and a certain amount of T3. But there should be none of those. They shouldn't be in there? No, it should be thyroglobulin with only... the slightest trace amounts of any of the actual hormones, that's the characteristic of the thyroid product is that it's almost pure protein defatted and we digest it and in the process of digesting the thyroglobulin our enzymes release the T4 and T3 and some T2 hormone. It shouldn't be in the product but I think the FDA encouraged this misleading really, really false labeling."

**CONTEXT:** What are the issues with commercially available thyroid supplements, and what constitutes a truly effective thyroid product?

**RAY PEAT:** "No, it's a mixture of a 4 to 1 ratio of T4 to T3, and the same company makes a pure T3 called Xenomel. Xenomel."

**CONTEXT:** What is the composition of Xenoplus, and what is the name of the pure T3 product from the same company?

**RAY PEAT:** "Glycine is something like 35 or 40 percent of the amino acids. And glycine and proline have a cell-stabilizing anti-inflammatory effect. And gelatin is completely free of the amino acids that are pro-inflammatory, anti-thyroid, and even carcinogenic. Tryptophan is a carcinogenic amino acid promoting inflammation, excess serotonin, for example, and cysteine can be pro-inflammatory. Methionine is another amino acid that is not in glycine. Methionine is a longevity-shortening amino acid. Gelatin, being free of those three potentially toxic amino acids, is a very protective protein for a mature person who isn't growing. So that's one of the reasons why you like the gelatin product, if you want to do a protein powder rather than something else, whey, or bean, or rice, or whatever."

**CONTEXT:** What are the key amino acids in gelatin, and why is it considered a protective protein?

**RAY PEAT:** "If the manufacturer of the powder or the tablets used oyster shells or eggshells, they would get a pure, safe product, but you can't count on that. When people have analyzed various calcium carbonate products, the eggshell was always the purest, very close to oyster shells. If the oysters are taken from a polluted part of the ocean, they can have some contaminants, but eggshells are consistently the least chemically contaminated source of calcium carbonate."

**CONTEXT:** Why are eggshells a preferred source of calcium carbonate compared to commercially produced tablets?

**RAY PEAT:** "No, it's actually filling in for potential calcium deficiency. The sodium is tending to lower your adrenal aldosterone production. Aldosterone is an age-promoting, inflammation-promoting, fibrosis-promoting hormone, so keeping that low by a little supplement of sodium is good. The bicarbonate is turned, once it gets in the bloodstream, it's absorbed by cells. If they happen to be deficient in carbon dioxide, they can turn the bicarbonate into carbon dioxide, acidifying cells, keeping them in the protected oxidizing state. So a little baking soda is generally very protective. Athletes at the start of a marathon bicycle race, for example, have taken a tablespoon of baking soda and greatly increased their endurance. Lots of people take a teaspoon at a time, but even a smaller amount can be protective."

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of consuming baking soda, and how does it relate to calcium deficiency and adrenal function?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's probably okay if it doesn't smell like turkeys. Yeah, you don't smell like turkeys. And lanolin, it's a very stiff oil, so it helps to thin it with a little coconut oil or MCT or something to make it spreadable. But besides being a protecting, sealing agent so your skin doesn't dehydrate, it tends to hold moisture in the skin just by forming a seal. But at the same time, it's I think it's more than 50 percent of a precursor steroid to cholesterol. So I think it's to the extent that it can be dissolved, like if it's maybe olive oil or MCT or something thinner, to the extent that it can dissolve into the skin, it's going to have an anti-aging effect. by supporting the local production of cholesterol."

**CONTEXT:** What are the properties of sulfated castor oil (turkey red oil) as a soap, and what are the benefits of lanolin as a moisturizer?

**RAY PEAT:** "Gelatin is the only protein I know of that is stable during dehydration."

**CONTEXT:** What makes gelatin a unique protein powder?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, 30 grams of the book on the medical use of gelatin that was published, I think, about 1940 and distributed by, I think, the Great Lakes Gelatin has been distributing the book. It described treating diabetes and colitis, for example, with, I think, 30 grams a day was the most they recommended, but I've known people to use 60 grams a day with very good results. I think it's, I have to look at the cam, but then about 10 grams of protein per tablespoon. That'd be a lot if you wanted to get 60, six tablespoons, but you know, I don't know if it works."

**CONTEXT:** What are the recommended dosages for gelatin, and what conditions has it been used to treat?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you cool it and it becomes solid. Yeah, just solid, yeah. Yeah, so that's what you want."

**CONTEXT:** What is the characteristic of a gelatin-rich bone broth?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and vitamin D and thyroid. That'll do it, huh?"

**CONTEXT:** What are some specific remedies for breaking down chronic inflammation in older individuals?

**RAY PEAT:** "Studies in New Mexico and Switzerland have shown heart disease decreases in proportion to increasing altitude. Really? And every thousand feet, they saw about a, I think it was about a 2% decrease in mortality every thousand feet you end up."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between altitude and heart disease mortality?

**RAY PEAT:** "Your body retains more carbon dioxide when you adapt slowly. If you rush up to 8,000 feet in a day, you might get altitude sickness. But the people who are low thyroid at sea level and think they're breathing okay are really hyperventilating chemically at sea level. And when those people go suddenly up to high altitude, their hyperventilation shows up and they get swelling of the lungs and brain and get sick. But if you adapt slowly, it will tend to correct hypothyroidism. Your T3 production goes up and your blood becomes more fluid even though more concentrated, carries oxygen more effectively. Very interesting. And inflammation goes down, that's the main thing. The Russians for about 50 years were doing high altitude therapy for allergies, arthritis, heart disease, and they even did studies in animals at least in which sending the cancer treated animals that should 100% die of cancer to 17,000 feet altitude, about 50% of them threw off the cancer."

**CONTEXT:** How does adapting to high altitude affect thyroid function and inflammation, and what are the observed effects on cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** "The very low countries, if you look at the three countries that have been number one for suicide, extremely high suicide rates in the last 10 or 20 years, South Korea, I think it was Lithuania, and Bangladesh. Very low altitude countries, extremely high suicide rates, and then the lowest suicide rates in the world have generally been Mexico, Colombia, and Bolivia. High altitude countries, yeah, interesting. And I think that's the actual effect of altitude. It improves health and reduces depression."

**CONTEXT:** What is the correlation between altitude and suicide rates, and what is the actual effect of altitude on mental health?

**RAY PEAT:** "If that includes milk and cheese and eggs and oysters, that's a pretty good diet, but if you don't include the bones or the milk and cheese, then it can be a dangerously high phosphate-rich diet. Phosphate, yeah. You should take in about equal amounts of calcium and phosphorus. And if you eat only the muscle meats, then you have something like a 10 to 1 ratio of phosphate to calcium, which is very pro-inflammatory and pro-degenerative disease."

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential risks of a carnivore diet, particularly concerning phosphate and calcium balance?

**RAY PEAT:** "The reason the Chinese developed the white rice. A product of thousands of years ago is that the fats in rice are very highly unsaturated and get rancid almost immediately in a warm temperature. In a cold climate they fall off the plant. When the weather is cool, and they live during the winter, and then sprout when the weather is warmer. And so the polyunsaturated fat is not harmful to the plant. But if you store it in the unprocessed condition, then it's very likely to be rancid by the time you eat it. And then when you assimilate those fats, they proceed to become more oxidized in your body. So I think the traditional Chinese way of making white rice and then cooking it. Thoroughly. It's a good source of carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** Why did the Chinese traditionally process rice into white rice, and what are the implications of consuming unprocessed rice?

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't think it's a problem if you have good digestion and good thyroid function. It's a potential problem if your calcium metabolism is going anywhere. You can form calcium oxalate stones, but calcium deficiency in your diet is one of the things that increases the stress hormones. A parathyroid hormone makes you mishandle calcium. That increases the tendency to form stones."

**CONTEXT:** What factors influence the risk of oxalate toxicity and the formation of calcium oxalate stones?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the ultra-pasteurized tastes funny. And that goes with a slight loss of vitamin A, for example, and vitamin C. I think it's about a 20 or 30 percent loss, but mostly it's a taste problem when it's ultra-pasteurized. But the good tasting pasteurized milk has, I think it has been held at the temperature only for a few seconds and then quickly cooled. And it can taste just as good as unpasteurized milk."

**CONTEXT:** What are the differences between pasteurized and ultra-pasteurized milk, and how does heat processing affect nutrients and taste?

**RAY PEAT:** "Similar. If it's overcooked, the cholesterol is progressively oxidized, so quick cooking at high temperature. For example, they've compared different meats. Salmon was the most interesting because poached salmon had many times more toxic, oxidized cholesterol than quickly broiled salmon. Same with steak. If you slow cook a steak, it tastes bad, and part of that is your fats and cholesterol have been seriously oxidized. So that's what the kind of overcooked flavor is when you overcook meat. It's an oxidation of the fat in there? Yeah, and if you can bring it up to temperature in just two or three minutes, that's best like a flash pasteurization of milk. It preserves the flavor and the nutrients."

**CONTEXT:** How does the cooking method for meat and fish affect the oxidation of cholesterol and fat, and what is the optimal cooking approach?

**RAY PEAT:** "Sugar is the protective thing, and when your sugar is low, your free fatty acids go up and poison all of your tissues. Not just the liver, but your brain, everything is exposed to stress when the sugar is low. Those people with that slight shift in the balance of porphyrin metabolism, estrogen causes a drop in blood sugar and a surge of porphyrin. Just having consistent sugar intake, keeping your thyroid steady so that your blood sugar doesn't drop easily, and having frequent orange juice, for example, as a source of sugar is usually all it takes to prevent the attacks."

**CONTEXT:** How can sugar intake and thyroid function help manage conditions like EPP (Erythropoietic Protoporphyria) and porphyrin metabolism imbalances?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, people have told me that they have taken honey secretly to the hospital for someone that was in serious condition, gave them a couple of tablespoons, person got up and left the hospital."

**CONTEXT:** What are the remarkable effects of honey in critical health situations?

**RAY PEAT:** "One thing it does is lower your prostaglandin production. It competes with arachidonic acid for making the pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, so it can reduce inflammation. But when it's taken into the bloodstream, by the time it gets to the bloodstream, it's oxidizing. A large percent of it is oxidized before it gets into the tissue. Some of it does reach the brain, but much of it circulates as breakdown products, and these poison the immune system, interfere with white blood cells, and that can powerfully stop an inflammatory process. But if it continues for more than a few days, that suppresses your resistance to bacterial or fungal infections, too. So after a period of about six months, you start seeing serious damage to the immune system when people are eating too much fish."

**CONTEXT:** What are the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation, and what are the potential long-term consequences of excessive intake?

**RAY PEAT:** "I wrote a newsletter about that, and there is a lot of literature showing that babies in particular, it's the omega-3 fatty acids that are damaged by blue light or ultraviolet light, but bright light in general causes retinal damage specifically by the changes in these highly unsaturated fats. So there's a lot of literature showing that they are damaging to the retina. The threes are?"

**CONTEXT:** How do omega-3 fatty acids relate to retinal damage, particularly in infants exposed to light?

**RAY PEAT:** "Probably, but I haven't seen any research on that. It's very interesting stuff, but I don't know exactly what it would be doing to the thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** Could breathing hydrogen gas have an effect on thyroid regulation?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it would depend a lot on what the bear was eating. Some bears eat lots of berries, lots of fruit, and others load up on salmon when the salmon are running. So if they were eating berries, I think it would be pretty much like beef fat."

**CONTEXT:** What factors determine the quality and suitability of bear fat for consumption?

**RAY PEAT:** "Part of it is that lots of fruits stimulate the intestine and accelerate the movement through the intestine and so they can keep the bacteria happy and harmless. One of the problems with a pure fruit diet over the long run is most fruits are very low in iron. There was a study in California of migrant fruit picker families. The kids were, they found that their average hemoglobin was at 10 way down in the, in the Anemic range because they were eating lots of oranges, but but they were extremely free of disease and infection, healthier healthier than their well-fed neighbors. So I think that you can tolerate a fairly low iron intake if everything else is good. And there isn't enough availability of a variety of fruits, I think, for people in the United States to... you might end up eating a lot of bananas and dates and easy to store and ship. And those those happen to be high in serotonin and can create problems of inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential nutritional challenges of a fruit-heavy diet, particularly regarding iron intake and serotonin levels?

**RAY PEAT:** "I suspect that that is a part of it because when you stress a plant it produces defensive irritating chemicals intended to kill insects or predators. And I think the way bananas are grown is very stressful to the plant."

**CONTEXT:** What might cause bananas to be higher in serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** "People that love fruit, where would you get that from? I'm not sure. In some of the studies of of the Pacific Islanders who live on a potato diet, once a year they have pork feasts. One week a year. And that's enough iron apparently. My goodness. Isn't that funny? Yeah. One day a year. I mean, holy. One week a year. One week a year they just eat a lot of pork. Yeah. But let's see, doesn't molasses have a lot of iron? Black strap? Yeah, but it also has some irritants that I don't think it's a safe regular source of iron. Better than an iron deficiency, but not a, I think, eggs or oysters or something would be a much safer way to do it."

**CONTEXT:** How can individuals who consume a fruit-rich diet ensure adequate iron intake, and what are the considerations regarding molasses as an iron source?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the information is gradually getting organized to the point that we'll be able to understand which fruits, for example, complement each other. You can get all the protein you need just from fruits. Potatoes are extremely good as a protein source, but with the right choice of fruits you can get your protein just from fruits. But it involves choosing with information about which fruits should balance your whole nutritional pattern."

**CONTEXT:** What is the future of dietary understanding, and how can fruits and potatoes contribute to complete protein intake?
