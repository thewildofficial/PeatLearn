**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the ocean is warming up and when that happens we get extra rain. Humid air condenses. I saw the... Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. The nighttime rain is the traditional Northwest weather, but we had been a changing over the last 30 or 40 years until it looked more like a Midwest climate. Summer rain and drier winters. But I think we're back to the old rain in the winter. Night and winter. I saw where the farmers Albinac, they use sunspots and they're predicting a cold and woolly winter this year for a lot of the country. We'll see how accurate that is. Yeah, I think the sun and the submarine volcanoes are really the important thing changing the weather over the long term rather than carbon dioxide. Submarine volcanoes? Yeah, the Pacific is really pretty full of volcanoes that actually are warming the ocean and they have cycles, like sunspot cycles. So they put out a lot of heat down there and they're going on and we don't really know, they're spitting up. Yeah, and they're teeming with life. They're primitive life forms that can live at extremely high temperatures. So the ocean's warm and that causes all kinds of things to happen in the jet stream and weather changes more dramatically?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about weather patterns and predictions, leading Dr. Peat to discuss the influence of submarine volcanoes and ocean warming on climate, contrasting it with the focus on carbon dioxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's hard to imagine that carbon dioxide is like the devil. Don't we want to keep more carbon dioxide in us by not breathing so fast? Yeah, one of the anti-climate change people, he gets up on the box and lectures in London. He has a little sign that says carbon dioxide is the gas of life. Many people believe that. Gosh, how could you make it so political stuff? Who knows what's going on with all that?"
**CONTEXT:** Following the discussion on weather and climate, the host brings up the politicalization of carbon dioxide, prompting Dr. Peat's perspective on its role as a "gas of life."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were times, like when I was living in Mexico City, when it was hard to get good milk, the rich people would send their maids out at dawn to buy up all of the good milk. And so for three or four years I went very light on milk, but the rest of my life I've been a big milk drinker, gallon a day."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's long-term milk consumption, leading him to share his history with milk, including a period where access to quality milk was difficult.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, about two and a half quarts, I think, averaging now."
**CONTEXT:** In response to the host's question about his current milk intake, Dr. Peat clarifies his daily consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think some of that is historical metaphor, but there is some basis to it, undoubtedly because it's now known that... Every tissue has its rate of protein turnover, and as your nutrients change, the food you eat guides the turnover of the proteins, so that you get proteins suitable for the type of food you're eating. And every tissue, like bone, is extremely slow to turn over. Most of its substance, your iver is very fast, the skin and intestine are extremely fast, just a few days, and they're completely remade, and the heart has a slower rate of protein turnover, but everything, the mitochondria, the energy-producing apparatus, is turning over constantly. At its own rate, and I think, in general, the faster a tissue turns over, because it's kept warm and well-nourished and unstressed, high stress will make you turn over your thymus gland and muscles and skin very fast, but in a destructive way. But a good, warm, well-fed condition, you do have a constant turnover. And renewal of your tissues, it's like a streaming. New cells are being born as the old ones are being eaten up. And so you clean out the debris at a regular pace according to the tissue."
**CONTEXT:** The host reads a passage from an Ayurvedic text suggesting milk nourishes all seven tissues in one day. Dr. Peat explains the concept of protein turnover in different tissues and how nutrients influence this process, validating the underlying principle.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, sure. Living outside of Mexico City where they have cows or goats. That's the custom. Everyone puts a big pot of milk on in the morning and brings it to a boil. Usually they skim off the fat that rises. And make special dishes out of that, or else feed it to the cats and chickens."
**CONTEXT:** The host inquires about the practice of boiling milk, prompting Dr. Peat to describe this custom from his time in Mexico City.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if a person likes it, they have dishes and puddings and things that they make out of it, they use it as a sauce on tacos and such."
**CONTEXT:** Following up on the practice of skimming milk fat, the host asks about its use, and Dr. Peat explains its culinary applications.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, surprisingly the damage nutritionally is very small. It oxidizes some of the vitamin A and a tiny bit of the vitamin C, but milk is still basically the best source of all of the nutrients when you compare it to milk. For the number of calories and protein in it, it has all of the nutrients except iron."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the nutritional impact of boiling milk, especially for those consuming non-raw milk. Dr. Peat assesses the minimal nutritional loss and reiterates milk's overall nutrient density.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, each has its medical uses. I haven't been a big fan of them. Mexicans put cinnamon on their chocolate."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of adding cardamom and cinnamon to boiled milk. Dr. Peat shares his limited experience and a cultural observation.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, A1 is found in the Holsteins and then A2 is more in the Jerseys or the Guernseys. When I was little we had a Holstein and then... when I was about eight or nine we got a Jerseys which we had for 10 or 15 years and I don't really see any difference and I think a lot of it is just marketing to sell something for a higher higher price if you have the right kind of cow."
**CONTEXT:** The host brings up the distinction between A1 and A2 milk and their supposed digestibility. Dr. Peat explains the origins of A1 and A2 milk and expresses skepticism about the marketing claims.

**RAY PEAT:** "My own preference is for cow's milk just because I'm more familiar with that. When I was in the first or second grade we had a whole scene and the neighbors had goats and their goat milk. It was very strong smelling and so I learned to prefer cow's milk but if you handle the goats right the goat milk will taste as good as cow's milk."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's opinion on cow's milk versus goat's milk, and he shares his personal preference based on early experiences.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, milk has always, the last 40 years, has been the bulk of my daily food. When I would drink a gallon a day, I would maybe have a couple of quarts of orange juice and some cheese or sardines or something for a supper snack and eggs for breakfast. And that keeps you going, that will keep you going. Without losing, you know, keep your muscles going."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of milk in Dr. Peat's diet, and he elaborates on how milk has been a primary food source for him, supporting his energy and muscle maintenance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I noticed after about 10 years of just sitting and studying, my shoulders got less. Rounded muscles. I could see in photographs that my shoulder muscles were smaller because I wasn't working regularly. But just moving around, my leg muscles have stayed huge. After not going skiing, for example, for 10 years, someone told me that my leg muscles must be... getting weak from just sitting around reading all the time. But I tested myself doing one-legged sit-ups, and every 10 years I would do 10 one-legged sit-ups, and didn't notice a significant dropping off with time. I haven't done it for 15 years, though. I don't know whether I could still do 10."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about maintaining muscle mass and preventing sarcopenia, leading Dr. Peat to describe his personal experience with muscle maintenance despite a sedentary lifestyle, and his self-testing methods.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, when good stuff is available. It should be thoroughly ripened. The commercial stuff They they are used to selling unripe oranges and so if they accidentally get ripe oranges they add acetic acid to it A lot of the for example the concentrated or canned varieties Very often have acid added but the acid etches the enamel off your teeth So ripe oranges are safer in every way so"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's continued enjoyment of orange juice. Dr. Peat emphasizes the importance of ripeness and warns about the addition of acetic acid in commercial products, which can damage tooth enamel.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah Clear water, maybe even baking soda if it's very acidic."
**CONTEXT:** Following the discussion on orange juice and its acidity, the host asks about rinsing the mouth, and Dr. Peat suggests using clear water or baking soda.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I know people who do as much as as a teaspoon two or three times a day and think it improves their and endurance and strength. But even a fourth of a teaspoon two or three times a day, people say that it helps reduce inflammation and I know people who used to get swollen legs when taking a long airplane trip and when they took a teaspoon of baking soda in water before getting on the plane, they stopped having those swollen feet."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the regular use of baking soda and its potential benefits. Dr. Peat shares anecdotal evidence of improved endurance, reduced inflammation, and relief from swollen legs during air travel.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the sodium lowers your aldosterone very quickly and aldosterone is a general stress hormone that tends to go up with cortisol which... damages tissues but aldosterone uh... has uh... causes a shift towards inflammation and fibrosis so you the chronic elevation of aldosterone leads to heart disease and circulatory disease and kidney disease so chronic intake of a little extra sodium such as you get with uh... that uh... small doses of baking soda that helps a chronic uh... anti-stress effect keeping your albastroin lower and that lets you lose the sodium fairly quickly and the bicarbonate part is quickly changed uh... there's an enzyme carbonic anhydrase that changes carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and bicarbonate back into carbon dioxide at the surface. When you're losing the sodium through your kidneys, your cells change bicarbonate into carbon dioxide, which is more soluble in the living cell. So it goes out of your blood more or less at the same rate that the sodium is leaving your blood. Bicarbonate into your cells, sodium out of your body. So what it amounts to is the same. As breathing a little extra carbon dioxide or failing to hyperventilate and low thyroid people hyperventilate and blow away the carbon dioxide they should be keeping in their cells. And so the supplement of baking soda is imitating to a degree the normal thyroid function, keeping in your cells....more charged with carbon dioxide, which is a stabilizing thing that has tremendous ramifications everywhere. When you are at a high altitude, there's less oxygen, and the oxygen normally is in your lungs, it exchanges with carbon dioxide. So, at sea level... high oxygen pressure pushes more carbon dioxide out of your blood. At a high altitude, the lower oxygen tension allows you to retain more carbon dioxide. And people have less dementia, heart disease, and cancer at very high altitudes and live longer. And that's very likely mostly the effect of retaining... the proper amount of carbon dioxide and so at moderate altitude if you're breathing more carbon dioxide, like adding a supplement, it can be with baking soda. This extra carbon dioxide is to some degree imitating a high altitude or a better thyroid functioning."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the metabolic mechanisms behind baking soda's effects, detailing how sodium lowers aldosterone, an anti-stress hormone, and how bicarbonate influences cellular carbon dioxide levels, mimicking high-altitude benefits and improved thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, relative to how much oxygen they need, because the oxygen requirement is very low in a low thyroid person, so they don't need to move very much air. Yeah. Like a quarter of oxygen will last a low thyroid person maybe minutes where a high thyroid person would be gone in seconds. I've seen it in labs where we were practicing doing the basal metabolic rate test by rate of consuming oxygen."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the breathing patterns of low-thyroid individuals. Dr. Peat explains that their lower oxygen requirement means they move less air, contrasting it with high-thyroid individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** "Mm-hmm. And, for example, the typical old-fashioned machine contains two liters of oxygen. And I didn't know that I was hyperthyroid. I didn't have any signs of hyperthyroidism. But in the standard test, I emptied the machine in half the allotted time. So the tracing on the graph paper was almost a vertical line where it was supposed to be about a 45-degree angle to the right, and according to the standards, I was about four times the normal oxygen-consuming rate. A doctor would say, oh, that's dangerous hyperthyroidism, but I was fine, no health problems at all. Very interesting."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recounts his personal experience with a basal metabolic rate test, where his high oxygen consumption indicated hyperthyroidism, yet he experienced no negative health effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when you're producing energy at a high rate, say... 150% of the average, you're maintaining your blood sugar level because you're using the sugar efficiently, not wasting any. The hypothyroid person wastes sugar at a terrible rate because they aren't using oxygen properly. So if you're using sugar efficiently, that means you don't......experience hypoglycemia, and so you don't produce very much adrenaline to regulate your blood sugar. And so your adrenaline level is low, your stress level is low, and everything metabolically is running efficiently. You're turning over your proteins, but in a renewal way rather than a... a stress-produced way."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how efficient energy production, indicative of good thyroid function, leads to stable blood sugar, lower adrenaline, and overall metabolic efficiency, contrasting this with the sugar wastage seen in hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, yeah, I didn't know they were still putting bromide in breads. I don't think they are generally, but maybe, maybe this lady knows. Yeah, it isn't good if it's there. It should be avoided. And fluoride, I think, I was for a while using a supplement of T3, the active thyroid hormone. And when I would go to San Francisco or an area where they have fluoridated water, I would get a migraine headache. I looked up the amount of fluoride ions in water and the amount of T3, the number of potential sites for the fluoride to stick to, and a glass of fluoridated water is enough to knock out a day's portion of the active thyroid hormone and since I was using that active thyroid hormone it was very quick and very noticeable that if I drank fluoridated water for example in my coffee or orange juice I would get a migraine from extreme hypothyroidism."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the impact of fluoride and bromide on thyroid function. Dr. Peat expresses concern about bromide in bread and shares his personal experience with fluoride in water exacerbating hypothyroidism symptoms, including migraines, by interfering with T3.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've seen several people who were hypothyroid who when they took the amount that brought their oxygen consumption up to the right level it was just amazing. They had recovery of their own thyroid function and could stop taking it. It doesn't happen very often but I've seen several people who cured their low thyroid by supplementing thyroid. So explain what you mean taking the oxygen level. How do we know? How would you know?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the possibility of recovering natural thyroid function by supplementing. Dr. Peat shares instances where thyroid supplementation led to recovery and the host probes for how to gauge this.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, if you're sick with low thyroid you have......variety of symptoms and these individuals responded to supplementing their thyroid the way any hypothyroid person does, but in a few cases they were able to maintain their metabolic rate and stop taking the thyroid because the thyroid had restored, the supplement had restored their... anti-stress metabolism lowered the adrenaline and cortisol and allowed the tissue to start metabolizing by itself and producing its own thyroid, but usually a person's body is loaded up with anti-thyroid substances, polyunsaturated fats built right into the structure of the cell, that brought me in there....fat tissue, but in their muscles and brain and so on, especially after the age of 20, the tissues start building polyunsaturated fats right into the structure, and when you're under stress, you release some of those polyunsaturated fats into your bloodstream, where they interfere with thyroid function. So the average person. In their 20s or 30s or older Needs to if they're hypothyroid They benefit from taking a supplement for at least a few years until they can change the composition of your body"
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how thyroid supplementation can restore natural function by reducing stress hormones and allowing tissues to metabolize properly. He also highlights the role of polyunsaturated fats in interfering with thyroid function over time.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you happen to take too much, you will get breathless, too much oxygen. I've done it many times and just standing up to answer the telephone, I would start panting and had to cut back on my thyroid. But I've seen people, well, myself for example, I... When I was judging just by how I felt I would supplement the thyroid and one morning I noticed I had dents in my throat beside my Adam's apple where the thyroid gland had been about and about the size of my finger pressed into my throat and I realized I'd shrunk my thyroid gland so I stopped taking the quick acting t3 The next morning my neck was smooth And I've seen several people who were Taking too much thyroid and have shrank their gland and in this one or two days It comes back massively"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the optimal dosage of thyroid medication. Dr. Peat shares his personal experience with taking too much, leading to breathlessness, and also recounts instances where individuals experienced thyroid gland shrinkage from excessive doses, which then recovered upon reduction.

**RAY PEAT:** "If one is taking some thyroid Meds as we call them What's what's the role of taking supplemental iodine if you're not taking a thyroid or if you are foods such as milk and eggs always contain thyroid, even though seafood is the known reliable source of trace minerals, selenium and iodine particularly, but since thyroid is a fertility hormone, animals can't produce eggs and milk if they're very hypothyroid. You're assured that milk and eggs will always contain some iodine and some equivalent thyroid-supporting substance, so there was a study back when iodine was sometimes used as a dough conditioner instead of bromine, and at that time the average American diet contained several times the ideal amount of iodine, and it has been about 60 or 70 years since there were hypothyroid low iodine areas in the United States, like the Great Lakes region was a famous greater belt, but since food technology has started using so much iodine, there hasn't been any iodine deficiency zone in the U.S., and what happens if you take even twice, two or three or four times the amount needed by the body, you start interfering with the function of the gland, and often people supplement more than a milligram up to as much as ten milligrams a day. And that seriously damages the thyroid. I, every couple of months, hear from someone who has damaged their thyroid by taking several milligrams a day of iodine. Is that a lot of milligrams? Yeah, the required amount is about a tenth to a fifth of a milligram per day. And taking a half a milligram per day chronically, looking at a big population. That's enough to increase the incidence of thyroiditis and eventually thyroid cancer."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of supplemental iodine, especially when taking thyroid medication. Dr. Peat explains that milk and eggs contain iodine and thyroid-supporting substances. He then warns against excessive iodine supplementation, citing studies and personal reports of thyroid damage from doses far exceeding the daily requirement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it's seriously dangerous in the long run to supplement too much iodine. I do really well, and others have too. They've mentioned with this, you know, the salmon you can get, you know, the little thin slices. What do you call that? I guess smoked salmon and things like that. You think that's a generally good food?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of consuming smoked salmon. Dr. Peat confirms it's nutritious but cautions about potential overload of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, a lot of pupa. Really? What are they doing there? I thought that's a fish. Yeah, the cold water fish eat algae, and the algae is the source of the pupa. So, you tend to, you like to gravitate more towards the warm water fish?"
**CONTEXT:** The host expresses surprise at the mention of "pupa" in salmon. Dr. Peat clarifies that cold-water fish consume algae, which is the source of these. He then asks about a preference for warm-water fish.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, as far as it's available, but a small amount. There are some low-fat fish. that come from pretty cold waters. Cod and sole are the lowest fat fish that I know of, and I think they're safer than salmon if you're going to eat fish every week."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat states a preference for warm-water fish when available but highlights cod and sole as low-fat, safer alternatives to salmon for regular consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, low thyroid people. Tend in that direction. And I wrote some newsletters a few years ago on shock, and the history of shock goes back a few hundred years, but it really became a major aspect of physiology just a little over a hundred years ago, the beginning of the 20th century. When one of the pioneers was George Washington Crile, whose son at the Cleveland Clinic, which was founded by G.W. Crile the first, the son was a pioneer in both thyroid therapy and breast cancer treatment. He innovated the......lumpectomy rather than the horrible, radical mastectomy, and he practically eliminated thyroid surgery, went from over a thousand surgeries a year in the clinic to just about a dozen by understanding how the thyroid can be treated. But his father was the real pioneer that led to that understanding of the thyroid. And his... thyroid work grew out of his surgical experiments in which he really explained more than anyone else what shock is and how the vagus nerve governs shock and what happens in shock is that signals are sent to all of your body cells. Turning off the ability to use oxygen and the use of oxygen is what thyroid is in control of. The more thyroid you have, the more oxygen your cells can use and within a broad range that means that your metabolism becomes more and more efficient as you use more oxygen. So the low-thyroid person is wasting their energy, but in shock, it's even worse than hypothyroidism. It simply turns off the mechanism for using oxygen and burning any fuel, and so it imitates death, basically. When a person is in shock......it is cut, their blood stays bright red. They aren't using the oxygen in their blood because the tissue is simply switched off metabolically. It's like turning off a thyroid in a nervous or electrical way rather than a chemical way. And the judge... Washington Trial showed that stimulating the vagus nerve was the basic signal for turning on shock. Whether it was caused by loss of blood, or fright, or whatever. The signals through the vagus system were able to switch off basically the life process temporarily. And that process is easier to trigger the lower your thyroid function is. You become more of a vagal organism when your thyroid is lower. But people generally, if they're going to keep functioning at all, they compensate......for that exaggerated activity of the vagal nervous system by pumping out extra adrenaline. Their adrenal glands become overactive, and they run as much as 40 or 50 times the normal amount of adrenaline production, compensating for that abnormal activity of the vagal opposing system, the parasympathetic system. It is the vagal system and the adrenaline system is the sympathetic nervous system. And so, surprisingly, many people are running with both sides of their autonomic nervous system running at an extremely high rate. And if something interferes with their production of adrenaline and sympathetic activity, then... they drop into the vagal state and move towards shock, fainting, for example."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about vasovagal syncope and its triggers. Dr. Peat links it to low thyroid function and discusses the historical work of George Washington Crile, explaining how the vagus nerve governs shock by turning off oxygen utilization, a process exacerbated by low thyroid. He also details the compensatory adrenaline response and the potential for collapse when this is disrupted.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, Kyle, C-R-I-L-E. Oh, Carl, okay. Carl L. Yeah. Long time ago? Yeah, the senior trial died, I think, in the 1940s, and the junior died not long ago in the 90s, I think. And what did he do to lower all these surgeries that he went from thousands to a handful? What did he do? Oh, supplementing thyroid, basically. Oh, he just gave supplemental thyroid?"
**CONTEXT:** The host clarifies the spelling of Crile and asks about the timeline of his work. Dr. Peat confirms the historical nature of the research and explains that Crile reduced thyroid surgeries by supplementing with thyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, things they were calling thyroid cancer. It was just a minor condition that he could turn off just by giving him a full replacement dose of thyroid. Really? Was he using TSH and all that as a metric? No, not at all. TSH measurement came in. Later, really. He was measuring it enough to realize that people developing these symptoms of thyroid cancer nodules and so on were experiencing the same condition that iodine supplementers experience with a very high TSH, and so he understood that TSH was driving towards... thyroiditis and eventually thyroid cancer, and so he would give usually three or four grains of armor thyroid sufficient to lower the TSH to zero, and then these people without thyroidectomy, or maybe just partial removal of the cancerous part, would live a normal life, just keeping their TSH down so that... any surviving cancer cells wouldn't be stimulated by the TSH."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on Crile's treatment of "thyroid cancer," explaining it was a minor condition treatable with thyroid hormone. He clarifies that TSH measurements were not used, and Crile's approach was to lower TSH to zero to prevent stimulation of any remaining cancer cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "My goodness. Three or four grains. Now, a grain is 60 milligrams. I mean, that's a lot, isn't it? Um, well, two grains was the average dose for just the run of the mill. Was it? A low-thyroid, middle-aged person, but sometimes, just to have good functioning, some people took three or four. There were even five grains. The armor company sold tablets of five grains, and veterinarians found that that was the right dose for cocker spaniels, and a couple of breeds of dogs needed about five grains a day, and quite a few people sold bottles of I think it was five hundred five grain tablets for ten dollars or so, and I've seen a few people who needed more than five grains ten or fifteen grains a day to cure their problem, and then they would settle in on four or five grains a day for maintenance."
**CONTEXT:** The host expresses surprise at the dosage of thyroid medication mentioned. Dr. Peat confirms that while two grains were average, some individuals required three to five grains, and even higher doses, for therapeutic effect, citing historical availability and veterinary use.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, The Basal metabolic rate was still in use use through through the 1940s and into the 50s then the chemical the first test was a blood test called a Protein bound iodine came in just around the same time that Synthroid came on the market and it turned out 20 years later that it was an absolute meaningless thing but at the time I was in junior high at the time and several of my fat friends said they had learned that they didn't have a glandular problem because the protein bound iodine showed that they had. a fully normal amount of protein bound iodine in their blood and so they had discovered that they were just gluttonous. So they brought this med thing out right when the synthroid came out. I mean, they test."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that basal metabolic rate testing was used before the advent of protein-bound iodine tests, which coincided with the introduction of Synthroid. He notes that protein-bound iodine was later found to be a meaningless metric, used to blame patients for their conditions rather than address them with thyroid supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it really was part of a marketing system. What they did was blame the problem on the patient rather than supplementing with aromatherapyrate, which was a good... reliable product."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reiterates that the shift to less effective diagnostic methods was a marketing strategy to avoid using reliable thyroid supplements like Armour Thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, using your temperature and pulse rate, you can come fairly close to the old oxygen consumption test. That's still the ideal way to prove hypothyroidism, but you can make a very good guess by taking your temperature before you get out of bed in the morning and checking your pulse rate at the same time. If you're...lots of the low-thyroid people are running on high adrenaline, which rises during the night, and that tends to push up the cortisol. The adrenaline sometimes will cause 90 or 100 beats per minute heart rate when you're waking up, sometimes following a nightmare. And if the cortisol goes up higher than average, it always tends to rise around dawn. But the higher your cortisol rises, the higher your waking temperature will be. The adrenaline speeds your pulse at dawn, the cortisol raises the temperature and helps to push the heart rate back down by bringing your blood sugar up. So just that one measurement can be ambiguous, high adrenaline, high cortisol, or low, both of them. If you then take your temperature and pulse rate. An hour or two after eating, the food will lower your adrenaline and the daylight and food will lower your cortisol. And very often these people who woke up seeming to have a very normal 75 beats per minute pulse rate and a 98 degree temperature. These people will sometimes drop to a 55 or 60 pulse rate. And at 96 or 97 degree temperature at 11 o'clock in the morning."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how to estimate thyroid function using morning temperature and pulse rate, noting that high adrenaline and cortisol can skew initial readings. He advises taking measurements again after eating, as food and daylight can reveal underlying hypothyroidism by lowering these stress hormones and revealing a lower temperature and pulse.

**RAY PEAT:** "That they're super low thyroid. Okay. So the Brota Barnes thing wasn't kinda sorta right. I mean, if you had a 98, you know, according to Brota Barnes, then you were good. But this whole adrenaline and cortisol thing, you're saying that maybe not."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on what the post-meal measurements indicate. Dr. Peat confirms that a significant drop in temperature and pulse suggests severe hypothyroidism, and contrasts this with the simpler temperature-based assessment of Broda Barnes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, In hot, humid summers in Eugene, I first started questioning Barnes' temperature measurement. He worked at Fort Collins, Colorado, where it never gets very hot and humid for very long. And I saw that people in this hot and humid weather, even very hypothyroid people. kept a normal temperature, but usually with a normal temperature they would get a slow pulse rate. So I started adding the two together, but then I saw that a very stressful night time would make both of the indicators sometimes look normal at dawn or waking, and then they would go down on cool. mid morning or afternoon"
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his divergence from Broda Barnes' temperature-based thyroid assessment, citing his observations in hot, humid climates where even hypothyroid individuals maintained normal temperatures. He emphasizes the importance of considering pulse rate and how stress can temporarily normalize readings.
