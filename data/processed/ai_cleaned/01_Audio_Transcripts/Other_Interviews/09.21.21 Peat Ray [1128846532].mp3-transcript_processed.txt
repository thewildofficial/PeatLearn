**RAY PEAT:** The sugar in orange juice is mostly sucrose, which in itself is much less glycemic or insulin stimulating than the glucose that drives from starch.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the sugar content of orange juice versus starches.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the things you want to do is stop eating the things that slow your metabolism, that inhibit your thyroid. And damage your mitochondria and block oxygen use and heat production. And the worst of those foods are the polyunsaturated fats. And the very high starchy foods like pasta are the next in line. But the proof is... accumulate in your body and turn off your thyroid in different ways and damage your mitochondria so that your ability to burn calories decreases as the polyunsaturated fat in the food is stored in your body. Canola, corn oil, soy, all of those are highly polyunsaturated and butter is a very relatively highly saturated food and so it can be fattening if you eat enough of it. Against a background of history of having eaten a lot of soy oil and so on, just adding a little coconut oil which is quickly absorbed and oxidized can increase your heat production. But the ability to produce heat from your food is the thing to pay attention to and sugar in a lot of experiments, just adding sugar to your diet can increase your metabolic rate by twenty percent and so you can actually lose weight in eating. Increasing metabolism with sugar.
