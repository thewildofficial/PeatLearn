**RAY PEAT:** People have known for several decades, starting in the 1930s actually, people were realizing that hospital oxygen levels were going down. It isn't good for people. A physiologist, based on how people react to altitude, a physiologist tried adding from 5 to 7 percent carbon dioxide to the oxygen and they started using it in fire departments for resuscitating people and it worked very well. I tried it on newborn babies and found that it was good for babies to stimulate breathing. It was used all around the country in fire departments for maybe 5 or 10 years and then gradually went out of use but hospitals almost always keep oxygen, plain 100 percent oxygen on hand for patients but several people didn't last. 20 or 30 years have started looking at the outcome when they oxygenize a person and when the blood saturation is approaching 100% saturation, when it's above 90% actually, the mortality starts increasing rather than decreasing. And the hyper-oxygenated patients, actually about twice as many of them, don't come out of the hospital. And what I realized was that that's been known as an effect of strenuous exercising, where you breathe very intensely. Your blood couldn't become. very over oxygenated and they know that that increases prolactin as a sort of a stress reaction hormone and so they tried just having a person breathe 60% oxygen or 100% oxygen and found that that drives their prolactin very high and I realized that what's happening is the lack of carbon dioxide in the blood when you're being treated with oxygen or just hyperventilating and that raises the pH of your blood causes the platelets to release their serotonin and serotonin drives up. Prolactin. People have rejected that idea because they believed that there was a barrier, a blood-brain barrier that would keep the platelet serotonin out of the brain, but in fact I've just been going over the evidence that in fact there is no blood-brain barrier. When you have too much estrogen, for example, the enzymes in the capillaries of the brain lose their ability to detoxify serotonin and so it goes right from your blood into your brain.
**CONTEXT:** What is the physiological effect of over-oxygenation and hyperventilation?

**RAY PEAT:** Folks over-exercise. We get too oxygenated and we lose too much carbon dioxide. Is that right? By breathing fast? If we breathe fast? And that's not a good thing.
**CONTEXT:** Is over-oxygenation and losing carbon dioxide through fast breathing detrimental?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, exactly. And there are more than 300,000 people every year just in the United States who die with cardiac arrest. And it's known that serotonin increases the delay between contraction and readiness for a new contraction and the SSRI, serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, increase that delay by raising your serotonin. And so they are actually known to be able to increase the cardiac arrest frequency.
**CONTEXT:** How does serotonin relate to cardiac arrest and the use of SSRIs?

**RAY PEAT:** And starting in about 19... 1965, when the birth control pills came on the market, there was suddenly an increase. I think it was about a hundred-fold increase in the incidence of pituitary tumors that secrete prolactin. And that was an effect of the birth control pill, creating prolactinoma tumors. And that, I think, is because estrogen causes you to hyperventilate, interferes with your thyroid gland, which makes you produce carbon dioxide, which is an anti-serotonin agent. And so if you're high in estrogen or low in the thyroid function, you're going to have effectively a shortage of carbon dioxide and an excess of prolactin and serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** How do birth control pills, estrogen, and thyroid function relate to prolactin and serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. That can make the exercise much more effective. Much more effective.
**CONTEXT:** How does retaining carbon dioxide and strengthening the heart and blood vessels make exercise more effective?

**RAY PEAT:** It, for one thing, delivers the right amount of oxygen to the tissue. The tissue, your muscle, produces carbon dioxide and the blood arriving in the capillaries release oxygen in proportion to how much carbon dioxide you're producing.
**CONTEXT:** What is the function of carbon dioxide in the body, specifically regarding oxygen delivery?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the carbon dioxide, meanwhile, is keeping the pH of the blood in the proper range where the serotonin can be stuck in the platelets. The platelets lose their affinity for serotonin if you don't have enough carbon dioxide.
**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide maintain blood pH and influence serotonin's interaction with platelets?

**RAY PEAT:** Not really, only metaphorically because if your thyroid function is low, you just don't need much oxygen in your tissues and then you can be hyperventilating even when you're only taking 10 or 15 breaths per minute because your tissue needs so little oxygen. If you breathe at a normal rate, you're hyperventilating and the typical diabetic or hypothyroid person is going around just at rest with an excess of lactic acid in the blood because they're losing carbon dioxide and producing lactic acid because they can't use the oxygen that is in the blood.
**CONTEXT:** How does low thyroid function lead to hyperventilation and lactic acid buildup?

**RAY PEAT:** I've used the little infrared things that measure oxygenation of the tissue and everyone, hospitals even, say you shouldn't get below 90% saturation and if you go down to 80% they put you on put you on super oxygen treatment and lots of people like to keep their saturation around 98%. But using it in different conditions I saw that in cold weather I could be exercising or whatever but in cold weather my fingers always showed 98 or 99% saturation but when I was warm and my fingers were actually using oxygen I could get my fingers down to 90% or 89% saturation. So if your tissue isn't using oxygen you can be dead and still have saturated hemoglobin. So what's the message there? If you quick froze a person's hand it would stay saturated with oxygen. So those little gadgets that are sold so commonly and used in hospitals just don't say very much about your physiology.
**CONTEXT:** What is the limitation of using pulse oximeters to measure oxygen saturation in assessing physiological health?

**RAY PEAT:** Sure if it's temperature. If your feet are below oh I think it's down around 80 degrees right they start producing inflammatory signals and it can cause your your whole system to become stressed and yes responding to inflammation so so warm feet for example will make you sleep better yes by reducing inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of foot temperature in relation to inflammation and sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh the oxygen is making you burn fat and sugar, turning it into energy to use. And in the process of producing ATP and using the ATP, you're producing heat in proportion to the amount of oxygen you're using. And the thyroid is what makes you use oxygen to burn, preferably sugar, but also fat or protein. And so in proportion to the health of your thyroid, you'll be consuming oxygen and producing heat. So you can measure the heat a person is producing, but that would increase under the influence of stress and cortisol, which could be breaking down your tissues, not using oxygen. So temperature alone. isn't enough. You have to know the actual amount of oxygen being consumed. That's almost all under the influence of thyroid function. And so, in the 1930s and 40s, lots of doctors had their little apparatus, a can inverted in water, with a hose to put over your nose. Then you would breathe for two minutes and measure the amount of oxygen consumed. And using that test, 30% of Americans were hypothyroid. But when the drug companies came on the market with a supposed way to measure the amount of thyroid in your blood, they convinced the whole world that only 5% of the population is hypothyroid. So, immediately, in the mid-1940s, people went from being 30% hypothyroid to only 5% hypothyroid. So, it was a great medical disaster.
**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function relate to oxygen consumption, heat production, and the historical methods of diagnosing hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** It's just one of the signs. Like when you shake hands with someone, if they have ice cold hands in the summer, they're almost always hypothyroid unless they're just very nervous.
**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of cold hands as an indicator of thyroid status?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I don't really trust them, but I drink it because it's available. But, yeah, I'm very concerned about the possible emulsifiers they use to get the vitamins in the solution. But still, I have been using the commercial vitamin-added milk for many years, and apparently haven't had serious problems with it.
**CONTEXT:** What are the concerns regarding vitamins and emulsifiers in commercial milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I like the low-temperature pasteurized. And usually I drink the homogenized just because it's convenient not to have to shake it up.
**CONTEXT:** What is the preferred type of milk regarding pasteurization and homogenization?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think so. You don't think so? I've seen the research that says there is a difference, but I don't notice any difference. So that's just a myth that's been going on for the last 50 years, I guess. Yeah, because our digestion effectively homogenizes it, the bile acids are an emulsifier that break up the particles very thoroughly.
**CONTEXT:** Does homogenization negatively impact milk's digestibility?

**RAY PEAT:** No, not at all. But the evidence was very clear that they were using a bleach. To make flour white and the bleach was nerve toxic and they demonstrated dogs would have convulsions and other fits. Yeah, I remember that. That's where that whole white flour thing came from. Yeah, but they changed to a less toxic way of bleaching the flour. So it isn't a problem now. And the white sugar, I don't know of any bleaching process other than using carbon activated charcoal to remove some of the color material. But that isn't actually bleaching, it's filtering it out.
**CONTEXT:** What were the historical concerns with white flour and white sugar production?

**RAY PEAT:** It's sugar which is very, very highly purified. More purer than many of the reagent chemicals they use in research labs. It's washed to a... crystalline purity. And so it's almost perfectly free of allergenic material, which brown sugar can cause a really intense inflammatory reactions for sensitive people. And molasses even worse. Molasses gets the... essentially the dirt, smoked residue and such, from burning the cane fields. But the white sugar is very safe. And since it has none of the problems of fats, it doesn't break down into inflammation-promoting material, like all fats do if you are under stress and have eaten too many fats. It's safe for diabetics for example. 150 years ago in France and England there were doctors who cured terminal diabetic patients, far advanced people wasting away. By giving them as much sugar as they wanted, which was about 11 or 12 ounces of white sugar added to the regular meals of potatoes, beef, vegetables and such. And they were curing diabetes like that? Yeah. Two articles on my website describe their experiences. I've seen them. How it works is that it suppresses the breakdown of fat in your body. And the free fatty acids are constantly, when you're under stress, they are constantly killing the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. And so you have a stressful event, produce free fatty acids, they kill off your insulin producing cells. And so you're unable to oxidize the fat and it keeps you under stress. And you can break the cycle, as those doctors showed, by letting them have as much sugar as they crave. That in itself provides energy. Their blood sugar might go up to 400 milligrams per cent or so, four or five times higher than normal. But in doing that, it's providing the cells the energy they need to stop the stress reaction. And that stops breaking down the fat, which is killing the cells. The pancreatic cells and glucose happens to stimulate the creation of stem cells, beta cells in the pancreas. So sugar causes the cells to be renewed of free fatty acids. And so if you can break the cycle, keep your free fatty acids down, the glucose is going to renew your pancreas.
**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of white sugar, and how did historical doctors use it to treat diabetes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, about 40, 50 years ago in Israel, some physiologist figured out, realized that it's free fatty acids. That cause diabetes, not sugar. Free fatty acids. And you produce free fatty acids when you're under stress. Diabetics can't get the glucose into their cells and so they are having the equivalent of hypoglycemia, except it's neuroglucopenia. Their brain can't get glucose and so it sends out signals to increase the food supply and that leads to the breakdown of fat and production of toxins.
**CONTEXT:** What is the actual cause of diabetes, according to research?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah. If you eat more than you need, you will put on fat for sure.
**CONTEXT:** Does consuming excess sugar lead to fat gain?

**RAY PEAT:** And in the mountain areas especially, inland, the rainfall is depleted in deuterium. And deuterium research in the last, ever since 1950 actually, but in the last five years there's been new research showing that heavy water, deuterium, is age-promoting. And when the rainfall has rained out some of the heavy water, the inland, the last rain to fall is lighter water, and so beet sugar has less deuterium than tropical cane sugar.
**CONTEXT:** How does deuterium in water affect sugar and the aging process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's been done for the nuclear bomb industry, for example, but people have been trying to figure out ways to do it on a more practical scale, but for many years I've figured that taking as much water as possible in the form of milk and orange juice, the cow and the orange tree are acting as filters. As they age, they accumulate deuterium and the water that passes through them is somewhat deuterium depleted.
**CONTEXT:** How can one reduce deuterium intake, and how do cows and orange trees act as deuterium filters?

**RAY PEAT:** The heme group is how we use it in the blood and the iron atom is isolated by the carbon framework. And so when you eat meat, liver for example, the iron is isolated until it gets right into your bloodstream and cells. But if you take an iron supplement, the free iron ions react in your stomach, for example. People have analyzed multiple vitamin mineral capsules or tablets and found that they were adding iron in a tablet or capsule along with vitamin A and B12 and so on. And the vitamins were destroyed right in the tablet before it was taken. But that same thing happens in your stomach if you take an ionized iron form. It will destroy the nutrients in your stomach or intestine before they're even ingested or digested.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between heme iron in liver and iron supplements, and how do iron supplements affect other nutrients?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, doing the exercise in the proper way so that you don't lower your androgens will make the exercise more efficient at restoring tissue. But the anti-stress program, everything that keeps your cortisol low, leaves the androgens such as testosterone and DHEA active. Keeping the cortisol low is something that the Germans discovered in the 1960s and they were accused of doping because their androgen level seemed impossibly high for an athlete. But it turns out that if you just don't exercise so hard, your androgens are much higher. So they figured out a way how to kind of strengthen the muscle, put pressure on it, resistance on it, but not too much so the cortisol level didn't get too high, which turned it around the other way.
**CONTEXT:** How can exercise be optimized for muscle building and androgen production, and what is the role of cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the muscle, when it's properly stimulated, is actually producing testosterone or androgens. But if it's stressed, the muscle turns around and produces cortisol.
**CONTEXT:** How does muscle stimulation and stress affect androgen and cortisol production?

**RAY PEAT:** The concentric contraction is one thing that protects the muscle. If you lift a weight and then drop it without letting it down gradually, it's the lengthening of the muscle under stress that damages the muscle. And so if you walk or run uphill, the dominant action is concentric. But if you walk downhill, that injures the muscle because you're stretching the muscle under pressure. So concentric contraction actually strengthens the muscle, makes it bigger, and that would be when you pull the weight up, say you have a 25-pound weight down at the bottom and you're pulling it up and you're doing a curl, would that be concentric? Yeah. And then if you just drop it down slow, you're saying that just makes it... That's stretching the muscle while it resists, and that's doing microscopic damage and it damages the mitochondria so it produces less energy, and they've shown that in old people doing concentric contractions only, they can create new mitochondria and restore the energy system.
**CONTEXT:** How do concentric contractions differ from eccentric contractions in terms of muscle building and mitochondrial health?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the gravity is stretching the resisting muscle. Yeah. I have to think about that. Maybe I could just drop, right? Just drop. Yeah, but you don't want to... Yeah, but I wouldn't do that. The stress on your legs of dropping is probably counterproductive.
**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of dropping weights after a concentric contraction?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the important thing is to limit your tryptophan intake as far as you can without becoming protein deficient. That's why I advocate gelatin because gelatin contains no tryptophan, which is the source for serotonin. Ah, so that gelatin has the protein without the tryptophan. Yeah, and it has the precursor for dopamine.
**CONTEXT:** What dietary strategies can help restore dopamine levels, and what is the role of gelatin?

**RAY PEAT:** No, not really. It can, like histamine, too much serotonin keeps you awake.
**CONTEXT:** Does tryptophan directly cause sleep, or is it serotonin that affects wakefulness?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid, actually, is the main thing. Many years ago, sleep researchers found that some people never got below the second level of... of the four stages of sleep and thyroid. Deficient people went through the night without ever reaching the deep sleep stages, and I found myself on a trip, when I would have trouble going to sleep from driving all day, that if I took five or ten micrograms of T3 thyroid, I would go to sleep perfectly in about five minutes, I remember just a little hit of that T3, five to ten grams? Micrograms. Micrograms, wow. Yeah. A microgram is what, a thousandth of a gram? Yeah. Wow. No, a millionth of a gram. Wow. How much would five to ten, I mean, that would be like, just like a, just a very small, small, small amount, wouldn't it? Yeah, they make little tablets that are five or ten micrograms. Of T3? Yeah. And I've seen it work several times in other people. I always feel free to give thyroid to doctors, because they are supposed to know how to handle it, but doctors with pain, pains that they couldn't control, or insomnia, have remarks that they've never seen such quick relief, better than morphine, one doctor said. Thank you. When he supplemented with the T3. Wow.
**CONTEXT:** What is the primary hormonal deficiency associated with insomnia, and what is the effectiveness of T3 supplementation for sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, too much thyroid can create stress and make your testosterone become wasted or not produced. Not enough thyroid will cause the testosterone to be converted into estrogen. Estrogen blocks the secretion of thyroid from the gland. And testosterone overlaps with progesterone. Progesterone has a powerfully releasing function on the thyroid gland so that when it has been blocked by estrogen, a dose of progesterone can reactivate the gland. Testosterone has some of that supporting function for the thyroid, but not as effective as progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** How do thyroid hormones, testosterone, and progesterone interact with estrogen and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I'm putting something on to soften the callus, I think is the main thing. It protects the cause. Bad shoes cause the callus to form. So if you get the right kind of shoe and then put something on to soften the material. Salicylic acid and urea are things that have commonly been used.
**CONTEXT:** What are effective treatments for corns and calluses?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid hormone is one a progesterone is another an improved diet that shifts you away slightly from the serotonin side of things because serotonin is at the heart of learned helplessness. Harm avoidance is how one psychologist described the serotonin dominant condition. But learned helplessness is the extreme of harm avoidance.
**CONTEXT:** What are the physiological and dietary factors that contribute to learned helplessness?

**RAY PEAT:** If animals, they would torture them and not let them escape. Whatever the awful situation was, such as being thrown into a tank of water and forced to swim or drown. had never had the experience before of being put in a hopeless situation. Animals would sometimes let themselves drown in just a few minutes. But if they had ever been in a situation like that, that they managed to escape after being threatened with a deadly condition, one escape experience would change their perspective, which would change their physiology, so that they would then be able to sometimes swim for a whole day, many hours. Instead of just a few minutes, so that is one of the interesting aspects of physiology that is usually, well, almost never considered in medicine, but it can make a difference between resisting for maybe five minutes or for 10 or 15 hours, a total difference in the ability to survive just by changing your mental picture of how things work.
**CONTEXT:** How does prior experience with escaping a stressful situation influence an animal's survival response in subsequent similar situations?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it seems to work that the body has dehydrogenase enzymes that are in the habit of receiving their electrons from fat or sugar metabolism, but some people believe that they can receive electrons directly from molecular hydrogen, and that seems to fit with the experience of using them. Hydrogen gas as an anti-inflammatory agent during surgery, for example, it seems to reduce the inflammation and stress. Yes, they're using it in some places for stroke victims. You know, after stroke they feed them the hydrogen along with the oxygen and helps them to recover faster. Yeah, in my interpretation of what's happening, it's working. The way sugar does, sugar provides a very generous amount of electron energy. Hydrogen does that directly, bypassing some of the enzymes.
**CONTEXT:** How might molecular hydrogen function as an anti-inflammatory agent and aid in recovery from stroke?

**RAY PEAT:** CO2 with oxygen? I have heard of two or three hospitals in the United States and several in Europe. Germany, about 30 years ago, someone said that her father had a stroke while traveling. He was 90 years old or so and went into a hospital in Germany and they put him on carbon dioxide therapy. He recovered and went back to finish his world tour. It's still pretty widely used in Germany and Eastern Europe.
**CONTEXT:** Is carbon dioxide therapy still used in medical settings, particularly in Europe?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, also putting on a soft wool cap for sleeping. The head is the most intensely metabolizing organ that the kidneys and the heart and the brain have a very high metabolic rate. And so your head loses a lot of energy. And big animals, one of the reasons they live longer is that their geometry has less surface area for losing heat. A mouse has very little mass to surface. And so they radiate tremendous and lose by conduction to the air a tremendous fraction of their biological energy. So in effect, they're living beyond their means. They spend energy faster than they can use it. And putting a nice woolly hat on either in the daytime or at night is reducing the stress, basically making you keep more of your heat. At the average temperature, 70 degrees, a person is losing more than half of their body energy according to some experiments by radiation, not just by skin contact. At the top of their head? No, all of their body is losing it, but the head is the hottest. And so it's the worst leak of energy. Perhaps that's where some of the old time way back where people would wear these caps to sleep or something. Maybe that's what that was about. Oh, yeah, I've been recommending a sleeping cap.
**CONTEXT:** How does wearing a hat, especially a wool cap, affect heat loss and metabolic rate, and what is the significance of the head's high metabolic rate?

**RAY PEAT:** The shape of the fiber. Cotton is good, but some wool has been treated too that isn't really as good as the crude natural wool. There's something about the organic wool in pillows that they advertise about wicking the perspiration a little bit and it doesn't absorb in there. Something like that. The wool fiber has a catalytic function. I think it's not quite as good as activated charcoal, but it can have a bacteria suppressing effect. A butcher block made out of natural wood has a self-sanitizing effect because the structure of the wood, cellulose units, is toxic to bacteria. Interesting. I think the wool microscopic structure has that same bacteria suppressing effect.
**CONTEXT:** What properties of wool fiber contribute to its beneficial effects, and how does wood achieve a self-sanitizing effect?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it has to be a natural structured wood. Anything that seals the fine cellulose structure. That'll stain up pretty well, though, won't it, probably? The traditional blocks I've seen looked clean after many years.
**CONTEXT:** Does sealing the natural structure of wood affect its self-sanitizing properties?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they're in the right quantity. I've known a couple aging men who took 25 milligram tablets of DHA, and their estrogen became as high as a young cycling woman. And their livers enlarged. So you don't want to take more of the androgen than is optimal. Like a young man produces about 12 milligrams per day of DHA, and about 4 or 5 milligrams of testosterone. And so if a person takes more than that amount, it's going to raise their estrogen and have a counterproductive effect. Pregnenolone is the safest one to use. I experimented for a year taking about an average of 3 or 4,000 milligrams of pregnenolone per day. It had no side effects at all. Three or four thousand milligrams? Yeah, where thirty milligrams is a full replacement dose. I was just for fun taking a hundred times that. Very high stress resistance. Felt very good, exuberant. Pregnenolone. Pretty safe. You did three to four thousand milligrams a day for years? For one year. I ate a kilogram. I had brought back a kilogram from Mexico and I ate it during one year. Yeah, that was my experiment. My skin was sort of rejuvenated looking during that year. I had got saggy skin around my eyes and that snapped back into shape.
**CONTEXT:** What are the optimal dosages for DHEA and pregnenolone, and what were the effects of high-dose pregnenolone supplementation?

**RAY PEAT:** I studied the production and metabolism of lipofuscin as part of my thesis, and so I've been interested in it for a long time. One group found that vitamin E was removing it from nerve cells, which is much safer than the center of an oxine. But after they demonstrated that their vitamin E treatment was doing it, they did a control test. They had been administering vitamin E dissolved in ethanol. And their ethanol control removed the lipofuscin almost as well as the vitamin E in ethanol. So a very tiny amount of alcohol seems to do the job very safely like vitamin E.
**CONTEXT:** What are the findings regarding vitamin E and ethanol's effectiveness in removing lipofuscin from nerve cells?

**RAY PEAT:** No experience at all. Nothing at all. But I've had a lot of experience with flowers of sulfur and candida and other fungus.
**CONTEXT:** What is Dr. Peat's experience with black cumin seed oil and flowers of sulfur for fungal overgrowth?

**RAY PEAT:** It's precipitated or anything that produces a microscopically fine powder. Ground crystalline sulfur does not work. It has to be the non-crystalline fumed or precipitated sulfur. They call it flowers of sulfur. And that's like an antibiotic, isn't it, did you say? Well, the fungus... exoenzymes that it secretes, as part of its nutritional program, and these enzymes convert the sulfane form in the flowers of sulfur into sulfuric acid, or hydrogen sulfide first, and the hydrogen sulfide acts locally on the fungus to poison it, but the trace amount of hydrogen sulfide that it produces in your intestine, for example, has simply an antioxidant function. Hydrogen sulfide is one of our intrinsic substances, like nitric oxide. It's produced by our own enzymes, so we tolerate it, and it has an antioxidant function. But locally, for the fungus cell, it's very poisonous. So, the fungus kills itself by the way it metabolizes sulfur.
**CONTEXT:** What is "flowers of sulfur," and how does it function as an antifungal agent?

**RAY PEAT:** Anything that stresses us increases our antioxidant system. And I think the worst damage to the body is an absence of oxidative processes or reductive stress, where for 50 years they've been talking about oxidative stress. I think we have to avoid an excess of electrons and simply... keep our oxidative system working to consume the electrons, not to try to block them with antioxidants, because the antioxidants in themselves can interfere with oxidative metabolism. Cancer cells are... extremely well provided with antioxidant systems, and that makes them dangerous and harmful. So don't go overboard on antioxidants.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of antioxidants, and how can an excess of them be detrimental?

**RAY PEAT:** No, partly because our diet... can provide 3,000 milligrams a day if you don't eat grains. Just vegetables, meat, milk, eggs will provide thousands of milligrams of vitamin C daily in the form of dehydroascorbate, much of it, which is not in the reference books because they don't measure it. And if we do eat grains, what does that do to the dehydroascorbate? The grains are the only major food that don't contain vitamin C. Oh, I see. But it doesn't hurt the good stuff that we brought in. Okay. No. Good.
**CONTEXT:** How much vitamin C can be obtained from a diet without grains, and what is the significance of dehydroascorbate?

**RAY PEAT:** I use just USP aspirin, but salicylic acid is all right if you mix it with baking soda. But any aspirin that is in a form that doesn't choke you, it shouldn't be in a fine powder. But I use crystalline aspirin USP, and I try to average about 300 milligrams a day. And why do you take that? Just because it protects against anything inflammatory, pretty much. Crystalline USP aspirin, 300 milligrams a day.
**CONTEXT:** What form of aspirin is preferred, and what is the recommended daily dosage and its purpose?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the amount is too small for most people. And if you take vitamin K, you don't have to worry about the bleeding thing from chronic aspirin use. And vitamin K is in cheese, some cheeses? Yeah, aged cheese is a good source. Aged cheese, yeah. Especially the blue stuff. Doesn't that have vitamin K, the blue stuff? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The blue stinky stuff, right?
**CONTEXT:** What is the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular health, and how does vitamin K relate to aspirin use?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, stress, where you, for example, might have low blood sugar, anything that weakens smooth muscle contraction can do it. But estrogen is a very common cause of that. Weakening of the smooth muscles. Varicose veins are an extreme example where chronic estrogen weakens the muscle. Absence of progesterone will let the veins bulge. Absence of, so the cure, so if the veins are bulging in the back of the hands, you would want to take, how would you balance that estrogen out? Sometimes just a glass of milk or orange juice or some soup or something to get your salt and sugar up. That's often enough to do it. But if it's chronic, then correcting your whole diet and making sure your thyroid function is good. The old thyroid again, there you go.
**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen status affect the veins in the back of the hands, and what are the remedies for bulging veins?

**RAY PEAT:** Hypothyroid people sometimes, if they have very high fats in their blood, that supposedly increases the risk of forming them. But I don't think there's any harm in removing them.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between hypothyroidism, high blood fats, and lipomas?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the women I've known who had endometriosis over the last 50 years have stopped having all of their symptoms when they corrected their thyroid problem. Thyroid. Yeah. They go on to talk about the progesterone and do I need higher doses to combat the high estrogen. So they're wondering about how much progesterone, but you're saying you would just definitely go right to the thyroid and look at that. Yeah. And check your estrogen levels. The thyroid should bring the estrogen down under control.
**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function relate to endometriosis and estrogen levels, and what is the role of progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your liver function good is the basic detox method. Eating a balanced diet and keeping your thyroid function up will make your liver handle things optimally.
**CONTEXT:** What are the key factors for detoxifying pesticides like DDT from the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the brain can use them, but ketosis often refers to the condition that the body produces itself. If you find ketones in fruits and vegetables, they're very good for the brain and nerves. But if you produce the so-called ketosis, it includes some things that are not at all ketones. They're called ketone bodies, but one of them... is a reactive alcohol rather than a ketone. And so the ketones you produce yourself have side effects. If you get your ketones... in your diet, from food, they're fine.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between dietary ketones and endogenous ketones, and what are the potential side effects of the latter?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Buckyballs I think they are. And those are I think risky because the inflammatory triggers a tiny particle in a certain range can activate the inflammatory process. So the research is extremely interesting but I wouldn't touch the stuff myself. Oh, because they're nano? You mean they're nano particles? Ah, it's the nano thing.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential risks associated with nanoparticles like Carbon 60 (Buckyballs)?

**RAY PEAT:** Anything that stresses us increases our antioxidant system. And I think the worst damage to the body is an absence of oxidative processes or reductive stress, where for 50 years they've been talking about oxidative stress. I think we have to avoid an excess of electrons and simply... keep our oxidative system working to consume the electrons, not to try to block them with antioxidants, because the antioxidants in themselves can interfere with oxidative metabolism. Cancer cells are... extremely well provided with antioxidant systems, and that makes them dangerous and harmful. So don't go overboard on antioxidants.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between stress, antioxidant systems, and oxidative versus reductive stress?

**RAY PEAT:** The blood sugar goes down at night, creating stress. All of the stress hormones rise during the night, and you can minimize that with, for example, a glass of milk with honey in it. Sugar, yeah, you told me that. You mentioned that before. That's what I do at night, put a little sugar in there.
**CONTEXT:** How does nighttime blood sugar decline contribute to stress, and what can be done to mitigate it?

**RAY PEAT:** No. No. Sugar, sugar you say? Sugar. That's what the email is saying. Sugar. No, no. No. Doesn't do that. But so the whole metabolic syndrome of too many carbs producing sugar that inflames the arteries, then the cholesterol comes in. That's just a not, a valid, a valid, a meme, a paradigm? Yeah. Thousands of years ago, doctors noticed that people with what they called diabetes. had sweet urine and so they called it the sugar disease. In the 19th century, the sugar disease, since sugar was on the market by 1800, the doctor said, oh, you mustn't let the patient with sugar disease have any sugar at all, and so they would lock the sugar and carbohydrate away from them, which was the thing they most craved, and this doctor in Paris, just not to be cruel, he thought it was cruel to let a person die without a taste of what they most craved, and so he, just to be humane to his patients, let them have their sugar, since he knew they were going to die of their diabetes, but when they got all the sugar they wanted, they didn't die. That was what they call now Type 1 diabetes. Diabetes, as originally defined, was a wasting disease in which you couldn't build tissue because of the absence of insulin. And so you turned your muscles to sugar and the sugar was lost in the urine. And so it was a rapidly fatal disease which they interrupted by giving them all the sugar they wanted.
**CONTEXT:** What is the historical understanding of diabetes and the role of sugar in its treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** If you interpret them properly, you would then say what's happening to the sugar? Okay. Why is the person making the sugar? And you would then look for the fatty acids in the blood and the amount of lactic acid to see if they were wasting any sugar that they were using and how much oxygen they were using and carbon dioxide in the blood. All of the relevant things should be tested as well as the insulin. It would be good to know how much insulin there is. But people are often put on insulin treatment or other diabetic drug without measuring those things so they don't actually know what they're suffering from.
**CONTEXT:** What additional factors should be considered alongside fasting blood sugar and A1C for a comprehensive understanding of diabetes?

**RAY PEAT:** The glycation of proteins is not really glycation in most cases. It's really a chemical reaction produced by the small fragments of polyunsaturated fats that are breaking down, producing things like acrolein which reacts and attaches to proteins and is interpreted as glycation. Glycation from fat is what most of it is.
**CONTEXT:** What is the actual cause of protein glycation, and how does it relate to fat breakdown?

**RAY PEAT:** They contain lots of nutrients, but the trouble is that they're produced by high temperature dehydration to make them concentrated in syrupy from the thin sap. Oh, the maple syrup, yeah. And the heating process, since the natural sap contains some amino acids and proteins, when you heat sugar in the presence of amino acids, you get brown toxic material. And it's the brown stuff which is allergenic and slightly toxic. So if you're going to do honey, you want to make sure you're going to do honey that's never been no heat whatsoever, just honey.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential issues with honey and maple syrup due to their processing, and how can these be avoided?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but when it reaches close to the boiling temperature. That's fine, yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Is pasteurizing honey acceptable?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the intestine is usually a trigger, but it's when you're... not getting circulation to a part of your optic part of your brain, right close to where your optic nerve enters your brain. You're having blood vessel spasms, and serotonin is involved. Aspirin and sugar are first aid for that, getting your serotonin. Under control. Thyroid is long range, preventing, by keeping your carbon dioxide up, it keeps the serotonin under control.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential causes and remedies for optic migraines, and what is the role of serotonin and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the blood sugar goes down at night, creating stress. All of the stress hormones rise during the night, and you can minimize that with, for example, a glass of milk with honey in it. Sugar, yeah, you told me that. You mentioned that before. That's what I do at night, put a little sugar in there.
**CONTEXT:** How does nighttime blood sugar decline contribute to stress, and what can be done to mitigate it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the brain can use them, but ketosis often refers to the condition that the body produces itself. If you find ketones in fruits and vegetables, they're very good for the brain and nerves. But if you produce the so-called ketosis, it includes some things that are not at all ketones. They're called ketone bodies, but one of them... is a reactive alcohol rather than a ketone. And so the ketones you produce yourself have side effects. If you get your ketones... in your diet, from food, they're fine.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between dietary ketones and endogenous ketones, and what are the potential side effects of the latter?
