**RAY PEAT:** Coconut oil. It's the saturated fat. It's shorter chains than in butter, and so it's easier to metabolize quickly, tends to heat up your metabolism, burn calories faster. You can get fat on butter, same number of grams of fat than on that amount of coconut oil, but they're both very safe for your health.
**CONTEXT:** What's in coconut oil that we like? Why do we like that?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, sugar is the other main thing that will heat up your metabolism just by burning the right kind of fuel. And the faster your metabolism runs, assuming you can back up the possibilities by having the nutrients, everything you need to go ahead at that speed, then everything is easier to normalize the faster you run the machine. For example, if you slow down the rate of metabolism and oxidative respiration, you produce more free radical damage, so the faster you oxidize, the less damage you get from oxidation.
**CONTEXT:** Coconut oil heats up our metabolism, and Dr. Pete, we want to do that because?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, to an extent, the free radical theory of aging has a lot to it, but the faster you run your machinery if all the nutrients to do it are present, then you produce less of those toxic free radicals.
**CONTEXT:** So the faster we oxidize, the less damage we get from oxidative stress?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you think of oxygen as the end point, everything tends to fall towards the atoms of oxygen. So if you remove oxygen from the system, all of those electrons that were flowing rapidly towards oxygen, creating a little bit of water and carbon dioxide, those electrons have no place to go, and they are what create free radical damage. So the rate of aging theory 100 years ago was popular, saying that if you could slow your oxygen consumption, you wouldn't age so fast, but exactly the opposite happens.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain to us what that is, really? Is it the whole energetics of the body just moving faster?

**RAY PEAT:** A breakdown of order, and the faster you run electrons through the system, the tighter the ordering is. It's sort of like there's a negative electron pressure when the system is really running and so it's in a laboratory that you don't want the germs to escape you keep a negative pressure sucking air so that nothing leaks out of the lab because it's pulling air into it and it's the same with the whole system of electrons flowing from one thing to another. If you slow the flow, then they can wander off. They get a positive pressure rather than a negative pressure. And those are the ones that are random and can do damage.
**CONTEXT:** So the faster we run the electrons through the system, the tighter the ordering.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and you don't want to just stop the free radical process by using antioxidants because that can in fact increase the oxygen, increase the electronic pressure of the cell. And it has turned out, 50 or 60 years ago, everyone was enthusiastic about slowing aging by using antioxidants. Like vitamin C and things like that? Yeah, and vitamin C is a good example because inside cells, it's an oxidant. And if you overload the system with the reductant vitamin C, it can stop the oxidative effect of vitamin C in the cell. Vitamin C in the cell is in the form of dehydroascorbate, about 70 or 80 percent of it is in the oxidant form. And if you overbalance that with too much, you start getting leaky electrons. And it's the same with some of the treatments. Using things like N-acetylcysteine or anything that donates electrons, it's easy to get too much of them and they will tend to disorganize the system.
**CONTEXT:** So that's, could that explain why maybe a little bit of vitamin C or people have a good experience with a little?

**RAY PEAT:** All of our foods except seeds and nuts and grains, every food we eat contains enough vitamin C. The people who started saying we need three or four thousand milligrams a day, it's true if you live on bread and pasta and peanuts and such, you can get scurvy. But if you eat fruits and vegetables and meats, eggs, fish, milk, all of those provide adequate vitamin C but they don't show up in the chemical tests that the people use because they were looking for a reductive form of vitamin C which isn't what we have inside the cells. So if you eat meat, the meat has oxidant vitamin C in it which can interchange when we eat it and show up as the reductive form and back into the dehydroascorbate form.
**CONTEXT:** Why could it be like some people believe that they have symptoms of flu, whatever that is, detoxification or whatever it's doing, that would help them, but could that just be placebo?

**RAY PEAT:** Linus Pauling and several other people advocated taking doses of around 5,000 or so milligrams per day and one of his followers said to take it to bowel tolerance, meaning up to the point where it causes diarrhea. And what it's doing is cleaning out your intestine and detoxifying your body. So that's what's going on. It's just helping the body to get rid of whatever it's trying to get rid of.
**CONTEXT:** So that's what's going on. It's just helping the body to get rid of whatever it's trying to get rid of.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and you get exactly the same results from any good laxative. Castor oil or whatever.
**CONTEXT:** Castor oil or whatever.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Ling and many other people were showing that the body basically knows best what it went from the environment and these. Introducing the idea that it has to pump things, that it takes energy to live. That idea that everything that's in the cell, at a different concentration than outside, they say that takes energy. And when Ling added up all of those things, the being alive. It took at least 15 times as much energy as a cell could possibly have. Life is impossible from the membrane pump perspective, but the way science works, you can do it. Supposedly demonstrate one pump working. Someone else demonstrates another pump working. And all together, you need 15 times more energy than the cell could possibly have, but no one has pushed into explaining how that would be possible.
**CONTEXT:** So what is it that the mainstream biological and virologists and people have been doing for all of this time, that Ling and Hillman contradict? How does that affect our view of our body? I mean, what's really going on that helps us to understand what our body is doing in these cells if it's not like we're being told?

**RAY PEAT:** Very much, yeah. For example, the role of carbon dioxide, it's very obvious in Gilbert Ling's perspective that carbon dioxide is a one of the most beneficial materials in the universe. It makes water alive, basically. And so if you're respiring intensely, producing a lot of carbon dioxide, that shifts away from the lactic acid and free radical damage. The carbon dioxide has an antioxidant effect against the harmful free radicals. It's the only antioxidant that is successful in the body.
**CONTEXT:** So what does that mean to us, that the... Are we getting back to the idea that just with the proper nutrients that the body is going to do what it needs to do and heal?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we're turning up our lactic acid and the free radical producing damage form of oxidation.
**CONTEXT:** So, what's really going on in the cells is not really what we believed, it's more, do you think Cowan's onto it and Gerald Pollock, this idea of this goo stuff and more of a, what do you think is really what our bodies are made out of?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think in the video I saw one picture that looks like it was Sidney Fox's spontaneous formation of micro-cells, where he just heated amino acids and wet them and they formed little cell-like structures, and in a warm medium with amino acids and water, they would bud and grow just like living cells, but there was nothing present but amino acids and water. And so the basic substance, you could say, is amino acids and water. And the other things, nucleic acids, that simplest form of protein and water will then select the materials for making nucleic acids. And so the genes, in fact, come after the living cell, and the genes are shaped according to the preexisting cytoplasm, all of that is perfectly understandable by Gilbert Ling's perspective. In the 60s, Leninger included that work of Sidney Fox's in his textbook, but it was so alien to standard biology and medicine. The later editions of the book after Leninger died removed that most important chapter.
**CONTEXT:** So that would explain the idea that what we think and what we believe, our state of consciousness, as well as our nutrition and our lifestyle, is affecting everything and not genetics affecting us.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, right. Just the opposite of what we're told, right? All this genetic stuff is like... We're going to fix the genes and you're going to be healthy or something.
**CONTEXT:** All this genetic stuff is like... We're going to fix the genes and you're going to be healthy or something.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's for the standard medical, biological approach. It's all a machine and they think they understand what a machine is.
**CONTEXT:** I see. So would that then harken back to the idea that just because grandpa or grandma had a bad heart, we're not going to have a bad heart necessarily, right?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know, but the tendency is there. Where would the tendency be? For example, there have been many historical studies looking at the records of populations. And it works in animals too. If you starve grandma, the offspring are likely to be, in effect, malnourished for four or five generations after that.
**CONTEXT:** For example, there have been many historical studies looking at the records of populations. And it works in animals too. If you starve grandma, the offspring are likely to be, in effect, malnourished for four or five generations after that.

**RAY PEAT:** Right? But that would not be something that, so it would just be all the way into the whole total organism, who have this tendency, right, to be starved or something. Yeah, if you overfeed the starved grandma's offspring, then it doesn't have to run that average of four or five generations. You can do it in all-in-one generation.
**CONTEXT:** Right? But that would not be something that, so it would just be all the way into the whole total organism, who have this tendency, right, to be starved or something.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I see. Yeah. Like if you start with a baby born with the malnourished small brain. If you give it the nutrients and the support that the organism needs to use the nutrients, a good body temperature, for example, is necessary to grow brain material. And so with the right support, a small underdeveloped baby can go on developing outside the uterus. And the earlier you start with repairing the historical damage, the more complete the correction can be. And working with animals, people have demonstrated that just by supplying the nutrients to the brain, essential nutrients for brain growth during gestation. They can create animals, a rat or a chicken for example, with a brain bigger than that species ever had and more intelligent than anyone that ever knew that species.

They can create animals, a rat or a chicken for example, with a brain bigger than that species ever had and more intelligent than anyone that ever knew that species.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it definitely disproves that our intelligence is a product of the genes only. Because with an animal or a species that never got very far mentally, giving it great support, you can make it much more intelligent.
**CONTEXT:** So that would add to this whole idea of... somehow of evolution and how the specie evolves, huh?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and in the present situation, not vaccinating pregnant women. The animal studies have shown that every vaccination has an adjuvant that is intended to create systemic inflammation. And every inflammation during pregnancy damages the development of the fetus.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, and in the present situation, not vaccinating pregnant women. The animal studies have shown that every vaccination has an adjuvant that is intended to create systemic inflammation. And every inflammation during pregnancy damages the development of the fetus.

**RAY PEAT:** Wow. Every inflammation in gestation is damaging the fetus in some way. Yes. Thousands of experiments have demonstrated how sensitive the developing fetus is. But the World Health Organization goes on and advocates pregnant women getting influenza shots with adjuvant designed to create inflammation. It's probably the biggest crime of history to advocate vaccinating pregnant women.

It's probably the biggest crime of history to advocate vaccinating pregnant women.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, or it could be the newer plant extracts or fats or things that they don't have a history of creating damage and so they're putting them in as adjuvants that create inflammation, but no one has a history of the specific damage from that specific adjuvant.
**CONTEXT:** So these adjuvants are mercury and aluminum and other very anti-inflammatory things and poisons, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the present, RNA vaccines, some of them are using either synthetic lipids or a plant extract.
**CONTEXT:** Have you been learning any more about these injections that are going on? Are they as dangerous as many people are saying, in your opinion?

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that Mikey Eden and Sutard Bhakti are the closest to being accurate. Are they? And they are both... they don't agree with each other on every detail, but they, for example... Jaden says, I can't see any benign explanation for how this could be done innocently. He thinks there's a deliberate motive to sterilize the population.
**CONTEXT:** Are they? And they are both... they don't agree with each other on every detail, but they, for example... Jaden says, I can't see any benign explanation for how this could be done innocently. He thinks there's a deliberate motive to sterilize the population.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, sir. Yes, sir. When we had Bhakti on our show not long ago, Dr. P... He was really more concerned about these boosters that he felt like if somebody just got one they could maybe get away with it, but I don't know.
**CONTEXT:** Yes, sir. Yes, sir. When we had Bhakti on our show not long ago, Dr. P... He was really more concerned about these boosters that he felt like if somebody just got one they could maybe get away with it, but I don't know.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a mass effect. A little damage isn't as bad as sequential damages, one after the other endlessly.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, it's a mass effect. A little damage isn't as bad as sequential damages, one after the other endlessly.

**RAY PEAT:** I was speaking with a lady, maybe early 40s, a young child. Very healthy and not vaxxed, and she actually had intermittent bleeding and things like that, and really disrupting her cycle after being close in proximity to vaxxed people for a night.
**CONTEXT:** I was speaking with a lady, maybe early 40s, a young child. Very healthy and not vaxxed, and she actually had intermittent bleeding and things like that, and really disrupting her cycle after being close in proximity to vaxxed people for a night.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Pfizer manual for instructing the people who administer the vaccine. They were aware of research going back several years showing that whatever nucleic acid might be circulating in your blood shows up in your breath and your skin. The shedding is a perfectly soundly established thing going back 10 or 15 years.
**CONTEXT:** So there's something going on, huh?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and they warned about being, letting a vaccinated person be in the presence of a pregnant or breastfeeding woman.
**CONTEXT:** Really? Wow.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, if it causes those. uh extreme changes in women there will be some analogous change in men.
**CONTEXT:** What about us guys? I mean, we're only hearing the shedding with the ladies and the disruption of that. Anything there with the guys?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, several people have warned that vaccinated people should be quarantined for at least two weeks.
**CONTEXT:** So are we going to you think we're just going to want to be around vax people?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they have been talking about a self-propagating vaccine for years. You vaccinate one person and that person sheds and vaccinates everyone around them. So the idea has been proposed as a way to spontaneously vaccinate the whole world without having to treat everyone.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, they have been talking about a self-propagating vaccine for years. You vaccinate one person and that person sheds and vaccinates everyone around them. So the idea has been proposed as a way to spontaneously vaccinate the whole world without having to treat everyone.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, great. Oh, great. That's great news, Doc.
**CONTEXT:** Oh, great. Oh, great. That's great news, Doc.

**RAY PEAT:** The difference is pine pollen is probably one of the best nutrient food substances on on the earth. And you see it's made to be uptaken by all of the life around it. All the other plants take it in and use it for growth. Many of the animals eat it and it's a very nutrient substance. If you eat it, what happens is it goes through your GI tract and then puts it into the bloodstream. There's a lot of great stuff in it. It's really high in amino acids and protein and vitamins, so it's a very magnificent substance, kind of a nutrient longevity tonic food. It will over time raise levels, but if you really want to raise them fast, you don't want to let it go through your GI tract, hence the use of a tincture.
**CONTEXT:** Previously we asked him, what's the difference between gathering some pine pollen, eating that, and then maybe taking survival pine pollen and the grape alcohol, the tincture. What's the difference in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, oh sure. Just recently I've been seeing the effects of raising the body temperature on people with Parkinson's-like symptoms or Alzheimer's. Losing memory and general cognition, if you just even artificially get their brain temperature up to where it should be, around 99 degrees, their functions come back pretty well. You have to be sure not to get the body temperature up without keeping the memory temperature down. Food coming in, having orange juice or milk while heating the body, otherwise these people in a weakened condition suddenly needing a lot of metabolic energy, it's very common to faint when you warm up quickly.
**CONTEXT:** What about this idea we were talking about and Cowan mentioned and I kind of thought was true, on the fever idea, do you think that's valid? You know, fevers and heat and saunas?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's just the shape of the progesterone molecule that is such a stabilizing function that... It doesn't have to be turned into either aldosterone or cortisol, but in the absence of those, the progesterone itself has some of that function in the sense of helping to retain sodium in your bloodstream and to not get hypoglycemia. But it's not being turned into either of those. And if you have, for example, a tumor producing too much aldosterone or cortisol, taking a large amount of progesterone protects against the excess of those. So it's an intrinsic property of the progesterone that can balance either an excess or deficiency of the other hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Adrenal glands are required for making cortisol. And aldosterone from progesterone. How did progesterone substitute for the absence of adrenal glands in Hans Selye's experiments, S-E-L-Y-E-S experiments?

**RAY PEAT:** So, before we get to that, so when you just do a little dab of the progestes, do you know how many milligrams we're getting? Because a lot of people are taking 30 to 50 milligrams of the progesterone creams. Oh, in the cream, I don't have any idea how much you're absorbing through your skin, because people's skin has different amounts of blood supply and thicker, thinner skin. So it's highly unpredictable from a topical. How much you're getting in there, yeah. Because they claim you get one squirt for 50, but who knows how much is going in? About 5 or 10 percent. Is that right? Wow. So what about the progestes? How much is going in a dab of that? We don't really have a way to measure that, do we? If it goes into your mouth, it's essentially 100% absorbed.
**CONTEXT:** So, before we get to that, so when you just do a little dab of the progestes, do you know how many milligrams we're getting? Because a lot of people are taking 30 to 50 milligrams of the progesterone creams.

**RAY PEAT:** And milligram-wise, can you conjecture? Eighth of a teaspoon is 50 milligrams. Wow! An eighth of a teaspoon? Let me write that down. That's not a lot, is it? No. That's pretty small. An eighth of a teaspoon is 50 milligrams. Of the progestes.
**CONTEXT:** And milligram-wise, can you conjecture? Eighth of a teaspoon is 50 milligrams. Wow! An eighth of a teaspoon? Let me write that down. That's not a lot, is it? No. That's pretty small. An eighth of a teaspoon is 50 milligrams. Of the progestes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's why just two or three drops gives you maybe 15 milligrams. And so there's no real issues about getting just a little bit too much of that?
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, that's why just two or three drops gives you maybe 15 milligrams. And so there's no real issues about getting just a little bit too much of that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, not in that range. Some people with extremely high estrogen can hardly feel a half a teaspoon of progesterone until they get their estrogen under control.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, not in that range. Some people with extremely high estrogen can hardly feel a half a teaspoon of progesterone until they get their estrogen under control.

**RAY PEAT:** Irritability is one of the main signs. Restlessness. And then with prolonged exposure, the breasts develop. I'm sorry. Oh, for guys, you could actually start to grow some breasts. Yeah. And girls often start getting the effects, both the development of the nipples and the irritability. And psychological effects of estrogen when they're only around nine years old.
**CONTEXT:** What would be a sign, before we go, what would be a sign of extremely high estrogen for boys and girls? What would be some signs, if you think, just to tell you, your estrogen's not happy too high?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. In the animal studies, it made the male young more feminine. Their genitals were feminized and then their susceptibility to cancer later in life was increased.
**CONTEXT:** Oh, yeah. In the animal studies, it made the male young more feminine. Their genitals were feminized and then their susceptibility to cancer later in life was increased.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I read stories about some of the either somehow the Philippines got all hooked up in this whole soy milk craze, Doc, I guess in the 80s, right, when it all came out. And they were going into, they were, you know, starting to have their periods at 10 years old.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, I read stories about some of the either somehow the Philippines got all hooked up in this whole soy milk craze, Doc, I guess in the 80s, right, when it all came out. And they were going into, they were, you know, starting to have their periods at 10 years old.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, sometimes earlier. Wow. That's not good, right? No. No.
**CONTEXT:** Oh yeah, sometimes earlier. Wow. That's not good, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. It allows better development of bones and full development of the brain and personality.
**CONTEXT:** Really? Fascinating. So just in general, our culture, these young girls starting their periods at 12, 13, it's probably more unnatural than what it would be if we lived out in the woods or something, maybe.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Right. Right.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah. Right. Right.

**RAY PEAT:** People are always shedding. Whether they've been vaccinated or not, for years they've been testing breath as a way of analyzing what's going on in your body. If you put a cold piece of metal under your nose and exhale the hot air under the cold thing, it condenses. And then they analyze the fluid and things as big as large stretches of DNA and RNA are somehow getting into the air stream when you exhale. And rubbing the skin, you can find all kinds of genetic material, as well as proteins and other chemicals. So you can pretty well tell what a person has been exposed to by testing both their skin and their breath for these pretty large molecules. It's hard to imagine how they get vaporized.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. P, please explain shedding. I'm hearing all kinds of things. I went to an Eagles concert last month. And you either had to be vaccinated or tested, which I got tested against my will, but I wanted to see the Eagles in concert. So I questioned shedding because I was around thousands of people that had been vaccinated, but I really haven't had any kind of experience from it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but if it isn't turning to estrogen. That's a good thing. If it was turning to estrogen, he would be experiencing something like breast growth, but I think it's okay to have very high testosterone.
**CONTEXT:** His testosterone level is 1,139. Wow. He's 77. His total cholesterol is 266. Estradiol 27, DHT 47. I do not feel any benefits for such a high testosterone. Is that an issue? He is asking. That's pretty high, right? 1,139?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I use that a lot. You use it a lot? Just according to how good it tastes. Yeah, yeah. You know, I have noticed I really do think the organic orange juice and juice orange juice taste better. It tastes sweeter, I think, unless it's just a placebo thing, doc. I don't know.
**CONTEXT:** Thanks for watching! that don't have organics, is it okay if I drink orange juice from conventional orange juice?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it does contain vitamin C, but I don't think it's a main value. Organic orange peel is clean because a lot of the chemicals agricultural. Chemicals would be concentrated in the peeling, but the anti-inflammatory chemicals that are in the juice itself are very concentrated in the peeling. So its main benefit would be to make marmalade out of it.
**CONTEXT:** How about this? Would you please ask Dr. Pete if my organic orange peels and powder then would be a good source of vitamin C?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. When we find some, even if they're bitter, not good for juice, we use the peeling for making marmalade.
**CONTEXT:** So you think in general, in your opinion, and with the non- With the conventional oranges that most of the yuck stuff would be in the peels and not in the juice, you think?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, um... high protein foods, eggs, seafood, shellfish in particular, copper is one of the minerals needed to make strong connective tissues.
**CONTEXT:** And what would be some foods that might help this hernia, what do you think?

**RAY PEAT:** Oysters. Oysters, stuff like that. Now you told me like in the seafood department you like... You think some of the best things are, what do you say, scallops. Is that right?
**CONTEXT:** Oysters. Oysters, stuff like that. Now you told me like in the seafood department you like... You think some of the best things are, what do you say, scallops. Is that right?

**RAY PEAT:** Mm-hmm. Yeah, we can get some nice ones here.
**CONTEXT:** Mm-hmm. Yeah, we can get some nice ones here.

**RAY PEAT:** Often, when the first places you see it, there is an infectious... It's a tuberculin disease, but I haven't seen one of those. But several women over the last 40 years have been diagnosed as having essentially an incurable, untreatable lupus causing arthritis and skin symptoms. And they all quickly recovered as soon as they figured out how to lower their estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** I guess that's similar to systemic lupus erythematosus. The skin is...

**RAY PEAT:** Lowering the estrogen. Interesting. Yeah, vitamin D. Calcium, preferably milk in the diet, and not too much meat or seafood as a source of too much phosphate and supplementing thyroid and progesterone as needed. And they've had their blood test. That showed they had the classical lupus pattern of antibodies and they were recovering by the tests as well as by their symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. Yeah, must be. Do you see that whole thing with Theranos and this lady, this lady who convinced? About a hundred million dollars worth of investors that she could do like what 25 30 or 40 different tests from one drop of blood? Have you followed that story at all? Amazing story. Oh yeah. She had no shortage of people wanting to invest. Yeah, yeah. I mean they had big... big-time people like George Shultz and, you know, really heavy hitters, Bill Clinton and all this. And it turns out this thing didn't ever work. Never worked. Man.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, and you don't have to go to the place, and I think it was like 90 bucks, and I guess it's accurate, I don't know. But it seemed like a very reputable organization, the test looks all well, you know, put together and very organized and everything. I guess it would be possible to get a TSH level off of enough blood like that, huh?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you already had it, Chickenpox isn't really a disease. It's a detoxification thing, isn't it, Doc? I think it spreads from school teachers are very susceptible to it even though they had it when they were a kid, being around kids that develop it. It can spread to the teachers and their families, but usually the second time you get it, it's only a few spots, rather than the first time it can cover your whole body. But for this person, probably not much they need to do, it's probably just going to work itself out, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the people who started saying we need three or four thousand milligrams a day, it's true if you live on bread and pasta and peanuts and such, you can get scurvy. But if you eat fruits and vegetables and meats, eggs, fish, milk, all of those provide adequate vitamin C but they don't show up in the chemical tests that the people use because they were looking for a reductive form of vitamin C which isn't what we have inside the cells. So if you eat meat, the meat has oxidant vitamin C in it which can interchange when we eat it and show up as the reductive form and back into the dehydroascorbate form.
**CONTEXT:** I've been doing some pine pollen that Patrick talks about, an elk antler for testosterone. Here's this as a lady. I feel pretty perky, a little bit tingly, and I'm also doing some progesterone from Dr. Pete on my gums and lips. So, it seems like I'm doing better, I'm feeling better, but should I get some compound pharmacy cream for estrogen to help with dryness down there, or use suppositories to moisturize down there?

**RAY PEAT:** A few simple things like better nutrition, vitamin A and D and calcium and so on. But the local moisturizing effect, the amount of topical estrogen it takes to do that is being absorbed and spreading all through your body with the usual risks of promoting cancer and so on, so the whole idea of menopause as an estrogen deficiency is actually a reduction of estrogen in the bloodstream while the estrogen builds up inside cells where it does the damage. And the reason you don't see it in the bloodstream is from a progesterone deficiency. Progesterone. So when you don't see estrogen in the blood, it's because it's staying inside cells and doing its damage.

**RAY PEAT:** You just take a little dab of it, you think, every day for a guy? Yeah, that's what I do. Take a little dab, huh? And what does that do for us guys? What does it do for us men? If you're having any rheumatic symptoms, sword veins, for example, rubbing it in that area reduces the inflammation. But generally, if your body is turning your testosterone into estrogen, you are likely to be losing a general sense of vigor and the progesterone, by inhibiting the aromatase turning to estrogen, the progesterone is going to actually raise your testosterone when you're in a certain range. So it's just a good thing for guys to take a little hit of that, right?
**CONTEXT:** I bought some of that one that you developed, which is progestes, a little bottle. I keep it in the fridge. Trouble with the fridge is I don't remember to take it because it's in the fridge. But when I do remember, how much do I do?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you don't need it, then it has its intrinsic antitestosterone action. So a young 30-year-old isn't likely to see any benefit, but rather a blocking of their testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Well, you and I are way above that, so we're okay.
**CONTEXT:** Well, you and I are way above that, so we're okay.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the basic idea. The mast cell isn't the only source of histamine, but it's a major source, and it's one that has been studied the most, and estrogen activates the mast cells to produce more estrogen, more histamine, and progesterone has the opposite effect, reducing histamine formation and release from the mast cells. And so for such things as the bladder oversensitivity, you can pretty much turn that off by increasing your thyroid and progesterone because of their effect on the estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** Is that a gut dysbiosis problem? Should I be looking at thyroid or gut dysbiosis or hormones, increased progesterone to adjust the histamine sensitivity? I do not take any thyroid supplements right now.

**RAY PEAT:** Around 0.2 or 0.3 or 0.4. That low. So now I'm going to do this little test I told you about. I've been taking the piggy thyroid, you know, for a couple months. And so if I get this guy and it says my test, my my TSH is maybe one or two. It used to be three. Hopefully it'll be down. I'm feeling great. Would I just increase that the piggy and just keep it till I get to 0.5? Is that how you do it?
**CONTEXT:** And we want to get that TSH 0.5, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Temperature when I wake up in the morning, like 91, 98.1, something like that. Oh, that's probably good. Pretty good. After breakfast, it should be up to 98, 6 or 7. Yeah, it goes up, it goes up, like after the show, it's up there. Yeah, that's the most practical way to judge your thyroid level, but you can back it up by looking at your blood test.
**CONTEXT:** What about your temperature? Temperature when I wake up in the morning, like 91, 98.1, something like that. Oh, that's probably good. Pretty good.

**RAY PEAT:** Not really. Not really? There are a lot of companies that don't really know how to process the natural glandular material, so if you find the product that works just right, then you should stay with it because a lot of the products aren't labeled accurately. It can either be too strong or too weak. The good thing about the synthetic is that it's very consistent.
**CONTEXT:** Is there a big difference between the little piggy stuff like I have? I got it from Vietnam, this natural piggy stuff, and the... The stuff made in the lab, is there a big difference?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. In the animal studies, it made the male young more feminine. Their genitals were feminized and then their susceptibility to cancer later in life was increased.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I read stories about some of the either somehow the Philippines got all hooked up in this whole soy milk craze, Doc, I guess in the 80s, right, when it all came out. And they were going into, they were, you know, starting to have their periods at 10 years old.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, sometimes earlier. Wow. That's not good, right? No. No.
**CONTEXT:** Oh yeah, sometimes earlier. Wow. That's not good, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. It allows better development of bones and full development of the brain and personality.
**CONTEXT:** Really? Fascinating. So just in general, our culture, these young girls starting their periods at 12, 13, it's probably more unnatural than what it would be if we lived out in the woods or something, maybe.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Right. Right.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah. Right. Right.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, the weather has been too cold to spend much time outside lately. Oh, so that's where you paint, you paint outside? Yeah. Ah, you paint landscapes and things. Oh. Ah, everything, but just to not mess up the house with paint. That's right. Don't mess up the house.
**CONTEXT:** And how's your painting coming? You're still painting?
