**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, the altitude is even more important than the steady sunlight, but degenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis was one of the first things they noticed, very little of it towards the equator and farther north you get the deficiency of ultraviolet and vitamin D ends up with all the inflammatory degenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and nerve disease."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the health benefits of living closer to the equator and the role of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "That really is one of the most neglected areas of health research, but the insurance companies were wise to it 120 years ago or more that the degenerative diseases, cancer and heart disease, are about 10% lower chronically in all of the high cities of the world. In 1959 in his book Linus Pauling saw those figures and he was... concentrating on radiation mutations causing cancer and he saw those old figures showing that cancer mortality decreases steadily as you go up in altitude. He couldn't believe it. He said that. Something must be wrong with those figures, but it turns out someone reading his book in Texas compared the amount that they figured that melanoma would be the most responsive to the high ultraviolet light at high altitude. So this person made a map of the state, comparing the altitude and the mortality from melanoma, and found that even within the moderate altitude range of Texas, there is much less melanoma at higher altitudes, much more at lower altitudes. So it definitely isn't just ultraviolet radiation causing mutations. The increased vitamin D at altitude is one of the anti-cancer, anti-aging factors. But apart from the vitamin D at altitude, many other things change. Within, I think it was Bolivia, two cities were compared. One at around 13,500 feet altitude, one around 4,000 feet at not low altitude, but even within that 9,000 foot difference. There were eight times as many hundred year old people in a city of the same population at high altitude. Just a vast difference in extreme longevity for the high altitude. And within New Mexico, every thousand feet higher you go, you see lower death rate from heart disease. The best understood factor that changes with altitude when you're adapted is that your carbon dioxide rises with altitude, and the higher the carbon dioxide is, the less lactic acid your cells produce. And lactic acid metabolism is characteristic of stress, typical of cancer metabolism, but also heart disease and other inflammatory conditions."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of altitude in health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Right. Breathing in a paper bag, I've seen people lower their blood pressure in a day just by every half hour or so, breathing for about a minute in a paper bag. And the blood pressure comes down because of the carbon dioxide displacing inflammatory lactic acid."

**CONTEXT:** The host connects altitude's effect on CO2 to breathing techniques like the Buteyko method.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the fall and winter of 2019, the Chinese identified the coronavirus that was associated with pneumonia. But very quickly, they found that there were five variations of that virus, indicating that it had been around and mutating for a while, and then… once they had the PCR test to Identify it the people around the world started checking storage samples and a batch of sewage I think was in Portugal from January of 2019 About a year before the Chinese virus the coronavirus was identified in Portuguese sewage a year earlier so Definitely didn't just originate by the time it got to China. There were always already at least five varieties and that rate of mutation Indicates that by now almost a year later We would expect to have about 25 5 variants of the virus 25 and that's the reason After about 70 years of trying I guess 80 years Of trying to make a vaccine against the common cold They found it was impossible because the corona virus mutates so fast so the reason we don't have a vaccines for common cold would suggest that there will never be a vaccine that is actually effective for the corona virus, but If you look at what happened with the polio vaccine the polio Was identified as certain kinds of paralysis and so every time It for 50 years there was accumulating evidence that a polio like paralysis Coincided with the use of the hypodermic needle for intramuscular injections and it was Confirmed in animal studies as well as continuing into Africa that the part of the body that receives the intramuscular vaccine is very likely to be the limb that is paralyzed showing that it's the intramuscular injection causing the paralysis but despite that they came out with a polio vaccine and suddenly the incidence of Paralytic polio dropped sharply so that the vaccine was confirmed to work, but Oddly the incidence of other types of paralysis similar Actual Paralytic symptoms were given a new name Diene-Barré and Myelitis Transverse myelitis and several other types of paralysis suddenly shot up Right after the introduction of the polio vaccine. So by changing the definition You can make a vaccine seem to work very efficiently and In the case of Covid since When the the great peak of Covid incidents and mortality appeared in the second week of April of this year there was the incidence of Influenza fell off a cliff Very strongly indicated that What they had called influenza suddenly the definition changed ending the influenza epidemic and and creating this huge peak in in Covid and So we can expect once the vaccine comes into use there will be an instruction instead of Saying that a cough and and the fever of a hundred degrees Are the symptoms that will have you written down as a Covid patient? They'll simply change the return to a rational way of diagnosing Covid and make it a little more restrictive and suddenly the the Covid cases will disappear Because they'll change the definition of what a Covid case is and then they'll say the vaccine worked"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's opinion on the COVID-19 virus and the potential for mandatory vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've for a very stable kind of virus like smallpox possibly Yeah, it works pretty well for smallpox so they could eliminate the disease by surrounding the areas where it was out breaking and vaccinate people in a circle and That that is simply not in their plans if the vaccines worked they could circle an outbreak and quarantine the sick people and their immediate contacts and Eliminate the virus quickly if the vaccine worked if it so some viruses don't mutate like the corona like the smallpox and that's why it's possible to actually literally isolate the smallpox and Electron microscope and you can actually see it and then thus create a vaccine which is the theory behind vaccines the smallpox viruses is a DNA virus And the corona virus is an RNA and they're extremely unstable unstable RNA viruses are unstable. So these coronaviruses are they're always running around and mutating In the world just always and they're cold people experience colds and flus from them. Yeah And if a very sick old person catches a cold Not uncommon for Just a common cold to kill someone sure right the body so"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's true that vaccines can't be created for viruses that mutate rapidly.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I and a few other people started looking at the actual numbers back in March of this year and We couldn't see that anything at all was happening And it's only a few people Early who were saying that but by now Looking back at the actual figures more and more people are recognizing that But nothing happened there was no pandemic no pandemic."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the current situation is no different from any other RNA virus.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. And he said that he designed it to be used for a maximum number of cycles, cycles, yes, 34 cycles, I think he said, yes. And he said, beyond that, it becomes meaningless, because it produces more and more random results. But Fauci ordered them to run 40 cycles, you're much more likely to have a false positive when you run it beyond its designed capacity."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the validity of the PCR test and its cycle count.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, let's talk about that. We actually have a video that we played, and we could play it again. I don't know if it's necessary. In July, Dr. Fauci saying anything above a 30 to 35 cycles, and he said, I like 30. Anything, you're just getting dead nucleotides."

**CONTEXT:** The host references Dr. Fauci's comments on PCR cycle counts.

**RAY PEAT:** "So tell us what a cycle is. They're spinning the blood after they're spinning the thing they get from your nose, they spin it so many times? You know, the virus itself is enclosed. in a bunch of proteins like any of our exosomes, but the unique RNA that can be identified is enclosed in that protein circle sphere, and if your immune system has started tearing apart that virus, the virus no longer is infective, so you can call it dead, and so you just have scraps of material. But all the PCR needs is to have a scrap of RNA, and that will identify the virus, even though you might have a hundred scraps for every active virus."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an explanation of PCR cycles and what a "dead nucleotide" is.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's true, but it's a certain way to create false positives in cases that don't exist. So these cases, if you're spinning at 40, as Fauci said himself, above 30 is dead nuclear tides. They don't necessarily mean that somebody has a live, active, virulent, potentially deadly virus, right? They just don't, do they?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if high PCR cycle counts lead to false positives for active viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, almost all of the viruses that come into existence just end up as random dust fragments, and one of 100 different molecules can be identified as viral RNA, but it has no infective power at all."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if these detected viral fragments are infectious.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. They are structurally and functionally very similar to our own exosomes. Our cells, under stress, emit particles that are intended to communicate between tissues, for example. If you have lung inflammation, exosomes will be put into the bloodstream and go to the bone marrow and the bone marrow will recognize a problem in lung cells and make repair cells. But the virus is similar to the RNA or DNA fragments that are turned into exosomes. And so once it gets caught into a cell, the cell can multiply it in proportion to the stress it's experiencing. So a healthy cell can receive a virus and it's not making exosomes, so it probably won't make virus particles either. But once it gets into this stressed cell producing exosome-like particles, the virus can get spewed out into the bloodstream and lungs as a potentially infective virus."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if viruses are living organisms and how they relate to exosomes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, to restore balance in the different parts of the body."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the body creates exosomes to heal.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, under an electron microscope it's essentially impossible to tell the difference. Possible."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if exosomes look exactly like coronaviruses.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, we've had colds forever and this is just another variation of that family of viruses."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the speaker believes there are no actual coronaviruses, only exosomes.

**RAY PEAT:** "In all of the studies over the last 70 or 80 years they have found that it's extremely hard to deliberately pass a cold. It's impossible almost, isn't it? Almost, yeah. You have to get a person to lie down with their head slightly lower and then take the mucus from the nose of someone who is extremely infected and drip it right into their nose. And then some of those people will come down with the virus. But just sitting around all day, for example, in a small room with some infected people and others not infected, there's almost no chance of it actually passing by casual contact such as playing cards. They've put a dye in the nose of one person playing cards and after playing cards for a while, the dye from one person's nose is going to end up on everyone's hands and face. So even though there is contact and spreading of material, it just happens that it's very seldom that that kind of contact is going to spread a cold. Or a flu. Yeah, yeah. Similar."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if colds are caught from others or if they are self-generated.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you have to be somewhat sick and stressed before you come down with any of these potentially infective things."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if colds and flus are generally not caught from external sources but rather from within.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, since the 1940s there's been a lot of investigation of that subject and finding that it goes across species and families and phyla, the most distant organism like tree pollen. The DNA from tree pollen can get into our bodies."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if exosomes can be exchanged between people and if this exchange can help with overcoming issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the whole Lamarck thing was politically, philosophically rejected, but scientifically the evidence has gradually forced its way back and still professors generally get very angry if you try to say that all of these new facts are confirming Lamarck. They're saying it's something very different, but it acts exactly the way Lamarckism predicted that they would work out."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on Lamarckism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, actually, Darwin himself asserted that it happened, that an acquired adaptive trait, that something that the organism learns to do, to be immune to or resist, that can be passed on to the offspring. Darwin proposed that there were gemmules created by every cell containing and describing its abilities and that these gemmules formed during the life of an individual, traveled through the bloodstream to the gonads and entered the germ cells, passing on acquired information. That was Darwin himself refining Lamarck's general idea. But with neo-Darwinism, Darwin himself was censored and genes became unchangeable things. For example, a very stupid series of experiments in Germany, cutting off, I think it was 1,200 mouse tails and then showing that no mice were born with amputated tails. Oh, so that's how they were going to disprove this idea. Yeah, it had nothing to do with what either Darwin or Lamarck had proposed, just an insane experiment. But people were still citing that in university when I was there, a really deep-ended sort of logic."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a clarification of Lamarckism and Darwin's views on acquired traits.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sometimes, not always. And we might pass these along to baby? Sometimes yeah. If the general health is very bad, the emphasis tended to be on denying that anything was inheritable or acquired from the environment, and so it all had to be genetic. So all of the effects of malnutrition, poverty, all of these effects were blamed on bad genes. For example, until just 20 or 30 years ago, the dogma medically was that eclampsia, seizures during pregnancy, retention during pregnancy, premature birth, damaged babies and so on. All this was absolutely genetic that the baby had bad genes that were causing the eclampsia in the mother. So the doctor had no responsibility to cure their bad inheritance, and they were denying that nutrition could have anything to do with prematurity and pregnancy problems because of the absolute genetic determinism. But starting with a few doctors like Tom Brewer, he showed that if you give women a reasonable amount of protein, a slightly more expensive diet, and don't restrict their salt or anything they crave, you absolutely prevent eclampsia and tremendously reduce birth defects and prematurity and so on. So that completely wiped out, not completely, but it wiped out the genetic determinism idea."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about passing on inherited conditions like leprosy, herpes, and syphilis, and if these are fragments or something else.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, genes and viruses both have been used for the last 120 years as an excuse for why you can't make someone well. The doctor says, oh, it's a virus, we don't have an antibiotic to cure viruses, or it's a gene, it's hopeless. But instead of giving them a good diet, vitamin supplements, or whatever it takes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the common practice of blaming genes and viruses for health issues instead of addressing diet and supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, no I don't. About 50 years ago the industry started pushing wheat on the Mexican population and they started introducing it into tortillas, wheat tortillas. A horrible thing. The unleavened wheat especially is toxic, worse than even the well-leavened bread. If it has been processed by a sourdough method that breaks down many of the toxins. But wheat ______. Our wheat tortilla is just a horrible thing. is just not a good thing."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat considers wheat flour in empanadas acceptable.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the plain corn, as was eaten throughout the southern United States, it has a toxic excess of leucine and it contains no niacin to speak of. And nixtamalizing it reduces the toxic amount of leucine and tremendously increases the amount of niacin. So that in a kilogram of tortillas, you've got an amount of calcium that is almost like a quart of milk. Wow. So it doesn't matter what kind of corn. Well, of course, we'd want it to be organic if possible, but the nixtamalization really ramps up the nutritional profile of it."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if corn is nutritious enough to warrant the effort of nixtamalization.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ideal way would be to have a menstruation, but the anti-estrogen of tamoxifen, it has enough estrogenic effects that it tremendously increases the risk of endometrial polyps. I think the restoration of a physiological cycle, even if it doesn't succeed in menstruation, but if you correct your thyroid vitamin D calcium intake, that's going to shift the balance favorably away from estrogen, and it's the unopposed estrogen that leads to the polyps."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how menopausal women can get rid of endometrial polyps.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. They're pretty good. A few years ago, one of the companies was doing horribly inaccurate tests, but when they were exposed, they improved their methods, and so I think now the average hospital at a moderate price should be $30 to $50 per test."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the accuracy of vitamin D blood tests.

**RAY PEAT:** "Fifty nanograms. How many? Fifty-five zero. Oh, 50 nanograms. Per milliliter. Which is the number they normally show, right?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an optimal vitamin D level.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. The ultraviolet light does age your skin, so you don't want to get sunburned, but once your vitamin D level is up as a result of sunshine, then you're getting many other internal benefits from the bright sunlight because the other wavelengths, especially red light, neutralize and detoxify the aging effects of the ultraviolet, and so you get side effects other than the vitamin D if you get sunlight."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the difference between getting vitamin D internally versus from the sun.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the chicken lamps are very good because they have the usable, more or less, full spectrum white looking light, and provide heat, red light, and the cheery brightness itself is very important."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about different types of red lights.

**RAY PEAT:** "Inversion? Inversion, yeah, I guess flipping over on your, on your head. Oh, that? Yeah. No, I don't think it's especially beneficial."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's opinion on inversion therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on your age largely. The older you are, the more you have to be careful about excess protein. A high protein diet can seriously suppress your thyroid function and the average normal protein is high in methionine and cysteine and too much of those greatly accelerate the aging process. So after the age of 40, you have to carefully watch the balance between the amount of protein in your diet and the nutrients, calcium, vitamin D and your thyroid function. The carbohydrate can have a very reviving therapeutic effect. Currently, I'm hearing reports from several people who just by introducing fruit juice or even Mexican Coca-Cola, suddenly they recovered from various things, depression, migraines, all signs of slowing inhibited metabolism. Sugar. Sugar, yeah. Good old sugar."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the best carbohydrate to protein ratio.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can actually, I think you can actually still get Mexican Coca-Cola. I think there's a place in Dripping Springs and you can actually get it where it has sugar rather than high fructose cornstarch in it. Yeah, it's becoming so popular that supermarkets are selling it out quickly and so they're going, I think it might convince the U.S. Coca-Cola Company to return to producing some proper Coke."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the availability of Mexican Coca-Cola made with sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "If they're well ripened, they can be extremely valuable, but currently what you find in supermarkets, most of them are poorly ripened."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about other fruits besides orange juice.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think white rice is the best because the germ and the bran age and oxidize and get rancid. The Chinese learned that white rice doesn't go bad in storage, doesn't get rancid."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if certain types of rice are better than others.

**RAY PEAT:** "It doubles, at least doubles the usable protein, so if you're eating beans for protein, cooked sprouts are going to give you a more survivable amount of protein where the bean is usually cooked as a very, very poor source of protein with more toxin. But the problem with sprouts is they have to be well cooked. You don't want raw sprouts in your salad because generally, sprouts can release a lot of anti-fiberite material."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sprouting beans and grains makes them safe or beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "Topically, yeah. Mm-hmm. Do you ever use these clays internally or recommend them? Oh, never. Never? Because stomach acid will dissolve some heavy metals that they all contain. The stomach acid that we have will dissolve the heavy metals which is in the clays? Yeah. The aluminum itself is released in the solution when it hits the strong stomach acid, but they often have other heavy metals besides the aluminum."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the topical use of silica-based clay and whether it's safe for internal use.

**RAY PEAT:** "The standard thing for the nausea is an anti-serotonin drug. I think ciproheptadine is the most pleasant way to take anti-serotonin drugs because it comes with anti-histamine effects. And those, both anti-serotonin and anti-histamines, are also anti-cancer agents and there have been studies. that using Ciproheptadine against various cancers showing positive effects. So I think aspirin and ciproheptadine are generally protective against the toxic effects of chemotherapy."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for recommendations to lessen nausea from chemotherapy.

**RAY PEAT:** "All of those, yeah. All of those, wow. Histamine and serotonin both are powerful things released by cancer and stifles cancer growth. I see. And the aspirin, you're just talking, taking some aspirin every day and it's safe. It'll be safe for somebody with that. Yeah, it has a very broad spectrum of anti-cancer effects. And the nausea, where's the nausea coming from? The stomach, the body just doesn't like these harsh drugs and it's just trying to hype in hard time dealing with it?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mechanism of action for ciproheptadine and aspirin in relation to nausea and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, any kind of injury to the digestive system causes it to produce lots of serotonin. And the serotonin causes the sense of nausea among other things. And so blocking the serotonin will relieve the nausea."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the source of nausea.

**RAY PEAT:** "It involves extending the muscle against the attempt to contract and the effect is to cause microscopic tears. Your muscle is trying to go one way and the force of gravity is forcing it to go to lengthen when it's trying to shorten. So it tears some of the molecules apart and that interferes with energy production by the mitochondria. So every time you get a sore muscle from running downhill, you've done some damage to your muscle mitochondria."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what is bad about eccentric exercise.

**RAY PEAT:** "Concentric. That's concentric. And a few minutes later, And if you let it down carefully, that's eccentric. And the best is? Concentric. Concentric. So the good thing is to lift the barbell and then let it fall to the floor. Maybe that's why you see some of these weight lifters do that. I wonder if they know about that. Oh sure, I think so. So that's interesting. So if you can do the eccentric and then somehow release the pressure, that's the best."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a clarification of concentric and eccentric exercise using a barbell example.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've tried it, and it tends to be very irritating. I never succeeded in doing it for very long. But if you have a red light apparatus and put it on some part of your body where it doesn't bother your eyes, that can have a restorative effect, reducing through your bloodstream, reducing inflammation throughout your body."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if one should sleep with a light on, given that darkness can be a stressor.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, definitely possible, but I would just want to be cautious because there hasn't been research showing the safety. There's a possibility that it could stimulate cancer growth as well as production of hormones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if red light therapy on the testicles can increase testosterone levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "All of the good anti-inflammatory nutrition principles. are going to increase your protective androgens from DHVAs to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. All of those tend to rise when you do an anti-inflammatory, anti-estrogen program. And folks can Google that and look at that and anti- I mean you're talking about anti-inflammatories like Things like that different aspirin for example The right amount of progesterone and pregnenolone Even though a large amounts of progesterone antagonize testosterone by inhibiting estrogen the right amount of progesterone can actually increase your testosterone I've seen it happen in middle-aged men"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for favorite ways to increase testosterone levels after age 65.

**RAY PEAT:** "And so it leaves the Testosterone that you produce Leaves it effective. Oh, that's why you you helped develop that with the progesterone product years ago Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. And that's what that does. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mechanism by which progesterone can increase testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ingredients carefully There are several brands of sea salt that are just as pure But they're usually three or four times as expensive as the canning salt. Yeah You you you probably know dr. Hal Huggins right the mercury fellow Mm-hmm. We used to have Doc. We used to have him on Quite a bit years ago a wonderful guy and he would take all these different blood tests from people and he was a real you know magician at it and he would Thousands of them and he claimed that people that did the pickling and canning sea salt had better He called them blood chemistries had better blood chemistries and people on on sea salt That's the effect of the sodium chloride itself Tom Brewer Cited some studies A book by Shanklin and Hodin gave a lot of the details in which without changing anything else in the diet they gave women with serious eclampsia or preeclampsia symptoms gave them in one case six grams extra sodium chloride per day and in the other I think it was 20 grams extra per day and in both cases that salt alone cured their pregnancy problems has wide very general effects to avoid sodium chloride deficiency you're activating the protective oxidative metabolism suppressing aldosterone and aldosterone rises in proportion to the lack of sodium chloride and aldosterone produces inflammation, heart disease, calcification fibrosis everything bad produced by aldosterone is suppressed when you get enough sodium chloride"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why Dr. Peat likes Morton's canning and pickling salt, which lists sodium chloride as the ingredient.

**RAY PEAT:** "Very good except they contain heavy metals. Heavy metals, they all do. The discoloration is usually largely from heavy metals oh so the more white ones maybe they would be better? Yeah the pure white that's the thing about pure sea salt and Morton canning salt."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mineral content of fancier sea salts compared to canning salt.

**RAY PEAT:** "Warburg's enzyme used vitamin B2 as its cofactor and he advocated the great importance of getting enough vitamin B2 in your diet that can momentarily correct the cancer metabolism of overproducing lactic acid many other things are needed to change the whole physiology but vitamin B2 can when you're overproducing lactate the B2 can turn it off in a matter of hours so that people with redness of the eyes, redness of the nose and cheeks nose bleeds memory problems, nightmares lots of symptoms of a B2 deficiency in lactic acid excess, vasodilation and weakening of capillaries that can be corrected and according to Warburg that will be a drastic protection against developing cancer"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what nutrients can be consumed to increase oxygen in cells as a prevention of cancer, referencing Dr. Warburg's findings on low oxygen.

**RAY PEAT:** "Keeping enough fiber in the diet is one thing. Yeah, when you shift to those liquid foods, you're likely not having the same amount of bulk in your diet. And a change in your intestine will invariably increase your serotonin and histamine. Can you use these, they've got some pretty good, I think, organic even, psyllium husk, is that okay? Yep, any kind of fiber that doesn't irritate your intestine. I've seen a couple of people who got constipated from psyllium fiber, but usually it works. It works okay. And oatmeal, oat bran, it usually is sold with quite a bit of starch attached to it, but the oat bran is a very effective bulk except in the long run it can increase your estrogen. Bamboo shoots in excess they have a slight anti-sibrate effect but in moderation they're a very safe fiber. Raw carrots are one of the safest fibers and well-cooked mushrooms are another cancer preventive fiber."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for advice on overcoming headaches and strange noises in the head, possibly related to histamine intolerance, after consuming orange juice and milk or bone broth.

**RAY PEAT:** "It will over a period of several days establish a new rhythm in the intestine and that reduces estrogen, endotoxin, serotonin and histamine."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how increasing fiber intake can help with the issues mentioned.

**RAY PEAT:** "That can happen with a selenium deficiency or a calcium deficiency or vitamin D deficiency or some other imbalance of nutrients. So it's good to check what your ratio of calcium to phosphate in the diet is. Too much meat, for example, will interfere with proper thyroid function. Too much meat. Oh, so that's what you had mentioned last time you were on about even the animals getting lipomas from too much... What's the main ingredient in the meat? Phosphorus. Yeah. Phosphorus turns out to be a pretty important toxin. Not only in liver or kidney failure, but it generally is a promoter of cancer and degenerative diseases. So I guess on the animals, the calcium would be bones, why the people recommend giving bones to dogs. I guess you'd get calcium there?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about a situation where someone is taking thyroid medication, their temperature hasn't risen to optimum levels, but their resting heart rate is high.

**RAY PEAT:** "Exactly. It was in Toluca, which is very high altitude. I had known him for 40 years or so, and he didn't recognize me when I came in the room. His attention was affected along with his......breathing problem and purple face that I gave. his daughter a batch of Pregnenolone and a thyroid powder to add to his food every day. And I went somewhere for two weeks and came back later, and he was his normal self. He had his office on an upper floor at downtown Toluca, and there were only rams. And so he took me up to his office. I got winded at the high altitude going up to the third floor, and he was doing fine. He took me all around Toluca visiting various acquaintances and so on. And I was really short of oxygen, but he was absolutely breathing perfectly from official advanced emphysema to perfect lung function in two weeks."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a story about a man with COPD and lack of oxygen who recovered after taking pregnenolone and thyroid powder is accurate.

**RAY PEAT:** "That caused me to look up the old literature, and it happened right about that time. I saw a woman, 35 years old, who for 15 years had had a terrible oxygenation problem. It started when her father was giving her estrogen injections. He was a doctor and thought women needed estrogen, but her lung oxygenation dropped to about 5 percent of normal and stayed that way until she, 20 years later, took adequate thyroid. Looking at the animal research, I saw that... that they had created emphysema in various species, just with estrogen, a shot of estrogen could decrease oxygenation of the lung by 95% in about an hour after the shot. Wow! That's the same thing that had happened to this woman. And with age, both men and women accumulate more and more estrogen, unopposed by progesterone and androgens. And there had also been studies of using progesterone in emphysema, curing emphysema just with a few doses of progesterone. Fascinating! Wow! Amazing! But those individual studies just didn't catch on and get spread through the culture."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what caused the dramatic improvement in the man's lung function.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's recommended for vatas in Ayurvedic medicine. It internally has too much polyunsaturated fat for regular use, and with covering a lot of your skin, you can absorb harmful amounts of polyunsaturated fats. But on a small area, it's harmless and probably beneficial."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sesame oil is okay to use on the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since it takes itself out as it cleans your intestine, it's very unlikely to have any systemically harmful effects. Since it's a laxative, it just doesn't get very much absorbed."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the downsides of using castor oil to keep things moving in the intestines.

**RAY PEAT:** "Everything anti-inflammatory helps. Recently, people have been noticing that things that lower angiotensin, the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, the blockers in particular help to restore muscle mass in old people. Because it's inflammation developing with the accumulated hormonal changes of aging. The balance shifts towards estrogen, which activates nitric oxide and other pro-inflammatory mediators, causing inflammatory fibrosis and loss of the functional muscle protein."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to avoid sarcopenia and keep testosterone levels up after age 65.

**RAY PEAT:** "I'm sorry, one grain or 60 milligrams? That's a traditional definition, but the natural thyroids have varied greatly. But I consider these Sinoplus to be more or less two and a third to two and a half grains equivalent. So I recommend starting with no more than a fourth of a tablet for the first two or three weeks."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the grain count in Sinoplus tablets and how it compares to Nature-Throid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Traditionally, people would be started on, almost always on a half a grain. And then work your way up? Yeah, every two weeks. You can add a fourth to a half grain, and most people ended up needing two grains, so that's why the Xenoplus settled in on that dose, that's for an established corrective dose. About a 2.5 they do? Yeah, one pill a day ends up, but you shouldn't get there, try to get there the first week because it'll, for example, your tissue doesn't retain magnesium effectively when you're low thyroid, and if you take a big dose of thyroid suddenly, there's not enough magnesium for the demand, and so it can cause vasoconstriction in your heart and cause pains and so on."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the proper dosage and titration for thyroid medication.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's the relaxation rate that you look for in that Achilles reflex test. Yeah, and then also the body temp and... And pulse rate and quality of sleep. Quality of sleep. The depth of your sleep should increase very quickly when you correct the thyroid. It's the same relaxation principle in your brain as in your ankle reflex. It should relax instantly when you're not needing it. So when you start trying to go to sleep, your brain should turn off as quickly as your foot relaxes. And if your foot doesn't relax, then you just keep taking it until the body figures it out? I mean, how much you need?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the metrics used to determine the right amount of thyroid medication.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it was 10 micrograms I gave this person who had a very, very slow relaxation. And an hour later when we tried it, it was a normal, quick, floppy relaxation. I'll be, I'll be. And you can get quick results against insomnia the same way. Just by trying with a little T3 before bed?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effectiveness of T3 for insomnia and the speed of its action.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've seen just two or three people who cured their hypothyroidism by supplementing for just a few days. It broke them out of a stress that was inhibiting their thyroid. But usually if a person is overweight, the thyroid will help you get rid of the estrogen-producing fat and polyunsaturated fats in storage. And once you've got those eliminated, which typically takes from two to five years, then your thyroid can function normally with a good diet."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if thyroid supplementation can lead to long-term improvement or if it needs to be taken indefinitely.

**RAY PEAT:** "I heard that story from someone working at the Pepsi-Cola company in Mexico that they were using invert sugar, but not to claim that they were using the corn syrup. I hadn't heard that claim before."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Mexican Coca-Cola contains high fructose corn syrup, similar to American Coke.

**RAY PEAT:** "That was just tests demonstrating that any irritation will release histamine and serotonin and other inflammatory mediators and will be carcinogenic. I see. That was involving injecting distilled water."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why Dr. Peat believes distilled water could be cancer-causing.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's safe if your vitamin K level is adequate. I would start supplementing some vitamin K and make sure your clotting system is good."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's safe to take aspirin for pain and discomfort after a C-section while breastfeeding.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, drinking orange juice and milk. Orange juice and milk? Yeah, I've seen non-producers get their normal milk production up if they drank a quart of orange juice for a day or two."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for recommendations to increase milk production for breastfeeding mothers.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's an old practice. Partly the idea was that it contains estrogen. Could be something."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the old practice of drinking beer to increase milk production.

**RAY PEAT:** "It could be a salt or calcium deficiency or a low thyroid. Either one or all three? Or low protein. Or all protein."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what their body might be telling them if they experience swollen feet (edema).

**RAY PEAT:** "By the time you're 45 or 50, there are so many accumulated problems that it's fairly... What's the difference, right? Take a little pig thyroid. Yeah, it's fairly rare that a person doesn't benefit from a little thyroid after the age of 50. There's no real downsides, is there? No."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's possible to help the thyroid function on its own or if lifelong supplementation is necessary.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the World Economic Forum is, I think, intent on disrupting the economy at the point of creating food shortages so that they can institute their changes. If you Google Klaus Schwab, World Economic... Oh, yeah, we know him. Yeah, you'll find some really horrible plans they're putting out and instituting, putting into practice. They're not secret about it either, are they? It doesn't seem like they just put it out there."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat sees any potential food shortages.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh all of the above? They're proposing putting lots of horrible things in. Yeah. Tracking devices. I've heard that. Wow man. So we just got to figure out how not to take this guy right? Even if somebody tells us to."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat has heard anything disturbing about the potential COVID-19 vaccine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah and they're telling people to take a flu shot even if they can't get the corona. But several studies show that people who took a flu shot last season were several times more likely to develop a coronavirus infection this season. Yes. Showing that they destroy the immune system even though they produce antibodies against influenza. They weaken the innate immunity."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential effects of flu shots in relation to coronavirus infections.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah several lawyers people you've had on the program are working through the courts so I think there's hope that way. Yeah. I don't know if they really get hardcore Dr. P with this vaccine thing. It may be a Supreme Court one huh? Could be. Yeah and I hope the composition of the Supreme Court recognizes some kind of constitutional."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses legal challenges to government mandates and the potential for Supreme Court involvement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah there's a competition between authoritarianism and constitutionalism. Yes. Oh that's the other word yeah authoritarianism. Well Dr. P you take care of yourself we'll see you in a in a month or so I guess before Christmas. Okay. You have fun thanks for everything we really appreciate you being here sir it's an honor. Okay thanks."

**CONTEXT:** The host and Dr. Peat discuss the competition between authoritarianism and constitutionalism.
