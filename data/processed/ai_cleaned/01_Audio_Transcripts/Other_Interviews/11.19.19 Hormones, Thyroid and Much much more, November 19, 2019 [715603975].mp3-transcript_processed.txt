**RAY PEAT:** I'm working on a newsletter on progesterone for this month, something I've been working on for 50 years, but always something new to think about.
**CONTEXT:** What could possibly be going on with progesterone that would warrant that kind of attention in so long?

**RAY PEAT:** Apparently that the industry is reverting to some of the old myths about it. The estrogen... people discover the dangers of estrogen and that moves interest towards progesterone use. And then the estrogen industry has to defend itself because it's a multi-billion dollar a year industry and so they subsidize studies to make people worry about the risks of progesterone. They're starting to say that anything that estrogen is known to cause for a hundred years, they're starting to say, well, really progesterone is involved in it, so it's distracting attention from the dangers of estrogen. And in the absence of any real information, they're just putting the thought out there that if estrogen does it, maybe progesterone is really involved somehow.
**CONTEXT:** Talk about that.

**RAY PEAT:** The industry got started when someone synthesized a very simple chemical that triggered the whole fertility cycle in mice and rats. In the 30s, someone was thinking about the fact that chimney sweeps got cancer of the scrotum in the 18th century from getting soot and not bathing. And that led to someone putting soot on rabbits and finding that it was very carcinogenic, but they noticed that besides causing skin cancer, it triggered the estrus in the female rabbits. And so they did extracts of soot and found that there were hundreds of estrogenic substances in soot.
**CONTEXT:** In the soot? Which came from the wood, I guess?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you put a piece of cold metal or porcelain or something in the flame of a candle or a Bunsen burner or anything, and carbon spontaneously condenses at high temperature. Methane is a single atom of carbon with hydrogen, and when it burns, like if you have a cloud of natural gas and it explodes, it creates a cloud of soot, which results when the single atom of carbon surrounded by hydrogen condenses spontaneously into very symmetrical six-membered rings and then ten members on each ring being a hexagon of carbon atoms. Some of the cyclic molecules are huge, and they, being very large, heavy, stick to each other and form these gobs of black material. Each molecule has this pattern, six-membered rings. Which happens to be analogous to the steroid molecule. The steroid molecule has three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring. And when those don't have the proper oxygen atoms added in the right places, they act as estrogen. So you can get a million different estrogenic substances just from soot.
**CONTEXT:** Wow, that's fascinating.

**RAY PEAT:** So the estrogen industry realized that everyone could have a patented unique molecule and sell it as estrogen, which they called the female hormone, because it can be found in the ovary of a pregnant animal. So they advertised that they were selling the female hormone, which they said would make women more fertile, because if it's a female hormone, being fertile is what supposedly characterizes women, and so they convinced even Harvard doctors, two of them. did studies giving this basically a soot derivative, diethylstilbestrol, to pregnant women claiming that it prevented miscarriage, but the animal studies in the 1930s and early 40s had all demonstrated every kind of estrogen creates miscarriage or stillbirth. My thesis advisor was one of the early researchers showing that as you increase the dose of estrogen, you can create an abortion or miscarriage at... any stage of pregnancy, a very tiny dose will prevent implantation. A larger dose will cause miscarriage at the first week, a bigger dose at the second week, and so on. So they knew that estrogen caused miscarriages, but they were selling it to the public to prevent miscarriage.
**CONTEXT:** Wow, just the opposite. Because they could. So, wow.

**RAY PEAT:** Lots of doctors still refer to progesterone as the pregnancy hormone. Just a couple weeks ago, someone said her doctor said she had had her uterus removed, so she didn't need... progesterone, because progesterone is only the pregnancy hormone, an absolutely ridiculous idea.
**CONTEXT:** What is the, what's the biggest piece of misinformation to our... to our lady, well both ladies and gentlemen, listening around the world about estrogen and progesterone, what is, what is out there that most people believe that you believe is untrue?

**RAY PEAT:** Going back to the 1940s, doctors were taught that to sell estrogen. To get pregnant. Yeah, and they knew that estrogen causes cancer of the uterus. That was one of the early demonstrations of soot that has estrogens of all sorts. The first most sensitive organ is the uterus, then the breast, then the brain, then the lungs, then every other tissue, but it's just a matter of sensitivity and the uterus is most sensitive. And... Then someone discovered, actually about 1945, it was already discovered that progesterone prevented uterine cancer from estrogen, and so they said if you take estrogen and don't want uterine cancer then you should take progesterone with it, but then... The profitable thing was to do a hysterectomy, and so hysterectomies were being done. Everyone by the age of 30 or 35 was being urged to have a hysterectomy, and without the uterus, they said there's no need for progesterone, so... the woman would have her ovaries and uterus removed, and they would refuse to give her progesterone, because supposedly the uterus was the only organ that needed progesterone, being a pregnancy hormone.
**CONTEXT:** So, what is the, what's the biggest piece of misinformation to our... to our lady, well both ladies and gentlemen, listening around the world about estrogen and progesterone, what is, what is out there that most people believe that you believe is untrue?

**RAY PEAT:** But in the 1930s, the ovaries were found to produce hundreds of times more progesterone. More quantity of progesterone than estrogen. Estrogen is really a minor hormone from the ovary. In experimental surgery, people have demonstrated that when they measured the amount of estrogen coming out of the ovary, as a control, they measured the blood coming out of the monkey's arm and found that the arm was producing as much estrogen as the ovary. So the idea of estrogen as an ovarian hormone is really out of context when every tissue of the animal... produces a large amount of estrogen when it's under stress.
**CONTEXT:** So laying it out as you have been, you can see how there's so much confusion in the medical world and the natural world about these hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** They're very likely to be told still, 60, 70 years after it was proven false, told that estrogen is a lifelong female hormone, but old men rival women of the same age in the amount of estrogen being produced because it's a stress hormone produced by tissue of any sort under stress. So, question the claim that aging is evidence of a need for more estrogen. Old tissue increasingly tends to make estrogen, but the opposite is true. Progesterone failure is the primary thing that brings on menopause. The monthly surge of progesterone produces the monthly cycle, is an outstanding feature of the monthly cycle. When that stops, what is left is a surge of estrogen which is no longer balanced by progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** Well, they're very likely to be told still, 60, 70 years after it was proven false, told that estrogen is a lifelong female hormone, but old men rival women of the same age in the amount of estrogen being produced because it's a stress hormone produced by tissue of any sort under stress. So, question the claim that aging is evidence of a need for more estrogen. Old tissue increasingly tends to make estrogen, but the opposite is true. Progesterone failure is the primary thing that brings on menopause. The monthly surge of progesterone produces the monthly cycle, is an outstanding feature of the monthly cycle. When that stops, what is left is a surge of estrogen which is no longer balanced by progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** The stress symptoms increase as menopause approaches. And the healthier the woman is, the longer she's able to maintain these monthly surges of progesterone. And... With supplementation, it's possible to keep menstruating to a much older age.
**CONTEXT:** But that's the natural... It works for ladies, though, right? I mean, that's the way it's been set up to do a God thing, kind of? When the monthly cycle ends, like menopause?

**RAY PEAT:** Stress, even in the 20s or younger, I've known women having hot flashes that were resolved when they took thyroid or a progesterone to normalize, prevent the stress. Oh, with the thyroid functioning more appropriately, they're able to deal with the stress more easily. Yeah, and one of the immediate chemical changes that produces the hot flash in the skin is a surge of nitric oxide of acetylation. How it dilates the blood vessels. Yeah, and unopposed estrogen is a powerful activator of nitric oxide, and so I'm convinced that unopposed estrogen is the cause of the hot flashes. And doctors looking only at a blood test of estrogen will say no, at menopause a woman's estrogen in the serum is very low. But this has been very confidently studied. If you take a bit of tissue and compare it to the serum. The tissue has 10 or 20 times more estrogen than the serum. And what makes the difference, what can raise the estrogen in the serum is progesterone. So if you're deficient in progesterone, your tissue is likely to have 10 or 20 times more estrogen than shows up in the blood. When you have a normal cycle with progesterone, the progesterone does 8 or 10 different chemical actions causing the tissue content of the estrogen to decrease. And as it decreases in the cell, it enters the bloodstream on its way to the kidneys and liver to be excreted. But in the absence of progesterone, those changes that release estrogen to be excreted don't happen. And so the estrogen stays inside the cell at a concentration. Much higher than in the blood.
**CONTEXT:** And the hot flashes and all that, people have said that that's due to possible toxicity in the lady's body? Can you relate to that?

**RAY PEAT:** For pregnancy to be safe for both the mother and the baby. The placenta must produce a huge amount of progesterone every day, hundreds of milligrams per day, rising all the way through pregnancy to a peak approaching a gram a day. But when the woman or animal is under stress, the placenta must produce a huge amount of progesterone every day, hundreds of milligrams per day, rising all the way through pregnancy stress. The stress changes the pituitary and all the other glands. To avoid pregnancy, a stressed animal of any sort would be less likely to survive if it got pregnant. So the trick is that pregnancy is prevented by stress. for the safety of the mother so it's a natural kind of evolutionary thing yeah that's why yeah yeah and it works the same way with the bears or deers or girls yeah stress specifically uh turns off a progesterone for the avoidance of pregnancy yeah
**CONTEXT:** So why does that get low? Is it just living on planet earth with stress and diet and everything? Why the progesterone levels go too low?

**RAY PEAT:** My first experiences experimenting with progesterone was that it would stop my whiskers growing for a couple of days. Because a good dose of it blocks, that's one of its functions is to block hormones that could interfere with pregnancy. So it puts, progesterone puts everything down the middle when it's high in pregnancy. You don't want any stray hormones disturbing the pregnancy. So that's one of the functions of progesterone is to aim at survival rather than whiskers or production of large amounts of collagen or bone material or anything. So it keeps things right down the middle.
**CONTEXT:** So many feel like a little bit of progesterone cream, just a dab or so, helps to keep testosterone levels better for guys. What's going on there? And is that a reliable thing to look at for guys, isn't it? I've heard that from several men over the years.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it just blocks the stress, and if you get it at the right level, you don't have enough to block the testosterone, just enough to block the stress and leave your own testosterone.
**CONTEXT:** Oh, so it's not necessarily a testosterone builder or a more anabolic thing, the progesterone cream.

**RAY PEAT:** No, most of the men that I've known who used it, it did shrink the penis. Stop whisker growth. It shrinks the penis? Temporarily. Why? Because testosterone is maintaining the circulation. And it's the nitric oxide signal causes acid dilation. That really isn't the mechanism of erection. It's testosterone which gives muscle tone to the veins which......empty the penis, and the nitric oxide opens the vessels into the penis, so they're doing the same thing in different ways, but the right amount of testosterone maintains a certain tone in the exit vessels, allowing a considerable amount of blood to stay there, even in the... the passive state.
**CONTEXT:** So I'm kind of confused, so this little dab of progesterone that many guys do to keep their testosterone levels up, is that... does it work? I mean, is that good? I mean, I'm kind of confused, sorry.

**RAY PEAT:** At just exactly the right amount, it can leave the luteinizing hormone active and let the testicle... continue producing okay an adequate amount of testosterone.
**CONTEXT:** How would you know what just the right amount is?

**RAY PEAT:** I think only by trial and error because I've known men who had antitestosterone symptoms with 10 milligrams, others who felt an increase of testosterone with the same small dose.
**CONTEXT:** So you'd have to be...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think most of the progesterone, the one I saw from Dr. Wong, they talk about a little, and it's from Yams, I think, just a little tiny bit, just a dab or so of this cream.
**CONTEXT:** Wow, that gets a little tricky. You've got to be careful with that. You mess around with that, right?

**RAY PEAT:** The parathyroid gland is constantly regulating, responding to conditions, and if you eat an excess of calcium and a moderate or low amount of phosphate, the... a parathyroid gland becomes very passive, especially if you have adequate vitamin D. And the parathyroid gland, its main function seems to be to take calcium out of the bone and bring it into the blood, but a side effect of taking it out of the bone is that it activates take up by the soft tissue. Thank you for watching. And keeping the parathyroid gland as inhibited as possible leaves your bones unaltered. The calcium can still go in, but the parathyroid isn't going to be bringing it out of the bones into the bloodstream where it can affect the blood vessels. And when you eat an excess of calcium... and have an adequate vitamin D level in your body, the calcium passes right through your kidneys into the urine. But if your parathyroid is active, it can form stones on the way out, preventing the blood ability to keep it in solution. Changes and it's that same change that causes it to go into the blood vessel while carbon dioxide is the factor that keeps the calcium in solution in the bloodstream and stable in the bones calcium carbonate is the first molecule deposited in the bone and it's gradually changed to calcium phosphate but carbon dioxide is responsible for putting it into the bone when the parathyroid hormone is active it forms lactic acid in the bone and it's lactic acid that dissolves removes the Calcium from the bone. So the balance of carbon dioxide versus Lactic acid is under the control of parathyroid hormone in the bone and that same process happening in the blood vessels the carbon dioxide keeps the calcium dissolved ionized in solution, but the lactic acid, if it is allowed to form either in the blood or blood vessels, that counteracts the carbon dioxide, precipitates calcium, and forms hardening of the arteries and kidney stones and so on, so keeping the parathyroid hormone low and your carbon dioxide. Production high relative to lactic acid is what's going to keep bones strong and arteries soft.
**CONTEXT:** A concern expressed by other nutritionists is that calcium may not go to the bones, but into the soft tissue and other places causing systemic damage over time. If one does take your suggestion, what are the prerequisite actions or physiological cell metabolism assumptions you are making for taking 2,000 milligrams? And what kind of calcium?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone and thyroid are the things that most support the production of carbon dioxide and suppress the formation of lactic acid. Suppress it. Yeah, this ties right in.
**CONTEXT:** Prolactin and cortisol and parathyroid hormone all tend to interfere with carbon dioxide production.

**RAY PEAT:** No, there are two main kinds of stroke. One in which a clap forms......and plugs up the small arteries and the other where a blood vessel breaks and leaks blood. It could form a giant clot outside of the blood vessel. So it's a bleeding stroke or a clotted stroke. There's two different kinds. Let's first talk about... And then there's another relatively harmless thing which is a transient ischemic. That's where the arteries or capillaries close down because carbon dioxide isn't being produced.
**CONTEXT:** So is that what a stroke is? Is a stroke where the veins will just actually...

**RAY PEAT:** You lose carbon dioxide when you breathe too hard. Too hard. And a low-thyroid person is producing very little CO2, and so it takes very little over-breathing for a hypothyroid person to experience that constriction of blood vessels from loss of CO2.
**CONTEXT:** You over-breathe, that releases carbon dioxide. Breathing fast?

**RAY PEAT:** In the United States, at least, that's by far the most common type of stroke other than the transient ischemic. Yeah, the... It isn't quite a deficiency of aspirin, but it's related to that. Serotonin excess, serotonin increases when you're under stress, especially if you're hypothyroid. Okay. Hyperventilation raises the pH of your blood by blowing out the CO2, carbonic acid. Carbonic acid should be keeping the pH of your blood towards the lower end of the range. And as the pH of the blood rises from hyperventilation, your platelets lose the ability to bind serotonin. And so serotonin rises in the blood when you hyperventilate, but serotonin in the brain stimulates respiration and makes you breathe harder. And the doctrine for about 30 years has been claiming that serotonin produced in your intestine and carried in your bloodstream. It can't get into the brain to affect the respiration, but in fact, very clear experiments have shown that the blood-brain barrier, as far as serotonin is concerned, really doesn't exist because serotonin breaks down the barrier, so when it's high in the blood, it gets into your brain, makes you breathe harder, and if you're low in carbon dioxide to start with, it increases the release of serotonin into your bloodstream in a vicious circle.
**CONTEXT:** And why do these little clots form? Do we know?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that's how an emotional stress, something that just makes you breathe faster, if you're hypothyroid, it will start the cycle in which the pH rises, the serotonin is released from platelets. It activates your brain to breathe harder, exacerbating the problem.
**CONTEXT:** So can you conjecture then that just angst and tension and planet earth and worry could be a really chief cause for these strokes that people have?

**RAY PEAT:** On the background of a low thyroid function. On the background of a low thyroid. If your thyroid is happy and you have a TSH, I mean, way down, zero, one or two or something. And your body temperature is up, the body's not affected by stress as badly? Yeah, because your progesterone and DHEA and pregnenolone are being produced generously by the well-circulated blood supply carrying sugar to all these tissues. So hypoglycemia is something that works with low carbon dioxide. They both tend to increase lactic acid which wastes sugar and makes the problem worse.
**CONTEXT:** So that insulin resistance thing we talked about, Dr. P, you're saying that it's not the whole story. They got it wrong somewhere.

**RAY PEAT:** Stress increases the liberation of free fatty acids from your tissues, so apart from... the amount of fat you're eating, it's the liberation of free fatty acids which get into the cell and shift, block the ability of the cell to oxidize glucose, and when glucose isn't being oxidized, it's likely to be turned into lactic acid, and the lactic acid shifts the pH and starts the whole process.
**CONTEXT:** Stress increases the liberation of free fatty acids from your tissues, so apart from... the amount of fat you're eating, it's the liberation of free fatty acids which get into the cell and shift, block the ability of the cell to oxidize glucose, and when glucose isn't being oxidized, it's likely to be turned into lactic acid, and the lactic acid shifts the pH and starts the whole process.

**RAY PEAT:** A good diet is the first thing. B vitamins are extremely important for getting things running. Selenium is essential for being able to use the thyroid molecules to... put it into the right active T3 form and Carbohydrate is very important But but then you want to periodically check Have a blood test to See if your your vitamin D and and thyroid Hormone is in the right range.
**CONTEXT:** Can you please ask Dr. Pete some of the best ways to improve the health of my liver?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't think it relates very closely to sugar because It will be influenced by breakdown of free fatty acids the polyunsaturated fat breakdown in the fragments that look like sugar fragments but the fats are much more oxidizable and toxic the Pufers are, it's easier to oxidize those guys yeah and so doing Pufers actually raise your A1c yeah, as they break down but doing organic beet sugar or honey or maple syrup That doesn't raise your A1c or if it does do you care? Um, yeah, the numbers have been exaggerated so that the lower than, I think, seven, they found that the sickest people weren't at the highest level. So the numbers were cooked a bit too. It's a lot more complicated than just sugar causing that to rise.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. P talks about taking Some good forms of sugar. Does he believe that the a1c blood test which I think and I'm just adding this point Isn't that over 90 days or something? Is there is a reliable? Metric to see if I'm taking too much sugar

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think ferritin is meaningful enough to worry about. Don't even worry about it? Watching your hemoglobin level, at the low end of the normal range of hemoglobin, I think is the safest place to be.
**CONTEXT:** What, in your opinion, is the optimal serum ferritin blood level for someone aged 70?

**RAY PEAT:** The low end of the normal range for hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the essential thing for delivering oxygen, and ferritin can go up and down according to inflammation. And keeping it in a moderate range usually means that you're not very sick, because sickness and inflammation will destroy it greatly.
**CONTEXT:** Hemoglobin is the essential thing for delivering oxygen, and ferritin can go up and down according to inflammation. And keeping it in a moderate range usually means that you're not very sick, because sickness and inflammation will destroy it greatly.

**RAY PEAT:** That was the traditional idea that it would prevent the accumulation on the standard Western diet. Men constantly during their lifetime tend to accumulate iron. Women after menopause start accumulating it at the same rate. Because they aren't losing it, and so blood donors were seen to maintain an adequate level without so much accumulation with aging. In the last several years, people are seeing that there are other things. One label for them was stressens, units created by stress. There are several different names for substances released into the bloodstream during stress and aging, and getting rid of those has a slightly rejuvenating effect.
**CONTEXT:** So what is this idea of giving blood every so often to get rid of excess? Is it iron that people do this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think milk is such an easy nutrient to get almost all of your nutrients that drinking two or three quarts a day is good for most people, but you don't want to drink that much whole milk if you aren't doing very hard labor to burn calories. So one percent is an average amount of. fat for a person of average activity.
**CONTEXT:** If I'm trying to lose fat, should we be drinking lower fat milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, milk contains small amounts of progesterone and thyroid. Ah, good. In the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, lots of people, lots of babies were born without thyroid glands. But those who were breast-fed, as long as they were being breast-fed, the doctors didn't notice. That they had no thyroid gland function. As soon as they were weaned, the absence of a thyroid showed up, showing that the breast milk was keeping an adequate amount of thyroid to keep them growing. But cow's milk isn't as rich in thyroid and progesterone. But you get a little bit though, you get a little bit. Yeah, that small amount adds to the effect of the calcium to stimulate your metabolic rate slightly.

**RAY PEAT:** Food can be organic and still not be ideal. Sure, of course. Stinky weeds in the pasture. That's right. They can feed them. But grass-fed milk has more vitamin E. according to the research. But not necessarily we don't know more hormones or progesterone or anything like that. We don't know that. We haven't seen anything there. I don't think anyone has tested that.
**CONTEXT:** Do we know, are there any... research or to show if there's a big difference between grass-fed milk and regular old milk, even if it's organic. Who knows what they're feeding them, organic feed. Do we know?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's partly the shift of the nervous system. You let down your adrenaline a little bit when it's warmer, because adrenaline's function is to keep the blood up in your vital organs. And when it's warmer, you can reduce the adrenaline. And. That relaxes blood vessels and lets any leakiness show up, but I think it means that you're maybe not producing enough albumin in your liver or having some other effect of an unbalanced estrogen level. Estrogen makes blood vessels leaky. And reduces the formation of albumin in the liver. And albumin working with sodium is what keeps the blood, keeps the fluid in the bloodstream rather than leaking out into your feet.
**CONTEXT:** A little sweet, a bit swelling, but it seems to, when it's warmer. I was. I've heard that from quite a few people, but I don't really understand how it works.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, adrenaline keeps things working, but it changes the way they work.
**CONTEXT:** So the cold feet then it's tied with the thyroid low, but then it's the adrenaline combination that's not getting the blood there to the extremities. Is that right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the 30s, they already knew that estrogen prevented implantation or caused miscarriages. They didn't want to sell a miscarriage pill, and all through the 1940s and 50s, the drug companies realized that it would be a very profitable product. They didn't want to sell a birth control pill, but they didn't have the ideology that they knew it killed the embryo, and they didn't want to have the drug company identified as baby killers, but in the 50s, someone thought up the idea that it isn't acting on the uterus, it's acting only on your brain and pituitary, and it's going to stop ovulation. If you stop ovulation, you won't be accused of causing abortions. But that was fake news.
**CONTEXT:** So speaking of estrogen, it just came to me. Are these what birth control pills are? I don't know if they're very as popular as they used to be, but are these estrogen? Manipulators for the ladies, and are they dangerous?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so, yeah. There was no evidence. How can you see when a woman ovulates an ovum in an animal? You can dissect them and watch the process and catch the actual ovum. In humans, it was simply declared rather than observed.
**CONTEXT:** I think so, yeah. There was no evidence. How can you see when a woman ovulates an ovum in an animal? You can dissect them and watch the process and catch the actual ovum. In humans, it was simply declared rather than observed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the first wave of them was causing sometimes fatal hemorrhages, often disabling strokes by causing clotting in the brain. And... So they reduced the amount of estrogen by about a factor of ten from the first wave of contraceptives and made them more saleable because so many women were having strokes or hemorrhages. But still the... the medical literature is heavily biased against recognizing any damage done by them. But still the literature is out there showing that depression, various mood changes, movement disorders, restlessness, lots of problems are still associated with them.
**CONTEXT:** In general, do you know this? I know you may not know this, but are these birth control pills still very popular in our culture? People use them a lot?

**RAY PEAT:** The progesterone is mostly in the crystalline though micronized form and a lot of that, as your bile emulsifies the peanut oil, very little of the progesterone goes in the solution because peanut oil isn't a great solvent, like the girl I mentioned that had no effect from the vegetable oil dissolved progesterone because it had crystallized out in a period of two weeks. Some of it, as it contacts the micronized crystals, contacting your intestine surface will be taken up, molecules released from the crystals will go directly from your intestine to the liver and will then be attached to a sugar-like molecule, glucuronic acid. lude which then circulates through the body but quickly leaves the urine. That causes the progesterone to have a very different effect from the natural form that circulates in the fats and so when it's dissolved in vitamin E, vitamin E as it's emulsified by the bile, breaks up and enters. The form of chylomitrons, which enter the body in a very different pathway, going through the wall of the intestine into the lymphatic vessels, which then the chylomitrons dump into your general circulation, bypassing the liver. And the chylomitrons we normally process. Our fats through this system, and this lets the progesterone distribute through the whole system, getting equilibrated under red blood cells, under the cholesterol-carrying proteins and other cells, so that it can pass endlessly through the liver in these forms, the red blood cells. It can keep it in circulation for more than a day after one dose. It goes into the red blood cells from the chylomitrons, for example, to be at a higher concentration inside the cells and in the serum, where the micronized progesterone, as far as it hits the intestine wall, it is going straight to the liver to be glucuronidated.
**CONTEXT:** Oral micronized progesterone is it equal to Progest E and its effect?

**RAY PEAT:** It's seeing the pattern. The way a cat learns, for example, they can keep a cat in a cage for a long time, but once it sees how the lock works, if it's some sort of a latch, once it sees the way... out of the cage, it never forgets. But if you teach it something by rote, it'll forget it the next day. So you get it at a deep level of who you are because of your passion, and it's like it's there for you. It's not like you have to remember a phone number or something. Yeah, it's seeing how things work.
**CONTEXT:** How do you remember all this stuff?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't really think so. I think it's a... okay to eat whenever you feel like it. The experiments on mice claim that it's good to go a long time to fast for a while, but a lot of things are involved. Mice are nocturnal animals. They normally eat at night and just changing their their schedule creates such stresses that it's hard to extrapolate from. from rodents to people, especially things like eating.
**CONTEXT:** I've been having trouble finding good thyroid supplement. Is there anything else to help me with my hypothyroidism? I'm avoiding polyunsaturated fats. Oh, poofers. Thank you. Don't eat an excess of uncooked cabbage or kale or other vegetables of that family. When they're raw, especially, they can be very anti-thyroid. Anti-thyroid. Yeah. Somebody is asking about red light, putting a red light on your thyroid. What does Dr. Pete think about that to raise thyroid levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, it... does have an action, but what it's doing mostly is opening blood vessels, and that in itself can increase the production of thyroid, but it affects the respiration of cells, can increase efficiency locally.
**CONTEXT:** Do you think there's a...

**RAY PEAT:** I think it is able to catalyze oxidative metabolism. Oh, it's an oxidative, it's an antioxidant. Yeah. From the shape of the molecule, it looks like it would be a pro. Oxidative pro pro thyroid factor, but I've also been breathing. I've been breathing the you know, the hydrogen and the water too So that could be helping Very interesting. Yeah, so that might be something fun for you all to play with I don't know. I can't give medical advice but put some black coincide on your thyroid and Put a little heating blanket on or something or a red light, you know, it couldn't hurt though.
**CONTEXT:** You think there, so I'm kind of thinking maybe there is some toxicity going on and that helped to get that out. I don't know why the black cumin seed oil being heated up would do that.

**RAY PEAT:** Getting a perfect, well-balanced diet is the first thing, adequate calcium, a fairly high ratio of calcium to phosphate in your diet, not too much meat or beans or nuts because of the high phosphate content in those relative to calcium, and there are two main... classes of food that provide a very high calcium-magnesium content and low phosphate. Milk and cheese are one, and cooked greens is the other category. And vitamin D should be in the middle of the range, 50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter. Beyond that, you want to make sure that your thyroid is good and the pH of the blood and the CO2 level are indicators of that, but I don't think blood tests are the most reliable way to measure your CO2. A breath analyzer is really good. And... Actually using carbon dioxide supplements, absorbing it through your skin, or taking little bits of baking soda in water, that will actually suppress the lactic acid production if you do it in a graded amount, like half a teaspoon in a half a glass of water a few times a day will... slightly increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood, which will increase the CO2 inside cells, adjusting the pH and suppressing the lactic acid production and shifting the cell to be able to oxidize the sugar.
**CONTEXT:** Here's a 58 or 68 year old man on Natrothoid with healthy weight and have tried many diets, no processed foods and exercise, but still cannot cure type 2 diabetes, don't want insulin or metformin. What would your experience suggest I try next? This is from Jim in Eugene, Oregon.

**RAY PEAT:** Diabetics, they talk about... the sugar not being able to get into the cell. But that isn't true. It goes into the cell and it's turned to lactic acid is the problem.

**RAY PEAT:** You get... iron deficient if you try to live on it, because the pregnant woman's high estrogen causes her to absorb a very large amount of calcium and iron. And so the baby comes out very highly charged with iron. And to overcome that load of iron, it has to have a diet. essentially free of iron for up to a year, so that it grows into the large amount of iron that it has stored in its liver and bones.
**CONTEXT:** I've never really thought about drinking milk. And I was just wondering, I'm kind of an extreme girl, could you really just live on good milk? I mean, could you live? Could you?

**RAY PEAT:** Eggs are a very good source.
**CONTEXT:** How would you supplement the iron if you wanted to do milk for a long time?

**RAY PEAT:** When tissues get below, I think it's about 90 degrees, your hands and feet easily can get down to that temperature. The cells start producing, the white blood cells passing through those cold areas will start producing inflammatory signals which they carry up to the rest of your body and so cold feet really can affect your brain.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Pete mentioned on the last show wearing a sleeping hat. Does it matter what it's made out of? Not at all as long as it's comfortable and warm. And so what's going on at night? I like to wear these little socks, you know, and put some oil on the winter, you know, like sesame seed oil, and then put these little socks on. That's kind of fun.

**RAY PEAT:** A very common cause is toxic bacterial growth in the intestine causing a surge of serotonin leading to a balance. A balance that shifts water into your vestibular apparatus that governs your balance. That's probably 90% of the cases of vertigo. But there are other types that involve a serotonin, dopamine, and histamine imbalance farther down in your brain, not just in the......balance apparatus itself, but in the brain stem, the reticular apparatus that feeds the information to your balance system, maybe one or two percent of the vertigo people are having a chemical imbalance farther down. But the first thing to concentrate on is cleaning up your intestines.
**CONTEXT:** What he would do to combat it.

**RAY PEAT:** I think we are determined to have free will. It's part of our, our nature, part of the nature of every living thing. And like the, I mentioned the formation of soot molecules, extremely complex, organized, symmetrical molecules formed spontaneously when methane explodes. You, you get some carbon dioxide, oxygen consumes the hydrogens, but the carbon atoms... have an intrinsic order, ordering principle. They spontaneously organize into these very, very big complex molecules. And I think that spontaneous tendency to improve things create order out of chaos. I think that's... where determinism affects free will. So that the situation, the carbon atoms didn't have a written plan for what they were going to do, but it was in their nature, given the opportunity to create high orders of organization. I think our inherent free will is intending to create high-level order. As we press forward, moving into our life, our free will is what's creating order and more peace and love. In other words, I think we're biased against the creation of chaos. And inclined towards the creation of order.
**CONTEXT:** You would you ask Dr. Pete to talk about free will and determinism?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, without uh being uh any tests of it i would refrain from using it to cook anything acidic because ceramics unless they're specially designed to to resist acid and corrosion uh you wouldn't want to um cook a tomato sauce on it for example it in case it might release titanium into your uh food so generally though we've heard that the pure ceramic like lacruze that expensive stuff is is is good cookware is is that your opinion as well pure ceramic or not did i just hear you say not with spaghetti sauce ceramics remember uh lead lead-based ceramics were a major problem and uh the ceramics aren't aren't necessarily acid resistant it takes some some special chemistry to the more it's like a simple silicon glass surface the safer it is so glass is really that you can i don't know if they even make it anymore i think it's a vision cookware it's you can find them online i got a whole set on ebay but i think that's probably some of the best right class oh oh sure that's what i've been using for years yeah yeah like i say folks uh they don't sell it anymore it's called vision cookware but you can go on ebay and buy a whole set for pretty inexpensive i don't know people just stocked them up when they knew they were going out of out of style or something

**CONTEXT:** So that the situation, the carbon atoms didn't have a written plan for what they were going to do, but it was in their nature, given the opportunity to create high orders of organization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think we are determined to have free will. It's part of our, our nature, part of the nature of every living thing. And like the, I mentioned the formation of soot molecules, extremely complex, organized, symmetrical molecules formed spontaneously when methane explodes. You, you get some carbon dioxide, oxygen consumes the hydrogens, but the carbon atoms... have an intrinsic order, ordering principle. They spontaneously organize into these very, very big complex molecules. And I think that spontaneous tendency to improve things create order out of chaos. I think that's... where determinism affects free will. So that the situation, the carbon atoms didn't have a written plan for what they were going to do, but it was in their nature, given the opportunity to create high orders of organization. I think our inherent free will is intending to create high-level order. As we press forward, moving into our life, our free will is what's creating order and more peace and love. In other words, I think we're biased against the creation of chaos. And inclined towards the creation of order.

**RAY PEAT:** Um, without uh being uh any tests of it i would refrain from using it to cook anything acidic because ceramics unless they're specially designed to to resist acid and corrosion uh you wouldn't want to um cook a tomato sauce on it for example it in case it might release titanium into your uh food so generally though we've heard that the pure ceramic like lacruze that expensive stuff is is is good cookware is is that your opinion as well pure ceramic or not did i just hear you say not with spaghetti sauce ceramics remember uh lead lead-based ceramics were a major problem and uh the ceramics aren't aren't necessarily acid resistant it takes some some special chemistry to the more it's like a simple silicon glass surface the safer it is so glass is really that you can i don't know if they even make it anymore i think it's a vision cookware it's you can find them online i got a whole set on ebay but i think that's probably some of the best right class oh oh sure that's what i've been using for years yeah yeah like i say folks uh they don't sell it anymore it's called vision cookware but you can go on ebay and buy a whole set for pretty inexpensive i don't know people just stocked them up when they knew they were going out of out of style or something
**CONTEXT:** Here's a question recently uh i've seen new cookware in department stores titanium ceramic non-stick does dr pete think this would be safe to use titanium ceramic non-stick

**RAY PEAT:** I think we're biased against the creation of chaos. And inclined towards the creation of order.
**CONTEXT:** So that the situation, the carbon atoms didn't have a written plan for what they were going to do, but it was in their nature, given the opportunity to create high orders of organization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think we are determined to have free will. It's part of our, our nature, part of the nature of every living thing. And like the, I mentioned the formation of soot molecules, extremely complex, organized, symmetrical molecules formed spontaneously when methane explodes. You, you get some carbon dioxide, oxygen consumes the hydrogens, but the carbon atoms... have an intrinsic order, ordering principle. They spontaneously organize into these very, very big complex molecules. And I think that spontaneous tendency to improve things create order out of chaos. I think that's... where determinism affects free will. So that the situation, the carbon atoms didn't have a written plan for what they were going to do, but it was in their nature, given the opportunity to create high orders of organization. I think our inherent free will is intending to create high-level order. As we press forward, moving into our life, our free will is what's creating order and more peace and love. In other words, I think we're biased against the creation of chaos. And inclined towards the creation of order.
**CONTEXT:** You would you ask Dr. Pete to talk about free will and determinism?
