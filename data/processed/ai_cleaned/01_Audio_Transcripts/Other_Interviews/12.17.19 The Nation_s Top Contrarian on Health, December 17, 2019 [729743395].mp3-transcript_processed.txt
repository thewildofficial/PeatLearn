**RAY PEAT:** The life span is decreasing now in the U.S. and the government is finally admitting it. On top of the rapid increase in autoimmune disease, degenerative disease, and cancer rate and mortality increasing in younger people, I've been looking for explanations for that.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, you've been researching the decrease in life expectancy and the rise in autoimmune diseases. What are your findings regarding the cause of autoimmune issues?

**RAY PEAT:** The classic story is that the body gets an infection, a virus, a bacteria, or a fungus, and the immune system attacks that, and then it actually attacks its own tissues. I don't think so. I've seen studies in animals trying to duplicate that process. They give them a viral infection of the brain that increases the antibodies just like in multiple sclerosis and other human diseases. They find that if they prevent those so-called autoantibodies, if they block the cells that produce those auto antibodies, the animal dies. The auto antibodies are actually there repairing tissues. I've seen this in people with very high auto thyroid antibodies. That's a pretty common thing now to have chronic inflammation to the thyroid gland with high antibodies, but just very high thyroid stimulating hormone causes inflammation of the gland, and the immune system is attempting to clean up. The immune system needs those antibodies as part of a tissue cleanup process.

**CONTEXT:** So, the antibodies are actually beneficial?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. If you go way back to the Nobel Prizes in immunity with Ehrlich and Metchnikoff, Ehrlich worked for the chemical drug industry and created the antibody theory of immunity. Metchnikoff was an embryologist and he saw the immune system as a process of maintaining the structure of the body, removing damaged tissues so that the body remained entire and healthy. You can see that process happening in the thyroid, or if you just injure a cartilage, for example, your body will produce autoimmune antibodies, but it's a process of removing damaged tissues so that the cartilage will be restored. The body is doing what it's supposed to do.

**CONTEXT:** So, the body is preserving and restoring the thyroid in the case of high TSH?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, preservation and restoration.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned estrogen as a factor in autoimmune disease. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** For about 50 years, it's been very clear, especially with animal research, that estrogen is an extremely powerful factor in disrupting the immune system, creating inflammation. Women have several times the incidence of autoimmune diseases, five or possibly even ten times as much thyroid inflammatory disease as men. And that's because estrogen is suppressing the restorative part of the immune system and activating the inflammatory part.

**CONTEXT:** You've seen women with high thyroid antibodies improve with thyroid hormone. Can you explain that?

**RAY PEAT:** Over the last 40 years, I've seen probably 20 or 30 women with that condition. If their doctor will give them a full replacement dose of thyroid hormone, glandular thyroid, over a period of five or six months, those antibodies fade away. They fade away.

**CONTEXT:** You also mentioned a case where a vaccination during pregnancy led to autoimmune issues.

**RAY PEAT:** In just the last few weeks, I've run across two women who during their pregnancy, against their preference, were given a vaccination. Almost immediately, their blood pressure went up, their blood sugar went up, they were diagnosed as having preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The first one developed rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, went back for thorough exams, and found she had the lupus, typical antibody. She was diagnosed with SLE, lupus, and they wanted to put her on immune system-killing drugs. But she started taking thyroid and progesterone and changing her diet, and the arthritis faded away, the lupus antibodies faded away. I think in probably any case of autoimmune antibodies, if you remove the problem, the sources of inflammation, the antibodies, after about six or eight months, will fade away.

**CONTEXT:** You've described antibodies as helping to clean up damaged tissue. Can you explain the role of lactic acid in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** If your body doesn't... if the white blood cells are slightly poisoned by a bad diet and your thyroid hormone doesn't provide the energy, then there tends to be quite a bit of lactic acid in circulation. That's enough to start the inflammation process. By increasing the energy production, you lower the lactic acid and reduce the basis of the inflammation. With the lactic acid removed, then the oxidative metabolism can get going and energize the process of cleanup.

**CONTEXT:** What causes high lactic acid?

**RAY PEAT:** The basic general cause is anything that shifts you over to having free fatty acids circulating in your blood. Any kind of stress that runs into a limitation of energy capacity will break down the fatty acids in your tissues, put them into your bloodstream as a source of energy. When the fatty acids are being circulated, they block the ability to oxidize glucose. When you aren't oxidizing glucose, you aren't producing as much lactic acid and you aren't producing as much carbon dioxide and carbonic acid. That lack of carbonic acid inside the cell allows the cell to shift over to the production of lactic acid. The healthy cell is oxidizing glucose, which produces a lot more carbon dioxide than oxidizing fat does. That higher carbon dioxide suppresses the process of glycolysis and making lactic acid.

**CONTEXT:** In terms of diet, what increases lactic acid and what improves it?

**RAY PEAT:** You need all of the trace minerals and essential vitamins and adequate protein. Ideally, you would get all of your energy from carbohydrates, sugar or starches, and not have to rely on burning fat, because stress turns on the fat burning, and that turns on almost always some background lactic acid formation.

**CONTEXT:** What about the ketogenic diet and burning fat?

**RAY PEAT:** When the brain is given ketones, or especially the short or medium-chain triglycerides, if you're making an argument by doing a particular set of experiments, you take a frame of reference and you can seem to have made your point within a certain context. For example, if you're advocating the ketone-based brain energy, you've got to have a frame of reference and shift your argument over to make lactic acid a virtue rather than a menace. Medium-chain triglycerides, for example, oxidized by the astrocytes, the connective tissue of the brain, it causes them to produce a lot of lactic acid. If you see lactic acid as a virtue for energy, then that seems to support the fat diet.

**CONTEXT:** So, the ketogenic diet might be problematic due to lactic acid buildup?

**RAY PEAT:** Really, it's the background shift towards lactic acid metabolism that is the essence of stress, inflammation, and degeneration. So it's really key when you're looking at lactic acid production.

**CONTEXT:** Is lactic acid also a concern for the heart?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. It's a big deal. I think there should be a regular test of lactic acid content in the blood. You could see oncoming heart disease and cancer much earlier.

**CONTEXT:** What are the main causes of excessive lactic acid production?

**RAY PEAT:** Too much fat in your diet. Too much fat, even the good old grass-fed, whatever, animal fat. Too much of that. Butter, too? Too much butter? Yeah, you could eat so much butter that it can have that effect, even though it's good fats.

**CONTEXT:** How does butter differ from fish oil in terms of fat composition and effects?

**RAY PEAT:** When you eat butter, the highly saturated fat, stearic acid, for example, it has an anti-inflammatory effect in most tissues and it has an antioxidant action because it is so stable. Fish oil and safflower oil, soy oil, have so much highly unsaturated fat that they are spontaneously oxidizing, even before it reaches your bloodstream. They oxidize. It's the oxidized fat molecules, in the case of fish oil, that will temporarily produce an anti-inflammatory effect by poisoning your immune system.

**CONTEXT:** What about saturated fats from other sources, like well-raised pigs?

**RAY PEAT:** If the pigs are all healthy and cool, and they were eating good stuff and apples, for example, their fat would be just like butter.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that sugar energy from carbohydrates is preferable. Is it preferable over meat?

**RAY PEAT:** Meat should provide the protein which is essential and lots of the vitamins and minerals. But meat has a very high content of phosphate and almost no calcium in proportion. Phosphate imitates the stress condition. When you're under stress and break down ATP, you liberate phosphate, which activates tissue and is part of the muscle contraction and excitation. If you don't eat enough calcium in proportion, you start having an average condition of over excitation.

**CONTEXT:** So, too much meat without enough calcium from greens could be an issue?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. The cooked greens are the richest source of calcium. Cows eat mostly greens when they can, and so the milk is a very good source of magnesium and calcium from the greens they eat.

**CONTEXT:** Why doesn't the calcium from milk end up in the arteries?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the phosphate excess that pushes the calcium into your arteries and out of the bones. That's very closely related to the problem of inflammation, degeneration, and immune failure. The phosphate, out of proportion, triggers your parathyroid glands, and the parathyroid hormone specializes in moving calcium out of your bones, bringing it into the blood to balance the phosphate. The parathyroid hormone mobilizes calcium out of the bone by blocking oxidative metabolism, creating local lactic acid production, which breaks down the bone.

**CONTEXT:** What blood test markers would indicate a high parathyroid hormone level leading to these issues?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, that and aldosterone is part of it, the angiotensin system is a big part of it, they all go with parathyroid hormone. But the common blood test, the most often identified feature is a low vitamin D content in the blood, because vitamin D helps to shift the ratio in your body towards calcium, away from phosphate. Vitamin D, or a high calcium intake, turns off the parathyroid hormone.

**CONTEXT:** So, high calcium intake can prevent soft tissue calcification?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, it's crazy. So the vitamin D, is it the same as taking a vitamin D supplement or being out in the sun? Better to be in the sun. When your tissues have assimilated the calcium and vitamin D, you actually become resistant to the sun because it's the de-energized tissues liberating fatty acids and such that make you sunburn and age your skin in the sun.

**CONTEXT:** There's a concern that sugar causes aging. What's your perspective on that?

**RAY PEAT:** Lowering human growth hormone is one of the great advantages of carbohydrate, sugar, or starch. Growth hormone is one of the stress-related hormones. It rises when your blood sugar is low and liberates free fatty acids in the body. Animals that spontaneously lack the growth hormone live about twice as long as the ones with the normal growth hormone. High HGH levels are not pro-youth at all. They're just the opposite: pro-aging, pro-diabetes.

**CONTEXT:** What about the concept of metabolic syndrome, where too many carbs and high insulin levels cause inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** That's basically caused by eating too much fat. Not enough carbohydrate. Not enough! So the metabolic syndrome model is incorrect, in your opinion, in the research? You can create it very quickly by especially polyunsaturated fat.

**CONTEXT:** When you say "too much fat," do you mean all fats, or specifically the "bad" fats like fish oils?

**RAY PEAT:** Butter and coconut oil, for example, have about 3% of the bad fats, the PUFAs. Even though stearic and palmitic acids are in some way protective, chronically, you're going to accumulate and store these PUFAs because you preferentially oxidize the saturated fats. They're safer, don't destroy the mitochondria as quickly. So you store and build these PUFAs into your tissues. The brain of a newborn calf or baby is almost perfectly free of polyunsaturated fats. In humans, by the time they are 10 or 12 years old, the brain is already showing a high accumulation of PUFA, and the metabolism is slowing drastically. After the age of 12, up until about 20, when growth slows down or stops, the tissues are loading up more and more with PUFA. After the age of 20, when there is no dilution by growth, the concentration of PUFA increases steadily for the rest of your life because they are preferentially stored and built into your tissues, including your brain tissue, rather than being oxidized. They tie up the cholesterol which is synthesized in the brain as part of normal brain physiology. The PUFA bound to the cholesterol makes it insoluble, so it's like ashes or clinkers building up in your brain throughout the lifespan, primarily because of the accumulation of unmetabolized PUFA.

**CONTEXT:** What are some common PUFAs we should be aware of?

**RAY PEAT:** Fish oil, safflower and cottonseed and corn oil, soy oil. All of the things which make good paint and varnish.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned milk consumption. Some people experience constipation with milk. What are your thoughts on that?

**RAY PEAT:** What the cow eats shows up in the milk. If the cow is fed something that you're sensitive to, then it will cause inflammation, just like a baby getting diarrhea.

**CONTEXT:** So, finding a source of milk that doesn't cause constipation is key?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. I've known people who tried five or six different brands. Sometimes they will settle on something which isn't really very tasty. Ultra-pasteurized milk, basically cooked until it's sterile, they cook the life out of it. But you still get the same similar benefits. Lots of people find that they can tolerate that without constipation or diarrhea.

**CONTEXT:** What about the idea of a healthy lifespan and reversing damage from unhealthy living?

**RAY PEAT:** Your blood vessels and your brain, for example, deteriorate in proportion to the amount of the polyunsaturated esters of cholesterol. Those become hard to excrete and build up and inactivate the cells. I've looked for things that can shift the balance towards de-esterification to help the system to break down and liberate the free cholesterol from the polyunsaturated fat. Estrogen makes the balance worse, and progesterone tends to help the balance. I don't know of any prolonged experiments in which they've tried to reverse an animal's aged brain by giving them a high balance of progesterone. But you can see improvement in many of the tissues, possibly because of the anti-inflammatory effects of the progesterone. Prolonged dominance of progesterone tends to reverse those brain and blood vessel changes.

**CONTEXT:** So, the body can repair itself over time?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, that's part of the function of the immune system. That's what it does. It is to break down the damaged tissue and let new cells form.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think is a realistic healthy lifespan for humans?

**RAY PEAT:** The official view is that since authorities aren't likely to live more than 70 or 80 years, they won't accept evidence of anyone outliving them. Over my lifetime, I've seen examples of people living much longer.

**CONTEXT:** If you could only take three foods to a deserted island, what would you choose?

**RAY PEAT:** Cheese, turkeys, and oranges.

**CONTEXT:** Why those foods?

**RAY PEAT:** Turkeys are fairly neutral food for some reason that people tend to do fairly well on. If you eat the leanest parts, like the breast meat, that's pretty good food. Saturated fat is the best because it's more stable. Wild turkeys eating bugs and worms would have good fat. Same way with chickens. If you can get real chickens that are hanging out all day, that's where the best eggs are.

**CONTEXT:** Do you eat bread?

**RAY PEAT:** No. 45 years ago, I liked to make bread. I would soak it about 12 hours, keeping the flour wet so that the enzymes would break it down. That increases the protein and decreases, practically eliminates the gluten. I found that that was very digestible, very tasty. I could eat a loaf of bread at bedtime and sleep very well. A slice of regular bread would disturb my sleep.

**CONTEXT:** What about gluten sensitivity?

**RAY PEAT:** Gluten has a string of amino acids with the same pattern that estrogen activates in the intestine. Like estrogen, it can activate inflammation just by that pattern that the immune system recognizes as a signal of stress. Historically, bread was made with long soaking periods or by adding ashes to the dough. The ash alkali activates chemical processes that increase niacin value but decrease tryptophan, making it chemically much more nutritious and a safe, non-inflammatory food.

**CONTEXT:** You've linked hypoglycemia and lactic acid. Is there a connection between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular disease?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. When your oxidative apparatus, when the mitochondria are damaged, usually by fat, you tend to produce lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide. That is many times less efficient than oxidizing sugar. You're producing lactic acid and consuming sugar at a high rate but not getting the energetic benefit from it. To get the maximum energy, you use sugar at an extremely high rate. You just have trouble keeping your blood sugar steady.

**CONTEXT:** What are your recommendations for reversing lactic acidosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Good thyroid function, vitamin D, and lowering fat intake.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on TSH levels?

**RAY PEAT:** I've never seen anyone who was free of symptoms who had a 2.0 or higher TSH. Very few people at 1.5 are really fully functioning. A population surveyed for thyroid cancer showed that those with TSH levels of 0.4 and down were essentially free of thyroid cancer. I would aim for a TSH of 0.001.

**CONTEXT:** What are the symptoms of a TSH of 2 or 3?

**RAY PEAT:** Some kind of inflammatory problem somewhere in the system. Insomnia, sure.

**CONTEXT:** What general nutrition do you recommend?

**RAY PEAT:** Good general nutrition where you're not getting too much phosphate but are getting at least 80 to 100 grams of protein per day. Milk gives you phosphate, but in proportion to calcium and magnesium. If you drink 3 quarts of milk, you're getting an adequate amount of protein just from the milk.

**CONTEXT:** For someone with super ventricular tachycardia, what advice can you offer?

**RAY PEAT:** Checking vitamin D would be the very first thing. If your vitamin D is low, you're subject to the excitatory effects of phosphate. Checking the amount of calcium and magnesium in your diet along with the vitamin D, those are the heart-stabilizing nutrients. Selenium from seafoods in particular is important. One good meal of seafood per week will provide the required selenium. That lets your tissues form thyroid hormone. Your T4 in circulation might be adequate, but without selenium, the individual tissues won't be able to produce the T3 that they need, for example, for the heart. Avoiding a salt-deficient diet goes right along with getting enough calcium. Calcium deficiency was the problem with hypertension, not sodium.

**CONTEXT:** What is an optimal estradiol level for a 70-year-old male?

**RAY PEAT:** 15.1 pg/mL is a very fine, low estrogen level. That's good.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on microwave ovens?

**RAY PEAT:** They cause the same changes that boiling your meat does. They have the virtue of not tending to scorch things on the outside like a baking oven would. So, on average, the nutrients are safer by microwave. But it just doesn't taste as good. The old microwaves used to put out a huge field, but they are safe about three or four feet away now.

**CONTEXT:** What about remedies for microscopic parasites that might cause calcification?

**RAY PEAT:** Just getting your immune system revved up, keeping your body temperature up around 98.6 in the daytime, and your oxidative metabolism going well. The immune system can take care of those.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on spices?

**RAY PEAT:** They all have their toxic levels. Clove, cinnamon, pepper, black pepper are pretty safe spices. Chili pepper can cause serious damage and probably stomach cancer if you eat hot chilies in excess.

**CONTEXT:** What about chlorella powder, spirulina powder, charcoal, and diatomaceous earth?

**RAY PEAT:** I think all of them have their potential risks. They occasionally have been found to be contaminated with toxins. If they were clean, and you could have each batch tested, that would be different.

**CONTEXT:** You recommend not being afraid of sugar and fruit juices, despite common beliefs about dental cavities. What's your advice?

**RAY PEAT:** It's good to rinse your mouth after every intake because of the acidity. The quality of your saliva varies according to your hormones. Some cavities start inside the teeth when you're under stress. They're called stress cavities because the tooth removes minerals under stress.

**CONTEXT:** Is A2 milk good?

**RAY PEAT:** I think A2 milk is good. I like low-fat milk.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think of Shilajit?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know anything directly about it, just what I've read. It's a mineral from Liberia, I think.
