**RAY PEAT:** Science is a matter of questioning science. It isn't science if it isn't questionable.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about trusting science when claims are constantly changing.

**RAY PEAT:** The consensus is what people believe. She doesn't have to support it in any way. Fauci's principle is, I am science, trust me. That's exactly what science isn't.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how scientists figure out what's true and if it's just personal conclusion.

**RAY PEAT:** The government intervened with its grant power. The science was turning away from individual researchers with a little self-financed lab. It wasn't acceptable science if it didn't have financing. So government and the huge corporations controlled financing to direct science to go the way they wanted it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the shift in scientific funding and direction.

**RAY PEAT:** The combination of government and big corporations are the consensus. And if you dissent, you don't get any funding.

**CONTEXT:** The host brings up Peter Duesberg and his ostracization.

**RAY PEAT:** My belief, and Peter Duesberg's belief, is that the HIV thing never existed.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the HIV/AIDS situation was a similar situation to the current pandemic.

**RAY PEAT:** Duesberg points out that our liver is full of probably thousands of these remnant viruses. Not even sure that they were ever functioning as a virus, but they have the structure of a virus. They could be pollen you've inhaled. Who knows. Like this exosome idea.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about exosomes.

**RAY PEAT:** They are resident in our tissues, just as part of, they call it the dark DNA. It only takes a very small percentage of our genome DNA to make, to describe a person, something like 97% of it is mysterious, so called dark DNA. In that, there are thousands of these inert virus remnants, so that if you're sick, your tissues are stirred up. The genome is activated and disturbed and lets out a relatively broad spectrum of this dark DNA, and Duesberg suggests that HIV is just one of these. But it would account for sick people testing positive more than healthy people. But in the general population, it's about a half percent test positive.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sick people testing positive is a healing process.

**RAY PEAT:** The labor is putting out sort of hypotheses about what might help to repair the stress. So it's an explosion of variability, and if you test for that variability, you see things that are associated with people being sick, but it doesn't mean that they have anything.

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis and his statements about the PCR test.

**RAY PEAT:** The government instructions right from the start... It's 45 [cycles], right? Yeah, twice as many as you knew would produce false positives. So what they did was create an epidemic of tests. The more tests they did, exactly corresponding to the increase in the number of tests, the increase in the number of so-called cases increased. The cases were simply a reflection of how many people you tested. And so this whole thing was run on false data that nobody has talked about except alternative places like here and other people have, but just a handful compared to media.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the PCR test cycle count and its relation to case numbers.

**RAY PEAT:** Suddenly when the vaccine came on the market, the government said, okay, now you can run it to normal 30 or 35 cycles and that'll make it look like we're curing the disease because there will be fewer positives.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the cycle count can be changed.

**RAY PEAT:** You can engineer. You can start with a bat virus or any kind of a known transmissible virus-like agent. And then using the DNA engineering techniques that have developed over the last 50 or 60 years, you can change individual amino acids or you can take out a block and put in a new block that has a known function. So you can write your own virus program, essentially. That's what Ralph Baric and his lab at the University of North Carolina and the Fort Detrick term warfare lab. What they specialize in is creating a gain of function viruses where you make a harmless animal virus able to infect a human being and then to make it more or less virulent by adding a stretch of DNA that increases certain activities.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a virus can mutate into something like Delta or Omicron.

**RAY PEAT:** During World War II, the Germans and Japanese were leaders in germ warfare, but the U.S. recruited their germ warfare experts. Instead of hanging them, they came to work for the U.S. government. At that time, the Fort Detrick lab was just one of two or three major germ warfare experimental labs. The author of the best-selling medical physiology textbook, Arthur Guyton, was working for the germ warfare lab right at the end of Second World War, and his specialty was to make aerosols out of germs such as polio virus to make it survivable and transmissible through the air. And the government was experimenting that they would use a marker bacterium as something that was easy to find when it infected people. They sprayed San Francisco, for example, with an aerosol of a bacterium that produced a very visible response in the individual without especially making them sick. So they were testing it on innocent American populations. And in the process of making aerosols from the polio germs, Arthur Guyton became sick. He was polio and retired to teach medical physiology at the University of Mississippi and write his famous but very stupid textbook.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how engineered viruses would be distributed.

**RAY PEAT:** The government believed in the potential of the virus.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the polio thing was really about a virus or more about DDT and chemical poisons.

**RAY PEAT:** The essential thing, I think, for feeling better as well as recovering more quickly is its anti-inflammatory action. Just about any substance or process that is anti-inflammatory is also going to be anti-coagulant to some extent and protect you against the clotting and bleeding syndromes that are associated with COVID.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why people feel better taking ivermectin.

**RAY PEAT:** It's a bacterial antibiotic substance, a very complex, fairly big molecule, but it's been used around the world for parasite treatment, billions of doses given to humans to cure intestinal parasites.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about ivermectin's origin.

**RAY PEAT:** The placebo effect is extremely powerful and... the quinine derivatives... There are two synthetic quinine-like drugs that are, for some reason, prescribed, I guess, cheapness or profitability, but quinine is the basic thing that has a very broad spectrum of therapeutic value. But just taking a bitter potion is going to have a fairly powerful placebo effect, just because you know it has potency if it tastes so bad and bitter.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of belief and placebo in feeling better from medications like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine.

**RAY PEAT:** We powerfully regulate the amount of circulating cholesterol because it's an essential factor in our health. And the reason cholesterol rises is that it's a defensive substance. If you increase the amount of blood and just look at the ovaries' production of progesterone, the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary exactly corresponds to the amount of progesterone coming out of the ovary on the other side. And that means that when the blood level of cholesterol rises, your body is increasing it so that the defensive protective hormones, including DHEA, progesterone, and pregnenolone and so on, that these will be increased protectively.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about raising cholesterol levels and the safety of eating animal brain.

**RAY PEAT:** Usually the most common reason for low cholesterol, down around 140 milligrams per cent, or it should be around 260 to 220 or so, the thyroid level is what's responsible for converting the cholesterol into the defensive substances. But if your liver and intestine are very seriously damaged by poisons coming out of your intestine, then you can't make enough cholesterol to circulate and turn into the protective steroids. So the first thing to make sure your liver is able to produce the cholesterol you need for the glands and brain and other tissues to produce the defensive progesterone, the first thing you have to do is stop poisoning your liver by improving your digestion.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the cause of low cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid and the protective hormones do protect your liver and intestine, but they can't do the job alone if you're eating stuff that's very hard to digest and full of toxins. For example, just eating a very big green salad every day, if a person is in perfect health, it'll go right through them quickly, acting as a fiber. But if they're already having sluggish digestion, that raw lettuce or spinach or whatever the leaves are will sit in place being warm and exposed to bacteria so that it rots horribly before it gets out of your system. And the toxins produced from something seemingly as innocuous as a green salad can very powerfully limit your ability, your intestines and liver's ability to keep up your cholesterol production.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what's happening in digestion that makes raw salad a bad choice for some.

**RAY PEAT:** Quick peristalsis. So that's the colon making and doing its thing to move things through. Yeah, starting at your stomach, your stomach has to produce the digestive enzymes quickly, move it on quickly, get your pancreas to excrete more of the digestive enzymes, get it to move on as soon as the body has extracted what it can, then move the residue on quickly and eliminate it. And the quicker it goes through, the cleaner your intestine is producing the less lower amount of toxins.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what's lacking for proper digestion.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't think it teaches, but you have to remember that the enzymes can't be cooked to sterilize them. And so when you're eating a so-called enzyme, you're eating a raw animal organ. Not good? And so you have to be ultra careful that they don't contain bacteria or other infective material.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking digestive enzymes can teach the body not to make them.

**RAY PEAT:** If you have a good thyroid function, as well as all of the essential nutrients, that's the main thing for quick stomach emptying, quick pancreatic secretions, quick peristalsis, and quick elimination.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about finding good digestive enzymes.

**RAY PEAT:** My first experience was with a raw carrot every day. I stopped having migraines as long as I ate raw carrot every day. But then I found that taking thyroid, I was no longer so absolutely dependent on daily carrot. And there are several other fibers that are just about as safe as carrot. The carrot contains some toxins, as plant materials in general do, but the high fiber content of the raw carrot prevents almost all of the toxins from being absorbed. You don't even get much carotene, for example, if you just chew your carrot or if you shred it lengthwise so it doesn't produce a lot of juice. You don't want to put a carrot through a blender because that releases most of the carotene to be absorbed.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about therapeutic foods while waiting for thyroid health to normalize.

**RAY PEAT:** Very well cooked mushrooms are pretty effective. Very well cooked bamboo shoots and the traditional oat bran. The bran has some of the same effect, so it has a very low calorie content. It makes a very pleasant breakfast cereal to make a porridge out of the oat bran. Just oat bran.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about other high-fiber foods similar to carrots.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, I think any oatmeal is valuable. Got some good stuff? Yeah. It could be rolled oats, or just the grain is fibrous enough that it has a good effect. I think the drawback that scares some people away from it is that experiments have found that the oatmeal, as usually consumed, contains I think it's phytic acid that binds the minerals. I'm not sure it's phytic acid, but anyway, something that binds the magnesium and calcium so that according to those experiments, the more oatmeal you eat, the less calcium and magnesium your body can absorb. If you're going to eat oatmeal, you have to make sure to get extra milk.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about steel-cut oats.

**RAY PEAT:** I've seen improvement just by correcting the thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions for myasthenia gravis.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, below 0.4 is fairly safe, but it's fine to be even lower than that. And the body temperature is the other thing. The combination of a low TSH with a good warm body temperature stays around 98.6 for the bulk of the daytime. And in the morning, at least 98 or so to when you wake up. Yeah, 97.8 is okay if you warm up after breakfast.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about TSH levels and body temperature in relation to thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** Generally, it could be other hormones lacking. So you want to make sure your whole nutritional intake has all of the essential minerals and vitamins and quantity of protein and carbohydrates. All the good stuff.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if low TSH and cold temperature means increasing thyroid medication.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. It's in the same family as carotene. It's an antioxidant, but I'm not too enthusiastic about it. That general family. Too much of it can interfere with your thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about astaxanthin.

**RAY PEAT:** The carotenoid family. They are precursors or related to vitamin A. The other yellow, mostly yellow and orange pigments are the flavonoids. Those, the bulk of them, there are thousands of different flavonoids, but the largest number of them are very protective anti-inflammatory things. Where the carotenoids can even associate with increased cancer, increased damage to the skin from sunburn and so on.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what family astaxanthin belongs to.

**RAY PEAT:** No, almost never. There are several dozen studies of the iodine intake around the world that increased when they started iodizing salt and found that even, I think it's somewhere around, well, half a milligram a day associated strongly with damage to the thyroid gland and eventually loss of thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if supplemental iodine is good for thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's part of it. It did cure a lot of the goiters and hypothyroid. Some regions, I think parts of China and South America are still very iodine deficient. Outside of those areas, the supplemental iodine is more likely to cause damage over the years.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if iodized salt caused thyroid issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they aren't pure white, that means that at best it'll be some of the clay and mud from the from the beach where it's collected. You probably don't need that, right? It's hard to predict what kind of harmful minerals might be in that clay. The pink salt is very high in iron, so I don't think it's good to use regularly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about expensive sea salts.

**RAY PEAT:** First, I would look at all of the data, any data that had ever been claimed to be a basis for saying that there is a pandemic, make that public instead of stonewalling when someone sues the government public health agency, instead of keeping the basis for the pandemic existing, instead of keeping it secret. First thing would be to look at the data that they claimed was confirming the existence of such a thing as a pandemic. So far, no such evidence has been found. What they did was subsidize people to make up horrible possibilities, imaginary scenarios of what might happen, and then that was presented as the science rather than the government supported hypothesis about the horrible possibilities.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what recommendations Dr. Peat would make if he replaced Dr. Fauci.

**RAY PEAT:** The week, the second week of April, 2020, when there was this horrible spike in deaths, so-called from COVID, that week, flu went out of existence around the world. You don't have influenza committing suicide just so that the same amount of deaths could be blamed on COVID. It was simply a renaming of deaths that were happening anyway.

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions claims that the original COVID was computer-generated.

**RAY PEAT:** The number of heart attacks is very clearly connected to the vaccination.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about videos of football players having heart attacks.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so far they've just been the same thing over and over. More of the same. You can't even with the phony so-called vaccine principle of the RNA, you can't keep up with the changes in the virus, so you can't fight an epidemic in process with vaccines. It's never been rational. It's simply a fraudulent scheme to keep people under control.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effects of boosters.

**RAY PEAT:** It is out. Of course, it's out. It's a matter of whether or not we look at it. The people who are convinced that it's a crime not to be vaccinated are never going to look at the evidence.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the truth about the pandemic will ever come out.

**RAY PEAT:** The shedding, the phenomenon of shedding was known long before the vaccine. People are always putting out, in their sweat, urine, body fluids, and even breath, the proteins and pieces of DNA and RNA that are circulating in their blood. They come right out of the person into the air and surroundings. That's established, and so if you have a new circulating material in the body, the vaccine simply asserted that it wouldn't get away from your arm lymph nodes. It wouldn't get into your general circulation. But it was shown to circulate in the bloodstream, concentrated in the gonads and spleen. Other tissues, they're still saying, even though now it's acknowledged to circulate to all of the organs to some extent, they're saying it can't get into the breastfeeding woman's milk, for the same reason that it couldn't get into the bloodstream. So, if it can't get into the milk, naturally, the vaccine can't make the baby sick, except there's no fact to support their claims.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding after a partner gets a booster.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just not being around crowds that are likely to be shedding. I think things like a sudden... a burst of nosebleeds or untimely menstruation and so on, I think those are likely effects of crowd-induced shedding, poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Very often that starts with something you ate. I had that experience for many years, I could, an incipient tooth abscess or abscess below a tooth would flare up as soon as I ate potatoes or tomatoes. And so it was a way of training me to stop eating the foods that were affecting my mouth as well as my intestine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions for a toothache and inflamed gum.

**RAY PEAT:** I've never heard of that. I think it's not a good thing to take every day. Why would you take DMSO internally? They have found that it has an anti-inflammatory effect. It helps the same way progesterone and anti-inflammatory things do to let the cell give up some of the water it shouldn't have. But there are so many safer ways to reduce inflammation in cells. You can't always count on the DMSO being as pure as it should be. It can trace allergens into your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of taking 200mg of DMSO orally daily.

**RAY PEAT:** That's most often an effect of low thyroid. In animal studies, they find that... For example, a woman who was using estrogen cream found that her fuzzy dogs, I forget what brand of dog it was, but her dogs were going bald just from being in contact with her skin estrogen cream. The estrogen tends to... end the cycle of the fast-growing hair. Low thyroid slows the growth and thins the shaft diameter. So it gets weaker and weaker as you're......thyrate is lower and the estrogen higher.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about thinning hair that breaks off at the shaft.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just lately I heard from several people with a 4 point something TSH and they're obviously sick and their symptoms are all traceable to an excess of TSH. TSH itself is pro-inflammatory and just lowering it is going to improve your symptoms but increasing the metabolic rate by supplementing thyroid goes with the anti-inflammatory effect of getting rid of excess TSH.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the TSH level of 0.4 being so much lower than generally believed.

**RAY PEAT:** You definitely don't want to start right out with two grains. No. Even if that's what you were going to end up with in six months, as a starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or, or, uh, it will imbalance your nutrients to, uh, go at it too suddenly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about increasing thyroid dosage for hair loss and potential heart rate increase.

**RAY PEAT:** No. If they're supposed to be extracted from foods, they're going to be far more expensive than the food would be. Right. Yes. And in the process of extracting them, very often extraneous materials get in and you lose some of the active ingredients.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about food-source vitamin supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** The histamine, for example, activated by estrogen and many other things, but histamine and estrogen and endotoxin, each of those tends to make your tissues take up water, get inflamed, start producing more histamine or analogous things, release endotoxin from your intestine to circulate through your bloodstream. It makes things more inflamed, leakier. The histamine effect in cells is causing a local uptake of water, a change of the protein relation to the surrounding water, an activation of the cell, excitation shift to inefficient metabolism towards lactic acid production, for example, and that damage these transmitters that change the metabolism are changing the antigenic properties of the cell. It doesn't take a powerful chemical reaction, just a stretching or excess bending or swelling of the tissue can change the protein confirmation enough that it becomes antigenic. Your immune system sees what looks like a foreign antigen because of these intrinsic pro-inflammatory signals. The cell is swelling up and getting deranged, and to the immune system at an extreme, that looks like a foreign material, so the immune system comes in and tries to clean up the damage the way it would with a bacteria or fungal infection. It kills the cells and carries away the debris as far as possible. All of these same components, histamine and estrogen, for example, will shift your immune system, knocking out the brain of your immune system, the thymus cells, suppressing them and releasing the antibody forming B cells and at the same time activating an enzyme that creates an actual genetic change, a genomic destabilization enzyme, they call it AID, that produces novel antibodies. You're generating more and more antibodies under the influence of estrogen and histamine, so the immune system seems to be going a little crazy, but what it's doing is revving up and trying to clear away the tissue damage, which is the basic problem. I think of it as the tissue damage as being primary, so if you stop the inflammation, restore oxidative metabolism and energy production, you restore a lot of those proteins to their natural conformations so they are no longer antigenic. Then your immune system will be able to quiet down and stop attacking.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the cause and treatment for autoimmune diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** Once you've activated B cells to produce more and more antibodies and are less discriminant, they'll start trying to remove too many cells and make the inflammation worse, but you've got to turn off the inflammation first, then worry about it. Getting rid of the antibodies, like when you're hypothyroid, your thyroid tissue is under stress and you'll form antibodies to those stressed thyroid cells, but all you have to do is supplement the needed amount of thyroid hormone and nutrients and allow the TSH to stop over-driving and stressing your thyroid gland. For six months to a year, those anti-thyroid antibodies will fade away.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the immune system attacks tissues it shouldn't because it's confused.

**RAY PEAT:** I think treating it exactly the way you would treat the COVID infection, because the spike protein is what causes the inflammatory coagulation damage, and the spike protein occurs from the vaccine just as much as from the virus itself. So taking the same anti-inflammatory things. That would be aspirin, antihistamines, even glucocorticoids or progesterone will help to reduce the inflammation. Getting enough carbohydrate in your diet to restrain histamine production is part of it. Don't fast or eat a pure protein diet. That would tend to increase the inflammation and coagulation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for ways to detox from the vaccine.

**RAY PEAT:** So on the histamine thing, you want to get adequate carbohydrates for that not to get up.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about carbohydrates and histamine.

**RAY PEAT:** The cosmic radiation, the scare about high-altitude radiation was invented by the nuclear industry. People at high altitudes have much lower incidence of cancer, despite the higher cosmic ray intensity. The cosmic rays per unit of radiation are less harmful than the lower energy. It's a matter of what they call linear energy transfer, and it means that low-energy X-ray is more toxic than high-energy X-ray. Gamma rays are higher energy than X-rays, and they're less toxic because they transfer less energy to the tissues. Particle radiation is ordinarily far more toxic than the electromagnetic X-rays, ultraviolet or gamma rays, because the particle slows down and gives up all of its energy to the tissue. But in the case of cosmic rays, they are so extremely fast-moving that they give up a much smaller amount of energy to harm the tissue.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from airplane radiation while traveling.

**RAY PEAT:** Insurance companies have known for more than a hundred years that living at very high altitudes, you have less cancer and heart disease mortality.

**CONTEXT:** The host shares an anecdote about a pilot friend.

**RAY PEAT:** Brownstein was a follower of Guy Abraham, and I think there's a lot of assertion, almost no science behind those claims. It's only these two or three people descended mentally from Abraham. Abraham, the pro-iodine, he sold an iodine product.

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions Dr. Brownstein's work on bromine-iodine relationship.

**RAY PEAT:** No, no. Dr. Abraham. A fellow that sold an iodine product, and that's where this all came from? Yeah, yeah. His website, although he worked in the same lab before I did, doing hamster aging research, after that, I think his whole thing was to sell his products. His website had totally insane stuff about radiation and iodine. After I ridiculed it, the worst of it disappeared.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Abraham was biblical Abraham and if he sold an iodine product.

**RAY PEAT:** It was used to, scrofula was the original thing, but it was a traditional anti-inflammatory antiseptic drug. Generally, what Edgar Cayce said was pretty well founded, but I think you have to interpret the iodine stuff very carefully.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Edgar Cayce and iodine for a plague.

**RAY PEAT:** We've been oversupplied with dietary iodine now. For example, bread and baked goods, for a long time we were using an iodine dough conditioner to make the dough produce lighter bread just using, for a physical effect, an iodine compound. And that alone was giving the American population for decades a toxic overdose of iodine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Edgar Cayce was onto something with iodine and what disease he used it for.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, having a serving of fish from the ocean once a week will pretty much guarantee our adequate iodine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if fresh fish provides iodine.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but you can overdose, a lot of people overdose by using an iodine-rich seaweed. I think it contributes to the high incidence of nearsightedness in the Japanese. And anti-thyroid effect can show up as nearsightedness.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about iodine from seaweed and symptoms of overdose.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's a good question. Oh, somebody just wrote in here, oh our friend Adam Bergstrom, Dr. Pete, he said, Guy E. Abraham. Yeah, I'm not sure how you pronounce his first name, but French would be Guy E. Abraham. Guy E. Abraham, that's who you're talking about on this iodine thing.

**CONTEXT:** The host confirms the name Guy E. Abraham in relation to iodine.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that was the average dose for decades. Armour thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the average dose of thyroid medication is higher now.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you definitely don't want to start right out with two grains. No. Even if that's what you were going to end up with in six months, as a starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or, or, uh, it will imbalance your nutrients to, uh, go at it too suddenly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about starting thyroid medication dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** And carbohydrates are really the most adjustable because sugar tends to increase your heat production and metabolic rate. Calcium and vitamin D are other things that increase your ability to oxidize calories. I think anything up to over 200 grams a day is fine as long as your calorie intake is in balance and your heat production is good.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why one would keep carbs under 50 grams per day, referencing orange juice spiking insulin.

**RAY PEAT:** Too much protein can be pro-inflammatory and anti-metabolic, slowing your thyroid function and lowering your temperature.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what to make up the calorie difference if carbs are limited.

**RAY PEAT:** It's a matter of what they call linear energy transfer, and it means that low-energy X-ray is more toxic than high-energy X-ray. Gamma rays are higher energy than X-rays, and they're less toxic because they transfer less energy to the tissues. Particle radiation is ordinarily far more toxic than the electromagnetic X-rays, ultraviolet or gamma rays, because the particle slows down and gives up all of its energy to the tissue. But in the case of cosmic rays, they are so extremely fast-moving that they give up a much smaller amount of energy to harm the tissue.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about airplane radiation and its harmfulness.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's called Let's Get Checked. It might be interesting for people. You can just do your TSH. I think it was like $75 or something.

**CONTEXT:** The host suggests a home TSH test kit.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you definitely don't want to start right out with two grains. No. Even if that's what you were going to end up with in six months, as a starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or, or, uh, it will imbalance your nutrients to, uh, go at it too suddenly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about starting thyroid medication dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** Since it's very hard to predict what dose you need, it's important to monitor your daily reaction by checking your pulse rate and temperature at waking and middle of the day, and to gradually increase the dose until you're at an optimal body temperature and pulse rate. And only at that point should you bother to check the TSH again, because the temperature and pulse rate are going to be changing as you're adapting to the dose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how long one should be on thyroid medication before checking TSH.

**RAY PEAT:** Whatever works for you to some extent. But when you look at both healthy populations versus sick populations, or if you look at people in the given state of health who happen to have a heart pacemaker, for example, they've given mental acuity tests to people with different heart rates or with a pacemaker installed. And if they run the heart at 70 beats and have a certain quality of memory and reasonability, then they turn it up to 80 beats per minute, give them the test again, and all of their mental faculties have improved just by increasing the heart rate a little above 70. Same with very healthy, very alert people. They tend to have faster heart rates.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the ideal pulse rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Women have smaller hearts than men, and like kids, have much faster pulse rates because their heart is smaller and their metabolic rate is higher. But women generally have a slower metabolic rate than men, but with a smaller heart, you have to consider their body temperature and body size and so on to judge what each one means. But again, then in the afternoon, say one or two o'clock, if you're just hanging around the house, you want to really try to be at 98.6, and that's a good indication of what your TSH is doing? Very, very close in the long run.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pulse rate and body temperature in the afternoon.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking antibiotics for strep throat is advisable and if it messes things up.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, give it maybe half a day of tapering off just to make sure it's gone, but don't do the whole thing. They don't want to have to pay attention or think about it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if one can stop antibiotics early if symptoms improve.

**RAY PEAT:** Healthy persons can have the same germs present, but they aren't hurting anything. So there's a failure in the ground substance that you can't blame entirely on the bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if letting bacteria heal tissues instead of using antibiotics is a good idea.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effects of antibiotics on the body.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the common advice to finish a full course of antibiotics.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a matter of whether or not we look at it. The people who are convinced that it's a crime not to be vaccinated are never going to look at the evidence.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the truth about the pandemic will ever come out.

**RAY PEAT:** The spike protein is what causes the inflammatory coagulation damage, and the spike protein occurs from the vaccine just as much as from the virus itself. So taking the same anti-inflammatory things. That would be aspirin, antihistamines, even glucocorticoids or progesterone will help to reduce the inflammation. Getting enough carbohydrate in your diet to restrain histamine production is part of it. Don't fast or eat a pure protein diet. That would tend to increase the inflammation and coagulation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just not being around crowds that are likely to be shedding. I think things like a sudden... a burst of nosebleeds or untimely menstruation and so on, I think those are likely effects of crowd-induced shedding, poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Very often that starts with something you ate. I had that experience for many years, I could, an incipient tooth abscess or abscess below a tooth would flare up as soon as I ate potatoes or tomatoes. And so it was a way of training me to stop eating the foods that were affecting my mouth as well as my intestine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions for a toothache and inflamed gum.

**RAY PEAT:** I've never heard of that. I think it's not a good thing to take every day. Why would you take DMSO internally? They have found that it has an anti-inflammatory effect. It helps the same way progesterone and anti-inflammatory things do to let the cell give up some of the water it shouldn't have. But there are so many safer ways to reduce inflammation in cells. You can't always count on the DMSO being as pure as it should be. It can trace allergens into your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of taking 200mg of DMSO orally daily.

**RAY PEAT:** That's most often an effect of low thyroid. In animal studies, they find that... For example, a woman who was using estrogen cream found that her fuzzy dogs, I forget what brand of dog it was, but her dogs were going bald just from being in contact with her skin estrogen cream. The estrogen tends to... end the cycle of the fast-growing hair. Low thyroid slows the growth and thins the shaft diameter. So it gets weaker and weaker as you're......thyrate is lower and the estrogen higher.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about thinning hair that breaks off at the shaft.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just lately I heard from several people with a 4 point something TSH and they're obviously sick and their symptoms are all traceable to an excess of TSH. TSH itself is pro-inflammatory and just lowering it is going to improve your symptoms but increasing the metabolic rate by supplementing thyroid goes with the anti-inflammatory effect of getting rid of excess TSH.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the TSH level of 0.4 being so much lower than generally believed.

**RAY PEAT:** You definitely don't want to start right out with two grains. No. Even if that's what you were going to end up with in six months, as a starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or, or, uh, it will imbalance your nutrients to, uh, go at it too suddenly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about starting thyroid medication dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** Since it's very hard to predict what dose you need, it's important to monitor your daily reaction by checking your pulse rate and temperature at waking and middle of the day, and to gradually increase the dose until you're at an optimal body temperature and pulse rate. And only at that point should you bother to check the TSH again, because the temperature and pulse rate are going to be changing as you're adapting to the dose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how long one should be on thyroid medication before checking TSH.

**RAY PEAT:** Whatever works for you to some extent. But when you look at both healthy populations versus sick populations, or if you look at people in the given state of health who happen to have a heart pacemaker, for example, they've given mental acuity tests to people with different heart rates or with a pacemaker installed. And if they run the heart at 70 beats and have a certain quality of memory and reasonability, then they turn it up to 80 beats per minute, give them the test again, and all of their mental faculties have improved just by increasing the heart rate a little above 70. Same with very healthy, very alert people. They tend to have faster heart rates.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the ideal pulse rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Women have smaller hearts than men, and like kids, have much faster pulse rates because their heart is smaller and their metabolic rate is higher. But women generally have a slower metabolic rate than men, but with a smaller heart, you have to consider their body temperature and body size and so on to judge what each one means. But again, then in the afternoon, say one or two o'clock, if you're just hanging around the house, you want to really try to be at 98.6, and that's a good indication of what your TSH is doing? Very, very close in the long run.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pulse rate and body temperature in the afternoon.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking antibiotics for strep throat is advisable and if it messes things up.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, give it maybe half a day of tapering off just to make sure it's gone, but don't do the whole thing. They don't want to have to pay attention or think about it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if one can stop antibiotics early if symptoms improve.

**RAY PEAT:** Healthy persons can have the same germs present, but they aren't hurting anything. So there's a failure in the ground substance that you can't blame entirely on the bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if letting bacteria heal tissues instead of using antibiotics is a good idea.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything.

**RAY PEAT:** The spike protein is what causes the inflammatory coagulation damage, and the spike protein occurs from the vaccine just as much as from the virus itself. So taking the same anti-inflammatory things. That would be aspirin, antihistamines, even glucocorticoids or progesterone will help to reduce the inflammation. Getting enough carbohydrate in your diet to restrain histamine production is part of it. Don't fast or eat a pure protein diet. That would tend to increase the inflammation and coagulation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just not being around crowds that are likely to be shedding. I think things like a sudden... a burst of nosebleeds or untimely menstruation and so on, I think those are likely effects of crowd-induced shedding, poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Very often that starts with something you ate. I had that experience for many years, I could, an incipient tooth abscess or abscess below a tooth would flare up as soon as I ate potatoes or tomatoes. And so it was a way of training me to stop eating the foods that were affecting my mouth as well as my intestine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions for a toothache and inflamed gum.

**RAY PEAT:** I've never heard of that. I think it's not a good thing to take every day. Why would you take DMSO internally? They have found that it has an anti-inflammatory effect. It helps the same way progesterone and anti-inflammatory things do to let the cell give up some of the water it shouldn't have. But there are so many safer ways to reduce inflammation in cells. You can't always count on the DMSO being as pure as it should be. It can trace allergens into your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of taking 200mg of DMSO orally daily.

**RAY PEAT:** That's most often an effect of low thyroid. In animal studies, they find that... For example, a woman who was using estrogen cream found that her fuzzy dogs, I forget what brand of dog it was, but her dogs were going bald just from being in contact with her skin estrogen cream. The estrogen tends to... end the cycle of the fast-growing hair. Low thyroid slows the growth and thins the shaft diameter. So it gets weaker and weaker as you're......thyrate is lower and the estrogen higher.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about thinning hair that breaks off at the shaft.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just lately I heard from several people with a 4 point something TSH and they're obviously sick and their symptoms are all traceable to an excess of TSH. TSH itself is pro-inflammatory and just lowering it is going to improve your symptoms but increasing the metabolic rate by supplementing thyroid goes with the anti-inflammatory effect of getting rid of excess TSH.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the TSH level of 0.4 being so much lower than generally believed.

**RAY PEAT:** You definitely don't want to start right out with two grains. No. Even if that's what you were going to end up with in six months, as a starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or, or, uh, it will imbalance your nutrients to, uh, go at it too suddenly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about starting thyroid medication dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** Since it's very hard to predict what dose you need, it's important to monitor your daily reaction by checking your pulse rate and temperature at waking and middle of the day, and to gradually increase the dose until you're at an optimal body temperature and pulse rate. And only at that point should you bother to check the TSH again, because the temperature and pulse rate are going to be changing as you're adapting to the dose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how long one should be on thyroid medication before checking TSH.

**RAY PEAT:** Whatever works for you to some extent. But when you look at both healthy populations versus sick populations, or if you look at people in the given state of health who happen to have a heart pacemaker, for example, they've given mental acuity tests to people with different heart rates or with a pacemaker installed. And if they run the heart at 70 beats and have a certain quality of memory and reasonability, then they turn it up to 80 beats per minute, give them the test again, and all of their mental faculties have improved just by increasing the heart rate a little above 70. Same with very healthy, very alert people. They tend to have faster heart rates.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the ideal pulse rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Women have smaller hearts than men, and like kids, have much faster pulse rates because their heart is smaller and their metabolic rate is higher. But women generally have a slower metabolic rate than men, but with a smaller heart, you have to consider their body temperature and body size and so on to judge what each one means. But again, then in the afternoon, say one or two o'clock, if you're just hanging around the house, you want to really try to be at 98.6, and that's a good indication of what your TSH is doing? Very, very close in the long run.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pulse rate and body temperature in the afternoon.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking antibiotics for strep throat is advisable and if it messes things up.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, give it maybe half a day of tapering off just to make sure it's gone, but don't do the whole thing. They don't want to have to pay attention or think about it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if one can stop antibiotics early if symptoms improve.

**RAY PEAT:** Healthy persons can have the same germs present, but they aren't hurting anything. So there's a failure in the ground substance that you can't blame entirely on the bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if letting bacteria heal tissues instead of using antibiotics is a good idea.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything.

So taking the same anti-inflammatory things. That would be aspirin, antihistamines, even glucocorticoids or progesterone will help to reduce the inflammation. Getting enough carbohydrate in your diet to restrain histamine production is part of it. Don't fast or eat a pure protein diet. That would tend to increase the inflammation and coagulation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just not being around crowds that are likely to be shedding. I think things like a sudden... a burst of nosebleeds or untimely menstruation and so on, I think those are likely effects of crowd-induced shedding, poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Very often that starts with something you ate. I had that experience for many years, I could, an incipient tooth abscess or abscess below a tooth would flare up as soon as I ate potatoes or tomatoes. And so it was a way of training me to stop eating the foods that were affecting my mouth as well as my intestine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions for a toothache and inflamed gum.

**RAY PEAT:** I've never heard of that. I think it's not a good thing to take every day. Why would you take DMSO internally? They have found that it has an anti-inflammatory effect. It helps the same way progesterone and anti-inflammatory things do to let the cell give up some of the water it shouldn't have. But there are so many safer ways to reduce inflammation in cells. You can't always count on the DMSO being as pure as it should be. It can trace allergens into your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of taking 200mg of DMSO orally daily.

**RAY PEAT:** That's most often an effect of low thyroid. In animal studies, they find that... For example, a woman who was using estrogen cream found that her fuzzy dogs, I forget what brand of dog it was, but her dogs were going bald just from being in contact with her skin estrogen cream. The estrogen tends to... end the cycle of the fast-growing hair. Low thyroid slows the growth and thins the shaft diameter. So it gets weaker and weaker as you're......thyrate is lower and the estrogen higher.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about thinning hair that breaks off at the shaft.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just lately I heard from several people with a 4 point something TSH and they're obviously sick and their symptoms are all traceable to an excess of TSH. TSH itself is pro-inflammatory and just lowering it is going to improve your symptoms but increasing the metabolic rate by supplementing thyroid goes with the anti-inflammatory effect of getting rid of excess TSH.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the TSH level of 0.4 being so much lower than generally believed.

**RAY PEAT:** You definitely don't want to start right out with two grains. No. Even if that's what you were going to end up with in six months, as a starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or, or, uh, it will imbalance your nutrients to, uh, go at it too suddenly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about starting thyroid medication dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** Since it's very hard to predict what dose you need, it's important to monitor your daily reaction by checking your pulse rate and temperature at waking and middle of the day, and to gradually increase the dose until you're at an optimal body temperature and pulse rate. And only at that point should you bother to check the TSH again, because the temperature and pulse rate are going to be changing as you're adapting to the dose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how long one should be on thyroid medication before checking TSH.

**RAY PEAT:** Whatever works for you to some extent. But when you look at both healthy populations versus sick populations, or if you look at people in the given state of health who happen to have a heart pacemaker, for example, they've given mental acuity tests to people with different heart rates or with a pacemaker installed. And if they run the heart at 70 beats and have a certain quality of memory and reasonability, then they turn it up to 80 beats per minute, give them the test again, and all of their mental faculties have improved just by increasing the heart rate a little above 70. Same with very healthy, very alert people. They tend to have faster heart rates.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the ideal pulse rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Women have smaller hearts than men, and like kids, have much faster pulse rates because their heart is smaller and their metabolic rate is higher. But women generally have a slower metabolic rate than men, but with a smaller heart, you have to consider their body temperature and body size and so on to judge what each one means. But again, then in the afternoon, say one or two o'clock, if you're just hanging around the house, you want to really try to be at 98.6, and that's a good indication of what your TSH is doing? Very, very close in the long run.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pulse rate and body temperature in the afternoon.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking antibiotics for strep throat is advisable and if it messes things up.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, give it maybe half a day of tapering off just to make sure it's gone, but don't do the whole thing. They don't want to have to pay attention or think about it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if one can stop antibiotics early if symptoms improve.

**RAY PEAT:** Healthy persons can have the same germs present, but they aren't hurting anything. So there's a failure in the ground substance that you can't blame entirely on the bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if letting bacteria heal tissues instead of using antibiotics is a good idea.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the common advice to finish a full course of antibiotics.

**RAY PEAT:** It's a matter of whether or not we look at it. The people who are convinced that it's a crime not to be vaccinated are never going to look at the evidence.

Getting enough carbohydrate in your diet to restrain histamine production is part of it. Don't fast or eat a pure protein diet. That would tend to increase the inflammation and coagulation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just not being around crowds that are likely to be shedding. I think things like a sudden... a burst of nosebleeds or untimely menstruation and so on, I think those are likely effects of crowd-induced shedding, poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protecting oneself from vaccine shedding.

**RAY PEAT:** Very often that starts with something you ate. I had that experience for many years, I could, an incipient tooth abscess or abscess below a tooth would flare up as soon as I ate potatoes or tomatoes. And so it was a way of training me to stop eating the foods that were affecting my mouth as well as my intestine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for suggestions for a toothache and inflamed gum.

**RAY PEAT:** I've never heard of that. I think it's not a good thing to take every day. Why would you take DMSO internally? They have found that it has an anti-inflammatory effect. It helps the same way progesterone and anti-inflammatory things do to let the cell give up some of the water it shouldn't have. But there are so many safer ways to reduce inflammation in cells. You can't always count on the DMSO being as pure as it should be. It can trace allergens into your tissues.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of taking 200mg of DMSO orally daily.

**RAY PEAT:** That's most often an effect of low thyroid. In animal studies, they find that... For example, a woman who was using estrogen cream found that her fuzzy dogs, I forget what brand of dog it was, but her dogs were going bald just from being in contact with her skin estrogen cream. The estrogen tends to... end the cycle of the fast-growing hair. Low thyroid slows the growth and thins the shaft diameter. So it gets weaker and weaker as you're......thyrate is lower and the estrogen higher.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about thinning hair that breaks off at the shaft.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just lately I heard from several people with a 4 point something TSH and they're obviously sick and their symptoms are all traceable to an excess of TSH. TSH itself is pro-inflammatory and just lowering it is going to improve your symptoms but increasing the metabolic rate by supplementing thyroid goes with the anti-inflammatory effect of getting rid of excess TSH.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the TSH level of 0.4 being so much lower than generally believed.

**RAY PEAT:** You definitely don't want to start right out with two grains. No. Even if that's what you were going to end up with in six months, as a starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or, or, uh, it will imbalance your nutrients to, uh, go at it too suddenly.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about starting thyroid medication dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** Since it's very hard to predict what dose you need, it's important to monitor your daily reaction by checking your pulse rate and temperature at waking and middle of the day, and to gradually increase the dose until you're at an optimal body temperature and pulse rate. And only at that point should you bother to check the TSH again, because the temperature and pulse rate are going to be changing as you're adapting to the dose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how long one should be on thyroid medication before checking TSH.

**RAY PEAT:** Whatever works for you to some extent. But when you look at both healthy populations versus sick populations, or if you look at people in the given state of health who happen to have a heart pacemaker, for example, they've given mental acuity tests to people with different heart rates or with a pacemaker installed. And if they run the heart at 70 beats and have a certain quality of memory and reasonability, then they turn it up to 80 beats per minute, give them the test again, and all of their mental faculties have improved just by increasing the heart rate a little above 70. Same with very healthy, very alert people. They tend to have faster heart rates.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the ideal pulse rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Women have smaller hearts than men, and like kids, have much faster pulse rates because their heart is smaller and their metabolic rate is higher. But women generally have a slower metabolic rate than men, but with a smaller heart, you have to consider their body temperature and body size and so on to judge what each one means. But again, then in the afternoon, say one or two o'clock, if you're just hanging around the house, you want to really try to be at 98.6, and that's a good indication of what your TSH is doing? Very, very close in the long run.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pulse rate and body temperature in the afternoon.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if taking antibiotics for strep throat is advisable and if it messes things up.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, give it maybe half a day of tapering off just to make sure it's gone, but don't do the whole thing. They don't want to have to pay attention or think about it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if one can stop antibiotics early if symptoms improve.

**RAY PEAT:** Healthy persons can have the same germs present, but they aren't hurting anything. So there's a failure in the ground substance that you can't blame entirely on the bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if letting bacteria heal tissues instead of using antibiotics is a good idea.

**RAY PEAT:** But you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything. Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakened your mitochondria. You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the common advice to finish a full course of antibiotics.

**RAY PEAT:** It's a matter of whether or not we look at it. The people who are convinced that it's a crime not to be vaccinated are never going to look at the evidence.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the truth about the pandemic will ever come out.

**RAY PEAT:** The spike protein is what causes the inflammatory coagulation damage, and the spike protein occurs from the vaccine just as much as from the virus itself. So taking the same anti-inflammatory things. That would be aspirin, antihistamines, even glucocorticoids or progesterone will help to reduce the inflammation.
