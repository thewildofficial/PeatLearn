**RAY PEAT:** "I just read an article that was removed from the... website because of its dissent, but a professor at Johns Hopkins just a few weeks ago wrote an article looking at the pattern of deaths in the U.S. in 2020, Genevieve Breyand, I think her name is, and it is saying what... Several of us have been saying since last winter that essentially nothing special has been happening this year as far as deaths and respiratory disease deaths go. I looked at the total number of deaths recorded from previous years and compared them to what the CDC had done. For each week of this year and they were remarkably historically low for months and it was only in the middle of the summer when a few people had been saying that it's very interesting that the spike of deaths listed in the second week of April for COVID which was the exact week that the listed deaths from influenza dropped sharply just within a day or two. People stopped dying of influenza supposedly when the surge of COVID-19 came. But the quantity missing from all of those weeks before April 12 were just about the same quantity as the number of people in the spike. Danny Rancourt had this graph on Dale Bigtree's interview. He said in and of itself that was enough to put all of the top people in jail because it's so obvious a fraud. But when Genevieve Briand looks at these facts, she notices that there was a historical fall off in deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and a couple of the other standard invariable deaths. that corresponded to the spike. So what they seem to have done is just change the definition of people dying of heart attacks and strokes. The order went out by default if you didn't know what a person died of after a stroke. At the same time, they ordered people to run the PCR test beyond its capacity of accuracy, far into the range in which it produces false positives. So they ordered people to expand the testing program using a method that is predicted and known to produce false positives. So they were getting people who weren't infected, almost certainly these false positives were being put down as having the COVID infection, and then whatever they died of, they were recorded as COVID deaths. So I'm just as skeptical as I was in February or March. Even probably more so."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the perceived high number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 and how to address this concern.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when it's designed to run a maximum of 33 to 35 cycles, and Fauci ordered it to run more than 40 cycles. That's just like jiggling the machine so it puts out some kind of output, even though it has nothing to do with reality. And there was a tape that we ran on our show, I don't have it right here, but this was in, I think, July, where he was on tape doing an interview and suggested that anything over 30, he said possibly 35, but anything over 30 cycles, the CT is just showing up dead, I think is dead nucleotides or dead molecules, whatever his term was."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions the New York Times graph of new cases and the potential inaccuracy of the PCR test, citing a 95% inaccuracy suggestion.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and at the first sign of possible flu-like epidemic or pandemic. Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. said this is better than a planetary warming. This is just what we need to bring things under control, to shift, to destroy the legacy economies, to shift over to artificial intelligence everywhere. Tele-medicine, remote education, remote shopping and so on. Get rid of all the retail stores, retail schools, retail hospitals and medical practices."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about his opinion on how the situation has unfolded and mentions the World Economic Forum's statements about the pandemic being an opportunity for economic and societal shifts.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's the shock to the system is the first thing. The two nurses in England who on the first day developed anaphylaxis, they had been they had a history of allergies. But Pfizer or whoever their vaccine was made by didn't announce to the world that people who had allergies shouldn't take it. They had excluded allergic people from their test subjects. So naturally there was absolutely no evidence of safety if they excluded. Allergic people and old people and who knows how many other categories were excluded from the test samples? That was an obligatory bit of information that should have been announced to the world last Monday when vaccine was announced as a finished thing. But they said, well, yes, we did exclude allergic people. And immediately an official in the FDA said, but there are 1.6 million profoundly allergic people in the United States. That's a very large number. We can't exclude that many from receiving the vaccine. So according to the FDA, the Pfizer policy of not testing it on allergic people and then giving it to people with a history of allergy was perfectly all right because that was an appropriate risk. Safety testing has never been done like that. It's really fraudulent. And the article was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. People have analyzed it showing that the article didn't resemble at all the way an announcement of a new drug or product should be handled. It was like a public relations advertising bit. And it went with an editorial, not by an expert who could evaluate the Pfizer report, but the editorial was written by the editor-in-chief. of New England Journal of Medicine, whose magazine receives advertising money and major support from Pfizer. And this editor was on the FDA committee voting to approve it. So there was sort of a conspiracy all the way from advertising money through the medical journal announcement and the approval of it in the FDA. And then the FDA is saying it's all right no matter what it does to people."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the risks of the vaccine, particularly concerning genetic material insertion and potential long-term effects.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, not only the damage done to the immune system, which has its repercussions depending on how basic the injury was, but being RNA and even our own DNA replicating RNA, and being RNA and even our own DNA replicating enzymes, what we need for every cell to reproduce and to produce offspring. The DNA replicase enzyme happens to have the ability to function as a reverse transcriptase, able to transcribe RNA into DNA, making basically genes out of this bit of viral RNA, which can go into the genes, and the person can then become a factory for making the spike protein. This uniquely inflammation-promoting bit of information producing the viral protein, multiplying it endlessly by possibly all of our cells, so we would not only produce increasing amounts as our body went through its normal restoration and growth processes, but being spreadable by our secretions and passed on to our offspring if people should live that long."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about potential long-term effects of the vaccine, specifically regarding genetic material and its implications.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that particular thing was based on the fact that there was a lot of evidence that there was a similarity between an enzyme in the vaccine and the enzyme which creates the placenta, which happens to be just a structurally similar protein. That created doubt and suspicions that any sensible person would want to check it out. But instead of checking it out, they called it a conspiracy theory. So it's not a big stretch if folks explore the idea of eugenics and some very bad people that think there's too many people on the planet. It's not a huge stretch to say that this vaccine is part of that."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential for vaccines to affect fertility, referencing concerns about similarities to placental enzymes.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because that RNA is put in there to be copied. So those should be the ones with the dangerous passports and not the non-vaxxed people."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the concept of "shedding" from vaccinated individuals and whether vaccinated people could transmit something harmful.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they've put one very sick person with a cold into a room to play cards for several hours, passing things back and forth with a bunch of healthy people, and that almost never goes across. You have to be receptive, so the terrain theory is the basic thing, but you can't forget that things like herpes virus are super easy to transmit with just the slightest break in the skin, for example, doesn't even have to be a visible wound. So then that would play as well as for STDs. STDs, sexually transmitted diseases, the same thing because you're actually making contact to the mucosis, right? Yeah, Epstein, Barr, and lots of the contact viruses, and the experiments show that with extreme effort, putting a concentrated batch of viruses derived from one person, if you put them right into the upper nasal membrane, it will catch on a fair amount of the time. It'll catch on a fair amount of the time, but passing stuff to somebody who's two feet away from you, are you saying it's pretty rare?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the scientific basis for social distancing and masking, referencing theories that germ theory is "structurally incoherent" and that viruses are difficult to transmit person-to-person.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in one experiment they put a dye in a person's runny nose. They put a what? A colored agent into their nose and then had them play cards, and the dye was transmitted to everyone in the card game, but no one caught the virus."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the difficulty of transmitting viruses person-to-person and asks for clarification on an experiment.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Giving vitamin D is probably the single most functional thing. Vitamin D, vitamin A, adequate protein and carbohydrate and everything, but vitamin D is probably the main deficiency leading to epidemics."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for recommendations regarding social distancing and lockdowns, implying a lack of scientific basis.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, definitely. In the higher latitudes, the wind or sun doesn't make any vitamin D to count, and we need probably 5,000 international units a day is good for adults. If a person is overweight, it might take more than that, but the idea, the so-called research done medically has used doses of things like 500 milligrams, 500 units instead of 5,000 units, and then they say, oh, vitamin D didn't do anything to strengthen their bones or improve their immunity or reduce inflammation. You have to actually get their serum vitamin D up, and it has to be the kind of vitamin D that's the same as made in your skin by the sunlight and developed in your liver, and not the 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which is called the activated vitamin D is what they call that one, but we only activate ordinary vitamin D into the dihydroxycholecalciferol under stress. If we're deficient in vitamin D, the curative anti-inflammatory material, our body suddenly starts converting any trace of it to a very small amount of 1,25-dihydroxy, and that happens to do all kinds of destructive calcification things. So if you hear about the toxic vitamin A, it's almost always because they're talking about active vitamin A, but if you take enough calcium in your diet and the normal amount of sunlight exposure or vitamin D from even fish oil is usually an adequate source. If you take calcium and that kind of environmentally derived vitamin D, you'll have extremely low activated vitamin D. Activated vitamin D is the dangerous one."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if it's beneficial to take supplemental Vitamin D when sun exposure is limited.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in the winter, the summer, the sun is a little weaker, but in Texas, in a couple of hours, you're getting a moderate dose of vitamin D. In what areas would our listeners not get the vitamin D on their skin in December that they won't? For example, at the latitude of Oregon, even San Francisco, I think the sun is so weak right now that you could sit in it for eight hours."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about sun exposure and Vitamin D production in different locations during December.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "In experiments, either by accident or in animal experiments, people have occasionally, for confusion, taken maybe a quarter of a million units per day, and doing that for a matter of weeks, they do start showing signs of calcification. But if they stop in time, it isn't the extreme danger that it was made out to be when they insisted that 200 units a day was okay for kids and 400 for adults. But now 5,000 units, if somebody's taking 10 or 20, probably no issues with that if they wanted to take it. Yeah, I've known quite a few people who weren't getting their blood level up on 5,000 or 6,000 units a day, so they took for just a couple of weeks, they would take 10,000 or 20,000 units and suddenly their blood level would come up to normal and their symptoms would generally just suddenly disappear. Weakness, body pains, depression. R-R-R-Rumatoid. Symptoms just respond amazingly when you actually get your 25-hydroxy level up in your bloodstream."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the risks of taking too much supplemental Vitamin D.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "On the nanogram scale, it's about 50 mg per milliliter. That's the main thing they use. So that's the D."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a specific blood test number to aim for regarding Vitamin D levels.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, cod liver or halibut liver oil is you get lots of vitamin D and A in a small amount of oil, but in fish oil you get only the tiniest trace of vitamins. It accidentally gets in there when the whole fish is squashed."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if fish oil is a good source of Vitamin D and A.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, liver, any chicken liver, beef, any kind of liver is a great source of not only A and D, also K, all of the nutrients. The only problem with liver is it's very high in iron and very high in phosphate. And so I don't think you should eat more than one good serving of liver per week because you can chronically overload on some of the over-concentrated nutrients."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about other food sources of Vitamin D and A.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but one serving of iron per week won't hurt you unless you're eating red meat twice a day or something."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions that many people are told they have too much iron due to its addition to food.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they really enhance each other's effect and they don't have any contraindications. So both of them nourish and feed anabolic pathways, but in different ways. The pine pollen adds direct testosterone and other anabolic hormones into the body. The elk antler helps to fine tune the metabolism and feeds in all that connective tissue enhancing collagen that helps to feed and build up the body at the same time it helps to increase lean body mass. The two together would be your optimal nature-based formula. For both bodybuilding, for youthening, for anti-aging, and for anybody who's looking to keep their body in a youthful, anabolic, vigorous, and elastic state."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of using pine pollen and elk velvet antler together.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, both pine pollen and elk antler are tonic medicines. In other words, they don't have any contraindications of use, and they don't have to be cycled on and off. So somebody could use them short-term, but they could also use them long-term without worrying that they're overdosing themselves on them, because like you said, they're tonic medicines."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if pine pollen and elk antler can be used daily as tonics.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in the wild, animals tend to eat the small bones, like a carnivore eats a chicken. They aren't going to spit out many of the bones, because they can crush them and get the marrow out, and so on, so they're getting lots of calcium in a normal diet."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the calcium-to-phosphate ratio is important for humans, drawing a parallel to dogs and their meat consumption.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the parathyroidism. That's a consequence, but the first thing is the parathyroid hormone increases under the influence of too much phosphate, or not enough calcium. And the parathyroid hormone is what turns on the activated vitamin D, the harmful part of the vitamin D system, and it turns off cellular energy production. Not only in the hair follicle, but in the thyroid gland and muscles. Everything gets weak and tends to get inflamed if you have too much parathyroid hormone, and phosphate is the main thing in excess that will drive your parathyroid hormone too high."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the connection between the calcium-to-phosphate ratio and thyroid function.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it is okay topically. You don't want to take it orally because part of the effect of stress is to release fat from storage and every molecule of triglyceride involves a glycerin molecule. And glycerin, even from our natural tissue stores, a certain amount of it converts to methylglyoxal, which is a toxin and which adds to the protein glycation, the aging process. So you definitely don't want to ingest glycerin and I wouldn't use it copiously on the skin because a little bit of it might get absorbed."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if glycerin is safe to use topically.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, I was very interested in it in the mid, late sixties. Then I had a series of experiences in which it was producing inflammation and that sort of discouraged me. My interest in it, besides it produces a bad taste in your mouth if you just get it on your skin and it can easily take impurities into your skin with it and so the question of getting an absolutely pure substance in itself is hard enough, but then if you just introduce a trace of contaminant along with it, it can penetrate. I mean you could actually, people have said you could use some maybe DMSO and something else on your feet and put on a sock and if it has dye in there, that would draw that in. You have to be careful with that stuff."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's experience with DMSO.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Actually, cancer produces its own powerful reductants and antioxidants, and a big change that has been happening in the last 10 years is realizing that vitamin C, when it's working in a healthy cell, is a pro-oxidant. The reductant antioxidant form of it is not. It's not what's doing most of the benefit. It's the catalytic support of the oxidative systems that makes vitamin C useful. Vitamin E has its oxidative phase. The things you find in orange juice, fruits, and vegetables, the polyphenols, nobiletin. Phycetan, for example, these have been historically classified as antioxidants, but actually they shift the cell pro-oxidative processes, protect against the excess reduction, the opposite of oxidation that goes with stress and that is characteristic of cancer. The cancer metabolism is stuck. in an over-reductive antioxidant condition."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if antioxidants like Vitamin E or Vitamin C can promote cancer growth, given that low cellular oxygen can result in cancer.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Moderately salty chicken broth is historically one of the best things. The broth is a complex mixture that doesn't do anything irritating, but it has to be moderately salted because if there's too much water, that in itself creates inflammation in the digestive system. So the natural fluids, the right concentration of a salted broth or milk or orange juice which are more or less balanced solutions, those are all supportive of healing, anti-inflammatory, promote oxidative healing processes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for recommendations for foods or drinks for their sister who is experiencing nausea and can barely eat due to chemotherapy.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, chemotherapy is killing cells in proportion to how fast they grow and your stomach line lining is probably the fastest growing other than parts of your immune system. The stomach lining is turning over every two days roughly, and so if you kill the fast growing cells, that's how a lethal dose of ionizing radiation, for example, kills people by burning out the lining of their stomach, of their intestine. The chemical therapy does the same thing. It kills cells in proportion to how fast they're replicating, assuming the cancer is always fast growing, but very often a tumor is slow growing but still determined to go down the wrong pathway even though it isn't dividing very fast. So the ordinary radiation and chemotherapy are going to hurt your intestinal cells much more than they hurt the cancer if it's slow growing."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mechanism behind chemotherapy-induced nausea.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because of that reduction, it's a powerful reductant and what you want to do is get it into your cells in an oxidized form without pushing the growth of cancer cells, for example, for starting a process of inflammation. Once it gets into the cells, about 80% of vitamin C is in the form of dehydroascorbate and that means that eating meat, the animal's vitamin C that it makes is in all of its tissues, including the muscles, and at least 70 to 85% of it will be in the invisible oxidized form, DHA. And so when you're eating meat, you're taking in lots of vitamin C and still the official Department of Agriculture charts don't show any vitamin C content for meat, even though Amundsen, was that his name? The Arctic Explorer showed that they did fine if they ate meat all winter, didn't get scurvy."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the preference for whole oranges over juicing and the role of oxidized Vitamin C.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, when you cook it in a marmalade, it is very beneficial, but once I heard that when I was about 16 or 17 and tried eating a whole orange, it's very irritating to the stomach. I couldn't keep it down."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if eating a whole orange is more beneficial than juicing it.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, leaves are very full of irritants intended to interfere with animals' digestion, aimed primarily at worms and herbivores. But when we eat them, they have specific enzyme inhibitors that will decrease the nutritional value, but when you cook it, some of those are degraded and so it's a lot safer to eat well-cooked vegetables. Kale is a good food? Kale? Yeah, as a source of vitamin K in particular, calcium, magnesium."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if kale is a good food, following a discussion about cooking vegetables.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, having a blood test is important to check your thyroid estrogen and vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D are recognized as very important anti-fibroid factors along with thyroid. One outstanding example I think illustrates what thyroid can do. A woman in her early 40s had a child and wanted to, but she had a big fibroid blocking the top of her uterus, blocking both fallopian tubes. I explained how thyroid lowers estrogen while increasing the activity of enzymes that can break down fibrotic tissue. Anyway, she took... What her doctor said was a very dangerous overdose of thyroid, kept her heart rate beating at rest 110 beats per minute. That was in the spring. She had an ultrasound every month and saw visible shrinking, so she stayed with it through the summer. And by... I think it was September or October, she was pregnant. Just by uh... keeping her estrogen uh... under control by uh... keeping uh... steadily uh... slightly above average thyroid activity."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a recommended approach to dealing with uterine fibroids, especially when they cause pressure on the colon and bladder.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, I think it is. I've used erythromycin which is uh... the the original uh... form. They're very similar. They both have the uh... extra virtue of being anti-inflammatory and somewhat pro-propulsion of the intestine. So people who are having intestinal problems notice that the inflammation goes down and uh... the tendency to uh... uh... reverse peristalsis. uh... uh... reflux during the night or constipation. uh... the erythromycin acts as a mild laxity keeping the intestine going in the right direction rather than coming up into the throat."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of azithromycin.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Uh... uh... the uh... during the night uh... excitation increases uh... uh... from the blood sugar going down uh... and uh... this generalized uh... inflammation uh... against a background of low thyroid. Uh... uh... the thyroid uh... keeps the peristalsis uh... running in the normal direction uh... uh... from top to bottom. Uh... when that gets confused and uh... you get random uh... centers of irritation and inflammation uh... inflammation uh... just below your stomach for example start a wave of peristalsis moving through your stomach and up your esophagus carrying stomach contents or even lower intestinal contents into your mouth. Uh... a medical professor uh... in the nineteen twenties experimented on his medical students uh... putting a an indicator uh... an indigestible particles uh... that is very easy to recognize under the uh... microscope. He put a little uh... dollop of this in the rectums of all of his medical students and then in the morning had them take a swab of saliva and put it under the microscope and all of those who had morning breath found the particles that had been inserted the night before. Uh... showing the reverse peristalsis even in healthy young people it is very common uh... and it shows up most often as simply bad breath in the morning."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why reverse peristalsis occurs, leading to heartburn and other issues.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, over the years I've talked to I think three or four uh... young middle aged men uh... twenties and thirties early forties who uh... were eating maybe four thousand calories a day uh... and still weighed only a hundred and thirty five or a hundred and forty five pounds just couldn't put on any muscle. Uh... and my own experience was that uh... through my late teens and twenties uh... I ate gigantic amounts produced huge amounts of heat and steam uh... but stayed uh... at the same weight uh... a hundred and sixty five or seventy uh... and uh... as soon as I experimented taking thyroid my caloric requirement decreased by thirty or forty percent. Uh... and I suddenly was able to put on weight uh... and so I mentioned uh... thyroid supplements to these men uh... each one of them uh... had the same experience immediately they were able to put on weight that's because thyroid is our basic anabolic hormone. Uh... that was published in uh... endocrine textbooks uh... eighty years ago uh... a picture of uh... people who had experienced removal of their thyroid gland without replacement of a thyroid supplement. Uh... they wasted away uh... it was called the cachexia uh... the wasting disease caused by thyroid deprivation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if low thyroid could be the cause of being chronically underweight despite eating high-calorie foods.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the nucleic acid of it lives in the cell body, and only when the organism is under stress, when the pituitary is activated by a change of season, for example, this activates the virus to travel down the nerve fiber into the skin, where it produces the sore and becomes infectious. And at that point, probably an ointment or a wash containing a dissolved aspirin will help at the surface, but the quieting anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin systemically reduces that continuing process. So keeping your energy up with good food and thyroid supplemented with aspirin as needed is the quickest way to bring a shingle's attack to a close."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about shingles, its viral nature, and how to address symptoms and keep the virus dormant.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well, ALS is the degenerative nerve disease, right? I believe so, yeah, Lou Gehrig's, yeah. Lyme disease is definitely a bacterial, a spirochete-type infection, and it can be cured two or three weeks, maybe using two or three antibiotics at the same time. But there are some doctors that... claim that it's a perpetual thing that takes endless treatment, but really it's very cleanly. Eradicated by a good course of antibiotics, I've had experience only with one person with confirmed ALS and he started changing his diet and behavior right at the very beginning and he met a lot of other patients at the same stage in the neurologist's office and so he watched the course of their disease very similar to his for the first few months, but then suddenly he started getting better as they kept getting worse and all he was doing was changing his hormones and nutrients, things that we've been talking about, but also every day he would shine a bright light on the back of his neck in particular for an hour or more every day, making sure he was getting penetrating light into his nervous system as well as doing all of the anti-inflammatory pro-energetic things and he had reached a point where he bought equipment for using the bathroom, hoists and all of that sort of equipment and quit his job at his own business and was ready basically to become a complete invalid, but then he didn't. Suddenly, you... his improvement started and by the... in less than a year from the time he started, he was completely recovered, sold all of his machinery, and went back to work. At the age of 70 or 71."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about a connection between Lyme disease and ALS, and what recommendations Dr. Peat might have.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think a plain, like a chicken lamp, a plain clear front light bulb is good. It has all of the spectrum and we aren't sure exactly which wavelengths are the therapeutic ones. Red definitely is part of it, but I think it's good to have orange and yellow at the same time."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if exposure to red light and other available lights is beneficial for the body, following the ALS discussion.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Um... Well, it spontaneously does that. The more sugar you eat, the more will come out. Except that, yeah, if you do that, that will reduce the consumption of your good tissues, converting them to sugar. So if you eat as much as you're losing, that will tend to cure the process. It stops the stress, which is destroying your pancreas. And I've only known a few people who decided to get off the program and start eating a balanced, high-carbohydrate diet. And they had the same experience that those doctors did 140 years ago."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the William Budd maintenance method for type 1 diabetes, specifically regarding urine glucose measurement.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Overheating is the first thing. Overheating, meaning taking your temperature first thing in the morning? No, just feeling too hot, out of breath, and then checking your temperature. Your temperature might get to 99 all day. But if your pulse rate is going 120 at rest, that's definitely too much. So you should aim for a daytime 98.6 and 80 to 85 pulse rate."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for signs of taking too much thyroid medication, referencing their own experience with TSH levels and ordering medication from Mexico.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think, generally, niacinamide, internally, is the safest because big doses of nixinic acid create increased prostaglandins and have a lot of pro-inflammatory things that I don't think are at all good for MS. So niacinamide, does that, in general, increase circulation? Does it do the flushing thing? It improves metabolism by reducing free fatty acids that block oxidation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if niacin can be used on one leg to improve circulation for MS, and if it needs to be taken internally.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and the peristalsis might be a problem, too. So having some fiber in the diet is one way of reducing inflammation and stimulating peristalsis. And then checking your body temperature. Usually a low body temperature goes with sluggish peristalsis. I see. And so that could be causing his problems to bloat because the peristalsis isn't just happening. Yeah, the stomach and intestines just sit there letting any gas that forms stay put and blow up where peristalsis should be squeezing out little bits of gas as they form. I see. And then that would be, different forms of fiber would be the psyllium husks maybe and mushrooms? Yeah, mushrooms are very pleasant. Psyllium husks constipate a few people, but when they work, they're fine. Cooked bamboo shoots are good. For some people, oat bran mush works all right, but it's very starchy."

**CONTEXT:** The host describes experiencing bloating after meals, regardless of food type, and asks if it could be due to insufficient stomach acid or enzymes, or both.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, these are chicken lamps where you can get at Home Depot, right Doc? They're the big silver thing that you can put them in with a clamp. You've seen those. You can find them in the electrical department. And a chicken lamp is go to the light department at the Home Depot and they have these red, I guess, are they LED? Near red, Fred. Aren't they lamps? Well, they're usually clear front. The clear front is a lot cheaper. Oh. And it has just as much red light. Really? So you don't even need the red front? No, the red front cuts out blue light, so it gives a red appearance. But the clear front is putting out just as much red radiation. But isn't the blue light an issue for turning off melatonin or is it different blue light from the computer and a television screen? Well, the good thing about the chicken lamp is there's very little blue in it because it runs warmer, less hot."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a clarification on what a "chicken lamp" is.
