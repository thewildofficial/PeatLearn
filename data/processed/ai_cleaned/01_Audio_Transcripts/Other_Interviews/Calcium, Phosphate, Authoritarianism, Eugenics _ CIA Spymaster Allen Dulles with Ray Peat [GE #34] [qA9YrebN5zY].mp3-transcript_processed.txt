**RAY PEAT:** "It is extremely important to realize that calcium deposits in soft tissues become worse when the diet is low in calcium. Persons suffering from arthritis, bursitis, scleroderma, hardening of the arteries, and any abnormality where calcium deposits or spurs may cause pain are often afraid to eat foods rich in calcium. Actually, they can never improve until their calcium and magnesium intakes are adequate."

**CONTEXT:** The host introduces the topic of calcium as both a cause and solution to health problems, referencing a quote from Adele Davis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and that was 50 years ago that she wrote that, at least. And that's just horrifying to see how the medical journals now, about 80 or 90 percent of the people talking about calcium, at least 90 percent, completely miss that information that she had back in 1960."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the medical establishment's misunderstanding of calcium is an extension of an incorrect view of the cell.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I don't think she knew anything about Gilbert Ling, but she did read. That's the difference. She was reading stuff in general, and just accumulating information. That is what you have to conclude, even without knowing the principles of the gel nature of cytoplasm, and how gels work, what pH does to a gel and its affinity for minerals. But that work had been going on for 20 or 30 years before Gilbert Ling wrote his stuff. And so it was in the culture and people just staying awake, just like Adele Davis accumulated it by reading nutrition."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about David McCarran's work and its lack of acknowledgment.

**RAY PEAT:** "He got fired from California University, I think UC Berkeley, and went to Oregon. They were too backward to see how dangerous he was. And the dangerous message was the calcium anti-hypertensive effect? Yeah, stop talking about salt and giving people diuretics. The medical business had been killing them already for 30 years. And when he said that it's calcium deficiency, not sodium excess, they had to fire him and send him to the backwoods."

**RAY PEAT:** "The ATP complex is with calcium and then this is the general state that leads to the reductive stress, the low carbon dioxide, the high lactic acid, and then the shift in the intracellular and extracellular pH. And meanwhile things are streaming. Oxygen and sugar are streaming in and CO2 is streaming out, dragging the unnecessary minerals with it."

**CONTEXT:** The host provides a summary of cell polarization and asks about the shift to a depolarized state.

**RAY PEAT:** "Gilbert Ling showed that when he poisoned the energy producing systems glycolysis and oxidation that cells retained their polarization for longer than 24 hours just sitting there essentially dead. And meanwhile... Sodium and calcium were bouncing in the cell and bouncing right back out again so that they kept their polarization despite the motion across the surface and into the near regions of the cytoplasm and then back out."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of carbon dioxide in maintaining the polarized state.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I asked him something about carbon dioxide about 25 years ago and and he described an experiment he had done in graduate school that exactly answered my question. It explained what they call the lactate paradox of high altitude where you can work full speed at high altitude without producing lactic acid the way you would at low altitude. And he did it in the lab basically showing that cells don't. Fully depolarized even when they're stimulated and working if they have a good supply of carbon dioxide. So in the lab he showed the CO2 was preventing full depolarization and that's what you see it at high altitude. You don't depolarize enough to shift from oxidation to lactic acid production."

**RAY PEAT:** "The cell depends on at first using its internal glycogen to get the sugar it needs to produce carbon dioxide and if that's depleted then it starts using any amino acids or fatty acids to oxidize and they produce less carbon dioxide and will turn on the wasteful process of producing lactic acid. And that starts a vicious circle."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the carbohydrates carry their own oxygen. Each carbon already has part of the carbon dioxide or fat. You have to start with molecular oxygen. There's no oxygen built into the fat molecule. You use the oxygen. To produce the carbon dioxide for each atom of carbon in the fat. Where with carbohydrate, you use only half of the oxygen molecule because there's already one oxygen atom attached to the carbon."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but was he right in what he said? Do you agree with that? Yeah."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Andrew Kim's description of magnesium's role in ATP formation and its function as a calcium blocker is accurate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Similar, it tends to push it in, and fructose has the property of lowering intracellular phosphate, and the phosphatases are very self-protective in general. Getting the proteins unphosphorylated puts them into the resting state. When you stick a phosphate onto a protein, covalently it tends to change its whole behavior. The whole cell goes into the excited state. But even before it gets there. gets attached enzymically it's pulling the water system away from the resting state."

**RAY PEAT:** "So my interpretation of muscle contraction or nerve excitation isn't that there is some little motor that runs on the so-called high energy bond. The way they usually picture it is that the energy from the so-called high energy bond goes into some kind of a motor and that's what is happening rather than the parts that are left behind."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it was in 59, it was killed by Kidney Bernard. But I mean, that it's still common talk today, correct? Yeah, yeah, horrifyingly. It makes you miss the whole thing that's happening, which is. That you don't want that free phosphate messing up your water system."

**RAY PEAT:** "You said it was excitotoxic. Is that increasing some? Messenger or something to de-energize the mitochondria? No messenger, just the whole system changes the way it's lined up like if you have a bunch of soldiers lined up in rows and then you say given order and suddenly the whole thing melts and there's no longer any rows. That sort of a whole phase transition is what's happening. And that's the problem with the receptor idea that everything to some extent is a receptor. When you have a thousand different things getting ordered differently when it's in one state than in the other, the order that has been kept in the proper positions melts as a whole process, not as a series of isolated processes."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if it can't find its internal resources of, ideally, the glycogen and oxygen, if something cuts off its oxygen and glucose supply, then it starts eating itself, and it's in danger of disintegrating, and it can do that in more or less organized ways. If it's taken too by surprise, it can dump its innards out in very distressing ways, but if it is gradual enough that it is deprived of energy, then it can get itself organized so that it can be re-organized in a way so that it can be re-organized in a way so that it makes its internal materials available to other parts of the organism."

**RAY PEAT:** "So when you're exercising one set of muscles, if you go about it gradually, you can build those up and not subtract too much from the others because you're feeding what they need, but if you... are very intense in your exercise, if it's stressful, then the cortisol gets the material by shutting off the oxygen sugar use in idle cells, causing them to slowly release their material that can be used by the active cells to build them up? So stress hormones partly are there to prevent toxic death of cells, make it an orderly disintegration that can help the other parts of the organism."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's the working system. It's an adaptive process that feeds support into the system that's working and functioning. The idea of the functional system, it includes the way your brain is working too. Habits are sort of a functional system. You integrate your thoughts and your digestive processes and your muscle activities around a way of living and that supports that pattern. So you tend to get in a rut if you don't have things to interrupt and give you a more general way of functioning."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, he was a great hero to the Freudians who were still there and the new behaviorists were coming on and they didn't think he was at all scientific."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, his approach was great for the union breakers. They immediately saw that and one of his collaborators on the book, the Sciences of Man, I think it was called, his co-author said that his approach was good for the tobacco industry. So, Sally was a cigarette promoter, but... Rodgers, his first book, Client-Centered Therapy, the back part of it gives the philosophical basis. It's a very good description of phenomenology. It's philosophically very good, but it can be made bad use of by bad people."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, yeah, Maslow would just... butt in and say, you're feeling messed up because you're dealing with a horrible situation and just get out of that situation."

**RAY PEAT:** "But a direct way of being anti-authoritarian can look authoritarian, but it isn't. And actually, the super anti-authoritarian Rogers followers end up leaving the authoritarians in place."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's the Koch brothers and their ilk. They pose as anti-authoritarians, libertarians, because they want to have absolute power. They really would like to own the government, but if people still insist on voting and things. Then they want to break up the government entirely and then have their own governing system and they want all types of different freedom in quotes except they don't want economic freedom. Yeah, they want the army and their way of controlling the money system."

**RAY PEAT:** "No, no. He was a good libertarian compared to the Koch type."

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, yeah. Those are pretty good libertarians. They don't want to kill everyone. They consider themselves the uh... archaic conservatives. I forget the term, but they're the old-fashioned conservatives who actually believe in freedom rather than freedom to control everyone else."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there's the reality problem."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the place that that should be normal is in lactation. The serotonin turns on prolactin and the prolactin is parallel to the parathyroid hormone both of those. Break down the bone to provide extra calcium for lactation so the serotonin works systematically in a logical way to make milk. But when hypothyroidism is the reason for excess serotonin, hypothyroidism in itself because you're not producing very much carbon dioxide by not using oxygen much. Any little exertion tends to use up your energy and you have to then resort to... glycolysis and have produced the lactic acid and inflammatory state and hypothyroid people run at a higher level of histamine, serotonin and usually adrenaline too. Everything is using the emergency system unnecessarily. Just a background state of a very hypothyroid person is hyper ventilating in the sense of running around with those processes turned on. So when they go to a higher altitude and get even less oxygen and breathe faster, their hyperventilation becomes visible. But anyone, if they're driven to breathe faster than they should, if they use up their carbon dioxide, anything that makes you like an inflammation that produces lactic acid and serotonin will turn on. hyperventilation and stop the adequate production of carbon dioxide. And that sets in motion the things like causing the platelets to release more serotonin and the serotonin activating the prolactin and parathyroid hormone. It causes chronic breakdown of your bones."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide is going to produce lots of sugary fruits and make the diet easier to keep the carbohydrate up as well as the atmosphere keeping you from wasting your glucose."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there are lots of coal deposits that show what was going on there."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, just a burst of innovation biologically."

**RAY PEAT:** "There are people working on the idea of cycles of the earth, more or less coordinated with cycles of the sun. There are different opinions about whether you can have an approximate idea of when that's going to happen. But the smaller cycles, the ice ages, are somewhat easier to see meaningful cycles in."

**RAY PEAT:** "No more talk about the ice age that had been discussed for 35 years."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, people are a cancer because now we have automation and don't need workers. The Rockefeller Foundation, starting in the early 1900s, was pioneering disease prevention because they needed healthy workers. And now that there's automation, it would be very economical to get rid of about four or five billion workers."

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, basically. One of my favorite examples of research financing was... Elwood Jensen was a government financed chemical warfare person working on things better than cyanide for killing people. And the government transitioned him right into working on estrogen. And around that time, estrogen became a big government as well as industry topic with cancer institutes taking up the study of estrogen. Edward Jensen invented the estrogen receptor. The government gave him the only radioactively labeled estrogen to do his research with. Using that, he said that there is no metabolism of estrogen by the uterus. So all you people studying enzymology to explain how estrogen works, you're wrong. It's just hitting the receptor. No metabolism. It turns on the genes, and the genes... turn on femaleness, and then 15 or 20 years later, other people had access to the various isotopes that they could show. Yes, the uterus does. Metabolize estrogen, but meanwhile everyone had adopted the idea of a receptor turning on genes."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think the chemical warfare and estrogen Pentagon people are all clearly doing that. As a sidelight, they are seeing that inducing cancer almost instantly can be a useful tool for the military."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the whole genetics movement itself, genetics, not eugenics, grew out of that motivation, the original famous geneticists. We're also eugenicists, and the Journal of Eugenics, after Hitler became a target of scorn, the eugenics journal changed its name to Human Genetics. And just after I got my PhD, I wrote an article in the graduate student newspaper and mentioned that fact that the eugenics people were still around, still teaching genetics, but that they were embarrassed and mentioned the Journal of Eugenics in the library. That week, all of the old volumes disappeared."

**RAY PEAT:** "No, they were his employees, Standard Oil and several of the big banks, the Bush family and some of the big Democrats. I guess they were at times in the State Department, but in the banks primarily, they were financing the fascists right into and through the war. And as the war was declared, Roosevelt's government declared that I think it was Alan Dulles was officially declared a German enemy agent temporarily, but then very shortly after that he was put into the secret service or the OS test, I think it was called. And then the CIA and his brother put into the State Department, and if you look at the whole 10 or 15 years history of how those corporate powers were treating Roosevelt, in 1933, they had organized a coup, and they recruited Marine Corps General Smedley Butler to lead the Army into Washington to put him out of office. And he... gathered information as they were communicating between the corporations through intermediaries with Butler, and he took the information to Congress and said, Look, these big corporations are planning a coup. Congress investigated and confirmed what he said, but then did nothing. After 12 more years, they were influential in putting Truman in as Vice President in place of Henry Wallace because Wallace had gone on record. as favoring a continuation of Roosevelt's anti-war policies. Alan Dulles was, meanwhile, in charge of European negotiations. He, just a week or two before Roosevelt's death, Alan Dulles was secretly and against instructions agreed upon by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. Alan Dulles was making deals with the Nazis to... have the Nazis not fight the Americans and to go fight the Russians. Truman heard about it and said that information must be false because no one would do that. Stalin heard about it first and that was how Roosevelt heard about it but Stalin just has no judgment to think that could happen and then within a few days Roosevelt conveniently died before he had to accuse Dulles of the treason he was involved in. Allen Dulles then made deals with the German intelligence apparatus and unified the U.S. intelligence system with the Nazi system and that's what has set the course of history."

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah. There was talk about the inhalant that he used while he was being painted, just putting a little too much Benzedrine or something in the inhalant. He sniffed it, held his head, and had an excruciating pain in his head after sniffing his inhalant. And then that inhalant disappeared."

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, and have you heard any of the connections of Lee Harvey Oswald's landlady and Damorin Schilt? Lee Harvey Oswald's landlady who was working with Damorin Schilt, who was a 35-year associate of Dulles, they were both helping Lee Harvey Oswald get jobs. Like in the convenient book building in Dallas, and his landlady was a very close family friend of the Dulles'. Both of the people managing his movements for the last few months of his life were close longtime associates of Alan Dulles'."

**RAY PEAT:** "No, my first thought... was that Kennedy was such a bad man, no wonder, but then immediately within a week or so, I realized it was a coup for putting an even worse man in office."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Allen Dulles started associating with that banker by politician crowd when he was about 10 years old. So he had real skill and background in how to maneuver through the political criminal world. And I don't think there's anyone with such an extreme... international social background operating."

**RAY PEAT:** "You have to include... Sodium and a lot of other things in there, but yeah, it's one of the adequate breaks on the system."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's part of a system. So in itself is very powerful. The vitamin D and calcium are working on other things too. And so you can't say that they're only working on the parathyroid hormone. They work on the serotonin and prolactin and growth hormone, essentially everything in themselves to different degrees."

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah. People have been saying completely imaginary things. I imagine someone... wanting to sell a product other than Progest-E complex must have made them up because they have no connection to reality. But I have nothing to do with the Progest-E formula. It's exactly the formula that I developed in 1976, and has been exactly the same thing all these years. But people have been saying that they added estrogenic substances to it. A lot of people saying that they get estrogen symptoms is the usual internet placebo, negative placebo suggestibility, but the story, the formula has changed. It seems to have been repeatedly promoted on some of the internet discussion places."

**RAY PEAT:** "So everything progesterone does in reference to estrogen. There are at least 11 things that I've counted that consistently everywhere you look is anti-estrogenic. So I think it's all a suggestibility."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, one person said she had no effect from taking a hundred milligrams a fourth of a teaspoon of the progesterone. And I asked her to repeat the dose and she took as much as 400 milligrams a teaspoon and still didn't feel anything and when she had her blood tested, her estrogen was the highest I've ever seen. It was 100 times higher than the estrogen should have been and when your estrogen reaches a certain point, there's no absorptive capacity, no carrying capacity into the blood that can carry enough progesterone to have an effect. And for those people, it's necessary to work on the liver, feeding liver protein or B vitamins, whatever it needs to start detoxifying the estrogen and increase the thyroid if necessary to make the liver metabolize the estrogen."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and the word bloat has various meanings. Some people who have one or two ounces of liquid around their intestines. Verified by ultrasound or such, just a small amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity can create a sensation of fullness and some people refer to that as bloat or an enlarged uterus. Some people feel bloated, but when it's digestive, if you aren't digesting your carbohydrate, the bacteria can produce a large amount of gas and the usual traditional meaning of bloat was accumulated gas. And the test for that is just to thump your belly with your fingers, you can tap it in different places and find exactly where there's a gas deposit if there is."

**RAY PEAT:** "Cholesterol and then progesterone will be my next newsletters, thinking about the evolutionary in every sense. Implications and meaning of cholesterol and progesterone."
