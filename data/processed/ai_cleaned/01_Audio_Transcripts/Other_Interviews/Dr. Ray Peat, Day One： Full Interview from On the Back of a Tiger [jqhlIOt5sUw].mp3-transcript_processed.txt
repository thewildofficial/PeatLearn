**RAY PEAT:** My name's Raymond Peat.
**CONTEXT:** Just start by telling us your name and general background so that can include your fields of study, occupations, but just a brief rundown of all of that.

**RAY PEAT:** I first decided to become a teacher and went to a teacher's education college, Southern Oregon College, and intended to maybe become a literature teacher and so I went to the university to get a master's degree and at that time it was, I got my bachelor's degree in 1956 and I thought the university would be a place of relative enlightenment compared to the small town and I found that politics pretty much ruled the University of Oregon at that time in 1956 and so I tried one department after the other, went from an English major to, I tried philosophy for a while and I spent six months as a psychology major and tried a few months as an art history major and finally decided that politics governed all of them. Art history was the freest of political influence, but I wasn't that interested in it so I found that I could write a thesis on a subject that, if it incorporated different departmental areas, I could get a degree based on that thesis and so I had, as an undergraduate, become interested in William Blake and since he had an interesting philosophical orientation as well as being a poet and a painter, that became the way to integrate what I had been studying into a master's degree and just by chance I was interested in going from my study of Blake and psychology philosophy into applying it to the idea of linguistic biology, bio-linguistics and how the brain makes language and I found that there was a program that would permit a PhD degree to be interdepartmental with philosophy and linguistics as the main areas and so I started this program at Ohio State and there were not many professors sympathetic with the sort of integrated interdepartmental approach that I was interested in, but there was a Swedenborgian college about 45 miles from the university where I found that they needed a biology teacher and that was really how I got more involved in teaching biology and developing my interests, so I was studying linguistics and philosophy at Ohio State and teaching courses that were, the title was physics for biology majors and the new president of the university, it was called Urbana University but it was a very small, formerly church seminary college, the new president was revising it by developing a really interesting curriculum and he said he didn't want physics taught the way he had experienced it and not to teach the standard mechanics as the introduction to forces and fields and so on, he said he wanted his students to be able to understand physical science topics that they read in newspapers and magazines and he wanted to prepare them for majoring in biology, so with that instruction as what the course should be, I decided that the computers were a new cultural phenomenon at that time, so I decided that understanding how information theory works in the brain and in computers would be a good application of physics for biology majors and that the interaction of energy and matter, which is one of the core ideas in physics, that this would make it possible to understand the question of the biological effects of atomic bombs and radioactive fallout, so those were two important ways of organizing the course and as it turned out, the trustees weren't pleased when the students got interested in questioning the government position on the safety of the radioactive fallout from atomic bomb testing and so that job only lasted for a year and that immediately led to the idea of starting a college that would be independent of these extraneous influences of the trustees and their commitments and so I put some advertisements, for example, in the Saturday Review magazine and a professor who had been offered the job to replace me as a biology teacher, Leo Koch, it happened that his lecture, his tryout to be a new biology teacher, his topic was the dangers of radiation and so he was dropped and he and I together went around giving lectures helping to recruit students to start a college that would be owned and controlled by the teachers and the students jointly and so that kept me busy for six or eight years and on my own I kept following up these various lines of biological study until in 1968 I decided to go back to graduate school, the culture had changed somewhat and I felt that I could stay in one department and simply ignore the political impositions that each department had, so I went back to work on a PhD in biology at the University of Oregon.

**RAY PEAT:** As a very little kid, my parents had made the decision that they weren't going to indoctrinate me with anything with religion or politics and they would simply answer my questions and just apparently out of my own inclinations I was interested in how the natural world worked and how my self worked in such things as perceiving and those simple childish urges to figure things out without getting any answers preformed, it turned out that organisms and white organisms and people died became a continuing concern and the resources at that time were for example the family encyclopedias and some of the books of my grandparents and parents old, turn of the century, literature, philosophy, medical books and so on, these were available and so I started reading and found lots of interesting things had been done in biology and physics. I ran across JC Bose in one of the little encyclopedias, an Indian physicist who actually invented wireless communication and he devised instruments to show the reactions of living material to very small stimuli and showed similarities between inorganic substances and organic substances and since I hadn't been given any indoctrination as a little kid this JC Bose's approach to explaining substance and living material seemed very natural to me and that started a line of looking for information in encyclopedias, magazines, anything that was available and around the same time I found good descriptions of some of the early Neolomarchian studies, a professor at I think it was University of Wisconsin named Michael Geyer did some experiments showing that for example he would grind up eyes and inject it into pregnant rabbits and some of the babies would be born with damaged eyeballs, some of them blind and when he bred these offspring with the damaged eyes he found that the trait could be inherited, a damage or blindness would be passed on from the treatment and so seeing a lot of that evidence that was in the encyclopedias and standard publications I realized that the biology that was showing up in the textbooks and schools was a very doctrinaire anti-scientific position so it led me to wonder where this natural selection neo-Darwinian genetic absolute inheritance of a fixed trait came from and so that involved studying the culture and philosophy influencing science and so in simply trying to understand the world practically it involved running into people who were selling something with their constructed facts.

**RAY PEAT:** My very first experience with going to school we had moved to Grants Pass or a small country school outside of Grants Pass and my first reaction to the second grade teachers I was already skeptical. I had seen stuff in books at home that made me doubt what I was being taught and then in the country school where I went to third to fifth grade there were at first eight grades and then six grades in a one-room schoolhouse and so I could hear what was being taught to all of the different grades and that was a very pleasant schooling experience. The teacher had a very open attitude, wasn't imposing anything, had some of us learn oil painting and then going back to the city schools again I had a very oppressed feeling and for example in the seventh grade in 1948 they had a student mock election and I think my brother was the only one in the school to vote for Strom Thurmond just because he wanted to be annoying and I voted for Henry Wallace and in my social science class I was arguing for why Henry Wallace would be a good candidate because he wasn't for war and I wanted to keep the economy going and so one of my classmates asked the teacher since they're talking about having capital punishment for communists are they going to kill Raymond? The teacher said no I don't think they will he's a nice little boy but basically I considered most of the high school teachers to be either prisoners of the system, there were several really nice teachers who communicated tolerance and such and then there were the disgruntled Hitlerites and the standard middle class fascist minded people so I was eager to try out college and at Southern Oregon College after I'd been there for I guess two or three terms I was having a bad reaction to several of my classes and heard about Arthur Kreisman a Jewish literature teacher who he had had an offer to teach at Harvard but preferred the relaxed atmosphere of Ashland and the very small college atmosphere and he was sort of an eye opening experience to he took a philosophical cultural approach to everything he taught and so after taking his world literature survey I signed up for some of his philosophy classes and a comparative religion class and he was the college was so small he was able to teach many different subjects and even though he was the main focus of my undergraduate education people had told me that there would be other people like him at the big university and so I was eager to to start there. I graduated when I was 19 and getting to the University of Oregon I found that it was much more of a narrow minded tuned in to the political situation not the backwater tolerance of the little teacher education school and so then I essentially dropped out of the whole thing dropping out of four different departments and looking for some outlet which for a time it seemed to be this interdepartmental program at Ohio State. The outcome of my PhD program at Ohio State was that I intended to go work somewhere else while I finished my dissertation because I had finished the course requirement and I kept working on the bio linguistics approach as I did the Blake College project and about the time I was thinking of going back to Ohio State almost the whole humanities faculty resigned in protest to the president of universities expulsion of the student for having Gus Hall speak at his house. So that was the end of my Ohio State thesis project.

**RAY PEAT:** Even though I... I... had......several experiences as a teacher. For example, teaching high school in the San Diego area. I found that the newly hired teachers in the......one of the area high schools that had just been created......all of the teachers were lively and we enjoyed talking in the teacher's room. And the other high schools that had been established over the years......the teachers all seemed to be in a depressed, semi-hypnotic state. Just unwilling or unable to get interested in anything......in their office free time in the teacher's room. They would just want to gripe about conditions and so on. But in the new school, where the teachers hadn't been around the system for very long, everyone was lively. And after three or four months, I saw the new teachers who had been lively......starting to become depressed and dull. By the end of that year, they were pretty much like the teachers in the other schools. And I realized that it was very hard to continue functioning......in the system, doing what the system told you to. When Blake College in Mexico ended, I went to teach at the University of Montana for a year. And having designed my own courses, not only at Urbana in biology and physics......but at Blake College, the idea of inventing courses to suit the needs of each student. That guided the way I designed the linguistics courses at Montana. And I found that I could meet the definition of the course according to the college catalog......what the content should include. But I could still do it in a way that didn't deaden either me or the students. For example, there were textbooks that were chosen by the department. And so I would go through the textbook, class by class......and show what I thought was wrong with the approach in the textbook. So that I didn't repeat anything that was being taught in the text......other than as something to offer perspectives on.
