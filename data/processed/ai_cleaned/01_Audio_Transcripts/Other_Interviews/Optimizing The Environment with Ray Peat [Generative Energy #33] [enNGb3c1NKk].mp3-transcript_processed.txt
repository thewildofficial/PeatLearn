**RAY PEAT:** The progesterone prevents the energy from disintegrating you. It's one of the most powerful stabilizers. Carbon dioxide has a similar structurally stabilizing effect. And then that creates the unified system which can respond in a unified and directional way.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the role of progesterone in individual development and its stabilizing effect.

**RAY PEAT:** Lauchetti's principle that a system adjusts in ways which restore a disturbed equilibrium is behind this idea. Every part of the flow can be seen as a disequilibrium, and the complexification of the structure tends to absorb the disturbing energy. So, like, the more energy, the more complex. When that's interfered with, that's, I guess, when the... health problems start to form or the structure becomes imperfect. We're always having a flow of energy. That flow itself is disturbing the equilibrium and it's tending to absorb energy and turn it into structure. Anytime you flow energy through a system, it is creative and creates structure and the particularities of the structure that forms under that response to Le Chatelier's principle. Structure is always going to form but it has the option to take on different shapes according to the shape of the stress that you're putting on the system.

**CONTEXT:** The host is exploring the concept of energy inducing complexity and its relation to health problems, referencing Le Chatelier's principle.

**RAY PEAT:** There is a new young physicist who I don't know if he's still at MIT, but he was working there, Jeremy England, who has been demonstrating basically the fact that the universe isn't controlled by the second law of thermodynamics. He says that if you start with a random clump of atoms and shine light on it long enough, it shouldn't be surprising that you end up with a plant. That is something that ever since Le Chatelier and Vernadsky, basically it's restating what Vernadsky said that the sun generates large-brained animals, basically. And in Jeremy England's phrase, if you create a plant by shining light on random atoms, if you shine enough, brighten enough light, you'll eventually get... large-brained mammals, because the ordering principle of a directed flow of energy is going to create a complexity, and whatever the surrounding conditions are where you're disturbing the equilibrium, it's going to conform to those boundary conditions, so it will take a shape responding to everything in the environment, but it's the flow of energy, which is responsible for the growing complexity.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the idea of energy inducing complexity, referencing Vernadsky and Jeremy England's work.

**RAY PEAT:** The natural tendency of things to have dinosaurs grow up to a huge size and then mammals come in and grow bigger brains. Those are basically guided just by the surrounding competitive innovations of matter. The sun and the internal energy of the Earth are supplying the streaming energy and then the shape, particular shape that things take is a reflection of who else is around absorbing that energy. So plants come up and if the Earth is warm, the plants will come up. They make not only carbohydrates, but will make saturated fats and the expanding brains of the contemporary animals eating those plants with saturated fats will thrive integrating the saturated fats into their brain. But if for some reason the big brained move into a cold climate and eat plants that are defending against freezing, they'll start ingesting polyunsaturated fats into their brain and their brains will suffer and be limited in proportion to how much of the cold climate polyunsaturated fats get into their brains so that creates accelerated aging and lots of other problems. So if everyone had stayed put we might have just been on a straight line to a very happy big-brained population eating nice tropical oily fruits, but besides the going off into very unhospitable environments at the poles, under those tense circumstances people started exploiting each other instead of having more or less egalitarian situation of the tribes in a very favorable climate they started getting competitive and creating control situations where some people would work as slaves so that a few people could have a better life and the authoritarian war-like sadistic cultures reflect the distorting power of scarcity, natural scarcity and natural competition then you if those populations survive they tend to conquer and become dominant and as they become a unified authoritarian civilization in the temperate zones then they will in various ways create ideologies that justify what they're doing ideologies of basically caste systems slavery and competition and you'll come up with the idea of competition and survival of the fittest and then those applying those ideas various forms of education and advertising and indoctrination will expand and and complexify those authoritarian exploitative processes so it's just like altered the course of human history by singing the praises of competition and things like that.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about how societal structures and ideologies reflect energy and environmental influences, and whether individual control is paramount.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's just a matter of being able to step back from the culture in one of these authoritarian societies when someone steps back and questions, they tend to get kicked out and have to go look for some other tribe to belong to because the authoritarians don't tolerate questioning and opposition. They indoctrinate everyone that competition is good, but they do everything to eliminate competition. So the ideology of the United States has been competitive free enterprise. I used to say the basic business in reality has been the elimination of competition using government whenever possible to eliminate the competition, but also forming organizations, non-competitive, anti-competitive systems economically.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing cooperation and the paradox of individual liberty versus community equality, and the host is asking about the misrepresentation of communist ideas.

**RAY PEAT:** About 65 years ago, I saw a book called Communism and Christianity, and I don't have any idea who wrote it, but it was observing that Marx's basic ideas apparently came from Christian ethics. And if you take Christian ethics seriously, then you start thinking like Marx, or at least the anarchists or communitarians of the 19th century. You think, if those ethics are valid, what can we do to observe them?

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the ethical underpinnings of political ideologies.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you look at the do unto others ethic, and then you look without a Darwinian bias, you know, Darwin believed that everything English was superior, that English plants even would displace the species when they were transplanted the way the superior English men would displace other races of people because of the natural superiority of everything English. If you can get away from that fairly psychotic view of biology and actually look at the behavior of squirrels or mice, any birds in general, they all are aware of their surroundings and are inclined to be altruistic and benevolent, not destructive and aggressive. Aggression is a very peculiar and unusual part of the behavior in most species. When their intelligence is allowed to act, they make it obvious that they are experiencing empathy even with different species, but especially with their own species.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for clarification on ethical concepts and the nature of cooperation.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that is just a story that has been invented to put down the do-gooders. There have been people who were supported by big corporations and or governments to write popular stories, to make movies, to illustrate that. Ronald Reagan got his... ideology from some of these political fictions that promoted that idea, anti-Dickens approach to society... on your hands, and you'd have a bunch of Americans that were destitute, and so it's just the idea of the government being the problem, but if you get rid of the government programs, you're immediately in this worse position if you do that. Well, if you do that, a bunch of corporations will disappear, and rich people will be desperate to find a new way to undo that, because the corporations... are constantly being defended by government power. Police and armies are there to make the corporate ruling class stable and secure, and they talk about the welfare of keeping people from starving, but it's the government that is keeping them poor that creates the starvation by following the rules of whatever the corporations want to write into the... economic system. Every aspect of the culture has been designed to favor corporate exploitation, and the poverty expands in proportion to the power of corporations over government. So the story that people need welfare to prevent starvation, that's a very downstream part of the story. First you create the starvation, and then you decide whether to alleviate it slightly.

**CONTEXT:** The host is playing devil's advocate regarding government intervention like welfare programs.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just the rules regarding corporations and labor unions, for example. The unions have very restrictive things that they can do collectively. Corporations now have absolutely no restrictions. They can spend whatever they want. controlling political information. Just the organizational rules that are built into the system, removing those would make a tremendous difference. The whole structure, any structure we can see, is there for the purpose of exploitation and the alleviation of the suffering is just a wave. Preventing hysterical uprisings here and there.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the concept of structural violence and its relation to societal stress, shame, and discrimination.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, when Martin Luther King said that white people are being exploited and sent to kill foreigners for the good of the corporate class. That was very antagonistic to the military and corporate factions and led to his being killed. Anytime someone suggests even moderate approaches to changing the system, they suffer violence. They don't have to propose violence. He was absolutely against violence from either side. But no matter how much you advocate non-violence, you're going to experience it if you do anything that threatens the system.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if violence is ever necessary in response to systemic oppression.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, progesterone keeps the progesterone, oxygen and carbon dioxide towards an ideal for as long as you can supply all of those things together. Because women naturally have more progesterone than men.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about hormonal imprinting and the potential for cells to "learn" or replicate proteins.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think at six months of gestation is there we're the most pedomorphic and then that tapers off. It sets up a pattern of tapering off and predicting how much of a crocodile or primate you're going to be. If you were very early deprived, you're going to be an eating machine more than an experiencing machine.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the concepts of ontogeny, phylogeny, pedomorphism, and juvenileization.

**RAY PEAT:** In 1946, I think it was, that I read Ashley Montague on the biological superiority of women, sometime in the late 40s. I've been conscious of that ever since and thought of myself as a feminist until the Gloria Steinem CIA brand of feminism came on the scene. I was shocked. I saw the video of her talking about her CIA operative days. And I wonder how many so-called feminists are aware of that, you know, and how this institution was using feminism in some way to their advantage, you know. To expand the labor market to lower wages was a basic function. And some people were saying to destroy the... basic nuclear family. Make everyone cheap labor. That's the basic purpose. To as peacefully as possible dispose of the excess population that isn't needed to run the factories. And so with automation, the population excess is going to be a higher and higher percentage of existing people. And so fewer and fewer people will have authorization to live.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about women's unique place in society and the historical context of feminism.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's the same thing, Le Chatelier. And Vernadsky, the energy available to flow through the system is extremely intense in the first processes away from the ovum. The oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose are generously available. Your demand is small because you're only a few cells big, so you can suck up the environment at it. Terrific rate a thousand times faster than when you get bigger and so the environment is just pretty ideal until you get up to about the size of a peanut and then the environmental limitations start being felt. So the aeromorphosis processes where flowing energy generates complexity. That energy is right zooming through your processing system producing a huge head and eyes. Then you start running into what your mother didn't eat and finding the need to specialize and limit your development. So you start out inventing future species trying out what the simple flow of energy does to your cells. And it expands you as a knowing being and then as you run into the limits you start adapting to those limits and the worse your mother's condition is the more you become prematurely adultified.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the concepts of ontogeny, phylogeny, pedomorphism, and juvenileization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think at six months of gestation is there we're the most pedomorphic and then that tapers off. It sets up a pattern of tapering off and predicting how much of a crocodile or primate you're going to be. If you were very early deprived, you're going to be an eating machine more than an experiencing machine.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if puberty marks a major landmark in aging and if pre-puberty is a more evolved physiological state.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the deep sleep doesn't necessarily involve dreams. If something is disturbing you, then you'll try to work it out in the dreams just the same way you work things out in reality. And when the dream catches some emotional energy, if you can remember that and become anxious with it, the dream can make the emotional energy available to you during the day to work out parts of reality that need work on.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the significance of dreaming, particularly in relation to hypothyroidism and processing trauma.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the animal intelligence is always there, offering itself, and our daily cultural consciousness is distracting us from watching. I see it like a set of projectors that are working with resources from inner body senses and stored images. Body is projecting possibilities, trying to bring them to your attention. For you to work on consciously, but ordinarily the consciousness that tries to handle those intrinsic body deliveries to your awareness, the consciousness tends to stop the process or deform it. So I think a kind of passive attitude towards watching what your body is trying to do is similar to watching what ants or birds or other animals are trying to express. Treat your body as if it was a bit of nature and watch what it's trying to tell you to do.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if dreaming is part of innate animal intelligence versus cultural conditioning.

**RAY PEAT:** You can... have a tremendous amount of energy in the passivity, but it's passivity in relation to the fictional character, like the role society tells us to play. It's like a fictional role in a melodrama. If you detach yourself from that cultural self, then the passivity actually gains energy that you can... appreciate the full intensity of the problem you're confronting.

**CONTEXT:** The host is describing their own tendency towards an aggressive approach to problems and asking for alternatives to foster a more receptive state.

**RAY PEAT:** Being around people who are open to consideration of actual parts of reality, I think that's a very powerful part of our nervous system is how we feel ourselves resonate. With other people the way Jeremy England says shining light on a random clump of atoms will produce an organism if you have a random clump of people the natural process of Resonance is going to create interesting things So anything that you can do by yourself happens more Intensely there's more freedom to become yourself when you can resonate with other people for example people have put brain cells isolated from a brain put them in a culture dish and feed them for a few days they start vibrating together they learn to act like a brain and if you put people together without pressure and demands from the outside they will come up with solutions that would be sort of an ideology that you can expect more intelligent solutions to come. Out of a group of people than any individual trying to impose an ideology.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for other activities besides the arts that foster a sense of openness and connection.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so the culture has taught people that their self that they need to to concentrate on is this fictional role like their their caste position social position and I think realizing that that culture that tells you who you are. It's also killing you. I think that's an essential starting point that you want to be able to get together with other people who are aware of the hostile nature of our bigger society. So it's essential to have a group in some capacity to put the ideas into action.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if focusing on personal change can create a ripple effect in society, referencing Tolstoy's quote about changing the world versus changing oneself.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so and the traditional ways of organizing are now being monitored so carefully that they can shoot them down. The moment they start to take effect. So I think the weariness of the culture is the most infectious thing that can precede organization if the recognition that medicine is mostly harming people and that the foods are leading to an early diseased death. That sort of suspicion of the system and rejection of the system. I think is what can spread and precede the actual search for what to do next.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the challenges of organizing and the potential for societal weariness to precede action.

**RAY PEAT:** The ultimate goal should be something on the order of gathering culture, not hunting and gathering, but having such a fruitful environment that we can just pick what we need, have milk goats or milk cows and fruit trays so abundant. That seems like the immediate way to satisfy your needs rather than going off and stealing someone's hoard of soybeans or whatever.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the ultimate goal of societal organization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the government and the corporations are enforcing those things. Ivan Illich studied them in good detail, how medicine and schooling are enslaving people and harming them. I think one of the elements of schooling that he said was the worst aspect was the compulsory need to be taught. So disengaging somebody's autonomy and ability to learn by themselves.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about three things that would move society in a good direction: deleting medicine, the legal system, and education.

**RAY PEAT:** The whole education system, structurally, the way they define excellence has... been a big part of the mental enslavement. When I first went to college, my second year, I came across a professor who was for a little state college. He was unusual. At the time, I took literature from him. He was teaching five different departmental subjects, and I saw a letter he received from a dean at Harvard inviting him to come there to teach literature. But he enjoyed teaching comparative religion, contemporary philosophy, German literature, English literature, and occasional other subjects. He was an excellent teacher in everything he taught, but he didn't want to be limited to an English department. And one of my friends in Mexico, at the time he was teaching anthropology at Lake College, he was teaching at... I think it was 11 different universities in half a dozen different subjects, Latin, forensic medicine, history, various branches of history, all sorts of anthropology and archaeology, geography, and considered outstanding in every field. The fact is that when you can teach a subject other than what you've been taught, especially psychology. You're going to teach that subject probably better than someone who has drilled in it for 10 years. I would regularly encounter people in San Francisco that studied medicine and not that I have any idea what I'm talking about, but I could never have a normal conversation with them and I'm passionate about the subject so you think I might be able to.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the structure of education and the definition of excellence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and Gabor Maté was an English major. I think he's a good example. Before he studied medicine and taught high school English, if you know one subject to a pretty saturated degree and then approach another one, you learn the essential way to get at that subject. And someone who is teaching in the five departments can make each one more valuable than someone who teaches a single subject all their life. They're more equipped to teach those subjects with their systems thinking.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing Marx's idea of multifaceted individuals and Gabor Maté's background.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's that same thing, Le Chatelier. And Vernadsky, the energy available to flow through the system is extremely intense in the first processes away from the ovum. The oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose are generously available. Your demand is small because you're only a few cells big, so you can suck up the environment at it.

And it expands you as a knowing being and then as you run into the limits you start adapting to those limits and the worse your mother's condition is the more you become prematurely adultified.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for an explanation of ontogeny, phylogeny, pedomorphism, and juvenileization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think at six months of gestation is there we're the most pedomorphic and then that tapers off. It sets up a pattern of tapering off and predicting how much of a crocodile or primate you're going to be. If you were very early deprived, you're going to be an eating machine more than an experiencing machine.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if puberty marks a major landmark in aging and if pre-puberty is a more evolved physiological state.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, progesterone keeps the progesterone, oxygen and carbon dioxide towards an ideal for as long as you can supply all of those things together. Because women naturally have more progesterone than men.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about progesterone's role in long-range thinking and women's societal position.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's the same thing, Le Chatelier. And Vernadsky, the energy available to flow through the system is extremely intense in the first processes away from the ovum. The oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose are generously available. Your demand is small because you're only a few cells big, so you can suck up the environment at it.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about progesterone's role in long-range thinking and women's societal position.

**RAY PEAT:** The deprivation of sugar, carbon dioxide. Progesterone, thyroid and possibility of life opportunities.

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the increasing prevalence of autism and its potential causes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, many things are deficient. Breastfeeding is deficient. Prenatal happiness. It is deficient. Security of both father and mother before conception is deficient. Our culture is creating deficiencies of everything good and autism is an increasingly epidemic expression of Deprivation.

**CONTEXT:** The host is referencing Dr. Cannell's work on vitamin D deficiency and autism, asking for Ray Peat's perspective.
