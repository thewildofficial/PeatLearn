**RAY PEAT:** "The female hormones, actually progesterone, is a basic... stabilizing factor. It's historically considered a pregnancy hormone, but it's essential for brain function in both men and women. The concentration in the brain of progesterone is about 10 times higher than in the blood."
**CONTEXT:** Tucker Goodrich discusses the role of progesterone in brain function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress induces estrogen, which again isn't the female hormone as it's been advertised now for about 70 years. It's actually a stress hormone. If a man is injured, or if a woman is injured, or if a man is injured, or if a woman is injured, has a heart attack, or is very sick and old, his estrogen is going to be as high as a woman's or higher. So it's a stress and aging indicator or hormone, definitely not a fertility hormone."
**CONTEXT:** Tucker Goodrich discusses the role of estrogen, and Ray Peat clarifies its function as a stress hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1930s, estrogen was already identified. As a promoter of miscarriage or abortion and inflammation and cancer, despite that the estrogen industry by the early 1940s discovered that almost anything toxic turns out to have an estrogenic effect, and so it, for example, you can extract about a thousand different estrogenic substances from soot, and so the industry found a very cheap, almost so cheap you could hardly identify a cost, a substance which is estrogenic, and began selling it as the female fertility pregnancy protecting. Hormone estrogen convinced the FDA and other regulatory agencies that it was an appropriate treatment for pregnant women, aging women to prevent aging and so on. The first two hundred ailments or more that estrogen was sold. To treat all turned out to be fraudulent. But they made many billions of dollars in the process, so they changed medical schools, medical journals, the whole national consciousness to sell their fraudulent scheme or project."
**CONTEXT:** Tucker Goodrich describes the historical marketing of estrogen, and Ray Peat elaborates on its fraudulent promotion.

**RAY PEAT:** "I started out in Mexico looking at the reason for malnutrition and poverty was a major thing. So I started thinking about the cost of foods and what was most easily available and started looking around the health of populations around the world and what they were eating and what was economically available to correct their problems. Oh, refined grains, for example, seemed to be a major problem when the traditional Mexican diet of tortillas and vegetables and small amounts of crustaceans, when that diet was replaced by the Spanish. Refined cereal-based diet and meats, for example, the nutritional deficiency diseases started showing up."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about his transition into nutrition, and he explains his early observations on malnutrition and the impact of refined grains.

**RAY PEAT:** "So I looked at what the traditional diets were doing, and the lime processing using either calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide from ashes. to soak the corn kernels in to pre-cook them in this strong alkali solution. It changes the chemistry. For example, decreases the tryptophanes, turns it into niacin, and makes the starch and toxic proteins digestible and harmless. Simply, their traditional process of the way they cooked their corn turned it from a toxin to an actually beneficial food rich in calcium, niacin, and other essential nutrients."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the traditional Mexican diet, and Ray Peat explains the benefits of the nixtamalization process for corn.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the southern U.S., where they imported corn from Mexico but didn't widely. Use the alkali process harmony is the safe form of corn cooked in lime but when they didn't make their corn into harmony they got pellagra yes terrible very nasty disease of niacin deficiency niacin is. Vitamin b6 if I remember correctly Yeah with an excess of leucine one of the excess amino acids in corn right Yes, interesting interesting"
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions pellagra in the southern US, and Ray Peat explains its connection to niacin deficiency and the lack of alkali processing of corn.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many years ago, I was hearing dieticians talk about the … glycemic index of foods, and right in their own tables, they showed that starches had a higher glycemic index than sucrose. And that started me thinking about the difference between starch and sucrose. Sucrose consists of 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, where starch is … when you assimilate it, it's pure glucose, and glucose stimulates insulin, turning on fat production and lowering your blood glucose unless you have a steady intake of it, where the fructose component either doesn't stimulate insulin or even can have a restraining influence on insulin. And so intrinsically, the reason sugar has lower glycemic index than starch is that the fructose component restricts insulin and restrains fat synthesis and so stabilizes blood sugar."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Ray Peat's view on sugar, and he explains the metabolic differences between starch and sucrose, highlighting fructose's role in moderating insulin.

**RAY PEAT:** "And so the fruit goes in with a slightly insulin-moderating fructose content and also the simultaneous slates of potassium, which takes care of absorbing the glucose without needing to secrete insulin. And so it... it has these surprising ways of bypassing the insulin problem or what's related to diabetes."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the benefits of fruit, and Ray Peat explains how fructose and potassium in fruit can help manage blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "And I ran across two 19th century doctors, one in Paris and one in following up in England, who... the one in Paris was the first to observe that... a high-sugar diet cured his terminal diabetic patients, originally diabetes, because you couldn't assimilate glucose. You turned your protein of your tissues into glucose to survive, and so the diabetic wasted away, lost their muscles. And finally, died in essentially a starvation condition. The doctor in France gave his terminal diabetic patients who were wasting away the amount of sugar they craved and found that they stopped wasting away and very quickly started building muscle when they were eating. A regular diet, milk, beef, fruits and vegetables, and so on, but along with a sugar supplement. So the doctor in England did exactly the same thing and described the course of people who were dying, wasting away, putting out tremendous amounts of sugar in their urine, even though they weren't eating any. They were restricted because they called diabetes the sugar disease, so they were torturing their patients by not letting them have any of the sugar that they craved, but he decided not to torture his patients and let them add as much sugar as they wanted to their diet. Suddenly, they stopped putting glucose into urine. They stopped losing muscle and recovered very quickly."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the historical use of sugar for diabetes, and Ray Peat recounts the findings of 19th-century doctors who used sugar to treat terminal diabetic patients.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it turns off the cortisol which breaks down your tissue protein to make sugar out of it, or the sugar equivalent."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if sugar intake spares the liver from producing glucose, and Ray Peat explains how it reduces cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** "And same thing happens in cancer. The myth has developed that sugar feeds cancer. It's true in a sense, but the cancer sends out signals such as ammonia to the body that needs sugar if you don't have sugar in your diet. And the... body turns on extreme amounts of cortisol, providing sugar by breaking down your immune system, muscles and skin, all of your tissues, except the brain and lungs and heart are preserved. But the cancer causes catexia or the wasting disease as the main killer. And that's what we're going to talk about in this video. If you simply give the body a large amount of glucose or sugar of any sort, that will reduce the production of cortisol and stop the destruction of the body tissue or at least slow it. So diabetes and cancer have that in common, that they involve the stress, which is a major high cortisol-induced loss of active body tissue to provide the glucose, which is essential for the brain to survive."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about sugar and cancer, and Ray Peat explains how sugar can be beneficial in cancer by reducing cortisol and preventing cachexia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Are both diabetes and cancer driven a lot by the overconsumption of the PUFAs? Exactly. The PUFA, the... the number of unsaturated groups in the molecule, the more highly polyunsaturated the fat is, the more double bonds there are in the molecule. And exactly in proportion to the number of double bonds, the interference with thyroid function increases, so the... Enzymes that release thyroid from the gland are inhibited by the highly unsaturated fatty acids. The proteins that carry thyroid hormone in the blood, the thyroid is displaced competitively by the highly unsaturated fatty acids, exactly in proportion to the number of double bonds. And the... cells, tissue cells ability to respond to the thyroid hormone that they do receive is blocked in proportion to the number of double bonds. So it's every known step of thyroid activity which is needed to produce oxidative energy and it's that exactly which fails in diabetes and cancer so that you lose. Oxidative energy production from glucose and the fatty acids it's in the 1960s research showed that as your free fatty acids in the blood go up from stress from the need for more sugar in your diet. The increase of free fatty acids blocks. exactly the ability to use and oxidize glucose. Apparently the basic survival function of that which is called the Randall cycle, the biological function is probably to stop the use of glucose in your massive skeletal muscles and dispensable tissues, skin and muscles in particular, saving whatever glucose is available for use by the brain, heart and lungs. But as the pre-fatty acids in the blood rise, then even the ability of the heart and lungs in the brain to use it. Glucose for energy decreases, and that's especially true if the pre-fatty acids are highly unsaturated because they are increasingly toxic to the mitochondria in proportion to their instability and high unsaturation."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if diabetes and cancer are driven by PUFA consumption, and Ray Peat explains how PUFAs interfere with thyroid function and glucose metabolism at every step.

**RAY PEAT:** "During his talk in that video, he quickly shows many references in the background. And I looked up all of the references that I could read and found that they supported my argument as much as they did his. And for example, he described fructose as a poison similar to ethyl alcohol. In fact, if you're poisoned, you're going to be poisoned for the rest of your life. By an overdose of ethanol, if you're very, very drunk, the antitoxin or the antidote to alcohol poisoning is fructose. It exactly reverses the changes inside the cells caused by alcohol. So he was right about alcohol being a metabolic poison. He was exactly wrong by saying it's like fructose. Fructose is the antidote to the alcohol effect."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Lustig's views on fructose, and Ray Peat refutes the comparison of fructose to alcohol, explaining that fructose is an antidote to alcohol poisoning.

**RAY PEAT:** "PUFA seems to be a metabolic mitochondrial toxin to the effect that I Mean, there's some there's some argument that your mitochondria actually prefer to burn it to get rid of it It seems to be toxic to the extent that it alters the mitic and composition which makes it more susceptible to oxidative damage and this breaks down the electron transport chain impairing mitochondrial function especially the ability to process glucose so you know if you know that that's basically the mechanism that I've seen that describes what Dr. Pete is talking about."
**CONTEXT:** Tucker Goodrich explains how PUFAs act as mitochondrial toxins, impairing function and glucose processing.

**RAY PEAT:** "It used to be 40 or 50 years ago there was the absolute doctrine dogma that diabetes was a genetic disease almost 100% caused by genes and the new immigrants after the formation of Israel Israel had an extremely high incidence of diabetes. Somewhat higher than the European countries the immigrants had come from, and the dogma persisted that they simply had the genes for being diabetic. But then immigrants to Israel from the African countries, these people were very genetically different. And had no diabetes at all when they moved into the new country. But they soon took up the European diet that the diabetics were eating. And their children all had the European high incidence of diabetes, totally disproving the genetic causation. The polyunsaturated fats were high in the European diet and had been very low in the African immigrants until they moved."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the genetic basis of diabetes, and Ray Peat uses the example of Israeli immigrants to disprove the genetic theory and highlight the role of diet, specifically PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the same as the two 19th century doctors. Uh, it's all a matter of, uh, revising your thinking, uh, realizing that the, uh, unsaturated fats, uh, are the cause, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, getting rid of them in the diet as far as possible. Uh, and then, uh, uh, returning to a, uh, a more, uh, a traditional, uh, uh, diet, uh, of carbohydrates, uh, and moderate amounts of protein. Uh, from a variety of sources."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about promising treatments for diabetes and cancer, and Ray Peat reiterates the importance of eliminating unsaturated fats and returning to a traditional diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the minerals are extremely important in a less refined diet. There, there was a lot of magnesium and calcium, uh, uh, vegetable greens. If they're cooked. Uh, provide both lots of magnesium and calcium and, uh, the cows and goats that live primarily on leafy greens, uh, uh, process, uh, uh, their rumen, uh, ferment, uh, and predigest, uh, the, uh, greens, uh, which are high in PUFA, but, but they, uh, uh, the bacteria in their rumen destroys about 97% of the PUFA, uh, uh, so you get the very rich, uh, calcium and magnesium content in their milk, uh, uh, uh, to, to some extent in the meat, but, uh, not nearly as much as in the milk, uh, along with a, a radical, uh, decrease, uh, of the PUFA content. Uh, and, uh, uh, simply getting a very generous amount of these minerals, uh, calcium and magnesium, uh, is, uh, uh, therapeutic not only to diabetes, uh, but to a lot of other conditions."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about minerals, and Ray Peat emphasizes the importance of calcium and magnesium, explaining how dairy products can provide these minerals while reducing PUFA content due to rumen bacteria.

**RAY PEAT:** "Uh, the, uh, there, there's a somewhat mysterious brain disease, uh, that was first seen in Guam, but in... several other regions, uh, uh, uh, that resembles, uh, uh, Lou Gehrig's disease or, uh, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, uh, and Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It, it includes, uh, a combination of all of those symptoms. Uh, and, uh, uh, they have considered various theories about poisons from bacteria and so on. Uh, and, they, thank you. uh, from eating, uh, uh, uh, uh, flying Fox, uh, uh, that had lived on, uh, foods containing those bacteria. And it turns out that what those regions have in common, not the toxins, but they are all regions, very low in calcium, calcium and or magnesium. And in the absence of a large amount of calcium or magnesium in your diet, the brain cells, uh, take up any, uh, uh, positively charged, uh, metal in place of, uh, uh, the, the calcium and magnesium."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about brain diseases seen in Guam, and Ray Peat links them to calcium and magnesium deficiency, explaining how the brain can uptake other metals in their absence.

**RAY PEAT:** "What happens when you're deficient in calcium is your parathyroid land becomes hyperactive, turns off. Almost directly or indirectly, your mitochondrial function decreases your ability to produce energy and lacking energy, cells tend to calcify and the calcium is, in early years, protective molecules. What is ultra-hypertensive? of these de-energized, de-vitalized tissues. But if it continues for a long time, the diet deficiency of calcium leading to hyperparathyroidism and reduced mitochondrial energy leads to eventually destructive levels of calcium in the tissues, such as hardening of the arteries, calcification of the brain, heart valves. kidneys and so on."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the consequences of calcium deficiency, including hyperparathyroidism, reduced mitochondrial function, and calcification of tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** "But in these island regions, they called it Guamanian dementia, because it was discovered on the island of Guam. In the absence of the calcium to such an extent that your parathyroid hormone becomes very high, de-energizing your cells. If your environment has a normal amount of iron, lead, and any of the heavy metals, they will load up to a toxic extent with the heavy metals. And then the heavy metals interact. To catalyze the oxidative breakdown of the PUFA, which are concentrated in the brain. So a calcium deficiency, if you're extremely deficient, you won't even deposit the usual amount of calcium. It'll be replaced by iron deposits or land or whatever other metal is excessive. Copper, molybdenum, and manganese, for example, and aluminum is a major accumulated mineral because it's generally abundant when calcium is deficient."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat further elaborates on the Guamanian dementia, explaining how calcium deficiency, coupled with heavy metals, leads to PUFA oxidation and neurodegeneration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's an essential to making the ketones. The ketones are great if you get them in fruits and potatoes, for example. They work fine as an energy source for heart and brain and so on. But if you have to make them yourself, the way you make them is to break down proteins, which will come necessarily partly from your own tissues, despite the fact that you're eating a lot of protein. The cortisol doesn't care whether it's... exogenous protein or your muscle protein that breaks down. And so when you're starving your tissues for glucose, your brain, lungs and heart are going to get glucose any way it can, which means from protein. And so you break down your own protein or your food protein. And in the process, you have to dispose of the large amount of ammonia released by the protein. That means that you become increasingly dependent on carbon dioxide to combine with the ammonia to make urea and get rid of the potentially toxic ammonia. And if something interferes with your carbon dioxide production... specifically not oxidizing enough glucose, which produces about twice as much CO2 per unit of energy as oxidizing fat, you're creating a situation in which you have these multiple interacting stress factors that generally... at an extreme, it can end up with poisoning your brain with too much ammonia, but always to some extent poisoning your body with too much cortisol breaking down proteins to make the glucose to sustain your brain and lungs and blood system."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about ketogenic diets and cortisol, and Ray Peat explains how endogenous ketone production from protein breakdown can lead to ammonia toxicity and cortisol-induced tissue breakdown.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just looking at the pancreas gland itself, the way back around 1920 people were... thinking of of genetic reasons for the loss of the beta cells in the pancreas that can make insulin. It turns out that we have stem cells in the pancreas constantly replacing. If you kill for whatever reason your beta cells, they are stem cells. Ready to give birth to new insulin producing beta cells and glucose is the sustaining factor for making new stem cells for maintaining the ability to replace the missing insulin producing cells. But free fatty acids are constantly killing the beta cells. So a deficiency of glucose limits the stem cell production and an excess of free fatty acids kills the beta cells faster. That means that you can very quickly activate the stem cells to make new beta cells, and at the same time, you can kill the beta cells faster. By increasing the sugar availability, decrease the free fatty acids which are killing the beta cells and that can account for how these two 19th century doctors so quickly cured terminal diabetics. The pancreas is perfectly willing to repair itself and become non-diabetic. If you just stop killing it with Pufa."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the pancreas and diabetes, and Ray Peat explains how glucose supports beta cell regeneration while PUFAs kill them, highlighting the role of sugar in reversing diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** "That would not be enough? Far from it, I think. At somewhat, well more than 100 grams per day, the healthy amount seems to be up. Above 200 grams of carbohydrate per day, the therapeutic amount that the French and English doctors used was somewhat, a little over half a pound of sugar per day added to a standard diet."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about lower carb diets, and Ray Peat states that 40-50 grams of carbs is insufficient, recommending over 100 grams, with therapeutic amounts exceeding 200 grams of carbohydrate per day.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, they, they probably weren't terminal diabetics. The patients of these 19th century doctors stopped needing the sugar supplement in just two or three weeks. But if someone isn't diabetic and they add that amount of sugar, it's all, uh, uh, unnecessary excise, excess calories. In the case of the diabetics, they were powerfully deficient in calories. And so when they added the half a pound of, of sugar, they were simply making them a calorie, a neutral and, uh, uh, uh, shifted them to an anabolic metabolism that made the calories more efficient for rebuilding muscle. But a person who isn't in that dying state from advanced diabetes always has to attend keeping their calorie intake within their metabolic consumption. Uh, animal experiments show that, uh, shifting to a fruit or sugar-based sucrose-added diet increases, in various studies, increases the metabolic rate by around 20 percent so they can keep their metabolism in a calorie-balanced condition even by adding a moderate amount of sugar. But gaining fat weight means definitely that you're out of balance, taking in too many calories."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about gaining weight from sugar, and Ray Peat explains that for diabetics, sugar supplements were calorie-neutral and anabolic, while for non-diabetics, excess calories lead to weight gain. He also notes that sugar can increase metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the calcium and vitamin D are probably the most powerful weight loss nutrients there are because both of them suppress the inflammatory system and the parathyroid hormone. And the parathyroid hormone suppresses mitochondrial oxidation, and it's a very important part of creates a vicious circle of stress. And the most powerful way to stop that exaggerated parathyroid hormone is to get a lot of calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D in your diet. And that, again, drastically increases your ability to burn calories, produce heat, and not get fat. A low-fat milk. A diet with adequate vitamin D is a very efficient weight loss diet, as well as therapeutic in a variety of other conditions. In fact, probably all of the really dangerous diseases are helped by a diet high in vitamin D. Calcium and magnesium."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about weight loss, and Ray Peat highlights calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D as powerful weight loss nutrients that suppress parathyroid hormone and increase metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it in moderate latitude in Florida. The sun is always within a. A reasonable. Intensity high in the sky during the middle of the day in the northern states, except in the late spring, summer and early fall, even the midday sun is so low in the sky. Not not going to get enough sun. Only in the middle of the day in the summer, late spring and early fall in the northern states, sunbathing is is curative. It takes 30 minutes to an hour of good sun exposure on the majority of your skin to keep your vitamin D level. At least the middle of the range they call normal. That should be something like 50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter To keep your parathyroid hormone under control"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about vitamin D and sunlight, and Ray Peat explains the optimal times and duration for sun exposure to maintain adequate vitamin D levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah. There was a rabbit experiment. They shaved the rabbits and fed one group a PUFA-rich diet, the other one a PUFA-deficient diet, and the ones on a PUFA-deficient diet didn't have sun damage, and they happened to be studying the Rinsling effect. The ones eating a lot of PUFA had so much sun damage, their skin got fragile and wrinkled. And the same thing that causes wrinkling, it's the same process that leads to chronic inflammation and cancer."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between PUFAs, sunburn, and skin cancer, and Ray Peat cites a rabbit experiment showing PUFA-rich diets increase sun damage and skin fragility.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the... the tendency to swelling up burn symptoms and eventually fibrosis and even calcium deposits in extremely damaged skin. It's very common for precancerous and cancerous inflamed cells. to show crystals of calcium forming. Interesting, due to the body's inability to properly process calcium."
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions fibrosis and calcium deposits in damaged skin, and Ray Peat links these to precancerous and cancerous cells and impaired calcium processing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, vitamin D and calcium help that along. They are contradictory to the PUFA effect. I used to sunburn just ridiculously easy. Just driving with tinted windows in a bright sunny area in the desert, for example, I would get horribly sunburned right through the windows and five minutes in the midday sunlight in Mexico, and I would have a lobster looking skin color. But after supplementing. Vitamin D, getting lots of milk in my diet and avoiding Pufa as completely as possible. The last time I was in Mexico, I was able to work the whole day at about 7,500 feet altitude. Extremely intense ultraviolet, no burning at all."
**CONTEXT:** The host shares their experience with reduced sunburn susceptibility after adopting a low-PUFA diet and supplementing with vitamin D and calcium, and Ray Peat confirms this is contradictory to the PUFA effect.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, the pasteurizing does slightly lower the vitamin content and so on, so it's still... just about the best food available, even when it's not well-treated. But if you have a problem with one brand of milk, I found that the taste of the milk is a good indicator of how easy it is on your digestion. But some people do react probably to the way they've added the vitamin A and D. They use an emulsifier, and some of the emulsifiers might cause digestive problems. But if you try different brands, you can usually find some kind of milk that agrees with your digestive system. And if you haven't been a milk drinker, it's important to start with, for example, half a glass with each meal, and then gradually build up over... a few weeks, because it takes time to induce enzymes, such as lactase, in your intestine. Even lactose intolerant people, if they go at it gradually, can induce the enzymes needed to break down lactose."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pasteurized milk, and Ray Peat states that while pasteurization slightly reduces vitamin content, it's still a good food. He advises on finding a palatable brand and gradually introducing milk to build lactase enzymes.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. If I had a good clean source, a lot of even commercial dairies don't wash the udders of the cow before they milk it. When we had a cow at home, we always carefully sponge off the udder to get rid of the dandruff. We were careful to wash the cow with non- preservative water, so we could keep the udders in a fresh place. and the dirt might be possible to get into the milk, but lots of dairies don't do proper hygiene with their cows."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Ray Peat seeks out raw milk, and he explains that he doesn't, citing hygiene concerns with commercial dairies.

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on how active they are, nowadays kids are more likely to drink full-fat milk. be watching their computer or telephones than doing active calorie burning, so I think usually one or two percent fat content is good even for kids. Even a dairy country where people are working vigorously eight or ten hours a day. Then full fat milk is very appropriate because they need the calories and will burn them. Very often people who drink whole milk and have a sedentary way of life are going to get fat."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about milk fat content for children, and Ray Peat advises lower fat milk for sedentary children and full-fat milk for active individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the overlooked things that exercise does... If you're working, for example, you don't have to think of exercising if you're moving bales of hay or milking a cow or whatever. One of the overlooked things is that muscle activity increases your body temperature and the increased body temperature increases your calorie burning. And so it's similar to what thyroid supplementing does, the good body warming effect of physical activity keeps your metabolic rate going with an anti-inflammatory effect. If you're sedentary, your body's temperature falls and you go into a pro-inflammatory state. Of course, exercise also upregulates your resistance to oxidative stress, which from my understanding of that term is generally what it means in practice is a toxic effect of omega-6 fat breakdown. Exercise increases your ability to detoxify omega-6 fats in the body and their metabolites. Body temperature is very powerful. In reducing lipid peroxidation, for example, higher body temperature lowers inflammation and lowers lipid peroxidation, makes you oxidize properly rather than oxidizing fats that shouldn't be oxidized."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about exercise and obesity, and Ray Peat explains how muscle activity increases body temperature, boosting metabolism and reducing inflammation and lipid peroxidation.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's the number of double bonds, and the fish oil is extremely rich in five and six double bonds, or the seed oil, and minus three, and minus six vegetable oils typically have two double bonds. Those are sufficiently toxic, but when you get five or six double bonds in a molecule, the instability is that much greater. The anti-saturate effect of the fish oil, very highly unsaturated, is that much greater than the seed oil. But the good thing is that they are so unstable. That a large part of them breaks down before they even circulate to your tissues. And it's the breakdown products, the oxidation fragments of the N-3 fish oil type of PUFA that has the so-called anti-inflammatory effect. It's toxic. To your immune system to the extent that for the first few months you can see a definite anti-inflammatory effect by interfering with things such as prostaglandin synthesis and some of the inflammatory cytokines and breaking down thymus cells that could be involved in inflammation. But the trouble is that prolonged use, after about six months, this anti-inflammatory effect starts becoming immunosuppressive and over a lifetime the amount of the long-chain highly unsaturated M-3 accumulates. Stabilized to some extent by forming an ester with cholesterol molecules. And that happens in atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries. And then when it does oxidize, forming an aged pigment-like material in your arteries, that's part of the buildup. of the high cholesterol-containing plaque, but it's the PUFA esters that start the process of forming aged pigment and or arterial plaques. But that process continues in the brain so that the old person's brain has much more fish oil-like molecules. The baby's brain. Any healthy pregnancy delivers a baby who is, according to the dieticians, deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids. Their brain, their body is burning calories at two or three times the rate of an older individual and their brain is learning at several times a higher rate than an adult. In the teens, the metabolic rate slows drastically in proportion to how much unsaturated fat is in your diet, turning down your metabolic rate, but with aging, these anti-metabolic fish oil like M-3 fats build up steadily in the brain. People are talking about them as being necessary because they find so much of them in the brain but in late development fetus just before delivery and right after delivery, healthy babies are extremely deficient in all of the PUFA and the brain function corresponds negatively to the amount of PUFA esters of cholesterol in the brain. So the actual available cholesterol decreases in the aging and de-menting brain. The cholesterol which is needed to make progesterone in the brain, for example, is bound up to the PUFA molecules which accumulate the de-mended brain. It has more total cholesterol but it's inactivated by being stuck to the highly unsaturated molecules that have accumulated from the diet."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about fish oil, and Ray Peat explains that the high number of double bonds in fish oil makes it unstable and toxic, with breakdown products causing temporary anti-inflammatory effects but long-term immunosuppression and accumulation in the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the mother's milk is. So, because they're not producing those ketones in their own body, it's a healthy type of ketosis for them to have. Well, I don't think they should go into ketosis if the mother is producing sugar-rich milk. The baby has such a high metabolic rate, they very quickly use up their sugar and need to be fed again."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about babies and ketosis, and Ray Peat clarifies that babies shouldn't be in ketosis if the mother's milk is sugar-rich, as their high metabolic rate requires frequent feeding.

**RAY PEAT:** "What the crustacean eats, the puffa derive generally from algae and the very simple sea creatures or water or organisms live. Ultimately from the nature of the simple single cellular sun-dependent organisms and so if the food that the crustacean eats has a more saturated fat because they live at a warmer temperature than the crustacean itself is going to. have less of the fish oil material. For example, in the Amazon, with the high water temperature 85 degrees or so, the fish fat there is closer to butter than to what we think of as fish oil from the northern seas that are very cold. Of course, in the same effect holds true for vegetable fats that... coconuts and palm, which come from tropical areas, are much more saturated than grains, which tend to grow in temperate climates."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about fish consumption, and Ray Peat explains that the PUFA content in fish depends on their diet and water temperature, with warmer water leading to more saturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the meat not only has a very out of balance iron excess relative to copper and other minerals, it also has an imbalance in the direction of tryptophanes, and so on. And cysteine, which are anti-thyroid pro-inflammatory amino acids, and an extremely out of balance excess of phosphate, which is an excitatory agent, counteracting the protective quieting effects of calcium."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about reducing red meat consumption, and Ray Peat explains that meat has an imbalance of iron, tryptophan, cysteine, and phosphate, which are detrimental to thyroid function and promote inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the temperature is lowered. animals that are going to hibernate load up on seeds, for example. In the late summer and early fall, they tremendously increase their PUFA content and shift that brings up serotonin activity, which helps to lower the body temperature."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if PUFA consumption induces torpor, and Ray Peat explains that animals preparing for hibernation increase PUFA intake, which raises serotonin and lowers body temperature.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the experimenters have deprived them of PUFA and they didn't go into torpor or hibernation. Animals, animal models. Yeah."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if PUFA deprivation prevents torpor, and Ray Peat confirms this based on animal studies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the same thing that the diabetes doctors 150 years ago found. Even table sugar supports our metabolic calorie burning better than a grain-based starchy diet."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about table sugar, and Ray Peat reiterates that sugar supports metabolic calorie burning better than starchy diets, referencing historical findings.

**RAY PEAT:** "More fruit and milk would be the key. Simple things and sunlight and definitely avoiding all of the added pufa. Everything you buy in the supermarket is somehow distorted. They're even trying to put pufa in the milk by feeding chemical mixtures to cows that prevent the protective saturation that the rumen does."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for the most important dietary changes, and Ray Peat recommends more fruit and milk, sunlight, and avoiding added PUFAs, noting that even milk can be distorted by modern farming practices.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if it's actually good tasting, first pressing olive oil, the one you don't want is what they call light olive oil. It has a much higher pufa content, but good. First-pressing olive oil is only eight or ten percent pufa, usually."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about olive oil, and Ray Peat advises choosing good-tasting, first-pressing olive oil, as "light" versions have higher PUFA content.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ray Pete's newsletter at gmail.com, $28 for 12 issues over two years."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Ray Peat's newsletter subscription details.
