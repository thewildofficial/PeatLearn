**RAY PEAT:** The idea of accumulating capital so you can build machines, people wouldn't have built steam locomotives and ships and such if they hadn't accumulated capital and so lots of good things come from accumulating capital and putting it in one place but the trouble is Marx pointed out that it tends to accumulate all in a few hands and then the system stops running because no one can buy what is produced so efficiently in factories and so you have business cycles and then Lenin said well they discovered that you can cure the business cycle by having imperialism. And invading countries to make them buy your product and keep the system running. So as long as you have wars, capitalism has no problem. But that's a problem that has its internal contradictions and tends to cycle down to a crash every few years if you don't have some way to break out of that.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the relationship between capitalism and societal health, and how does the accumulation of capital impact the functioning of a system?

**RAY PEAT:** The culture is basically it has functioned as a system of illusions to help keep a dysfunctional system working to make the people think it's that they're better off than they are. And so I think working on the culture is really where political work should be done. Propaganda analysis everywhere, including science, science and philosophy.
**CONTEXT:** How does culture function within a political system, and where should political work be focused?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the late 60s, when I came to Eugene, I knew someone who started the local free clinic. And in Eugene in the summer, the fields all around the north of town were growing grass for the seed, lawn seed industry, and at the end of the summer, they would burn their fields and all of the pesticides and things that had been put on the crops would be vaporized and blow into Eugene and people with asthma would be more likely to die during the smoky seasons and after it caused some huge traffic accidents they finally after many many years limited at least but during that time allergies were a major problem and so my friend of the free clinic was constantly sending allergy people to me and I found. They were all taking ascorbic acid and vitamin A and the usual things that people take for allergies and I had just a little before that been trying out Linus Pauling's idea of big doses of vitamin C and my first bad experience with vitamin C was in the mid-1950s when it suddenly got very cheap. I had had previous good experiences with tiny 50 milligram tablets that cured my poison oak right away. So when it became cheap, I tried a 500 milligram tablet, woke up the next morning with a sore throat and cold symptoms and over the years, I saw that repeatedly happened that a good big dose of vitamin C always gave me. Some kind of a cold symptom reaction, so around 1968 when I started seeing these allergy people in great numbers, they were all taking vitamin C and some other supplements and so I suggested that they try stopping it and just almost without exception, they would come back and save a day. Their allergies were gone for the first time in years, just within a week of stopping all their supplements.
**CONTEXT:** Can you describe your early experiences with supplements, particularly vitamin C, and how they led to your skepticism about their widespread use, especially in allergy sufferers?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, one of the things the endotoxin does is to impair oxidation of the lining of the intestine and create a reduced state. Too many electrons and the sulfites and ascorbic acid are very powerful reductants and I think the combination of endotoxin and massive chemical reductant can interact and set up a big inflammation in the intestine and reflexes from that. cause the nose to run and eyes to water and such.
**CONTEXT:** What is the suspected mechanism by which endotoxins and chemical reductants like ascorbic acid can cause intestinal inflammation and allergic-like symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** I had previously found that after I had dental x-rays that happened three different times from the age of 10 to the age of 30, for about, in the first two times I had. Leukoplakia on the inside of my cheek for six months following the x-rays and the third time it happened, I had been thinking about what happens to stressed cells and membranes and it occurred to me that the vitamin A would be destroyed by x-rays just as much as it is by sunburn and so I took a big dose of vitamin A. It immediately just overnight cleared up the leukoplakia and knowing the similarity between cervical so-called precancerous conditions, leukoplakia can occur in the cervix as well as in the lining of the cheek, I told women about it and they tried big doses of vitamin A and vitamin E. Similarly, got the precancerous condition to disappear but as I continued taking the vitamin A just as a regular supplement, I started getting headaches from it and I'm not sure if the product had changed or if I just happened to be at that stage where I was more sensitive to it. I found that just a touch of it on my lips would give me a migraine the next morning. So I tried out a series of individual supplements and found that riboflavin, the very important vitamin B2 was almost as powerful as ascorbic acid for giving me. Almost immediate serious headache or asthma symptoms. One other that was very intense was rutin, whatever they were selling as a rutin concentrate. It was extremely allergenic and I'm talking to people with allergies pretty much they confirmed that. Ascorbic acid was the number one problem for most people, but vitamin B2 and sometimes vitamin A caused problems.
**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on your experiences with vitamin A and vitamin E, and how they led you to discover potential issues with other supplements like riboflavin and rutin?

**RAY PEAT:** When vitamin C was first on the market up until 1953 or 4, it was sold in very small 50 milligram tablets and that was during the time when all of the classical amazing results were published. I think that was because it was free of contaminants but the new cheap way of making it from glucose markets were so much easier to make. At first, it involved sulfuric acid oxidation of glucose and the sulfuric acid was almost always contaminated with some lead because of the way it was manufactured. Over several decades since 1955, there have been a series of chemical innovations for making it even more cheaply, but apparently each of them introduces some... kind of chemical adulterant in trace amounts. In the Journal of Free Radical Biology, I think it's called, in the late 90s someone published a study of the re-agent grade best purity ascorbic acid that they got for lab use. They dissolved a gram of it in... a liter of highly distilled water and then measured it in an electron spin analyzer, ESR or EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance, shows free radicals and the person who did this experiment said that... just spontaneously on dissolving purified vitamin C and purified water, the content of free radicals was as high as would have been produced by, I think he said, something like 6,000 rads of X-rays, basically a killing dose and he said, this is amazing. This amount of free radicals doesn't kill her intestines. He said it was apparently from traces, he looked at the very tiny traces of heavy metals and said any one of those, but iron was adequate but there were several other trace metals that wouldn't be enough to create free radicals.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential reasons for the irritant nature of supplements, particularly vitamin C, and what did a study in the Journal of Free Radical Biology reveal about its purity and free radical content?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, every additive has its own manufacturing history and every reagent used in making that thing has its own history. And you have to look, you know, it's like they used to say about. HIV infections, one encounter can amount to hundreds of historical encounters and opportunities for infection. But when you look at every excipient in a product, each one of those has many components, each of which has its own. history and opportunity for contamination.
**CONTEXT:** Beyond the active ingredients, what are the potential risks associated with the excipients and additives found in supplements?

**RAY PEAT:** My thinking, I think. Got started along a certain path in 1960 when they were analyzing the amount of strontium-90 from atomic bomb fallout and collecting babies teeth from all around the world to measure exposure to radioactive. Isotopes but strontium-90 happens to be concentrated in the bone and the bone marrow is turning over rapidly and so the exposure to fallout would show up as mutated blood cells and radiation exposure to the bone marrow is a known promoter of leukemia and so they were looking at. At the connection between childhood disease and strontium-90 and because strontium-90 is similar to calcium it dissociates in milk and so the government was warning parents not to feed their children so much milk because of the. Radioactive strontium that the bomb tests were putting into it but i looked at the other how did the strontium-90 get into the milk and it falls under the ground in the rain the plants that need the water and soil to grow absorb both calcium and strontium-90 and so the concentration in the soil. Is relatively very high after a bomb test in the ratio of strontium to calcium and when the cow eats the grass the the cow purifies selects for the calcium over the strontium if you look at the ratio in grass and cow meat and milk the milk has the least strontium-90 in proportion to other nutritional factors, especially calcium. So every organism is a purifying system, getting what's good and excluding as much as possible of what's bad, even to the matter of being able to select between the isotopes of potassium, for example. Radioactive potassium goes down every time it passes through. An organism on the food chain and so the safest thing is to get the purest food possible from an animal like a cow producing milk, which is multiply filtered from the environmental source when they talk about the chemical purity, that's only a reality in the mind of the chemist. It's maybe better than something from a crude or factory. In relation to biological nutrients, it's just wildly out of the ballpark in terms of contamination. So any natural food is extremely purified. Any supplement made chemically is going to be dirty, just in principle.
**CONTEXT:** How did your understanding of radioactive isotopes like strontium-90 influence your perspective on the purity of food versus chemically synthesized supplements?

**RAY PEAT:** And one of the problems is that you get lots of unnamed and still unidentified nutrients in any living tissue or recently living tissue, for example, in mushrooms. The content has hardly been just sketched out. There are thousands of potentially valuable nutrients or para-nutritional substances, things that influence your quality of life, that simply haven't been. Identified and tested
**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of unidentified nutrients found in living tissues, such as mushrooms, and how do they contribute to overall health?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and some of the fruits that are most interesting happen to have some of the most amazing still unidentified substances in them like the the curimoya they're just like Mark Twain said it was the best tasting substance in the universe. So those have a lot of medicinal qualities as well? They haven't been studied, but if you eat them for a while, you can tell that there is something amazing about them. That's good to know. They're in my refrigerator right now. And then marmalade, too. There's something you could make that is full of naringenin and then naringin, and this is something you would normally throw away that could be... I'm doing air quotes, but like a supplement with something with great value. Yeah, like orange peeling people usually throw away, but if they're good oranges and well prepared, the marmalade is like a super drug. People might worry about the fact that marmalade is more sugar than orange peeling, but... the sugar itself is part of the nutritional wonder drug.
**CONTEXT:** Can you discuss the potential medicinal qualities of fruits like cherimoya and the value of utilizing parts of fruits like orange peels in preparations like marmalade?

**RAY PEAT:** A general rule about drugs is that the oldest ones are best. They've been... tested for more years and the... since the pharmaceutical industry sort of took over the world and the government, they have had 20-year cycles in which they talk about a new generation of the drug. And the first generation is usually the safest and most effective that the... second, third, and fourth generations are more weirdly dangerous. But the toxic side effects just haven't been published yet.
**CONTEXT:** What is your general approach to evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs, and what is your perspective on the evolution of drug generations?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, 50 years, I assume that most of the middle-term side effects would have been noticed. If it's going to bring on cancer, you have to use it for at least 20, preferably 40 years, to know whether it's safe, because cancer is a developmental process that typically takes at least 20 years. And then regarding like if it causes your children or grandchildren to be born without heads, that's worth knowing. And... They aren't going to know that for quite a few years for all of the drugs that have been patented in the last 20 years.
**CONTEXT:** How can we assess the long-term safety of drugs, particularly concerning the development of cancer and potential transgenerational effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Finasteride, Propecia. Oh, oh. Yeah, I hear from a lot of people who have had trouble from that. What kind of... affects what you expect with inhibiting 5AR? Is that just because I get the email, I think, all the time? Well, brain chemistry depends on it. The metabolism of progesterone as well as testosterone in your brain, if you block any of the enzymes used in making it, you're going to have a weird brain. But it works on the progesterone system too. And yeah, they said progesterone is only. A pregnancy-related drug, chemical and neglecting that the brain absolutely depends on making it and absorbing some of it that's produced in the ovaries and adrenals and skin but it's a major brain hormone that you're messing with when you try to. stop the production of DHT.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential neurological and hormonal side effects of finasteride, particularly concerning its impact on brain chemistry and the progesterone system?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and even better probably to start with increasing your cholesterol production, which means keeping your intestine and liver in good condition.
**CONTEXT:** Beyond specific hormonal interventions, what foundational steps are crucial for addressing issues related to DHT inhibition, such as those caused by finasteride?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I had fairly interesting experiences like the fact that 50 milligrams of vitamin C cured and horrible cases of......poison oak. I thought I was going to have to quit working in the woods, but over the weekend I took two doses of 50 milligram vitamin C and the poison oak was gone, never had it again. And around that same period I was feeling... gloomy and happened to take a tablet of I think it was maybe 20 milligrams of vitamin B1 and in minutes I had a clear happy perspective on the world. And when I worked in the woods I always by about mid-summer was getting acne and people talked about how sunlight was supposed to be good for your skin. For some reason, on exposure to the sunlight, I would get pimples and one night, I think it was in the winter in Mexico, I was lying on my bed with a bright light hanging over my head and I went to sleep, spent about eight hours lying on my back with a bright light shining on my closed eyes, and I woke up with pimples starting and that was it. I started the biochemical thinking going and I realized that my retina uses a lot of vitamin A just in the process of making the visual pigment and so on. But then the eye is the main regulator of your reproductive hormones and when birds are exposed to constant light for example they'll be constantly in their mating season like with artificial light in the winter birds will become fertile and and start nesting and it's because light is the signal that is springtime and that it activates your adrenals and gonads to produce lots of steroids and the production of steroids is a heavy consumer of vitamin A and so from that. That enlightening insight, I took a big dose of vitamin A and immediately the pimples subsided. Then around that same time, I was getting interested in the curative effects and I read Adele Davis and a friend in Mexico City was dropping by and saying that his little niece was in the hospital with uncontrollable diarrhea. He would stop by two or three days in a row saying the final day, he said they didn't think he would live another day but at that point, he accepted an idea from Adele Davis and I gave him a tablet or two of vitamin B6, 10 milligrams which he took to the hospital, and gave to the little girl. And within an hour or so, her diarrhea stopped and instant recovery, about a year or two after that, a neighbor of mine had a big alcoholic nose, he was a terrific consumer of gin and tequila, he bought it by the case and his nose was red and large and shiny and he had a terrific problem with vocabulary, he was a hobbyist short story writer and he would struggle for a long time to get the right word he wanted, he had it in mind but he couldn't call it up and he had this odd habit of when he was looking for a word, he would put his hand on his forehead and nose and so it started me thinking about the memory. And the circulation to his nose being a problem and possibly the circulation was brain was affected by the same thing. And so I quoted from Adele Davis again and described how vitamin B2 is essential for oxidation and the blood supply is carrying oxygen so it has to carry extra oxygen. When you're deficient in vitamin B2 to make up for the inefficient use of the oxygen. I kept telling him this idea to try vitamin B2 supplement and he couldn't remember it. I kept giving him notes and he would forget to take the notes. I think we tied the note to his finger and he finally got to the doctor with the note and the doctor gave him a shot of vitamins and I saw him within a day or two. He was talking as fluently as anyone, no hesitation in vocabulary and his nose was completely normal pink color. Then... got a weekly shot, but on some holiday, he forgot to go to the doctor for his weekly shot. The next time I saw him, he was hesitant in his vocabulary and his nose was red and shiny again. Once you're deficient in vitamin B2, it can raise your requirement for a long time afterward. So, basically, it's endless, what could be. Consider a deficiency like any kind of abnormal behavior or a friend of mine had a four year old kid who was having every afternoon he would have a violent tantrum and was getting dangerous really vicious episodes and at night he would wake up screaming and having a horrible nose bleed and the nose bleed. Brain connection reminded me of my friend with a shiny nose and we made up some milk powder, egg and sugar cookies with 10 milligrams of vitamin B2 powdered up in this batch of maybe I guess six or eight cookies which he ate that afternoon. That night he slept through the night without having his... nightmare and nosebleed. And he never, as far as I knew, in the next years, never again had his horrible tantrums.
**CONTEXT:** Can you share some of your personal experiences with nutrient deficiencies and how you identified and addressed them, citing examples like vitamin C for poison oak, vitamin B1 for mood, vitamin A for acne, vitamin B6 for diarrhea, and vitamin B2 for cognitive and circulatory issues?

**RAY PEAT:** They used the cornea to test the effects of a vitamin B2 deficiency and saw that the mitochondria were essentially in the cornea. Collapsed or structurally changed so that they no longer would take up vitamin B2 when it was given to the metanormal concentration. So I think that might be a unique vitamin in deficiency causing more or less heritable damage to the mitochondria which you can regenerate, create a new crop of mitochondria. Thanks for the question. Support and good condition over a period of probably quite a few weeks.
**CONTEXT:** What did experiments on rats reveal about the effects of vitamin B2 deficiency on corneal mitochondria, and could this indicate a unique type of damage that can be regenerated?

**RAY PEAT:** Your nutritional requirements depend on your parents, your grandparents, and every generation before that? Yeah. For example, something that makes your mother low in thyroid or high in estrogen or low in glucose for example during your gestation, that powerfully sets. A pattern in your nerves and endocrine glands that will greatly increase your requirements and if you intensely work on them, the earlier in life the better but at any age if you put enough effort into it, you can... overcome those pre-settings.
**CONTEXT:** How do ancestral factors and prenatal conditions influence an individual's nutritional requirements and predispositions?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I'm seeing the various ways the country people... ate in Mexico and in other countries, I realized that just the meaning of a traditional diet, to a large extent, was that it was nutritionally very complex and included hormones, especially the thyroid gland. People always would eat the chicken necks and fish heads, and they would save all of the glands from... pigs and all of the food animals, sheep and cows and such, and they would use those in sausages with the smaller animals, the whole animal tended to be stewed and used in a very comprehensive way. The blood, for example, carries a lot of hormones and... blood is a very frequent component of food in a basic traditional diet.
**CONTEXT:** What role did hormones, particularly thyroid, play in traditional diets across different cultures, and how were animal glands and blood utilized in these diets?

**RAY PEAT:** When you don't know the client very well, it's best to give them the information that can make them take responsibility for themselves. But sometimes when I saw someone in desperate, desperate, like a suicidal condition, I would... intervene by giving them a quick-acting thyroid or dosing them with some progesterone. When you can see it happening, you know that the person is in a desperate condition and that if they're going to be converted into a well person within an hour, you can take the time to to oversee it yourself, but otherwise... If you are just consulting more or less random people, it's better if you make them get informed so that they can watch themselves undergo the changes.
**CONTEXT:** When consulting with individuals, what is your preferred approach to empowering them with information, and in what situations might you intervene more directly with substances like thyroid or progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, thyroid is required too. Retain magnesium by cells. So when you're hypothyroid, the slightest stress makes the magnesium fall out of your cells and get lost in the urine. And so a constant daily supply of magnesium is essential for things like preventing cramps and depression and all of the... inflammatory things that come from magnesium deficiency, but once your thyroid is up where it should be, then you can go for really probably two weeks or more without anywhere near the required amount of magnesium. So most nutrients you can go without for a couple of weeks as long as you're getting energy.
**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence magnesium retention in the body, and what are the implications for individuals with hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because you're turning over your cholesterol to progesterone and testosterone chemistry constantly. And that uses lots of vitamin A. And when your thyroid is low, then you have a very low. requirement for vitamin A that the FDA sees.
**CONTEXT:** Why do individuals with higher thyroid activity have a greater requirement for vitamin A compared to those with lower thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** During my 20s, I apparently needed around 50,000 units per day. The researcher, dentist, Emmanuel Taraskin, at one of his conventions. He circulated a questionnaire and asked people to list their symptoms and all of the supplements that they used and he published a chart showing a straight line of inverse relationship between the amount of vitamin A from no supplement to 100,000 units a day and the number of symptoms went from I forget how many but multiple symptoms down to zero symptoms and the high metabolizers who were using a vitamin A 100,000 per day supplement.
**CONTEXT:** Can you describe the findings of Emmanuel Taraskin's research on vitamin A intake and its correlation with the reduction of symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** I think experimentation is best the when the person has extremely high blood pressure especially the difference between systolic diastolic effects of 70 or more I figured they should try some big doses of vitamin K because it is needed for keeping calcium out of your arteries and as they become vitamin K deficient and calcium overloaded they become stiff and you get a very hard kind of circulation. The pressure rises sharply on contraction and then falls drastically. on relaxation because there's no elasticity in the system and I've seen people in just a week or two bring their top and bottom numbers much closer like like a hundred point difference disappearing in just a week or two from a big vitamin k supplement like 40 or 50 milligrams.
**CONTEXT:** What is your recommendation for individuals experiencing extremely high blood pressure, particularly a significant difference between systolic and diastolic readings, and what role does vitamin K play in managing arterial stiffness and blood pressure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you have to use about oh sometimes 10 times the oral dose depending on um you know if you're going to bathe every day you for sure need about 10 times as much on your skin because it takes some time for the vitamin D to soak in and as your skin, the faster your skin is being replaced the more of the vitamin D that you put on it is going to be lost with the shedding cells so if you have some symptom like extreme weakness, that's going to be a problem. Muscular weakness and skeletal muscular symptoms will disappear in a day or two when you get a, if you bring your serum vitamin D level up from say 5 or 10 maniograms to 30 to 50. Just a tremendous difference in brain function, muscle function, absence of bone pain and so on. So if you wanted to use 5,000... IU of vitamin D per day, you should put 50,000 IU on your skin?
**CONTEXT:** When using vitamin D topically, what is the general dosage recommendation compared to oral intake, and what are the potential benefits for muscular weakness and overall function?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can get the vitamin A measured but I think it's very expensive and usually it's not worth having it done because if you just eat eggs and occasionally liver you're going to have plenty.
**CONTEXT:** Is it generally necessary to measure vitamin A levels, or can dietary intake of eggs and liver suffice for adequate levels?

**RAY PEAT:** In the winter I try to do it every day. In the summer, the food supply is usually fresher and so I often don't use them every day in the summer.
**CONTEXT:** How frequently do you recommend applying oily vitamins like A, D, and K2 topically, and does this frequency vary between seasons?

**RAY PEAT:** There are safe antibiotics that can work for a lot of people with bowel dysbiosis, bad bacteria, overgrowth. But I think the first thing is just to cut out the foods that are supporting the bad bacteria, which are usually polyunsaturated fatty acids and hard to digest starchy fibrous foods like grains. Beans, seeds and such, and then the disinfecting foods such as cooked mushrooms and raw carrots. These are natural antibiotics, but when you have a really serious intense bacterial problem, these subtilis and licheniformis, those are useful.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on probiotic strains like B. licheniformis and B. subtilis, and what dietary changes are most effective for addressing bowel dysbiosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but I've seen just carrot salad every day work just as well as penicillin. For reducing the stress that's causing a hormone imbalance for example, if you're having a very high cortisol and estrogen and low testosterone and progesterone, sometimes the supplement of any of the antibiotics can do it but so can just having a raw carrot salad every day.
**CONTEXT:** Can a simple dietary intervention like a raw carrot salad be as effective as antibiotics in addressing stress-induced hormone imbalances?

**RAY PEAT:** The aspirin, one of its effects, the famous effect but it's a very trivial effect in the actual benefit you get from aspirin is the knocking out of... of the clotting platelet function and that effect that can cause uncontrolled bleeding from too much aspirin is by blocking or interfering with the proteins that are produced by the liver under the influence of vitamin K. So not everyone experiences this but if you have taken antibiotics and have a deficiency of the type of bacteria that produces vitamin K in your intestine then you're susceptible to aspirins knocking out of this vitamin K dependent clotting protein. So just as as insurance it's good to have a source of vitamin K in your diet. Edged cheese or a well-cooked greens are ordinary foods for good sources.
**CONTEXT:** How does aspirin's mechanism of action relate to vitamin K, and what are the risks associated with its use, particularly for individuals with a compromised gut microbiome?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, those are made under the influence of vitamin K in the liver and they are the anti coagulant factors dependent on vitamin K. So people who have excess clotting problems are sometimes told to avoid vitamin K but if you haven't measured the proteins S and C it might be the worst thing to do is to avoid vitamin K because vitamin K is... required for the normal resolution of stimulated clotting and so you can have a tendency to strokes if you're very extremely deficient in vitamin K.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between vitamin K and anticoagulant factors like Protein S and C, and what are the potential risks of avoiding vitamin K for individuals with clotting issues?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's just about as general as vitamin D. The reason people are so... deficient in vitamin D is mostly in the northern latitudes, working indoors, only getting maybe a couple of weeks of good sunlight when they're on vacation. And in Muslim and Catholic countries, women have traditionally gone out in public very covered up. And if you're dark-skinned, it takes a very large amount of sunlight. to produce as much vitamin D as you need. So working indoors, wearing too many clothes, and having dark skin all make you more susceptible to a vitamin D deficiency. And the use of sunscreen makes it even worse because people go on vacation and block their vitamin D formation even when they're in the sun.
**CONTEXT:** Is vitamin K deficiency as widespread as vitamin D deficiency, and what are the primary factors contributing to vitamin D deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've done that. I got tired of carrots after eating one a day for 20 years. Bamboo suits are another alternative. We made more interesting recipes than raw carrots.
**CONTEXT:** Have you found that mushrooms can effectively replace raw carrots in a daily diet, and are there other alternatives to raw carrots?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, mushrooms have really a good broad spectrum nutritional value. But you just have to eat an awful lot of them.
**CONTEXT:** What is the nutritional value of mushrooms, and what quantity is typically recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it would probably be either pregnenolone or progesterone. If you, for example, fall off a cliff or get sunburned or get bitten by a strange animal, no matter what happens to you, you want to have a lot of progesterone or pregnenolone. It's kind of a universal. antidote. Like if you're in a car wreck and can move you should squeeze a bunch of progesterone into your mouth.
**CONTEXT:** If you could only take one substance to a desert island, including your normal diet, what would it be and why?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I've just finished my November newsletter on autoimmunity and I'm... thinking of the next one being on glucose as an anti-aging nutrient. That'll get some attention.
**CONTEXT:** What are your current research interests and upcoming newsletter topics?
