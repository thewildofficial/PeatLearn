**RAY PEAT:** "Looking at life in general, plants and funguses... and amoebas are the organisms that apparently don't need or don't want thyroid. But as soon as you get what we think of as real animal life, that includes corals, slenderets, echinoderms, mollusks, crustaceans, insects... Just about everything that has an organization to it uses thyroid and the basic function of thyroid is to energize cells and to give them enough energy and efficiency to allow them to differentiate so that they don't just concentrate on eating and growing. The way plants and amoebas and fungi and such do. So if you look at some of the old experiments in an aquarium with developing frog eggs, as soon as the eggs would hatch into tadpoles they would either add an antithyroid chemical or a little bit of a thyroid hormone to the water and if you added the antithyroid chemical the tadpole would never turn into a frog it would just get it to be a huge tadpole but if you added thyroid to the the aquarium the tiny hatchling tadpole would turn into a tiny spider-like frog, just about the size of a fly, showing that the thyroid, which energizes the cells so that they use oxygen and produce a huge amount of energy, this energy allows the cells to realize their function, but when it comes on too early, they neglect to grow. Without thyroid, all you have is growth, and that's fine for amoebas and mushrooms and trees and so on, but in humans, it can lead to things like tumors and malformations and so on. So, the energy production is... really the basis of all organized life. And that makes the thyroid, in a sense, the main gland. Really, if you take out the pituitary gland, which people have talked about as the master gland, many different animals, if you remove that and give them thyroid hormone, in some cases the animals live ten times as long as normal, usually about twice as long as normal, for the lack of the pituitary gland, as long as they had adequate thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** Why is thyroid hormone so important for animal life and cellular function?

**RAY PEAT:** "The inflammatory state means that something has gone wrong. It's interesting that doctors very often go entirely on the basis of the... amount of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone in diagnosing your thyroid status. But the thyroid-stimulating hormone creates all sorts of inflammatory processes. And when you have enough actual thyroid hormone to completely shut down your pituitary, you turn off practically all of these. Toxic inflammatory processes."
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between TSH and inflammatory processes?

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1930s, it was standard medical practice to have a little apparatus to allow the person to lie down, usually with an empty stomach, and to breathe oxygen for two minutes, and they would measure how much. Oxygen was used, and people who had the standard symptoms of low thyroid function would often they would consume only half the normal amount of oxygen in the allotted time, and that usually went with their hands and feet being cold and their core body temperature being below normal and their heart rate being somewhat slower than normal, and as they looked at the more biochemical indicators, they saw that cholesterol was almost invariably high in proportion to the reduced consumption of oxygen and lower body temperature, so the increasing cholesterol was like a mirror image you of the decreasing metabolic rate and thyroid function, and if you would give a thyroid supplement to someone with excess cholesterol, it would immediately come down exactly in relation to the increasing oxygen use. Oxygen excess was another identifying feature. The doctor would look at a person's palm of the hand looking at the calluses. A hypothyroid person typically would have cold and pale hands, but usually with orange areas where the skin was thickened in the calluses. That's because vitamin A is used directly in proportion to your metabolic rate. Protein turnover and thyroid function, and if your thyroid is low, you barely use your carotene, hardly convert it to vitamin A, and so the carotene typically would accumulate enough to show up as orange areas where the skin was thick, and in the ovary it was found that the... normal corpus luteum, or yellow body, where progesterone is made. In these women who were hypothyroid, the corpus luteum would be dark red because of accumulated beta-carotene, and that carotene would block the production of progesterone causing amenorrhea in the typical hypothyroid woman. Another good indicator that was developed in the 1930s was the Achilles reflex relaxation speed. A person kneels on a chair so their toes hang over loosely, and you thump the Achilles tendon so that the calf muscle twitches. And sometimes a low thyroid person......won't have really any reflex that you can see, but if they do have a reflex so their toe twitches out, the hypothyroid person's muscle relaxes so slowly that their foot returns like a door with a pneumatic closer on it, a little jerky relaxation. Electrocardiogram shows the same thing. The T-wave is called the repolarization wave, and it's exactly the same thing as in the relaxation of your calf muscle. In a hypothyroid person, the T-wave is delayed and low, usually, flattened out, and the same thing happens in all of your body processes. When your brain is tired, the nerves are slow to relax and so your sleep will not be as relaxing and restorative as it would be in a high thyroid state."
**CONTEXT:** What were the historical methods for diagnosing thyroid function, and what are their underlying physiological principles?

**RAY PEAT:** "All of those things contribute. The thyroid allows you to take up oxygen efficiently and oxidize it completely and in proportion to the... the lack of thyroid, when you stimulate a muscle cell or a nerve cell, it will use its oxygen inefficiently. It will allow calcium to enter the cell and keep it in an excited state. And it will tend to produce lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide. And carbon dioxide produced... under the influence of the thyroid, is needed to carry the exciting calcium out of the cells and allow the cell to relax."
**CONTEXT:** How do factors like low blood sugar, increased serotonin, calcium, or low thyroid contribute to slow muscle relaxation?

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of free and bound hormones, it's purely a laboratory construction and in the case of thyroid, it usually has some relation to symptoms, but it's a little bit analogous to reading tea leaves because the, actually, when thyroid hormone is... stuck to the albumin protein, which is the main protein in the blood, it has no trouble at all getting into cells, taking the thyroid into the mitochondria and the nucleus and so on. So the free thyroid test does correspond for a variety of indirect reasons to... the real available activity of the thyroid, but it's really just a laboratory construction that should be minimized."
**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of "free" versus "bound" thyroid hormone measurements in diagnosis?

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't recommend it as a way to diagnose hypothyroidism, but I do recommend if you're looking at a blood test, I would recommend having as close to zero TSH as you can get because all of the known effects of TSH are really harmful in some way. The main reason doctors are giving currently for not wanting to suppress TSH is they think because TSH reduces the turnover indicators of bone that this idea developed as a way to sell estrogen. Estrogen was never... shown to increase bone growth in humans but it did stop the osteoclast function so it reduced bone turnover and so they said this is evidence that estrogen is preventing osteoporosis because it stops the breakdown of bone and since PSH also stops the... osteoclast and the turnover of bone doctor said if we suppress it that will cause osteoporosis but in fact it's the indicators that were used to argue that estrogen was protecting the bones. They named a protein osteoprotengerin meaning bone protecting protein and for several years they were... using that as a way to sell estrogen and other drugs that would increase it but pretty soon it turned out that osteoprotengerin is closely associated with bone loss, osteoporosis, osteopenia and calcification of the soft tissues and it turns out that thyrotropin, TSH... like estrogen increases osteoprotengerin, increases the movement of calcium into your arteries and heart and out of the bones. So the main argument doctors have for keeping your TSH up to not below one is often what they say. Their very evidence is the opposite of what they think it is."
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on TSH as a diagnostic marker for hypothyroidism, and what is the significance of its relationship with bone health and estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. About 10 years ago I started hearing people telling me that their doctors had diagnosed them as being both. Hyperthyroid and hypothyroid at the very same moment more and more people were getting this diagnosis Which really shows that a crisis of confusion had taken over the profession around ten years ago That people on the basis of their blood tests could be both hyper and hypo at the same time and this misleading indicator diagnosis led them to diagnose many people who were suffering hypothyroidism as hyperthyroid without measuring their oxygen consumption, their body temperature, or looking at most of their symptoms or how many calories they were burning in a day. Looking at these other indicators, people who were clearly hypothyroid and who would lose their symptoms if they took a thyroid supplement, they were being diagnosed as hyperthyroid having either their thyroid gland removed or being given radioactive iodine to destroy it on the basis of a complete misunderstanding of even what constitutes hyperthyroidism."
**CONTEXT:** How has the medical profession's approach to thyroid diagnosis become confused, leading to misdiagnoses of hyperthyroidism in hypothyroid individuals?

**RAY PEAT:** "Broda Barnes, when he was working as a physician in the 30s, he was a PhD researcher who identified much of the physiology of hypothyroidism. But then he became a medical doctor and... he practiced most of his life in Colorado, where the weather is very cool even in the summer. And for his patients, the temperature was a very adequate way of diagnosing. And he describes the temperature, waking temperature, he thought should be... maybe around 97.8 and then after breakfast it should rise to, during the day, somewhere around 98.6. And in Eugene, in hot summer weather, I saw the same people who in the winter would have very low oral temperature. I saw that in the hot, humid summer weather... these hypothyroid people were maintaining a normal core temperature. And sometimes their hands would be cold even in hot weather. But I saw that a low metabolizing person, given some environmental support, could manage to keep their temperature pretty close to normal. And so I saw that their pulse rate even... when their temperature might be 98.5 during the daytime, often they would have a pulse rate of 45 or 55 or 65, somewhere below optimal. And that started me thinking about the factors that regulate body temperature. And I saw some people who... had extreme hypothyroidism who would oscillate between extreme depression and extreme mania. And when they were going into depression, their temperature would be consistently low. But once they switched over to the manic phase, they would wake up with a pulse rate of maybe 75 or 80, and the temperature... right where Broder Barnes wanted it. And so besides just the average pulse rate and temperature, I saw that after those people would eat a big breakfast, their temperature would fall. By 11 o'clock, they would show up a hypothyroid temperature. And during the night, everyone tends to have more of the stress hormones alternating. Surges of adrenaline and cortisol, for example, and the people who went past the exhaustion phase of hypothyroidism and reached the manic phase kept extremely high levels of blood cortisol and adrenaline and usually other transmitters like serotonin. And since food reduces stress. Somewhat getting your blood sugar up and daylight also reduces stress. If you see their temperature and pulse rate fall after a good meal, that is another thing that reveals behind those indicators, it can reveal a low metabolic rate that was just being held up by emergency stimulation from adrenaline and cortisol."
**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of body temperature and pulse rate as indicators of metabolic health, and how do they relate to thyroid function and stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it tends to go with fertility problems, hormonal problems, low testosterone, increased estrogen, a lot of... degenerative problems."
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential consequences of a low resting heart rate?

**RAY PEAT:** "Brodevarns was one of the first people to notice the importance of the liver in thyroid function. The Biskins in 1942 to 45, were showing how the liver regulates hormones but they were concentrating on estrogen. If the liver was lacking thyroid or protein or some vitamins, the Biskins showed that your estrogen would skyrocket in proportion to the reduced function of the liver. And there's this antagonism. focused on the liver between estrogen and thyroid and the thyroid works partly by increasing protein synthesis, but partly by simply energizing the liver so that it is able to detoxify everything that shouldn't be in the body. The liver should remove a hundred percent of the estrogen that reaches it in circulation. The body should be able to produce estrogen in the ovary, for example, send it to do its work in the uterus and breast and so on, but then it should immediately be destroyed by the liver. And if your thyroid is low, the liver loses the ability to detoxify estrogen and practically everything else harmful. And the... liver happens to also be the source, as Britta Barnes discovered, of the most active thyroid. He said it's about two-thirds of the thyroid used by the body is produced in the liver. And if your liver isn't getting enough sugar, enough glucose... or if it doesn't have enough selenium, it is unable to convert thyroxin into T3. If you can completely knock out the liver and your thyroid will excrete about this ratio of three parts of thyroxin to one part of T3. And so, as long as your thyroid is working... your liver will be getting a little bit of T3 and will be able to keep functioning, other things being equal. But if you're under stress, for example, don't have anything to eat for about 24 hours, or are exerting too much energy in proportion to what you're eating, your liver isn't getting enough glucose to convert. the three parts of thyroxine produced in your gland into the active T3. So you will have this drastic decrease in production of the active triiodothyronine, T3, most of which comes from the liver when it's well fed with sugar. If the doctor prescribes only T4, it'll work fine in anyone who doesn't need it, such as 25-year-old healthy men. But women, because of their higher estrogen level, have many times the incidence of thyroid problems and liver problems that men do. And it's because of the... centrality of the liver to the activation of thyroid hormone. And the liver's essentiality for eliminating estrogen, that a little problem with either thyroid or estrogen means that your liver will allow estrogen to increase in the body as it decreases its production of active thyroid hormone. And that in turn... slows the liver even more, so it has a vicious circle."
**CONTEXT:** Where does the conversion of T4 to T3 primarily occur, and what is the liver's role in this process and in estrogen detoxification?

**RAY PEAT:** "First it slows down liver function. But then it reaches a point where it will even block the thyroid itself. And this is where women tend to have a high frequency of goiter thyroid enlargement. They call it Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but most often it's what they used to call colloid goiter, since estrogen stimulates the stress hormones in the brain increasing. Thyroid stimulating hormone estrogen causes the pituitary to drive the thyroid harder. Meanwhile it's blocking the ability of the thyroid gland to secrete it. So it tends to enlarge the thyroid and then they get diagnosed as having thyroiditis. Progesterone......happens to activate these proteins that allow the thyroid to secrete, so I advise women who have an enlarged thyroid not to take progesterone until they've taken care of the enlargement of the thyroid, because progesterone will normalize the protein so fast that sometimes they'll go into a slightly hyperthyroid state for a few weeks."
**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen negatively impact thyroid function, leading to goiter and thyroiditis, and what is progesterone's role in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** "It very often goes with hypothyroidism because if your liver can't activate it, if you aren't producing so much estrogen that your gland gets shut off completely, your gland will go on producing hormone and you'll get along in your daily life with a little bit of T3 coming out of your thyroid gland. But that gradually allows the T4 to accumulate because your liver isn't using it up and that tends to slow down even the production of T3 if you get a very high T4 level. And what originally got me interested in this interaction of T4 and T3 was a patient at the medical school in Portland State. who was a slightly hypothyroid woman who was prescribed T4 for a few months. On one grain of equivalent of T4, 100 micrograms, she got even more hypothyroid symptoms and her doctor increased it to 200 micrograms and a few months later she was even worse. So... I think he reached 400 or 500 micrograms of T4 at which point she went into a myxedema coma and was taken to the hospital unconscious and they injected T3, pure T3, and she came right out of the coma but her symptoms got worse directly in proportion to the increased dose of T4 and after seeing that extreme example, I have run across probably a hundred women with less extreme effects but it isn't rare at all for a woman to get worse symptoms, noises in their head or electrical sensation in their body or swollen muscles or any of the... a thousand symptoms of hypothyroidism as a result of taking too much T4."
**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of a high T4 reading, and why can taking T4 supplements sometimes worsen hypothyroid symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** "When you aren't able to oxidize your sugar all the way to carbon dioxide, you produce lactic acid very easily, even at rest. A person will keep producing lactic acid as if they were under strenuous exercise, and the lactic acid turns on a lot of inflammatory mediators, which have systemic effects on your bone and skin, hair growth, everything. Lactic acid itself acts as a toxin. Gradually, if you're experiencing that year after year, it leads to a tendency to fibrosis and arthritis and so-called connective tissue diseases in general from an imbalance of the inflammatory mediators, histamine and serotonin especially, and a tendency of the soft tissues to calcify, so it contributes to... hardening of the arteries and heart failure."
**CONTEXT:** How does impaired sugar oxidation and lactic acid production affect various physiological systems, leading to chronic inflammation and degenerative diseases?

**RAY PEAT:** "Everything. The body is constantly renewing itself moment by moment. Like, overnight, people have measured that there's a 60% turnover of brain substance in one night, just because the brain has a high metabolic rate. And as, if you aren't renewing yourself at a high rate, you're allowing errors to accumulate. And one of the reasons thyroid and other problems get worse over time is that our diets, on average, contain a significant amount of thyroid inhibiting substances, especially the polyunsaturated fatty acids. And the French did a series of studies that really define how that works. A long ago, people knew that polyunsaturated fats blocked proteolytic enzymes. And in this French series of studies, they saw that the first effect of too much polyunsaturated fat is to block the ability of the thyroid gland to secrete the hormone by breaking down the thyroid globulin. And... Then, if the thyroid manages to secrete it, the transport of it on proteins in the blood is inhibited in proportion to the unsaturation. So, the fish oil, many 5 and 6 unsaturated bonds are the most powerful almost total inhibitors of thyroid transport. But linoleic acid with three double bonds inhibits about 50 percent and linoleic acid with two double bonds inhibits about 30 percent. So it's proportional to the number of double bonds, the transport. And the same thing happens inside the cell. The responsiveness of the cell to thyroid is inhibited in proportion to the amount of unsaturated. Carotene, even though it's not a fatty acid, is highly unsaturated and it has that same effect interfering with thyroid function just because of this series of unsaturations. The accumulated unsaturated fats in the body......turn on other antithyroid processes, so it isn't all immediate and direct, but they make you more susceptible to turning on prostaglandins, which promote inflammation and increase the tendency to produce lactic acid. And they interfere, apart from the thyroid, they interfere with the mitochondrial oxidative energy production. Right. So, while we're kind of on the topic of, I don't want to go too much into PUFAs, but let's go and chat about... Just estrogen levels and how we talked about how they block hypothyroidism, but you know, how hypothyroidism can raise those and I think You know, it's a huge concern because you know most I shouldn't say most but a lot of women are being prescribed these medications number one Most people are having issues with detoxifying their body of these estrogens number two and You know having this unopposed estrogen in the body can lead to specific you know dysfunctions or diseases like clotting and edema, fibrosis, cysts and all these things."
**CONTEXT:** How do polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) interfere with thyroid function and cellular energy production, and how does this relate to estrogen dominance and its associated health issues?

**RAY PEAT:** "There are very close interactions between the increased estrogen and you mentioned clotting. Estrogen increases serotonin dominance and serotonin and estrogen both promote and are promoted by... the polyunsaturated fats and the low thyroid condition, so it forms a sort of a polar cluster with the energizing thyroid and the good nutrients, sugar, minerals, protein and so on, maintaining and energizing the structure, the emergency stress things, the prostaglandins, serotonin, histamine. Cortisol and estrogen are all on the short-term defensive side, but they, when they become dominant, they deform the proper regulatory systems."
**CONTEXT:** What is the interconnectedness of estrogen, clotting, serotonin, PUFAs, and low thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "That means that you're oxidizing things completely. If you oxidize fats completely, you get rid of any toxic effect from the free fatty acids. But you also stop producing lactic acid. And stop that whole route of inflammatory, harmful processes of free fatty acids and lactic acid. But the carbon dioxide itself binds to all of our proteins. For example, hemoglobin in a diabetic, they look at the amount of sugar or fragments attached to proteins such as hemoglobin. But... It's actually the breakdown of fatty acids which contribute about 95% of these glycated proteins that accumulate in diabetes and aging. But when we're producing enough carbon dioxide, it not only protects the cell by removing the excitatory calcium, but it also binds to... all of our proteins that have a lysine group or another amine group exposed and these amines are where the breakdown products, free radical fatty acids and so-called glycation end products, it's where they bind and so carbon dioxide binds protectively to proteins keeping them in the native youthful state. Which happens to be the things called hormone receptors are in a different state when there's adequate carbon dioxide. Insulin is in a different state, growth hormone, all of our peptide hormones can bind carbon dioxide becoming a different substance. So all of our hormone system is deranged if we just hyperventilate. And blow out too much carbon dioxide or if we're hypothyroid, basically we're in effect hyperventilating even at rest, producing lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide."
**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid hormone influence carbon dioxide (CO2) production, and what are the advantages of higher CO2 levels for cellular function and protein integrity?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the CO2 is itself anti-inflammatory. A lot of hospitals are now recognizing that they were killing patients by giving them pure oxygen or even hyperventilating them. They can prevent most of the hospital-induced lung failure and a lot of brain damage. By giving them carbon dioxide or you just hypoventilating them so they accumulate their own carbon dioxide to a protective anti-inflammatory degree."
**CONTEXT:** How does CO2 act as an anti-inflammatory agent, and what are the implications for medical treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** "If you lived in a non-industrial culture, they would not have to remove the thyroid when they sell a chicken or a fish and they would throw the beef and pork. Thyroid blends into a sausage mixture and so you would get dietary thyroid if you were eating the way people did even in America until 1940 when the FDA came in, agriculture department banned the sale of thyroid in food. But looking at the natural diet, everyone would be getting the equivalent of half a grain of glandular thyroid extract. Just as part of their ordinary animal food diet, shrimps, oysters, crabs, everything like that that doesn't have a vertebrate type of thyroid gland, eating those you get some thyroid in your diet. Milk contains some thyroid. So babies who otherwise would be cretins, as long as they're breast fed, they don't need a thyroid gland. They get enough thyroid in their mother's milk. After Three Mile Island, a lot of babies were born without thyroid glands, but no one noticed the breastfed babies didn't have a thyroid until they were weaned, and then they became hypothyroid drastically. So eating the right foods, avoiding the polyunsaturated fats and the... hard to digest types of starch in a lot of beans, for example, have starches that we can't digest. Those irritate the intestine, create endotoxin that interferes with thyroid function. So avoiding the toxic foods and emphasizing sweet fruits, milk cheese, eggs, shellfish. And among the meat, beef and lamb, if you include the fibrous parts that industrial societies tend to throw away, like in Mexico, you get the skin in various preparations. In Asia, they eat the tendons, ears, snouts, tails and everything that are very rich in gelatin. Which is a pro-thyroid protein because it doesn't contain the precursors to serotonin."
**CONTEXT:** For individuals without a thyroid gland, what are the dietary recommendations for obtaining thyroid support, and what foods are considered pro-thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** "Years ago, I read that women had a drastic hormone change when they were taking antibiotics. And I realized that was probably because of the hormonal effect of intestinal toxins. And... So I had some women measure their blood estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol and then eat a carrot a day for a few days and re-measure it. The carrot has antibiotics and the fiber can't be digested in the toxins by bacteria because of these antibiotics. And after just a few days of a daily carrot, their hormones were back in a very favorable state, reducing. estrogen and cortisol, increasing progesterone and thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** How can a daily raw carrot positively influence hormone balance, specifically by reducing estrogen and cortisol while increasing progesterone and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** "The very sweet, low fiber foods, filtered orange juice, well strained orange juice from sweet oranges. It's the safest that I know of and there are several tropical fruits, probably a hundred tropical fruits that are very safe and helpful. And one very odd food, if you have a centrifugal juicer, you can juice a raw potato and then cook the juice like you would scramble an egg. And you get rid of the starch, but you have a very... safe high-quality protein and mineral formulation. But in practice, good orange juice and a few other tropical fruits are very good for your liver and thyroid balance."
**CONTEXT:** What are the best food sources for supporting T4 to T3 conversion and overall thyroid health, particularly regarding sugars and liver support?

**RAY PEAT:** "Any of the indigestible fibers, the commercial orange juices, they've learned. Enzymically to create new chemical substances that they sell as pulp. It's an type of fiber that can't be digested and can't be removed from the juice once they've chemically altered it so that you want to avoid the commercial pulpy so-called orange juices. And if you make it yourself, just running it through a strainer is enough so that you don't feed the bacteria. with these fibers that we can't digest."
**CONTEXT:** Why is strained orange juice preferable to commercial pulpy varieties for supporting thyroid and liver health?

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well, I've had many very delicious crude simple homemade coconut oils that are great for ice cream and puddings and such but a lot of people are allergic to those aromatic tasty things and so just for safety, it's good to have it completely filtered so that there is no free fatty acid breakdown product and none of the solid particulate coconut matter or even the aromatic stuff because just for safety to avoid allergies but any of the purely saturated fats are anti-inflammatory and and so it's just that the coconut oil with the short chains, it's very quickly metabolized and so for things like losing weight, weight lifters have caught on to using the fractionated coconut oil to get evenly shorter average chain length because it intensely increases the metabolic rate to have those shorter saturated fats and their anti-inflammatory, anti-histamine and so on."
**CONTEXT:** What type of coconut oil is recommended, and why is it considered pro-thyroid and beneficial for metabolic rate?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, people are probably going to continue eating some vegetables just because they like them, but I encourage them to cook them to death. Cook them as much as like 40 minutes of boiling. It makes them a lot safer. There were experiments in the 1940s with rats. They fed a selection of vegetables, either canned vegetables or the same vegetables raw. And the ones eating the canned vegetables thrived and were well nourished. Even rats couldn't live on raw vegetables."
**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended preparation method for vegetables to enhance their safety and nutritional benefits, particularly in relation to thyroid function?
