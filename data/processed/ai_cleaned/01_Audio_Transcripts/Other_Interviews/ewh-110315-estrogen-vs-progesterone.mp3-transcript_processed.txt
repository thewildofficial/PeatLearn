**RAY PEAT:** You know, because you have lots of articles in a lot of your books. Um, correlated with that, what kind of got you to go down that avenue? Um, it really started just as a little kid growing up and noticing things. Whenever I would see a medical textbook, I would read that. They were generally more interesting than novels. And when I worked in the woods, one of the old timers pointed out that when they wanted a pine tree to bear, a pine tree to bear. seeds, they would chop it with an axe, and that made it bear fruit. And I heard stories about how stress would bring on puberty prematurely. And those ideas started blending with what I was hearing and seeing from, like, a woman in the 50s who took a shot of estrogen. She immediately came down with rheumatoid arthritis, which got worse with each injection and completely cleared up when she stopped using it. And a classmate's mother had a shot of estrogen for menopause and within 30 minutes was psychotic and was committed to the state institution for several months. And the daughter, the classmate, began using... contraceptives shortly after that, and died of a stroke. And other young women who were using those first very high estrogen contraceptives were being disabled by hemorrhaging and such. And so it was in the culture by the time I decided to go to graduate school in biology, but my intention was to study......brain biology, nerve biology, and that grew out of my interest in psychology and linguistics, but it turned out that the real science was being done in the endocrinology department rather than in the very ideological nerve biology area. The fact that I had moved from Mexico to Oregon about the time I started graduate school, I started noticing my own health was changing with the dark, rainy winters in Oregon, and I started hearing stories from girls who came to go to graduate school and would get a cheap basement apartment and would spend all winter with PMS. And so that, even though I hadn't yet started studying endocrinology, I was seeing more things that were coalescing into the interactions of the environment with the hormones. And I had been reading, I taught at school. I was assigned a course in physics for biology majors. And in reading widely to know how to orient that, I ran across Hans Selye's early work. And in the 40s, he had already very well characterized the functions of all of the steroid hormones. He wrote a thing called the Encyclopedia of. And he demonstrated that a large dose of estrogen created a shock condition that had all of the features of shock. And progesterone imitated all of the features of the stress-protecting hormones so that animals didn't need their adrenal glands. If they had a steady supply of progesterone or if they were pregnant. So the first reaction from a big dose of estrogen was known to be shock-like. And so when I shifted over in graduate school to the endocrine department, my project was reproductive aging just because that happened to be what the university... had in the field of endocrine research and my thesis advisor had demonstrated that estrogen causes miscarriage basically infertility but if you give the right dose at any stage of pregnancy it will cause abortion and he had demonstrated that vitamin E in large doses would delay age related infertility and my project was studying the oxidative changes in the uterus that occurred during aging and I found that the changes of the uterus with aging were the same as those produced by estrogen treatment. But also by a deficiency of vitamin E and also by radiation treatment. And I started seeing how relevant Hans Selye's work was showing the stress shock imitating effect of estrogen. And that, in fact, any kind of shock or stress. Has estrogenic effects, so you can make an animal go into estrus by irradiating it. Not just its head or ovaries, but any part of the body something is produced that has an estrogenic effect. If you put a plastic bag over a rat's head, it goes into estrus. Suffocation activates the so-called... estrogen receptors, and will actually increase the production of estrogen and the sensitivity to estrogen, and even without estrogen, those stress situations will imitate the functions of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What sparked your interest in the whole estrogen, progesterone, et cetera, hormonal thing?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's really the essential masculinizing hormone. The females can have it. at the crucial developmental stage, but they have a lot of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein that inactivates estrogen. So at that stage estrogen will create a male functioning organism while it won't affect the healthy female fetus or infant. Because the female is simply protected against estrogen by that special protein. So it's basic early function is as a masculine hormone. And the estrogen industry really is where the idea came from that it's a female hormone. It was identified in the ovary. But the main ovarian hormone, which is the feminizing hormone, is progesterone. And men have quite a bit of progesterone, but women, probably the reason women live longer than men is that they are able to produce much more progesterone than men, since men produce it mainly in their adrenal glands.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that estrogen is essentially a masculinizing hormone and that men and women both have it. Can you elaborate on the roles of estrogen and progesterone beyond the menstrual cycle and fertility?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's an excitatory transmitter. And its effect in females... The main effects are to cause the pituitary to produce prolactin, to cause the breasts to develop, produce more tubules and keep growing, where progesterone stops the growth and differentiates them, and to cause the uterus to expand greatly in preparation for pregnancy. But those effects, there's a great surge of estrogen right around the time of ovulation that lasts for about 12 hours. And that releases histamine in many tissues that activates a great surge of cell division. Both histamine and serotonin are released by estrogen. And pregnancy... requires that only in the sense that the uterus is activated and made sensitive to the contact of the fertilized ovum. And that preparatory activation is what estrogen is needed for. You can substitute many other irritants. You can cause implantation to happen just... with histamine in the absence of estrogen. So estrogen isn't really essential for reproduction by the female in that sense that you can substitute other things.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed estrogen's role in cell division and its connection to histamine and serotonin. You also mentioned that estrogen regulates blood sugar. Can you expand on that?

**RAY PEAT:** And the estrogen, that immediate water logging effect can be compensated by the adrenaline, the cortex, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone effect, which is to try to compensate for that leakiness. By increasing the sodium retention in the kidney, at first sodium falls in estrogen dominance as it goes out of the bloodstream into the tissue. But then activating this blood pressure regulating system, you can shift from low blood pressure and swollen feet to high blood pressure and all of the stress. Related cortisol dominant syndrome with even at an extreme you can get gangrene constriction of the blood vessels of the extremities and the calcification of soft tissues that the old endocrine textbooks used to mention. That was another thing that Hans Sely investigated in great depth. He called it calcifilaxis and calcergy in which the excited blood vessels first constrict and load up on calcium. Estrogen releasing histamine and serotonin precedes that, but calcification and then that you have to identify so the blood vessels can these injured areas tend to load up with iron in most cases and the iron increases the breakdown free radical production in these tissues so it can lead to such things as gangrene of the fingers and toes and scleroderma hardening of the skin in various areas that are stressed. And I've seen people recover in just a couple of weeks from scleroderma when they stopped using an estrogen supplement.

**CONTEXT:** What are some of the symptoms of estrogen dominance or progesterone deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** Since it's excitatory, it can temporarily increase alertness. It acts on the same enzymes that cocaine acts on to increase the adrenaline. action in the brain and increases verbal activity so that women can talk twice as fast as men under the influence of estrogen. And that's sold as a cognitive virtue except that that carried on for a long time is excitotoxic to the nerves and causes loss of nerve cell function. And the more acute effects of estrogen dominance in the brain can include chorea, sort of uncontrolled, unexpected movements of the arms and legs and such. And epilepsy or seizures are promoted by estrogen. Water retention is... really the first action of estrogen on the cell in exciting it causes it to take up water. Anything that... if you block the oxygen delivery to a cell, it'll take up water too. So the excitation moves the cell's requirements to a level that can't be sustained so the oxygen becomes deficient. It takes up water and shifts its pH and electrical charge and that same shift of water into the cell makes the walls of the blood vessels leaky to water. And so the water shifts, letting sodium and water both go into the tissues causing the feet to swell up while you're standing up. During the night, your face will share the water burden.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that stress can increase estrogen. What environmental factors contribute to this imbalance?

**RAY PEAT:** Something stressful in the environment. It tends to increase estrogen. This research goes back to about 1940. The Biskons showed that malnutrition, after the Second World War, they tested it on humans, but they had been testing it on rats, showing that malnutrition and other stresses would increase the estrogen, primarily in their studies. Malnutrition causes the liver to be unable to destroy estrogen, which normally 100% of the estrogen that gets to the liver is prepared for excretion by the kidneys or into the bile. And if the liver is underactive because of, for example, a protein or vitamin B deficiency or a thyroid deficiency, a hundred percent of the estrogen reaching the liver can pass right through it back into the bloodstream. And that recirculating estrogen then turns on the adrenal stress hormones directly by acting on the adrenal cortex and by blocking the ability of the thyroid gland to secrete the thyroid hormone which is needed by the liver. to inactivate estrogen, so a protein deficiency or a B vitamin deficiency is one of the things that can turn on absolute estrogen control and infertility. Thyroid used to be in the 1940s and before was recognized as the basic fertility drug. And as progesterone came to be understood, it was seen that thyroid is needed to turn cholesterol into progesterone to maintain a healthy pregnancy. And increasingly, one of the environmental factors that impairs liver function, increases estrogen activity, and inhibits thyroid function is the... unsaturated oil, polyunsaturated, so-called essential fatty acids. These are all anti-thyroid and pro-estrogen and anti-progesterone. And some French researchers who had been hearing the propaganda about fish oil being good for the brain decided that they would demonstrate that fetuses are smarter. When the mother is getting a fish oil supplement by doing a sound and response test on the woman's abdomen, getting the fetus reaction to a sound, and they found that the women who were getting the fish oil supplement, the fetuses had retarded learning reactions. That's what happened. When the babies were born, they found that not only were they smaller overall, but their brains were smaller. And if they had been paying attention to the animal research in the preceding 50 years, they would have seen that this is very predictable, that polyunsaturated fatty acids, by increasing estrogen, lowering thyroid and progesterone, retard the development of the brain of the fetus.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that polyunsaturated fats and fish oils can mimic estrogen's reaction, down-regulate the thyroid, and cause liver issues. Can you explain the role of the gut in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** The intestine is a very important factor because the liver excretes part of the estrogen through the kidneys by making it water soluble. But part of it which isn't that water soluble goes into the bile and is excreted with the feces, assuming everything is working right. Mm-hmm. If the wrong bacteria are present and the bowel is sluggish, which always happens in hypothyroidism, that estrogen tends to be reabsorbed, adding stress to the liver and raising the systemic estrogen level. So sometimes just an antibiotic will drastically and immediately lower your estrogen and... stress hormones and increase the progesterone just by limiting that reabsorption from the intestine. And that's what got me interested in the raw carrot effect. You see the same effect, lower estrogen and cortisol and higher progesterone within about three days of eating a raw carrot every day.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed estrogen's effects and its relationship with stress hormones. Can you explain the role of prolactin and its correlation with osteoporosis, cortisol, adrenaline, and histamine?

**RAY PEAT:** The brain, many people have been taught that mast cells or basophils are the only cells that produce histamine, but any cell in the body seems to be able to produce it. Cancer cells can produce it. Brain cells, there's a network in the lower part of the brain that specializes in histamine signaling. To the rest of the brain and it seems to be a stress organizing influence and serotonin is the other general stress signaling system in the brain. When anything goes wrong your brain activates the histamine and serotonin system and prolactin is one of the stress reacting hormones. ACTH and thyroid stimulating hormone or others. But the prolactin can be used as an indicator of many bad conditions. It tends to increase steadily with aging in both men and women. And the normal range for prolactin about 30 years ago... was lowered because they saw that people with the... I forget the units, but the standard number, the top had been 20, but they started seeing that that was really... the top number was increased because of the large number of women who were using birth control pills, and there was an epidemic of prolactin secreting pituitary tumors. resulting from the contraceptive estrogen exposure and so 30 years ago the healthy normal range for prolactin was set back to 2 to 12 and with age that's a healthy person will rise in old age maybe 8 or 10 or something like that but just a few years ago the top number was raised in some labs to 25 or 30 because the average person is now in a stressed hyperprolactinemic condition so if you don't feel reassured if your prolactin is only 18 or 20 on the test because everything is under stress when it's that high. It's been known for many years that prolactin is a major factor in bone loss. A long time editor of the yearbook of endocrinology in one of, I think it might have been the very last volume he edited. He said it's interesting that prolactin causes osteoporosis, that estrogen increases prolactin but people are being told that estrogen will prevent osteoporosis. And he said what's going on? And that was his last year as the editor of that book. And men develop osteoporosis progressively. with age and with increasing prolactin. So men also have a tendency for the estrogen to creep up with age pushing the prolactin and stress hormones up. So it isn't strictly a female thing, but when progesterone falls at the first missed period out. around menopause, that's when bone loss really picks up and prolactin becomes active under the unopposed influence of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that estrogen increases prolactin, which contributes to osteoporosis, yet estrogen is often prescribed to prevent it. Can you explain the historical basis for this and the animal models used?

**RAY PEAT:** In the textbook we used in my endocrinology course, Constance Martin pointed out that people had been looking for an effect of estrogen on the bones in various animals and humans. But at that time... in 1970, there had been no evidence that estrogen increased bone calcium retention, although it did increase the soft tissue calcification. That was very well established in animal research by the late 1960s. But the first model for... estrogen's effect on the bone they tried was the Beagle dog, and in them estrogen caused many problems including bone loss. But they found that rats were a good model. It turns out that cortisol also increases bone density in rats. Their endocrine systems are very different because they live at night and are very short-lived. It just turned out that rats were a good model for selling estrogen as a way to prevent bone loss, but the effect they could see that estrogen was immediately doing was reducing osteoclast activity. Therefore they said it stops bone turnover if you stop breaking down the bone. That's what you need to slow the bone loss and that was the whole basis. Interestingly, the animal research was the whole basis for selling estrogen for preventing bone loss. But human research was the basis for getting FDA approval for DES. and other estrogens in the first place because animal research had shown estrogen to be almost across the board toxic and carcinogenic. So they can use clinical reports in humans which are very subjective when they want to sell a product. But if they can find an animal model... where they don't have any data in humans, they'll use the animal model. So it's important to look at what the salesmen are referring to. Is it a clinical or an animal model? And how relevant and how valid are they?

**CONTEXT:** You've detailed how stress can lead to estrogen dominance and progesterone deficiency. Can you explain the specific mechanisms by which progesterone counteracts estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Stress will, if you just look at the protein that they call the estrogen receptor and the progesterone receptor, each one acts outside of that system, but those are useful places to focus your attention. Stress activates the estrogen receptor. And estrogen activates and maintains the estrogen receptor in most systems. But once the estrogen is acting, that turns on the cell's production of the progesterone receptor that binds progesterone. And when progesterone is available and fills that protein receptor, that ______ ______ ______. It destroys the estrogen receptor. So progesterone is an anti-estrogen in a very absolute sense. It knocks out the protein that keeps it in the cell. It knocks out the sulfatase and glucuronidase enzymes that allow it to condense in the cell. And it activates positively the enzymes that eliminate ______. estrogen from the cell and inhibits aromatase which makes new estrogen and so on. So there are seven or eight specific mechanisms by which progesterone neutralizes and destroys and eliminates estrogen. So many people have wanted to say that it synergizes with estrogen, but ______. It doesn't really, it destroys estrogen in a very thorough manner, but estrogen, if your body can respond, if it has thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol, which are the materials needed to convert cholesterol to progesterone, given an estrogen stimulation, your body will make a massive amount of progesterone. Get rid of the estrogen and go on to differentiate the functioning, for example, of the breast and the uterus for lactation and pregnancy. And the progesterone counters the effect on all of the peripheral effects. For example, estrogen activates the adrenal cortex to produce albastrone and cortisol. And progesterone not only counteracts that effect in the adrenal gland, but even if you're injected with albastrone and cortisol, if you have adequate progesterone, the peripheral effects of those hormones are blocked. Progesterone will serve in place of cortisol or albastrone if you don't have either of those hormones. Because the adrenals are removed, so it will let the kidneys function properly and take care of most inflammations and so on. But if you have an excess of albastrone and cortisol, progesterone also prevents the toxic effects of those hormones the way it protects against toxic effects of estrogen. So progesterone fields in. For a deficiency of many hormones and protects against an excess of those same hormones.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned the importance of thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol for progesterone production. What is the role of magnesium in this process, and how does it relate to inflammation and cellular energy?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, partly, uh. Jerry Aikawa was a magnesium specialist who wrote at least one good book on magnesium. He showed that the cell which needs magnesium for many functions, but, for example, ATP is stabilized in the presence of magnesium, and if magnesium is deficient, you're energy deficient. So, and, uh. nd that contributes to cell swelling. If the mast cell is magnesium deficient, it can't retain histamine and serotonin and other inflammatory things. And so, whatever holds magnesium inside the cell prevents inflammation and allows differentiation and good function. And Jerry Aikawa showed that thyroid the T3 especially is what is needed by the cell to retain magnesium and I think the production of ATP and carbon dioxide is the mechanism by which the thyroid regulates the retention of magnesium and the reduction of histamine, serotonin and other inflammatory things by magnesium and its association with high energy cell metabolism and production of carbon dioxide antagonize the improper actions of calcium when the cell is inflamed or de-energized. In the absence of thyroid and magnesium, it takes up calcium and the reason it takes up is partly because the calcium should be held in suspension in the blood as an ion combined with carbon dioxide or bicarbonate. If you lose the bicarbonate, then the calcium goes into the cell and keeps it in an excited inflamed state. And so the proper condition of the calcium goes with the availability of magnesium and the magnesium keeps the platelet as well as the mast cell from degranulating and putting out serotonin and other inflammatory and clot-promoting agents.

**CONTEXT:** You've highlighted the importance of nutrition for thyroid function and progesterone production. Can you elaborate on how to achieve this through diet, particularly regarding polyunsaturated fats and the role of sugar and coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** The factor of polyunsaturated fats... In the last 50 years, this has been probably the main thing interfering with thyroid function, and you can block that very quickly with coconut oil because of the quick availability of the short and medium chain saturated fats. They compete against the polyunsaturated fats for......producing oxygen in the mitochondria. The short-chain saturated fats are anti-inflammatory and have many indirect, helpful functions, but they provide energy so quickly that they block many of the actions of the polyunsaturated fats. And the thyroid and the mitochondrial energy production are constantly... under a breaking influence of the polyunsaturated fats. When you're under stress, you free fatty acids to circulate. So every time you're under stress, your thyroid function is blocked a little bit and your cellular ability to use sugar is blocked a little bit. Coconut oil gives you a temporary reprieve while it's being digested. For a couple hours after eating it, it interferes with that blocking system of the polyunsaturated fats. Sugar does the same thing, only it doesn't have the same competitive power against the fatty acids. When you're having enough sugar and saturated fatty acids... to interrupt the anti-metabolic effect of the polyunsaturated fats, your blood sugar is stable and more available to be used and stored in the liver. And the liver senses the availability of fuel, especially glucose, to govern your thyroid function. And the way it does that is......local rather than acting through your pituitary or thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland puts out about three parts of thyroxine for every part of active T3 hormone. And your liver, when it senses that you have enough fuel as glucose or short fatty acids, will allow the thyroxine to be turned into the active T3. And will provide a very high and adequate thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland itself directly contributes about 30% of the active stuff. So it takes a little while for a change in the thyroid gland to affect the metabolism where the liver is instantly monitoring the amount of fuel. And adjusting accordingly. So, as long as your liver has enough glucose stored as glycogen to keep your blood sugar steady for 8 hours or so, your metabolic rate will stay the same. As soon as your liver runs out of glucose, if you're not getting a steady supply from your food, then your T3 production falls immediately by... about 60 or 70 percent, and then your thyroid and pituitary sense those changes and will adjust slightly later than your liver.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the impact of polyunsaturated fats on thyroid function and the benefits of sugar and coconut oil. Can you explain the issues with starchy foods and the importance of protein intake?

**RAY PEAT:** No, there are many problems with the starchy foods, so I'm strongly against all of the grainy starches in particular. If you're going to have to eat a high carbohydrate meal, you're going to have to eat a high carbohydrate meal. starch just to get by. It should be cooked for maybe 40 minutes as a minimum and then eaten with cream, butter, or coconut oil because the starch grains very easily find their way into the bloodstream of other body fluids where they, in the bloodstream, they clog small arterioles. cause systemic injury chronically. They've demonstrated that in mice as well as people. Cooking the starch much more than normal and eating it with quite a bit of fat is protective, but still people keep sending me studies showing that in a study of five weeks or so. They argue that there's a great benefit from feeding a high starch diet rather than a high sugar diet. But when you look at the long-range effects, if they continued, you'd see a super obese, stressed, older animal if it lived on that same high starch diet where the sugar helps to regulate the adrenal and the thyroid. hormones and to moderate the insulin and other adaptive hormones and I don't advocate eating although I think a person should have at least 80 to 100 grams of good protein every day and more is okay but it's important not to eat too much protein by itself. I had the experience of almost fainting after eating. Just eggs for breakfast when I was in a hurry in a cold climate and I heard that it was fairly common for women on a diet if they just ate eggs to faint about an hour later because the egg protein is very high quality and stimulates insulin secretion which lowers the blood sugar and that calls for a very intense cortisol reaction and it often can produce a fainting reaction but it always produces the insulin cortisol reaction which has chronic cumulative effects aging your brain cells and immune system and so on. So it's very important to not burn the protein for a long time. You want the protein to be used as protein, not as a substitute for sugar and fat. So having it with sugar and fat.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and birth control pills, what are your thoughts on these and what alternative methods do you recommend for women?

**RAY PEAT:** The consumption of the menopausal hormones decreased drastically after the 2002 Women's Health Initiative results came out showing that estrogen causes strokes and heart attacks. Dementia and cancer, the things that they were selling it to prevent. But the industry always comes back with propaganda pieces in all the medical journals. And so a lot of women are again being indoctrinated to take it. The short term benefit is that it's very much like cocaine. It peps you up. If a person wants to withdraw from it, there's often a time of depression and low energy. And while adjusting the thyroid and progesterone and diet functions, sometimes it just helps to supplement coffee to keep the mental energy up. And the hot flashes are really, it's a... a complex set of reactions, but I experienced hot flashes when I traveled to Mexico and was exerting too much, too fast for not being adapted to the altitude. And every time I would stop and rest, I would have a hot flash. And that started me looking around and... I noticed young women who were working very hard were suffering hot flashes in their twenties. It isn't just a menopausal thing, but it's a stress, adrenaline, cortisol, very complex set of reactions. And the simplest, safest way to respond to them is, for example... If you have night sweats and hot flushes during the night, having a lot of carbohydrate at bedtime will normally be enough to stop them. And having a snack of a glass of orange juice and milk several times through the day will usually stop them. Some salty food to steady the blood sugar and adrenaline will very often. Be all it takes to stop the heart flashing.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that sugar can help with hot flashes. Can you clarify what types of carbohydrates you recommend and address concerns about high carbohydrate diets?

**RAY PEAT:** No, there are many problems with the starchy foods, so I'm strongly against all of the grainy starches in particular. If you're going to have to eat a high carbohydrate meal, you're going to have to eat a high carbohydrate meal. starch just to get by. It should be cooked for maybe 40 minutes as a minimum and then eaten with cream, butter, or coconut oil because the starch grains very easily find their way into the bloodstream of other body fluids where they, in the bloodstream, they clog small arterioles. cause systemic injury chronically.

Cooking the starch much more than normal and eating it with quite a bit of fat is protective, but still people keep sending me studies showing that in a study of five weeks or so. They argue that there's a great benefit from feeding a high starch diet rather than a high sugar diet. But when you look at the long-range effects, if they continued, you'd see a super obese, stressed, older animal if it lived on that same high starch diet where the sugar helps to regulate the adrenal and the thyroid. hormones and to moderate the insulin and other adaptive hormones and I don't advocate eating although I think a person should have at least 80 to 100 grams of good protein every day and more is okay but it's important not to eat too much protein by itself.

So it's very important to not burn the protein for a long time. You want the protein to be used as protein, not as a substitute for sugar and fat. So having it with sugar and fat.

**CONTEXT:** You recommend progesterone for certain conditions like epilepsy, MS, and arthritis. Can you elaborate on the types of progesterone and your preferred delivery methods?

**RAY PEAT:** For about 40 years I've been......telling people that I don't believe in hormone replacement therapy because I've seen so many people on dementia, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, other types of arthritis, and totally disabling diseases I've seen recover overnight from one dose of progesterone. Most of these people, I've seen them 10, 20, 30 years later and they still hadn't had a recurrence of that terrible problem. So I think of progesterone, if it doesn't work within a week, something else should be fixed. So I advocate the diet first. Thyroid next, and then you probably, if your cholesterol is okay, and you're eating right, and your thyroid is working, then you don't need progesterone. But for an emergency, the things I do recommend it for are epilepsy, other movement disorders, MS, dementia. All types of mental impairments and arthritis of all sorts. Any very acute migraine, it'll usually stop a migraine if you have some backup of thyroid function. It'll stop a migraine sometimes in two minutes with a big dose. So for any disabling acute thing, for example, there are studies now being done on brain trauma patients. If you can get the progesterone to them in the first day, they practically all recover where before they would have practically all died.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned Warburg's theory of cancer, which relates to the body's use of sugar and the impairment of mitochondria. Can you explain how estrogen and polyunsaturated fats relate to this theory and the concept of the Pasteur effect?

**RAY PEAT:** The instantaneous effect of either estrogen or... unsaturated fatty acids is to imitate the Barberg effect of lacking the Pasteur effect, which is for oxygen to turn off lactic acid. In the presence of high estrogen and high polyunsaturated fats, we'll make lactic acid and not be able to use the energy oxidatively.

**CONTEXT:** So, if I understand correctly, you're saying that a lack of sugar or the inability of cells to properly utilize sugar is contributing to cancer, and that estrogen and polyunsaturated fats exacerbate this by impairing oxidative energy production and promoting lactic acid buildup, similar to Warburg's findings?

**RAY PEAT:** The cancer is eating everything at a high rate, including wasting the sugar by turning it to lactic acid, which burdens the whole system and that. That turns on the stress system.
