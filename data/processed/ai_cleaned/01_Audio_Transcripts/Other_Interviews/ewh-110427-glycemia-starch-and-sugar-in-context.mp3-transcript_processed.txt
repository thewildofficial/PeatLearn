**RAY PEAT:** "One of the things was reading John Yudkin's book, the English guy who wrote a book saying that sugar causes heart disease. And he was very clear showing that sugar increases cholesterol, and that was back in the time when everyone was saying cholesterol causes heart disease. And I was very impressed by his research, but since I saw cholesterol as a protective factor from studying progesterone, I saw that if you were deficient in progesterone or under stress, your body would increase production of cholesterol to make more progesterone to protect your systems. And so, I believed Yudkin was on the right track, but since I saw cholesterol as protective rather than harmful, I took his evidence to mean that sugar would help resist stress. So that started me along that line. And I had been a migrainer for all my life, and I gradually came to see that a change in my rhythm of eating in relation to activity was usually what brought on a migraine attack. And often I would have very odd food cravings just before the migraine appeared. And even shortly after eating I would get food cravings. And I started trusting those cravings and eating again and I found that if I ate enough sweet stuff, like a quart of ice cream, when I felt a migraine coming on, it wouldn't come on. And I was also a sort of a problem sleeper if I stayed up just an hour or two after my normal bedtime. Then my sleep would be disturbed even for a couple following nights. And one night I was talking on the radio and I wanted to keep going hour after hour. And I had a friend go out and buy me huge milkshakes, about one an hour. And I was able to keep talking until 1 a.m. and didn't have any problem at all going to sleep. And so I recognized that I had a peculiar need for sugar when I was doing anything unusually stressful. And so that started me thinking more about the physiology of it."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking Ray Peat about his early research and personal experiences that led him to question the prevailing negative views on sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "Physiologically, what's the importance of getting the sugars in our body? At one time I was experimenting with chocolate as a source of magnesium. And I found that bitter chocolate, like coffee, was extremely high in magnesium and some other nutrients. But chocolate happens to be very high in leucine. And it would give me low blood sugar, and I would crave something to eat very shortly after eating a lump of black chocolate. And that started me thinking about the amino acids in relation to blood sugar. And I saw that several of the amino acids in proteins are powerful insulin stimulants. And when you eat protein by itself, you stimulate insulin secretion, which is needed to metabolize the amino acids. But in reaction to the insulin, your liver has to put out glucose to keep your blood sugar going, so your brain and blood cells and kidneys and so on can keep working. And if your liver is somewhat low on glycogen, then every time you eat protein and have an insulin secretion, your body secretes a compensating amount of cortisol to bring your blood sugar back up. But the cortisol brings your blood sugar up at the expense of protein. And so partly cortisol, the first tissues that cortisol breaks down are your thymus, gland, and other immune cells and the muscles. And if you eat lots of protein, in spite of the high cortisol, you can keep your balance such that you are replacing your muscles and thymus gland. But you are running on a constantly high cortisol. And my previous interest in diabetes, I had seen that doctors simply neglected to measure hormones that were related to blood sugar when they would prescribe insulin. Calling a person a diabetic, they said they needed to take insulin the rest of their life. But having some of these people test their cortisol, we saw that very many of these so-called diabetics just had very high cortisol. And sugar happens to be the best thing for lowering cortisol to normal. And since high cortisol gives the impression of diabetes causing high blood sugar, you get the unexpected effect of when you eat sugar, you lower the cortisol and some of these people had a very quick recovery from their so-called diabetes."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the physiological importance of sugars and how protein intake affects blood sugar and cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** "In Celier's studies, he never talked about adrenal fatigue. Exhaustion was his word. When you would stress an animal terribly, first couple of days it would get ulcers, and if it didn't bleed to death, it might adapt. But if you kept the stress up, you would eventually kill the rat from stress. And he had the different phases, the shock, the adaptation and the exhaustion phases. And in the exhaustion phase, the animal would die from stress. And he very early in his studies found that pregnant animals didn't need their adrenal glands. And as soon as they would have a litter, then the next stress would kill them because their progesterone was no longer being produced to compensate for the adrenal absence. And so he gave some animals a daily dose of progesterone after taking out their adrenal glands and found that they would live a full, normal, healthy life lacking their adrenals absolutely. So the adrenals are there to regulate your sugar and salt. And it happens that progesterone just as nicely regulates sugar and salt metabolism. And to produce these hormones, either progesterone or the adrenal hormones, you need various nutrients, but especially to convert cholesterol into pregnenolone and then the other steroids. The essential factors are thyroid hormone and vitamin A and those are so closely connected that they travel in the blood on the same protein and are taken up by the steroid synthesizing cells on that protein, transported right into the mitochondrion where enzymes use those to convert cholesterol into the pregnenolone and the other steroids. So, if a person is deficient in vitamin A or thyroid, their cholesterol tends to rise trying to compensate for the deficient ability to produce the adaptive hormones. And so, with a thyroid or nutritional deficiency, you can be deficient in the steroid hormones, but it isn't the fault of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are extremely adaptive. When someone wants an animal that can't produce adrenaline, since the core of the adrenal gland is where adrenaline is produced. They would scoop out the contents in the adrenal capsule, including the cortex, and there would be a layer of adrenal cortical cells left in this capsule. And within just a few days, the adrenal cortex hormones would have regenerated. So you can basically destroy the adrenals if you have a few cells left and have good nutrition and thyroid function. The adrenal cortex will regenerate very well."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are discussing adrenal fatigue and asking Ray Peat about the role of cortisol and the adrenal glands.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, that's where fructose and sucrose come in, because fructose is the most powerful sugar at regulating blood sugar both up and down. It's been used in diabetics for decades as a small supplement to help bring down their blood sugar, but it also is effective in hypoglycemia because it helps to regulate insulin production and slowly turns into glucose, helping to regulate glucose use, whether you're low or high as the starting point."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the role of sugars in blood sugar regulation, and Ray Peat explains the specific benefits of fructose.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, health food stores used to sell pure fructose, I don't know if they still do, since the sort of mania about it has started, or the phobia. But I think some bakeries use it, but I don't recommend it in any of those prepared foods, because it's almost always combined with starches. And starches have a very quick ability to turn into glucose where fructose is a very slow controlled converter into glucose and so it regulates insulin."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking for sources of fructose.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, several things imitate the function of insulin. For example, if a diabetic exercises, just whatever the exercise is doing is increasing the cell's ability to take up and use glucose. The leucine in some foods like chocolate acts like insulin and will duplicate the functions of insulin to let you use your sugar faster. But potassium, in these studies, they found that potassium itself has that effect, and that's probably one of the things involved in exercise, insulin-like action. And that, since fruits are one of the best sources of potassium, that is another thing that makes fruits a good food. Besides the usually they have about 50-50 fructose and glucose, sucrose molecule is one half fructose and half glucose. And besides that balance between glucose and sucrose, the fruits always contain a lot of potassium and some other minerals. Magnesium is another one that helps regulate glucose. So, when you take, for example, orange juice or grape juice or the fruit, the high potassium content reduces the amount of insulin you have to secrete to handle those. And that accounts for why they're much more smoothly handled than a similar number of calories in the form of starch."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about insulin-like activity and the role of potassium in glucose metabolism, particularly in relation to fruits.

**RAY PEAT:** "Almost all of the sweet fruits are on balance better than the alternative of eating bread and pasta and cereals and such. But among the sweet fruits there are some factors that make a choice possible. For example, bananas, unless they're ripened to the point that they're sort of a translucent amber mush, the average way people eat bananas is almost all starch with enough sugar to make them pleasant tasting. But the high starch content is not an ideal food, not only because it has a great tendency to stimulate insulin, but also because when you don't eat it with a lot of fat, the starch grains actually can get into your bloodstream. And large starch grains are often bigger than red blood cells, so they clog your small arterioles and cause chronic tissue injury. Gerhard Folkheimer was the person who did that in some of his articles with very nice photographs, microphotographs of plugged arteries and of the starch grains actually in process of being absorbed into the bloodstream and lymph system are on the internet. Besides the starch problem with some fruits such as bananas, you have the allergy problem, and I think that's partly because of the industrialization of banana farming, the use of a lot of chemicals and just overuse of the soil stresses the plants, and you've heard of the latex allergy, probably corresponding to the banana allergy. Both of those, the rubber trees and the banana plants, are both highly industrialized stressed crops, and I think it's the defensive stressed substances that the plants evolved to kill insects that were attacking them. Those highly cropped species produce this insecticidal enzyme, which happens to be highly allergenic to humans. So even apples, some brands of apples have quite a high allergen content. And cooking many of the allergenic fruits makes them safer to eat. And the same with the starches. Very well cooked, starchy fruits are much safer than the raw fruits. And a third factor in fruits to watch out for is the serotonin content in bananas again. Excel in their high serotonin content which has, before people were aware of it, they were diagnosing intestinal tumors when they found high serotonin content in the urine because some tumors produce excess serotonin. And if you eat bananas or prunes and plums, kiwis, several types of fruit are high in serotonin, so that's just one factor to be aware of. But starch and allergens are probably generally more important. And pretty much that leaves some things like watermelons and grapes and citrus fruits, oranges in particular."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking Ray Peat to recommend fruits and discuss which ones might be less beneficial, and why.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, pineapples are known to have a fairly high amount of cryptophane that can contribute to the serotonins. And mangoes, it's I'm not sure. They're in the same family as poison oak. And in the tropics, after I had enjoyed about a kilogram of mangoes, some people said, oh, didn't you know about mango sickness? And it's well known in the tropics, but I think it's partly that they are sort of a fibrous fruit, and partly if the fiber isn't handled by the right bacteria, it can cause toxin production in the intestine. My next newsletter is going to be relating to the issue of fiber, soluble fiber or anything, any carbohydrate that isn't sugar can potentially feed bacteria that produce toxins and cause systemic stress."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about specific fruits like mangoes and pineapples in relation to the previously discussed issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, serotonin, like endotoxin and histamine, serotonin is a major trigger of the stress adaptation system. And so, it turns on the hypothalamic protein hormone that turns on the pituitary hormone that turns on the adrenals. So, serotonin works at a very basic level to increase the stress reaction. And the Internet is full of people saying that sugar will raise your serotonin. But what I think what they're meaning is that you feel good after you eat a bunch of sugar. And feeling good is supposed to mean that your serotonin is up. But actually it's free fatty acids which cause your brain to take up more tryptophan and make more serotonin. And you produce more free fatty acids when your blood sugar is low and when you're under stress. So, stress or starvation, hypoglycemia will make you produce these free fatty acids which will send serotonin into your brain and trigger the adaptive stress reaction which brings out the cortisol."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the connection between serotonin, glucose, and the stress response.

**RAY PEAT:** "When you're at rest, the resting muscle is metabolizing a very small amount of fuel, just a maintenance amount, but it's fuel at rest is fatty acid and at maximal activity, you are burning almost pure sugar. And so at rest, the fat is being handled by your muscles and not causing any great rise in free fatty acids. The muscles use it just about as fast as it's released. But if your liver is well energized with a thyroid hormone, all the nutrients including adequate sugar, your liver is able to treat any excess free fatty acids produced by stress as any other toxin. And your liver can attach glucuronic acid to these fatty acids and excrete them in the urine and bile just as if it was insecticide or something you had eaten. So a healthy liver, keeping your liver well energized with thyroid and sugar will gradually help you get rid of stored fat. And other When you exercise on, for example, a low-carbohydrate diet and start mobilizing more and more of these free fatty acids, some of them, at an extreme, will turn into ketones, and the ketones are good, safe energy for your brain and heart. And the It's the free fatty acids that don't turn into ketones, which are harmful, and the problem with most of the free fatty acids is that on our current or 20th century diet, these, our tissues, are pretty well filled with polyunsaturated fatty acids, and these, when they're liberated, instead of supporting the full high-reach metabolism, they suppress the mitochondrial metabolism by interfering with the thyroid hormone in proportion to how unsaturated they are, and so as soon as you get stressed enough to start eating your own stored fats, these stored fats, if they're polyunsaturated, happen to block the thyroid function and turn your metabolism down. So you, within two or three days of going on a diet, a person's metabolic rate drops so tremendously that at the end of 10 to 14 days, they have lost very little weight, but almost all of that weight is muscle tissue because of the stress produced by the low blood sugar. When they put people on a moderate low-calorie diet for the same length of time, they find that they lose mostly fat and very little protein tissue, so it's the degree of the free fatty acids being mobilized that suppress your ability to burn calories."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the dangers of liberating free fatty acids and the impact on weight loss and metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Rats, giving them various kinds of fiber, many of the most popular health food fibers, increased the toxin formation in their intestines, and they found that with fiber added to the diet, fiber that could be fermented by bacteria, the animals became both anxious and aggressive. Just leaving that fermentable fiber out, the animals were friendly and confident. The commercial orange juice in the last few years, there have been new technologies developed. You might have noticed that there is more pulpy orange juice on the market. I think it was about 15 years ago the Environmental Protection Agency told the industry that there are mountains of orange juice waste from making orange juice were attracting too many insects and other pests and they had to find a way to dispose of it and one of the technologies that they used to dispose of it was to dissolve it with enzymes and to leave a large part of the pulp dissolved in the orange juice. When you squeeze a ripe orange naturally, if you let it stand in a glass in the fridge for a few hours, the bottom will be orange and the top will be clear, but much of the commercial orange juice, the fiber has been chemically altered so that it will never settle out and it's actually a new chemical substance that people have never eaten before. It's like any of the other gums or fibers that can be intestinal toxins. It's almost like caramogenite juice. Many of these fibers that people were thinking they were eating to protect against colon cancer, some of them actually increase the incidence of colon cancer in experimental animals. So now they're using humans to dispose of all that. Everything, instead of throwing it out for the insects, we're just becoming the disposal of gray, cool."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about Ray Peat's recommendation for orange juice without pulp and the potential issues with processed fibers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, one of the functions of cortisol is to maintain blood sugar, but one of the ways it does that is to block the use of sugar for most purposes. Red cells can keep using it in the presence of cortisol, but immune cells that the thymus consists of mostly can't use sugar in the presence of cortisol and the presence of cortisol forces them to metabolize fats, and especially unsaturated fats will quickly kill the thymus. And it only takes, I think it's about three hours typically, for the thymus gland to disappear during profound stress. And so if a person is killed really instantly out of a young age, they'll still have a thymus gland. But if it takes them a few hours to die, the thymus gland disappears and that's really part of the reason that they've thought that the thymus disappears in adulthood because by the time a person is dead, they will have gone through some stress that melts the thymus gland very quickly. The right nutrition and hormones, the thymus can almost as quickly regenerate itself."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are discussing the shrinking of the thymus with age and asking Ray Peat for his perspective on the role of stress and nutrition.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the low fiber, low starch things, there are a few of them that are called vegetables. For example, small summer squash. They're actually fruits, but since they are, they end up more starchy. They're usually thought of as a vegetable. But if you eat a tender summer squash with some butter, the small amount of starch in it, if it's well cooked and eaten with butter, it's very similar to eating fruit, high potassium content, high magnesium."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about Ray Peat's recommendations for vegetables in relation to sugars.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, generally the roots don't have, fruits are almost designed as food. They're food for the seeds and so they aren't designed as a tissue that has to replace itself. Like the leaves are part of the energy factory of the plant. And the roots are essential, but they're protected against grazing animals, for example. And so they have anti-fungal chemicals more than anti-grazing animal chemicals. And so, aside from those mild toxins that are mostly directed at bacteria and fungus, the roots are pretty free of the plant-defensive toxins. And so, if they're cooked, for example, young turnips and young potatoes that haven't maximized their starch production, eaten with butter after being thoroughly cooked. Potatoes are pretty safe and potatoes are almost unique among the plant materials. The liquid part of the potato in between the starch grains happens to have the equivalent of amino acids besides some protein. These are keto acids which They can be used as fuel by the brain and heart as a substitute for sugar or fatty acids and they're really an ideal anti-stress fuel but they can also be, just by attaching an ammonia group, they can be turned instantly into the essential amino acids as needed. And so the, apart from the stark, the potato is a very amazing food. And I've seen a few cases of people who had basically incurable problems, undiagnosed but they were clearly dying, who, just juicing a few pounds of potatoes and cooking the juice. With a centrifugal juicer you throw out the starch grains almost completely and then you cook it just like you were scrambling an egg and the juice coagulates so it's sort of like limp mashed potatoes. And this provides both energy and the essential amino acids but without stimulating insulin or cortisol. So it's sort of an emergency food for almost any stress problem. R.L. Veitch is the famous ketone researcher who his ideas are now being applied to cure Alzheimer's disease because the ketones provide energy that the deteriorating brain can't get from either fat or sugar. And so I think potato juice would be a fairly economical and safe way to get the ketones that Veatch has been recommending."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about Ray Peat's recommendations for vegetables, specifically roots, and he elaborates on the benefits of potatoes and potato juice.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the people that I've known who used it, one was a man who hadn't slept for months and had almost no mentality, but his sister made him a big bowl of the cooked juice, and before he finished the bowl, he was asleep. He simply energized his brain enough that the stress hormones that he had been suffering from for months disappeared. And another one was a girl who couldn't digest anything. She tried all kinds of food, but she had wasted away to about 65 pounds. Every time she would eat normal food, she would burp ammonia, and that was what gave me the idea because RLV. had used his synthetic ketones for treating kidney disease patients who had the problem of disposing of excess ammonia if they ate proteins. And since I knew that potatoes contained the ketones, I made her some juice and she ate it without burping ammonia and digested it perfectly well. And she ate it perfectly well. Just a few days of doing that and she was completely recovered. Just went straight up to 130 pounds."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking how to use potato juice therapeutically and Ray Peat provides examples of its effectiveness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Honey is, basically, it's almost pure sugar with some minerals, and so it's a good food. It isn't that much greater than just plain white sugar, but slightly nutritious. Maple syrup is probably, chemically, it's probably more nutritious than honey. It has a very high potassium and good magnesium content, but the problem is that it's heat-treated, boiled down, and very hot oxygen-exposed glucose can make some allergens, so you have to be cautious with any of the dark, concentrated sugars, like molasses from cane sugar, or the maguey agave sugar, the same thing. It's boiled down until it's potentially allergenic."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about Ray Peat's thoughts on honey and maple syrup.

**RAY PEAT:** "For about 45 years now, the mechanism of how diabetes comes to exist has been understood. It was an Argentine who did the first studies that just sort of incidentally showed that sugar was actually protective against diabetes, but some Israeli researchers over the last 15 years or so have very clearly shown that it's the polyunsaturated fats. And this was very clearly set up by a man named Randall, and it some people refer to it as the Randall Cycle, except there's no cycle involved. It's he showed that as your free fatty acids increase, your ability to use glucose decreases. And that has been seen in hospitalized patients when they give them an intravenous emulsion of soy oil, for example. Within 15 minutes, their ability to metabolize glucose has practically disappeared. The Randall cycle is the instantaneous diabetogenic effect of the fatty acids, but if you do that chronically, you not only block the various tissue cells from using glucose, but you gradually over-stress and poison the beta cells in the pancreas from being able to keep producing insulin. And in some of the studies that I mentioned in a couple of newsletters, they have found that sugar stimulates regeneration of the beta cells in the pancreas. That was back in like the 1940s, right? Well, that regeneration was just about five years ago. But it was in the 1940s that the first research was showing that sugar was protective."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking Ray Peat to explain why he recommends sucrose (table sugar) and why it's often misunderstood, contrasting it with the prevailing view that sugar causes diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can produce the toxic effects in the animals. That's what so many people are doing, giving them 60% of their diet as sucrose or fructose. And at that point, you can make some fat. get various signs that they interpret as harmful. But a lot of these studies, even at the very high levels, they're exaggerating taking things as sign of harm, which are actually signs of adaptive corrective functions that if you extrapolate from their results that they get in five weeks or ten weeks. In animal studies, if you extrapolate the very data that they're publishing, it would look like the animals would have a better outcome at the end of their lifespan if they stayed on even the high fructose diets. There are a lot of these studies that are very clearly designed as propaganda against fructose. I don't have any idea what their motivation is, but they're biologically and biochemically irrational and irrelevant. Probably about 100 people have sent me certain studies, three or four studies in particular keep appearing, somehow they're circulating on the internet, and when you look at those that are being used as propaganda against fructose, they contain information that suggests even large amounts of fructose might be therapeutic, but they're going back 20 or 30 years, you see enough research that it's actually defining the mechanism, so you can somewhat judge how much fructose in the diet is safe. For example, there were studies in which they added to just a standard lab cow mixture. They would add the ability to drink, say, a 30% sucrose water, a very syrupy solution, or they could choose Coca-Cola. Plus, their lab cow drink as much as they wanted, or different percentages, but usually a pretty high percentage of sucrose in the diet. And these animals, given, for example, Coca-Cola, or the equivalent in sucrose, were able to eat 50% more food than the animals on just the lab cow without getting fat. In other words, a tremendous increase in their metabolic rate. And that's one of the clues to the protective therapeutic effects of fructose is that it catalyzes your ability to oxidize glucose at a higher rate. And so for a failing heart, for example, or a damaged liver, it works like the active T3, part of the thyroid hormone, to increase the production of ATP and get the cell going as a catalyst. And it doesn't really take very much fructose to have that boosting catalytic effect. So there's I don't know what the minimum is, but just a very small percentage of your diet can have an extremely beneficial effect. And then there's a middle range where it's still not clear how much is safe. And then the extreme range where you're eating almost nothing but sucrose or fructose, where you do get some degenerative processes. But those are being misrepresented really out of context by so many people."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the dosage and safety of fructose and sucrose, and Ray Peat addresses the propaganda against fructose and its therapeutic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when you look at the figures over the last 50 years for the national diet in the United States and a few other countries, a few people are saying that it's the high fructose corn syrup or or the white sugar or something that's causing these degenerative diseases, diabetes, obesity and so on, but the real figures show that what's increasing is calories and polyunsaturated fats and starches and actually a slight decrease in the proportion of the sugars in that total, but the the calorie consumption has increased, but mostly through starch and polyunsaturated fats, and those are the things that I think are well-established for causing obesity and a lot of the degenerative diseases. In the case of insulin, it's very clear that it's polyunsaturated fats."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking Ray Peat to clarify the role of sugars versus polyunsaturated fats in causing degenerative diseases like diabetes and obesity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes. What's your thoughts on... It's obviously very clear considering the amount of sugar that's been taken, how phobic people are to sugar, how it's clearly not having an influence looking at the numbers, just like you were saying, right? I've always thought that the same. I just never knew how to just didn't know what it was I was looking at. It makes perfect sense with the shift in the diet."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are reflecting on the disconnect between the public's fear of sugar and the actual dietary trends and their health consequences.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are some studies that show that the toxic effect of these fibers that can cause anxiety, aggression, and bowel cancer, fats defend against those processes by probably suppressing bacterial growth. The best fats at suppressing bacterial and fungal growth in the intestine are the saturated fats, so butter and coconut oil, for example, are protective against the fibers, so it's important to include some of those in your daily intake. And if you get enough protein, 80 to 100 calories or more, 80 to 100 grams per day or more, and if you consider the importance of fat and the essentiality of protein, then that leaves you only a certain amount for carbohydrate. And that, I think, is where fruit sugar and other sugars are a safe bet. Even if all the rest of your calories are in the form of fruit and other sugars, I think that's safe. As long as you're getting your saturated fat and protein."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the role of fats in mitigating the negative effects of fiber and the overall balance of macronutrients.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid deficiency is the most common reason for that. The enzymes are very sensitive to the presence or absence of thyroid. Selenium is needed to activate the thyroid, and ultimately the other B vitamins and all the nutrients aren't needed, but the most common problems are low thyroid and low selenium. But to use the selenium to activate the thyroid, you need glucose. And the fructose happens to be the best stimulant for the liver to store glycogen. That's the current phobia. People are talking about fructose increasing triglycerides but before it does that it powerfully helps the liver to replenish its glycogen stores. And then if you eat too much you can eat a lot of excess sugar but since it stimulates your metabolic rate it takes a big excess before you start. Converting much of it to the triglycerides and these triglycerides are then available for storage in your fat tissue. So the animal studies show that you can eat lots more calories in the form of sugar before you start storing the triglycerides in your adipose tissue."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the inability to store glycogen and the liver's role, and Ray Peat explains the importance of thyroid, selenium, and fructose.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some people who have been low thyroid for a long time have bacteria is living right up their top side of their intestine, right up near the stomach. And some people even get conditions that will support fungal growth in their stomach. And those, usually about two or three people somewhere in the world are in that condition where if they drink juice they'll get drunk because their stomach is brewing alcohol at a high rate. But short of that, lots of people have a reaction from bacteria high up in the intestine which are competing for their absorptive systems. The bacteria get the sugar as fast as they do. And usually the bacteria live in the lower parts of the intestine and the sugar is usually absorbed very quickly in the upper part of the intestine and doesn't reach the bacteria. So if someone has been under stress and low thyroid, they can have that bacterial problem that makes them sensitive to sugars."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about sugar intolerance and potential reasons for adverse reactions to fruits and juices.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's probably analogous to the lactose problem. They talk about a lactase deficiency, but bacterial toxins injure the lining of the intestine. These studies have, I think there was one or two that showed a similar effect with sucrose, but quite a few studies have shown that sickness can create the lactase deficiency, low thyroid, low progesterone, or a bacterial infection. Those are three of the known factors that affect the intestine's ability to break down lactose. And so you can, besides using small amounts of milk, or in the case of the juice-sensitive people, small amounts, you would want to experiment with things that suppress the bacterial growth and replenish your thyroid and progesterone levels so that you can produce the proper sucrase and lactase enzymes. And that's one of the things that the fungicidal root vegetables can do. Raw carrot contains its defensive antibiotics that allow it to live in moist soil without rotting. And so if you grate a carrot or just eat raw carrots, you're suppressing a lot of these bacteria and fungi that will cause food reactions. And another plant that grows in dark, moist conditions are the bamboo shoots. They're white because they haven't been exposed to the sunlight. And so they're growing in humid, warm conditions. And they are a good source of antibiotics."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking how to address sugar sensitivity and potential gut issues, and Ray Peat suggests strategies involving suppressing bacterial growth and supporting thyroid and progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Rene Duboe, who was a bacteriologist mostly, mentioned that, I think he had some pictures of the Candida type yeast, which were starved. When they're fed sugar, if you have a lot of them in your stomach, you can get drunk on the fermenting sugars. But in the intestine, normally, if they're living far enough up that they even get the sugar, they should be way down in the lower intestine. Your sugar should be absorbed in the upper couple of feet, two or three feet of intestine. But if they do get sugar, the worst they can do is make ethanol. And ethanol in small amounts isn't at all harmful. And Duboe showed that if you starve these yeasts that are just happily making some ethanol out of the sugar, when they don't get sugar, they start sending out pseudopods, or pseudohyphae, I think he calls them, which are invasive filaments that will sink into the intestine looking for sugar. And that's the point at which they can actually travel through your intestine and get into your systemic tissues looking for more glucose. So really having sugar in your diet, if you have a fair infestation of yeast, for some reason, in your intestine, sugar is a defensive means while you're trying to figure out how to get rid of the yeast, which carrots will usually do fairly quickly."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the common advice to cut out sugar for Candida overgrowth and Ray Peat explains why this approach can be counterproductive.

**RAY PEAT:** "In themselves, I think they're pretty harmless, but the problem is that there have been quite a few studies in both humans and animals in which the sweet taste activates your sugar metabolizing systems very powerfully. And One of the consequences is that they tend to increase your appetite and they make you eat or want more calories than if you had eaten sugar. And so as a diet food they're ineffective and the fact that they're causing such major changes in things like glucagon and insulin and several of the related glucose handling systems, they haven't been in enough situations that people really know what the long-range effects are going to be. They might contribute to chronic stress, for example, by constantly confusing your system, telling you your glucose-regulating systems that you're being provided what you need, and then it turns out that you aren't, and so it triggers more of the cortisol to maintain the blood sugar."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about the safety of artificial sweeteners like xylitol.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think things that activate your skin cause it to produce more moisture and oil, and make it more attractive for germs to grow. Vitamin A is essential for several defensive processes including the immune system and all of your surfaces become susceptible to infection in the vitamin A deficiency, but especially an increasingly warm, moist, functioning skin needs more vitamin A. For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov Which uses vitamin A to make the steroids will make your skin moister and oilier under most conditions and so sugar activating your thyroid revs up your ability of your skin cells to produce what they should be producing except if you're deficient in vitamin A or some other immune factor. Then you're going to grow bacteria in your skin. So it's more of an immune system kind of inhibition that's creating it."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about acne that can occur when introducing sugars and Ray Peat explains the role of vitamin A and immune function.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's the polyunsaturated fats, very clearly. In many of the animal studies, sucrose, because of its fructose component, increases the ability to dispose of glucose nicely, so either increasing insulin sensitivity or not affecting it, but still preventing hyperglycemia from eating more sugar. You can instantly demonstrate the effect of polyunsaturated fats blocking the ability to use glucose."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking Ray Peat about the cause of insulin resistance, contrasting it with the common belief that sugar is the culprit.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, frequent feeding is one of the things that will help to keep from having the up and down reaction. The fatter a person is, the longer it's going to take to get away from those. Stress reactions, every time you forget to eat the right things. And women, with the monthly cycle, have to keep that in mind. That the ability to handle sugar and fat varies with the amount of estrogen, thyroid, and progesterone. And so typically women will have relapse after a couple of weeks when they get into that part of their cycle, so women should think in terms of that maybe six weeks before they can get past the cycle of ups and downs."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about persistent low temperature despite following a healthier diet and Ray Peat discusses the importance of frequent feeding and hormonal fluctuations in women.

**RAY PEAT:** "Surprisingly, some of the things that are blamed on fructose, such as increasing triglycerides, estrogen has been known to do that. Cortisol is really the main thing that increases the so-called inappropriate blood lipids. Good triglycerides made from sugar or other carbohydrate really aren't harmful. They're just evidence that you're under stress and eating more than you need. And insulin and cortisol are usually the main factors increasing triglycerides. But estrogen tends to interfere with the oxidation of glucose and shifts you to being forced to oxidize polyunsaturated fats and tends to give you lower blood sugar problems at least temporarily under the influence and chronically all of the effects of impaired glucose oxidation and increased reliance on fatty acids. And the oxidative metabolism is disturbed in numerous ways by an excess of estrogen so androgens and progesterone and thyroid are all protective against those effects of estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking Ray Peat to elaborate on the role of estrogen in relation to sugar metabolism and inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, sometimes salt will help with that. One on their monthly cycle. At high estrogen times, we'll typically have either or both sugar and salt cravings. And women avoid eating salt, for example, because they're told it will cause them to retain water. But it's also a diuretic, so if they overcome that phobia and eat salt just as they crave it, it will usually prevent many of the symptoms of the premenstrual problem of water retention and edema. The sodium helps to increase your metabolic rate, so you use sugar more efficiently. And so when you have a sugar craving, having something both salty and sugary is probably the best."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking about sugar cravings and Ray Peat explains the connection to salt and hormonal cycles.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, yeah, your appetite is a pretty good guide. When you get low blood sugar, if you have a very concentrated form of sugar rather than fruit, if you eat a pound or two of candy, for example, You'll probably feel sick. It probably is injuring your stomach just by its osmotic concentration and it can cause diarrhea when it disturbs your intestine and stomach enough to overcome the adaptive ability to absorb it and handle it. Most of the claims of people like Lustig are really based on a lot of mistakes and misleading interpretations. I advocate using the fats regularly every time you eat. It's good to have some fat and protein at the same time. I think appetite will usually tell a person that something is wrong if they try to go several hours with nothing but a lot of sugar."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking if it's possible to eat too much sugar and Ray Peat addresses the concept of appetite as a guide and the potential for osmotic distress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Stimulating the metabolic rate, different studies say that it increases your ability by 25% or 50% to burn calories. And if you're backing that up with a balance of saturated fats and good proteins, it really is a help for losing weight. But two other factors that help to increase your metabolic rate are the salt and calcium. And that's why I advocate cheese and milk. As good proteins because of their high calcium content, which helps to raise your body temperature and metabolic rate."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking if Ray Peat advocates for increasing sugar intake to lose weight, and he explains how it can boost metabolism when balanced with fats and proteins.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes. is fine and cheese, if you can get cheeses without additives, they're nutritionally just about as valuable as fresh milk. But the starches in corn and other grains are complex enough that a lot of them won't be digested by human enzymes and so they feed bacteria. For more UN videos visit www.un.org The type of bacteria that you happen to have will govern the kind of reaction you have to those starches. So having a food like raw carrot in your diet regularly helps if you're going to eat some starches periodically. Carrot helps to reduce those allergy effects that cause mucus."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about cow's milk causing mucus and if stopping corn starch would help, and Ray Peat explains the role of starches, bacteria, and raw carrots.

**RAY PEAT:** "I'd like to go back to cow's milk because it's cheaper and it's easier to get. So I guess that if I had the carrot then I would be able to go back to cow's milk and get off goat's milk. And sometimes changing the brand, I've noticed that at the same supermarket one brand of milk will cause digestive irritation, something the cows ate, I think. And if the milk tastes good, I find it usually is easiest on my digestion. And some people have told me that the ultra-pasteurized milk that was heated to a very high temperature, it's a little lower in some nutrients, but people tell me that they can handle that better than fresh milk. And other people. React to that, but don't react to fresh milk, so trying switching brands of cow's milk might make a difference."

**CONTEXT:** The caller is following up on Ray Peat's advice about carrots and cow's milk, and Ray Peat offers further suggestions regarding milk brands and processing.

**RAY PEAT:** "It contains a little bit of sugar, and that's pretty much the only thing you absorb from it. If you eat a lot of it and have a low thyroid, you might absorb enough carotene to have an anti-thyroid effect. So you want to look at the palms of your hands occasionally to see that you aren't getting orange calluses. But it prevents the absorption of anything you eat with it or slows it greatly. So you don't want to eat a big plate of carrot salad when you're eating your main meal, because you might have low blood sugar for a couple of hours because it's blocking the nutrients."

**CONTEXT:** The hosts are asking if raw carrots should be eaten alone or with other sugars, and Ray Peat explains the potential effects of consuming large amounts of carrots, especially with low thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "The parathyroid hormone tends to promote tumor growth and eating plenty of calcium and adequate amounts of vitamin D and vitamin K, K1 and K2. They help you handle the calcium and I think probably takes 1,500 milligrams a day of calcium anyway to get your parathyroid hormone down into a safe range."

**CONTEXT:** A caller with stage 4 melanoma asks for dietary advice, and Ray Peat addresses the importance of calcium intake in relation to parathyroid hormone and tumor growth.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think seeds and nuts are a problem for anyone. Because of the unsaturated fats in them. And coconut oil, I think refined odorless coconut oil can be a big part of your calorie intake. Some cancer therapies have used, I think, as much as five ounces a day of refined coconut oil."

**CONTEXT:** The caller mentions a history of eating seeds, nuts, and vegetables, and Ray Peat advises against seeds and nuts due to their unsaturated fat content, while recommending coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "People who funded those labs in the laboratory, I mean, that's a huge factor in regards to what they're looking for in my opinion."

**CONTEXT:** The caller mentions research on fish oil and melanoma, and Ray Peat comments on the potential influence of funding on research outcomes.

**RAY PEAT:** "I have had outbreaks of things that a couple doctors were sure were melanomas, big black groin things. And when I have an outbreak of those, I a few times have applied either progesterone or DHEA near them, and they quickly moved away or disappeared or fell off, but basically increasing my thyroid to the point where I'm hypermetabolic will make all of the visible ones dry up and stop growing or eventually fall off."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about Ray Peat's experience with potential melanomas, and he shares his personal approach involving progesterone, DHEA, and thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, what I've always used since the original Armour stuff being available 20 years ago, I've been using either Cytomel or Sinomel, a Mexican version of Cytomel, which is quick acting, and so you can adjust the dose up and down so if you get too hypermetabolic and out of breath you can stop taking it for a few hours and come back to a comfortable level. But I've seen several people, someone just a few weeks ago had a mole that was growing and was about two inches long and within a week when he took big doses of cytomel it had disappeared."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if desiccated thyroid would be a good idea, and Ray Peat recommends Cytomel (T3) for its quick action and adjustability, sharing an anecdote about its effectiveness.

**RAY PEAT:** "For a person who's in a hurry, that's a way to find your total requirement. So when you're converting the dose, how much how does the T3 convert to the T4 in equivalency? The traditional equivalency is 100 micrograms of T4 are equivalent to 25 micrograms of T3 or one grain of traditional armor thyroid, but that really depends on how much sugar is in your diet and how high your cortisol is and several things. So those are just traditional rough estimates. It might be very different for some people."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about converting T3 to T4 equivalency for thyroid dosing, and Ray Peat explains the traditional conversion rates and the factors that can influence them.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well, the body only produces four micrograms per hour, typically. And so whenever you take more than that, if you're going to take 10 micrograms, it's good to have it with food so you don't absorb so much that your body experiences the excess. It's good to supplement in something like 2 micrograms per hour on average, so 10 micrograms with lunch will spread out for a few hours as you digest."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about typical T3 dosages and how to manage them, and Ray Peat provides guidance on absorption and timing.

**RAY PEAT:** "For falling asleep, sometimes a very small dose of thyroid. One doctor who had been awake for two or three days, absolutely awake. I gave him 10 micrograms of cytomel and the next day he said, that stuff's better than morphine. I've been taking Xenoplus and it worked the first day and then the effect wore off. Yeah, the sugar is the next best thing. I use a glass of sugar with maybe two or three tablespoons, a glass of warm milk, and three tablespoons of sugar dissolved, and it will usually have an effect similar to the thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about delayed sleep phase syndrome and potential issues with adrenaline, and Ray Peat suggests small doses of thyroid or sugar with warm milk for sleep.
