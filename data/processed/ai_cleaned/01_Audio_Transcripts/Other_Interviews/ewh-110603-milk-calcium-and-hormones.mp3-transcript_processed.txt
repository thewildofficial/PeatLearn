**RAY PEAT:** "I've been interested in milk for a long time. Probably 55 years or so, I've been studying what's going on with the cultural antagonisms to it. It was in the 50s when the government had been collecting samples of organisms from around the world to monitor the effects of the atom bomb tests. And they wanted to know how it was accumulating in young people. And so they started collecting baby teeth. And the isotope that concentrated most in teeth happened to be strontium-90. And then after they had been doing that for years, it came out that strontium-90 was causing leukemia in children, among other cancers. But when that got into the news, people said, well, baby teeth show the radioactive isotope which is similar to calcium, and milk is rich in calcium, and milk is probably the main place babies are getting their strontium-90. So a whole wave went through the culture for a few years. Advising people not to drink milk because of the strontium-90 in it, but already in the 1950s, 56 or 7, people had analyzed the composition of diets and found that the fallout into the soil produced quite a high ratio of strontium-90 to available calcium. But plants extracted the calcium, since that was __________. __________ needed and left behind a good proportion of the strontium. And then when cows ate the vegetation, they again extracted a high proportion of calcium and left out a lot of strontium. And so when you add up to get the essential nutrients, if you get them from vegetable matter rather than milk, you're __________. getting extremely high concentrations of the fallout isotopes. And milk is a good filtering process to eliminate all kinds of contaminants, especially in a period of high radiation. It filters out the radioactive isotopes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the perceived degradation of milk and why people are afraid of it, leading to discussions about allergies and intolerance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Actually, the United States cleaned up the commercial dairy industry 40 or 50 years ago, cut out the use of the most dangerous insecticides that had been getting into the milk. And were known to cause breast cancer and other things. But in the 60s, the Environmental Protection Agency and FDA banned the use of these insecticides around cows and dairies. And they controlled somewhat the additives going into the cow food. Israel was quite a bit slower than the U.S. to ban. One of these insecticides in particular, but when they did in the 60s, their breast cancer rate plunged tremendously. But the U.S. on that particular issue had been leading the world in cleaning up the milk supply, and that was far ahead of cleaning up the meat supply. So when you look at agricultural... industry in general, the dairy is still probably the cleanest food available."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on a point about stressed plants producing enzymes called chitinases and their relevance to dairy.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's something you find in lots of foods that are grown in stressed plants. That's a plant enzyme that is protective against insects in particular, but it is strongly allergenic to... any animal. And in small amounts, it's produced in the stressed animal under the influence of estrogen. So it's possible that that's a factor in meat and eggs and milk, but probably not in a practical sense. The main allergens that get into the milk are, for example, if they let cows graze on pastures that... have lots of allergenic weeds, that will go right into the milk, enough of the allergens that people can react. You can usually taste the funny food in the milk. If you go around the cow's pasture and see what it's eating and squeeze some of the leaves, you'll often identify what it... is that gives the milk a funny flavor. And some small dairies aren't very alert to what their cows are eating, and that can cause just an individual dairy's milk to be more allergenic than average."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about food intolerance labs and the validity of their findings, particularly regarding dairy.

**RAY PEAT:** "The tests for allergens are ______. Really just a very vague indicator of the fact that your immune system reacts to everything you are exposed to and usually the finding the antibodies to a particular substance mean that you have become tolerant to that substance. So I just don't pay any attention to the lab tests for allergies. But the intestine adjusts its enzymes. Within just a few weeks, probably usually it only takes two weeks to have a complete adaptation of the digestive enzymes. But until your intestine has adjusted its enzymes to a new kind of diet, much of that food is going to be undigested and it will feed bacteria rather than feeding the person. And the strange new growth of bacteria will produce lots of chemicals that can be toxic and allergenic, and so if a person isn't used to eating vegetables and they eat vegetables, they'll often get a sore throat and runny nose, sore joints, headaches, and so on. And it's much of the... food sensitivity issues just adapting too suddenly to a diet, failing to adapt when they change because they do it too suddenly."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if introducing milk back into the diet should be done slowly to allow the body to adapt.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, even if a person does have lactose intolerance from a lactase deficiency... Yeah....tests of that have found that if they drink a cup per meal or less, they don't have the diarrhea that could be produced by drinking a pint of milk on an empty stomach. And even if they have had biopsies that show a deficiency of the lactase enzyme, that can be induced in about two weeks just by introducing... an occasional small amount of milk with their diet. The enzymes...the cells sense the presence of a nutrient, and the enzymes are gradually induced until the intestine can then handle normal amounts. Bacterial infections and inflammation can cause the loss of... lactase enzymes and probably many other important digestive enzymes. And experiments with supplementing thyroid or progesterone have found that you can induce or restore the lactase that has been deficient just by increasing those anti-stress hormones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if hypothyroidism and progesterone deficiency can lead to lactose intolerance due to decreased lactase production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, inflammation is probably the basic problem there. Thyroid and progesterone, by restoring energy and normal function, bypass the inflammatory processes, and inflammation shifts the cell function....to an emergency state, and you tend to lose a lot of functional enzymes in an inflamed state."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why Ray Peat considers dairy so important and what its benefits are.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, again, part of it, the biggest part is probably the alternatives. Like 1960, the main focus against milk was its strontium-90 content, but when you look at the alternatives, it turned out milk was the... best food for avoiding strontium-90, and it's the same with industrial additives, accidental pollutants. Just about every place you look in the food industry, things are far worse than milk. Some fruits, if you can find fruits that aren't grown in a large-scale industrial... Orchards. Bananas are an example of one of the worst products for chemical use and overproduction, bad soil, stressful conditions, but if you can find unstressed fruits, those are very free of toxins and contaminants relative to most other... food products."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if dairy can be considered a complete macronutrient, balanced for blood sugar regulation and inflammation, with pro-thyroid and progesterone properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it even contains some testosterone. Thyroid, progesterone, and testosterone are important for the young animal. In human milk, they found that there was enough thyroid hormone in human milk that babies whose thyroids were destroyed by developing near Three Mile Island during the accident, they didn't. They didn't suffer any symptoms of hypothyroidism as long as they were being breastfed because of the high protective hormone content of the milk."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the importance of calcium in dairy and its regulation with parathyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's really a subject for a week of seminars. I can set it up for you. I can set it up easily. It involves everything at every level of the organism. Calcium is, potentially, it's the thing that causes all of the problems, allergies, cancer, heart attacks, and so on, but when calcium is regulated properly, calcium protects against all of those things. And one of the central things in regulating calcium is the parathyroid hormone. And when you're deficient in calcium in your foods, your parathyroid hormone increases, and it can temporarily keep your blood calcium up to the proper level, but it does that by taking it out of the bones. And when you eat an excess of calcium, that tends to suppress the parathyroid hormone and since they've been doing dialysis for kidney disease, that has been a way to get a better insight into how the parathyroid hormone works than had been done in just ordinary research. They have found that if they remove the parathyroid hormone, the parathyroid gland entirely as far as they can, that they can solve many of the deadly effects of chronic kidney dialysis. The hypertension and the insomnia, for example, are two of the things that are......immediately corrected by removing the parathyroid gland. And when you look at the effects of the parathyroid hormone excess in such things as dialysis patients, you can get an idea of the range of things that eating extra calcium can correct by suppressing the parathyroid hormone. Insomnia is... is just one of them. Probably everywhere calcium is involved in an excitatory inflammation-promoting way you can probably reverse it most of the time just by increasing the calcium in your diet. But the two vitamins that are important for making the tissue handle. Calcium properly also contribute to lowering the parathyroid hormone. Vitamin K and vitamin D help to handle the calcium so the parathyroid gland senses it and shuts down. And some other nutrients, for example, vitamin A and... niacinamide work in that same direction as vitamin K and vitamin D, helping to balance the ratio of calcium to phosphorus and restrain the parathyroid gland. Foods, when they have put animals on a vitamin D deficient diet, they find that giving the animal sugar instead of starch will... keep its bones from developing rickets. It isn't that sugar has a vitamin D action, it's just that it lowers the stress and makes the animal adapt better to a vitamin D deficiency. And if there's a calcium deficiency, letting the animal drink salty water will, for a long time, will... make up for a calcium deficiency in the diet by helping the kidneys to retain the calcium by, apparently, by substituting loss of sodium for loss of calcium."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the implications of taking straight calcium supplements and whether too much can be harmful, especially when parathyroid hormone is the issue.

**RAY PEAT:** "I often see people with a blood calcium where it should be. 9 or 10, I see people with 11, 12 or 13 and getting them to eat more calcium, maybe take some vitamin D and vitamin K, they can very quickly get their calcium down to normal and the reason it's high is generally because they are eating too much phosphate and overdriving their parathyroid hormone."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if muscle meats, tryptophan, or 5-HTP can facilitate parathyroid hormone and cause inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, many things do increase the parathyroid. Serotonin does have a direct action, estrogen, cortisol, prolactin, all of those things. They have parallel and promoting effects on the parathyroid hormone. Progesterone and thyroid are the main things that help to inhibit the parathyroid. Part of that is the carbon dioxide produced in the cell. As it flows out of the cell, that's constantly respiring. This forces calcium to leave the cell and that relaxes the cell because calcium should be outside the cell. When it's in the cell, it tends to excite the cell and cause inflammation and lactic acid production. So once you get the streaming flow of carbon dioxide out of the cell, you're getting calcium into the safe situation. And... it happens that parathyroid hormone activates glycolysis and the formation of lactic acid. And that's a big part of how it dissolves the bone to provide more calcium for the bloodstream. And so everything that shifts the balance away from lactic acid production and towards carbon dioxide production helps to regulate just the calcium. Back into the bloodstream, out of cells, ready to go back into the bones. And carbon dioxide, when they do tissue culture of, for example, a piece of a mouse skull, which is very thin and can be kept in culture, the parathyroid hormone tends to dissolve it, causing it to produce lactic acid. But if you increase... the carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide directly starts forming crystals of calcium carbonate and restoring the mineral structure of the bone. The first crystal laid down in bone is calcium carbonate, but as the bone matures, some of the carbon dioxide is replaced by phosphate."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of carbonated water, baking soda, or CO2 levels in regulating parathyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, people have found that that the exchange between bicarbonate and carbon dioxide is so quick that when you give a person a dose of... sodium bicarbonate, the exchange of the bicarbonate to carbon dioxide is quick at the cell surface of a stressed cell. And so you can actually acidify and restore to normal a stressed cell with carbon dioxide, with a baking soda, because the sodium will quickly get lost out the urine, leaving the body......as needed, acidified with the intracellular carbon dioxide, which puts the cell back into its anti-inflammatory resting state. And the excess sodium, it's the same as in the rat experiment, where if you let the rat drink salty water, it isn't so desperately dependent on calcium in its diet. The alkali minerals can substitute to a great extent for each other, so that a slight excess of magnesium or sodium or potassium will help to spare calcium in the stress situation. And calcium can likewise make up for a deficiency of one of the others. For example, if you're having cramps, it might essentially be a magnesium deficiency but you can often stop the cramp with just baking soda or milk for the calcium or fruit for the high potassium content."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the difference between raw and pasteurized milk and why some people tolerate pasteurized milk better.

**RAY PEAT:** "Every cow has its particular balance of bacteria, many of which will be chronically living in their udder. And it's a natural... saying a healthy cow will have a very high bacteria count in its milk. And that...the individual cow will change its bacterial balance according to what it's eating and the season of the year, the particular weather that the cow is having. It's extremely variable and if a person... in their own bacterial ecology has a bad reaction to some of the bacteria that they're getting from the cow. They can just try a different dairy. It might still be raw, but even pasteurized milk still has enough of these individual herd bacteria that trying a different brand of pasteurized milk is sometimes all it takes. And I know a few people... who tend to get gas or diarrhea from most of the supermarket milks, but if they drink only the ultra-pasteurized milk that has been heated, I think to 135 degrees Fahrenheit is a typical temperature, that they tolerate that nicely. The ultra-pasteurized milk has a somewhat lower... vitamin content, and it doesn't taste as good, but some people do tolerate that better."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about yogurts, fermented foods, and lactic acid production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the first worst concern is to make sure it doesn't contain carotene and gums. Those are showing up in more and more foods, especially yogurt and kefir and cheeses and such. Thank you very much. I think it even shows up in some so-called plain milk products. I've seen products that were intended to add the vitamin A and D to milk that contained a gum such as alginate or carrageenan. So the added vitamin is one of the potential sources of contamination. But if it says that it's just fermented milk yogurt, that's the safest kind of yogurt and still it's better not to eat more than a few spoonfuls per day because any lactic acid, especially the kind formed by bacteria, is extra work for your liver. The lactic acid that......contacts your intestine cells, for example, activates the fibrosis-producing system, stimulating collagen production. And a chronic exposure to lactic acid increases a general tendency to overproduction of all of the inflammatory system. But the cumulative thing is... collagen accumulation and aging. But the immediate effect of the lactic acid on the liver is that the liver is set up to turn lactic acid back into glucose. But to do that, it takes energy and so it consumes glucose to get rid of the lactic acid and so it basically is a... a drain on your blood sugar reserves."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for elaboration on carrageenan and gums, their presence in food, and their effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "And this stuff is analogous to our connective tissue. Cartilage material and the breakdown material in the bloodstream, heparin, it's a sulfated polysaccharide and it's close enough to our own regulatory heparin and connective tissue system that it can be interpreted as a sign of damage to our own connective tissue. So it can cause very acute immune reactions. It's used experimentally to cause the research inflammation. It's a very predictable and effective promoter of inflammation that, for example, they'll inject it into a rat paw and then test anti-inflammatory things for their... protective effects. The use of it in food is justified by experiments showing that the native carrageenan, as it is prepared right out of the seaweed, doesn't induce cancer in vitro tests. But if you allow bacteria to break down the carrageenan into smaller fragments that more easily get into cells, that will cause cancer. And our intestine contains bacteria that are able to do that breakdown. But there is such a big investment in using it in the food industry. That the cancer regulating agencies don't want to acknowledge that the fact that when you eat native carrageenan, your bacteria are at risk for producing the carcinogenic degraded carrageenan, which is well known as a carcinogen."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about dairy and saturated fats, and why they are needed.

**RAY PEAT:** "There's a liver disease research group led by A. A. Nanji. He has demonstrated a curative effect on hepatitis and cirrhosis from adding the saturated fats of a great variety of them all the way from coconut oil True. The butter fats up into the waxy long chain saturated fats and similarly they have shown that fish oils and the various seed oils that are polyunsaturated exacerbate the liver diseases and inflammations. The breakdown products of the unsaturated fats. Produce a lot of the inflammatory diseases and just by substituting saturated fats, you're going to have an anti-inflammatory effect generally and somewhat of an antioxidant effect by interrupting the pre-radical oxidation product of the polyunsaturated. Everyone's body with aging. Accumulates more and more of the polyunsaturated fats and probably the saturated fats become more important protectively and therapeutically after a person is metabolically slowing down in their 20s and 30s. A kid who's growing like a small... two or three year old kid might have twice the metabolic rate that an adult does and they can burn up much more of the polyunsaturated fats. As the metabolism slows down, even a small amount of the polyunsaturates in the diet will tend to accumulate and increase the tissue inflammation and oxidation processes. So... there's constantly some turnover, so if you can keep your food high on the saturation side, you can progressively, usually, you can make some headway against those stored polyunsaturates and it might take years to restore a good balance, but it's worth the effort to... minimize the polyunsaturates."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about dairy being low in iron and its protective effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the reason it's low in iron is that the... during pregnancy, the estrogen of the mother is one of its functions. Well, two functions are to cause the intestine to absorb more calcium and more iron. A woman will typically absorb nine or ten times as much iron out of her given food as a man does. So, an iron supplement is especially risky when your estrogen is high. And the... One of the functions of estrogen is to lower oxygen tension and the fetus is in a situation of low oxygen tension and so it accumulates iron, partly from the estrogen exposure but partly from the oxygen deficit. So, the fetus reaches its maturity. And is born overcharged with iron. It typically has enough iron in its tissues that it doesn't need to eat any iron for about six months to a year. And so milk is designed to let the baby grow into its potentially toxic overcharge with iron. And so milk is relatively very free of iron. And that's one of the. Protective effects that many of our foods have a potential overdose of iron, especially the meats. And men by the time they're 50 are generally well overloaded with iron and that contributes to free radical oxidation and is probably a big factor in heart disease and liver disease and so on. And women, to some extent, are protected as long as they're menstruating, throwing off some of the iron every month. But when they stop menstruating, then their tissues start overloading with iron. And milk and cheese are foods that are deficient in iron, and so adding them generously to the diet will help you prevent that chronic tendency to overcharge on iron."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about cheeses, their cultures, and potential risks.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, recently I saw an advertisement for one of the big additive companies that says that... 60-some percent of the cheeses now made in the world use their cultures. And their cultures are basically from bacteria and fungus. And they're cheap substitutes for the naturally grown bacterial and fungal cultures that cheeses have. They're traditional. Location and type of cow and so on has determined the type of bacteria and fungus. And traditionally they're made with bovine digestive enzymes as a way to clot the cheese. And they're now using fungal and bacterial substitutes for these beef enzymes. And that's almost all cheeses commercially now. are risky because of those microorganisms that are used in substituting for the traditional methods. And that's besides any additive for modifying the texture."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about whey protein powders and their potential issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 40 or 50 years ago, the dairies that were producing cheese would give their whey in a liquid state fresh out of the cheese factory to hog farmers, and in that fresh state it was mixed with other foods for hog slop, and it produced very healthy pigs. It was a stimulant to growth when mixed with a lot of fruits and vegetables and other waste foods. It was very good pig food compared to the corn and soybeans that pigs are now getting fed. But when it's sold, because pigs aren't eating it anymore, they have to dispose of it some way. The process of dehydrating and turning it into a powder... Since milk products are very high in the fragile amino acids, including tryptophan and cysteine, the process of dehydrating it increases the oxidation of the protein and not only lowers the protein value, but increases its toxicity and allergenicity. So, I don't recommend any. Dehydrated food, except in emergency, where they're convenient for transportation and storage, but as a regular thing, dehydrated, anything is a potential risk."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for elaboration on albumin in whey protein.

**RAY PEAT:** "The casein that you get in the cheese and you throw away. Largely the albumin fraction, the cheese, the casein protein turns out to be anti-inflammatory and anti-stress, helps hold down the cortisol production and you get the opposite effect from the huay fraction. So it's a bit... It has many direct nutritional problems. Probably the worst one is that most of the calcium stays with the cheese, and so you have a protein which is easily degraded and lacks the anti-stress factors and is deficient in calcium."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the argument that milk makes people fat.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the reasons a lot of people give if they have overcome the idea that milk forms mucus or is a risk for various diseases and so on, one of their arguments is that it makes them fat, but all the research on animals... and as far as it goes, the human research shows that milk is probably the best reducing food there is. The mechanisms for that are now known. Not only the anti-stress effect of the casein and the good balance of saturated fats and so on, but the calcium alone is a very important metabolic regulator that... it happens to inhibit the fat-forming enzymes, fatty acid synthase, and incidentally that's a characteristic enzyme that goes wild in cancer, but calcium and milk inhibit that fatty acid synthase, reducing the formation of fats, and at the same time it activates the... uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria which are associated with increased longevity because they, by increasing the metabolic rate, the uncoupling proteins burn calories faster, but they protect against pre-radical oxidation. They pull the fuel through the... oxidation process so fast, in effect, that none of it goes astray in random oxidation, where if you inhibit your energy-producing enzymes, you tend to get random stray oxidations that damage the mitochondria. So the uncoupling proteins burn calories faster at the same time that you're reducing fat synthesis. Milk is, as far as I know, it's the only food that does both of those things simultaneously."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about concerns regarding synthetic vitamins added to pasteurized milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well, for one thing, it's a very small amount of the vitamins. And even though I'm allergic to just a tiny amount of synthetic vitamin A will give me a headache for a couple of days, just a trace of it, I can drink a gallon of milk containing their added vitamin A and apparently other things in the milk. It doesn't protect me from that intense allergic reaction to synthetic A, but it is a problem that they, to anything but whole milk, they're required to add vitamin A and D in the United States. Probably that's been my average for 35 years or so. I average probably now only two, two and a half, or three quarts when I can get lots of orange juice or other."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the benefits of milk outweigh the potential issues with synthetic vitamins, considering other nutrient sources.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the calcium by stimulating our metabolism keeps us more like the teenagers. Metabolically who can handle and balance those things, but that's that's where gelatin and and fruit come in Helping to shift the balance somewhat away from that higher tryptophan and cysteine content right"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about caloric recommendations for dairy intake and its role as a primary source of calories, protein, and fat.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ideally, I would get half my calories anyway from fruit. Half your calories from fruit? Yeah, you The proportion of protein, carbohydrate and fat, it probably should be something like a third of each, but I'm not sure what the ideal is. It depends so much on the quality of each of them. Avoiding starch and avoiding polyunsaturated fats and avoiding the very high cryptophane. If you were to take a look at some of the high-content proteins, then you could go very high on any one of the major nutrients without a problem."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if high protein, low carb, or low fat diets can overstimulate parathyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because most protein comes with lots of phosphate. Grains, beans, are very bad protein but very high in phosphate. Meats are good protein but very high in phosphate. And the ratio between phosphate and calcium......is the main thing that activates the parathyroid hormone. And so minimizing phosphate or increasing calcium is extremely important."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the correlation between osteoporosis, high protein diets, and the role of estrogen and cortisol in bone demineralization.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the parathyroid hormone increases with old woman's menstrual cycle when estrogen is dominant, parathyroid hormone is highest, and prolactin, cortisol. It's interesting that the things that estrogen increases, prolactin, serotonin, parathyroid hormone, cortisol, all of those are known to dissolve the bones, so it's very interesting that they promote estrogen as a bone. In the 50 or 60 years that women have been taught to use estrogen so that almost American women have used estrogen, the rate of breaking hips has increased. So since all of the mechanisms through which estrogen affects the... the parathyroid hormone, serotonin, cortisol, and prolactin, those are all well-established, and those bone-dissolving hormones are constantly present. For example, with aging, a person's parathyroid hormone increases as the bone mineral density decreases. All right. There's a tendency for the cortisol to become dominant with aging and prolactin, both in men and women, has an increasing tendency to become dominant in age."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if progesterone and testosterone play a role in bone health, contrasting their effects with estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and testosterone. And these, the same factors that interrupt progesterone metabolism also interrupt testosterone. A high tryptophan or serotonin exposure will lower your testosterone. Hi, I am... polyunsaturated fats will lower your testosterone and testosterone protects against the parathyroid hormone and strengthens the bones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there are ways to know calcium levels besides labs, and if bone spurs indicate anything about calcium levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it usually happens in people who are eating too much phosphate, not enough calcium. Okay. Sometimes a general vitamin deficiency can be involved because, for example, niacin, amide, and vitamin A work to regulate the phosphate-calcium balance as well as vitamin G and vitamin A. But vitamin K is a very safe thing that currently is stylish, and it seems to be involved in our basic energy production the way thyroid and niacinamide are."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the importance of testosterone for women and feeding the pathway from pregnenolone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and cholesterol. Cholesterol has a protective effect against excess parathyroid hormone, because it's near the top. If you're feeding your liver just what it needs so it can make cholesterol, then the cholesterol with thyroid and vitamin A will let your... glands make the pregnenolone, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the correlation between parathyroid hormone, inflammation, and anemia.

**RAY PEAT:** "I'm not sure. If there is a direct connection, but the thyroid and parathyroid tend to go in opposite directions and the thyroid stimulating hormone definitely is involved in anemia, inflammation, liver malfunction and so on, so that when a person is hypothyroid they tend to have high parathyroid hormone and high thyroid stimulating hormone and just looking at the individual who is hypothyroid, you can see that their parathyroid hormone must be having a role in such things, but experimentally the thyroid stimulating hormone has a definite connection to malfunction of the bone marrow and blood vessels and so on. Serotonin metabolism, liver metabolism."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for other nutritional sources of calcium besides dairy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, for a... a person who wants a safe supplement, eggshells, if you boil your eggs to get any additives and cleaners off them, eggshells are the purest form of calcium carbonate to use as a supplement. And calcium carbonate is probably the ideal form to use as a supplement. Crustacean shells and mollusk shells and egg shells are natural forms of calcium carbonate. But egg shells usually, when they've been tested, are even cleaner than oyster shells as a calcium carbonate source."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the proper ingestion of powdered eggshells.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a fourth to a half teaspoon if a person is not getting their milk calcium."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the use of aspirin in calcium regulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Aspirin has some direct effects on the bone, blocking the prostaglandins that cause the inflammation related to parathyroid hormones. Glycolysis, the prostaglandins are very important factors in osteoporosis and aspirin blocks that, but aspirin also inhibits the pituitary stress hormones and so tends to lower cortisol and by lowering estrogen it reduces the prolactin all working in the direction to strengthen your bones and keep blood, keep calcium out of your blood vessels in your bones where it should be."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about fibrosis in relation to calcium and arteries.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hans Selye was concentrating for several years on the process of, he called it either calcephylaxis or calcergy, where calcium goes wild and causes spasms in blood vessels, even shuts off circulation and causes gangrene of the extremities or of the skin and scleroderma. In which the skin progressively calcifies rather than acutely and he showed that serotonin was a major factor. The stress combined with local irritation causes the first fibrosis and then the fibrotic tissue absorbs calcium. And creates inflammation and calcification. The inflammation with lactic acid production and the influence of lactic acid displacing carbon dioxide is what most immediately leads to the overproduction of lactic acid. Collagen and eventually those same factors displacing carbon dioxide will cause the tissue to calcify."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the curious effect of tissue calcification when calcium is low.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's where you get increased parathyroid hormone that displaces. It takes calcium out of the bones and puts it into soft tissues. That can be offset by eating more calcium and taking vitamin K, for example."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about fluoride and its potential danger, particularly regarding calcification.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's a... I avoid fluoridated water carefully because I, without thinking about it, during a stay in San Francisco, wasn't aware that the water was fluoridated and I started getting extreme hypothyroid symptoms and I realized that the water that I drank had enough fluoride in it to totally destroy the thyroid supplement that I was taking. So the first place that fluoride can act is by destroying nutrients and hormones that you might be taking. But to the extent that fluoride circulates in your bloodstream, where T3, the active thyroid hormone, is also circulating, it just takes one fluoride atom to ruin the T3 molecule. So my own experience with it is as a thyroid toxin. But it's John Yamanis and Dean Burke did some good studies, pretty conclusively showing that a population that's fluoridated has a higher cancer rate."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the connection between dairy consumption and acne.

**RAY PEAT:** "The vitamin A and thyroid and the hormones, DHEA, androgens, testosterone and... progesterone balance the inflammatory and anti-immune things that aren't normally present. I suspect that the connection between dairy and acne is that it's increasing your metabolic rate and increasing your requirement for some nutrients. So usually vitamin A is limiting. And people who do anything that increases their metabolic rate, and calcium is a very powerful stimulant to metabolism, the increased metabolic rate makes you consume vitamin A and probably several other nutrients involved in the skin. But vitamin A is most commonly the limiting. Factor in Acne"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the source of vitamin A (plant vs. animal) and whether enough can be obtained from liver, eggs, and milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, one serving of liver a week and an egg or two every day and any milk. That's for most people. Plenty of vitamin A."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the argument that milk drains calcium from bones due to a higher phosphorus to calcium ratio than in the human body.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, no, the ratio in milk is very high towards calcium so that you can, even eating some meat... or other foods that are high in phosphate, if you drink a good amount of milk, the high calcium will put those other excess phosphates into proportion. It should be one and a half calcium per phosphate anyway."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the argument that milk causes weight gain.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, that's very definitely the... the mechanisms that I mentioned, inhibiting the fat-producing enzyme system and stimulating the calorie-burning uncoupling protein, those are clearly established papers by Michael Zemel and his group, Sun and she and others. They've done some very good studies on curing obesity with... with milk products, but there are a lot of other groups that have noticed that milk drinkers are very rarely obese, chronic users of a quart of milk or more a day."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about trans fats in dairy and their danger compared to polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, conjugated linoleic acid is being sold therapeutically because it has so many protective effects, stimulating the metabolism and being anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity and so on. But the... That's a natural component of milk and dairy fat in general and the trans fats are just in process on the way to forming the conjugated linoleic acid. And I think their benefit is that they block the polyunsaturated fats, linoleic acid in particular. Linoleic acid is the antithyroid. It's pro-cancer, pro-inflammatory, so-called essential fatty acid, and there have been studies for about 20 years showing that trans fats can have a protective effect in themselves as an inhibitor of the linoleic acid toxic effect, but more importantly the dairy trans fats are precursors. The conjugated linoleic acid, which is specifically active biologically in a good way, and the mechanism by which these are formed is bacteria in the rumen hydrogenate in the protective detoxifying reaction. They detoxify the polyunsaturated fats. In the vegetable material that the cow is eating, and if the cow is eating a natural diet rich in vitamin E, such as leaves rather than grain, the vitamin E is a cofactor in the hydrogenating bacteria, turning the unsaturated fats to saturated. And in the two percent......of the fats that are missed, there's a small amount of intermediate, not fully hydrogenated material, which turns out to be the trans fats and the conjugated linoleic acid. And those in themselves, in small amounts, I think there's good evidence showing that they in themselves have a protective effect."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if trans fats in dairy are different from partially hydrogenated oils.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the fact that they're partially hydrogenated means that there's still a lot of PUFA left in them. And I think the... the defense of the idea of essential fatty acids, people are looking for anything to blame the toxic effects of margarine on. But for a long time it's been clear that even partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is still... has enough PUFA in it to have toxic effects."
