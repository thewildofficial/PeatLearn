**RAY PEAT:** They are probably okay to try. One... The thing that has made me skeptical about them was an article published in Nature about, I think, probably 35 or 40 years ago showed that there are antigenic regions on these lactobacilli that are exactly matching for proteins that are associated with female reproductive action. So that from puberty to menopause, roughly, there's the risk of having an autoimmune or immunological interaction between intestinal bacteria and body tissues. And there hasn't been much follow-up on that, but that is the period when......autoimmune-type problems show up in women, and estrogen is probably the main factor that is involved in that, but it just happens that there is this antigen parallel between the bacteria and the person. And the bacteria do have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the membranes of the intestine, but one problem......is that they do produce lactic acid, and so if you provide them with enough fuel, they can produce lactic acid, which is a potential toxin. It stimulates inflammation and formation of fiber collagen stimulation.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on probiotics, specifically *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacteria*?

**RAY PEAT:** There have been studies in which rheumatoid arthritis and similar things just are completely relieved during a week-long fast but then it would come back as soon as the person eats again and that's partly because your cortisol increases tremendously when you're not eating and what the cortisol is doing is converting your... muscle tissue mostly into fuel to live on and at the same time it's having an anti-inflammatory effect but the bowel is really the the basic cause of most of the degenerative inflammatory diseases and so there's a tremendous good reason for it. Thinking that fasting is therapeutic and I've seen animals with huge tumors that just refuse to eat and if their owners just let them sit around not eating, they would recover and live for years. So the lack of appetite during sickness is a natural. You don't have an opportunity to fast and sometimes it has a therapeutic effect. But since the reason the bowel is so connected to the inflammatory diseases is that besides the bacteria that produce things such as lactic acid and endotoxin, each of which has its range of harmful toxic effects, is that the intestine itself produces a tremendous amount of serotonin. And the serotonin, if it isn't detoxified right away, it promotes not only fibrosis and inflammation, but multiplication of cells in the blood vessels, thickening them, and promoting tumor growth. Just about every degenerative condition you can think of, so if you can lighten the inflammation load in the intestine, you can achieve the same thing as fasting, even though you can still keep absorbing nutrients if you just do it in a way that you don't either produce endotoxin, lactic acid. Or serotonin excess and partly that means using a very easily digested diet, avoiding the undercooked vegetable matter, for example, that can't be digested by human enzymes and provides good food for bacteria and having other easily digested or slightly antimicrobial foods, raw carrots or boiled bamboo shoots, for example, have germicides that prevent bacterial growth.

**CONTEXT:** From a health perspective, is there any time you would recommend fasting?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that whole approach assumes that we really know what the species ate while evolving. There are a lot of fantasy theories that whatever people enjoy eating, they tend to read into the history of people. And the essential evolution from ape-like animals to human-like animals, no one is really sure what people were eating. I'm inclined to think that, and there's direct, present experimental evidence that supports it, I think better than some of the currently popular ideas such as cananes about fish eating and so on. I think fruit eating was a good candidate for supporting evolution. Be more human than ape-like, supporting a big brain and the kind of digestive system we have.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on evolutionary diets like the Paleo diet or blood type diets?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some people have commented that the brain of the average person might weigh 2% of their body weight, but it uses 40 or 50% of their metabolic energy. And if that's the average, and a person, say, has a bigger than average brain, and human brains vary tremendously in size and in metabolic requirements, and if they spend a great amount of mental energy compared to the average, then you can see what a tremendous metabolic difference that can make.

**CONTEXT:** Do people who place high demands on themselves mentally have different nutritional needs?

**RAY PEAT:** There was an experiment 30 years ago in which they had people walk on a treadmill and they didn't let their heart rate go over 120 beats per minute. And they measured their... active thyroid hormone T3 at the beginning and then after 40 minutes and the average person's T3 had gone to zero in just 40 minutes of just very moderate exercise. And normally, as soon as you have some sugar, if your liver had a lot of glycogen, it would replenish the sugar in T3 quickly. Or the next meal that you have some sugar and replenish your glycogen, your T3 would snap right back. But the longer the stress is and the more inhibitors there are in your tissues or in your diet or surroundings. For example, if your body is loaded up on polyunsaturated fats or if you have... bad bacteria in your intestine, those things will tend to delay the recovery of your liver and T3 production. And so with some people in some settings, it just takes a little extra stress and it sticks you down in that low T3 condition. And there were other studies in which a person... or a group of people with low thyroid were given just sort of a tentative trial dose of a thyroid supplement. And a lot of them with just two or three days of a supplement would snap back and recover normal thyroid function, meaning that they had just been temporarily stuck in that stress condition. And with a little extra thyroid, they could break out of it. Her own client would take over.

**CONTEXT:** Are there ways to attenuate the ill effects of high-intensity exercise?

**RAY PEAT:** What I ate yesterday, um, would be easier than remembering a joke. I never can remember a joke. Um, steak, by chance, happened to be rib steak day. And, uh, eggs and lots of milk and coffee, orange juice and Coke.

**CONTEXT:** What is your favorite joke, or if not, what did you eat yesterday?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, gluten intolerance is, since the intestine is involved in everything. Gluten is one of the basic things that will cause problems once you get sensitized to it. High estrogen is one of the things that sensitizes the intestine and system to gluten. And the transglutaminase enzyme that is activated by estrogen and......activates the immune reactions that can cause celiac disease to cause psoriasis and arthritis. It is now known to be involved in causing cancer and brain conditions including schizophrenia. So, the ramifications of intestinal irritation... Gluten intolerance go off in all directions, from scaly skin and sore joints to craziness and senile dementia and so on. And stopping the inflammatory process is the basic thing. And I think that was behind the......orthomolecular approach to treating schizophrenia. The niacin approach, I think, was basically working on protecting cells energetically and against inflammation. And so I'm not specifically a follower of Hopper's treatment, but I think he was opening up a hole. It's an area of science that's valid, that you can treat schizophrenia metabolically, and I think it has just ramifications off in every direction. For example, the niacin, one of the basic effects of niacin is to inhibit the release of free fatty acids from our tissue stores. And free fatty acids poison our energy apparatus. And niacin is not only the, it's immediately involved in energy processes, but you've probably noticed how schizophrenics almost always are heavy smokers. And nicotine happens to have an actual brain-protective and therapeutic. effect against a lot of the degenerative inflammatory diseases, but I think that's because it's overlapping with the niacin pathways that are natural energy producers and anti-inflammatory nerve protective systems. I don't have any particular therapeutic ideas for schizophrenia, but keeping the thyroid function up so that the energy is supported, and keeping the toxins down, avoiding the polyunsaturated fats and anything irritating to the intestines such as gluten and indigestible starches and fibers and so on. I think all those will help.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, niacin, copper, and gluten intolerance?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I would guess that the conditions under which it comes on puberty is a major time for schizophrenia, and that's when the rising hormones very often interfere with thyroid function. That's when they get diagnosed mostly, right, is like late teens, early 20s?

**CONTEXT:** Would you say that hypothyroidism is the greatest factor in schizophrenia?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I've never tried it, but if it's extracted from from the sap or the core of the tree. Yes. Yeah, from the sap. Well, I think some of it might just be made from the starch chemically. And I would have to know what the chemical process is if they convert it from starch. But if it's made from the sap, there are lots of palm products that are very sugary. And I think in general, if it starts with a natural sugar extract, then it's... going to be fine, but if it's processed heavily, heat and chemical catalysts can leave irritating residues in the sugar, so I would want to know just how they make it.

**CONTEXT:** What about coconut sugar from the coconut tree? Is that an okay sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on the kind, but the old timers a hundred years ago it was very common to use a spoonful of flowers of sulfur, maybe once a year, and a huge dose of sulfur like that will... pretty much clean out any kind of parasite but I've experimented a lot with very small amounts of flowers of sulfur and it has a fungicidal effect so if there's just a mild yeast infection in two or three days, a pinch a day of flowers of sulfur will clear that out and sometimes that is enough to discourage it. amoebas and worms but flowers of sulfur is very safe to people in small amounts like that but it can get a very wide range of nuisances. Some of the organisms have exoenzymes that act on the sulfur in their environment. Causing it to oxidize to sulfuric acid, and it's just the pH change that eliminates them.

**CONTEXT:** What would be your approach to someone who might have parasites?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some people think they even have a beneficial effect on the immune system and some people advocate catching worms. Once in a while to prevent autoimmune diseases, but I'm not very convinced of that. Yeah, there's a guy, I forget his name, he uses helmet therapy for MS and he actually uses worms. He advocates it on his website, I forget the website, but he actually uses worms to treat MS. I'm inclined in the direction that since our immune system probably isn't what it has been thought of as following the German tradition of immune theory. I'm on the Metznikov side, which is seeing cells as the central activity and seeing it as a developmental process. Rather than a specific chemotherapy of our bodies against organisms from the environment. And if you think of it as a chemotherapy, then anything that activates your immune system is potentially good for you. But I think of it as developmental, and every time we affect our developmental system, we're... taking our whole self off in a different direction. And I think in Africa, for example, a lot of the so-called AIDS is really just from being exposed to too many stimulants of our immune system.

**CONTEXT:** Is it possible that parasites could contribute to some sort of autoimmune functions in our bodies?

**RAY PEAT:** Sometimes it's a developmental overbalance of the parasympathetic nervous system, or sympathetic. Either way can activate your... sweat glands. And sometimes people can remedy it with just an herbal thing that influences the balance of the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous systems. Sometimes hypothyroid people compensate with extremely high adrenaline production, and that can cause... sweating, even when they're not hot.

**CONTEXT:** What could it mean if someone is just sweating all the time, even from an early age?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I... I would be very interested in what kind of tests I should have run. None of my doctors initially were looking for parasites at all, so they tested and treated me for a whole lot of things that didn't have any impact. The first tapeworm, round of tapeworm tests that I did all came back negative, even though I was putting segments of worms in the stool samples. So, I would be very interested in what kind of testing should I pursue. There are doctors that specialize in that. I don't know who in your area would be best, but I'm sure there are parasite specialists in all of these, especially the coastal tropical areas. In the United States, there are doctors who see parasite cases. I would recommend... I mean, I like to test for metametrics. Just call the GIFX. You can call them, or you can work through... Just call them, and you can probably get hooked up with a physician there.

**CONTEXT:** What kind of tests should I pursue for parasites?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, the diet to keep your immune system so-called and your metabolic rate up where it should be, and if necessary, a thyroid supplement. If your metabolic rate is low, you'll tend to, for example, fungal infections really tend to specialize in hypothyroid people. That's the end. I think it's the same with a lot of intestinal parasites that, for example, the IgA antibodies on membranes and intestines are deficient in people who are low thyroid. And so all the membranes are susceptible to attack.

**CONTEXT:** What about restoring digestive function if I do get rid of the parasites?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I used to read periodically in the newspapers about someone, I think the first one that was......reported around the world was a Japanese man, who everyone thought he was a drunk, but when doctors examined him carefully, they found that when he ate sugar, he would start emitting alcohol fumes, and they found that yeast were growing in his stomach even. His digestive enzymes were so weak that the organisms... weren't killed by stomach acid and enzymes, and usually, on average, there's one case or so somewhere in the world actually getting drunk when they eat sugar from so many yeasts living high up in your intestine, but getting drunk is really the only major harm. Done by that, the real problem is that their digestion is so poor from being low thyroid that probably all they need is to take some thyroid and activate their digestive enzymes. That would probably spontaneously get rid of the yeast and bacteria problem. But I think it was Rene Dubose. Who did some experiments showing that with a given yeast in the intestine, when it's starved for the sugar that it needs to thrive, it sends out, I think they're called pseudo hyphae filaments several times their diameter in length, but long enough to reach....through the intestine wall, where they can get sugar from the bloodstream, and so they actually become invasive when they're starved for sugar. But if you feed them sugar, they don't put out those adhesive invasive filaments, and they just are happy living on sugar, and so a sugarless diet. It's really a dangerous thing for someone to do if they have a yeast problem. And besides its direct effect on the yeast, when you avoid sugar, you're having the risk of not giving your liver the sugar it needs to activate the thyroid hormone, and so you're tending to make the hypothyroid problem worse. Especially if you eat foods that are rich in the polyunsaturated fats. It happens that fungus loves unsaturated fat but can be killed by saturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** Why do yeast overgrowths occur, and why do we have Candida in our GI system?

**RAY PEAT:** There were experiments on cattle that were being sent in for slaughter. They measured blood and urine and Found that I think it was 30 to 35 percent of them showed chemical toxins that they had been exposed to either in their feed or insecticides sprayed on them and such but when they were slaughtered they found that That same proportion Of 30 35 percent had muscle and fat Evidence of those same poisons, but only six or seven percent of them had any of those toxins in their liver The liver has the equipment for gradually excreting the toxins that are stored in the fat and muscles and So the liver is the cleanest organ of the animal and if you slow down the livers Oh activity Which happens in a fast for example then your brain and other organs are going to be exposed to the chemicals that otherwise would have been excreted in the urine as they're diffusing out of your fat and muscles. So I think the best cleansing diet is one that increases your liver's action. And just tasty food is one of the things that will stimulate your liver's action. Sugar and thyroid are the other main things that activate the liver.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on liver flushes and general cleansing diets?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, the manufactured sugars such as made from corn starch, those are... the risk is that they have undeclared substances in them. For example, high fructose corn syrup, a group in California analyzed it and they found that it contained the amount of... fructose and glucose, the label said, but they found that about 80% of its calories consisted of other stuff, sort of intermediate between sugar and starch, which really can be very harmful and calorie-rich compared to the sugars. And with a very highly cooked sugar, such as maple sugar or agave sugar, you have to... watch out that it didn't reach a temperature that produced irritants and allergens. But otherwise, all the natural sugars... white sugar isn't chemically changed, it's just... it has the products of extracting and heating pretty much washed out of it. So, it's... that's as far as allergens go. The white sugar is safe, but nutritionally, fruit is the best way to get sugar because it's not only unprocessed, but it comes with a lot of the minerals needed to process the sugar, such as potassium and magnesium. So, when I say sugar, I'm thinking mostly of fruit.

**CONTEXT:** When you say sugar, do you mean any kind of sugar, or are you talking about some natural sugar, honey, agave, as opposed to high fructose corn syrup?

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, they probably will also tend to have puffy eyelids and faces when they wake up. Right. As the water redistributes, and that's from excess permeability of their blood vessels. Water just leaks out of their blood into the tissues. And sometimes all it takes is eating enough salt to make your albumin function to bind water and keep it back in your blood vessels. Wow. People aren't low. Salt diet are very susceptible to that movement of water out of their blood vessels and especially in pregnancy or pre-menstrually. There were studies of women with toxemia or pre-eclampsia in pregnancy who were having high blood pressure. What happens is that the high estrogen and... especially low thyroid, high serotonin balance during pregnancy makes the blood vessels permeable and the albumin can't retain enough sodium because of the low thyroid, high estrogen. And so the albumin is unable to hold the water in the blood vessels. And they gave these people in one experiment, I think they gave some......what, over 20 grams of salt extra per day and almost immediately cured their toxinia symptoms. Wow, so it may be too less salt as opposed to too much salt and not enough water.

**CONTEXT:** What could cause swollen feet in a relatively young person who works at a desk and has a decent diet?

**RAY PEAT:** Tom Brewer, he and his wife, Gail, wrote some books on nutrition for pregnant women, and they cited some of the research that was collected in another book on prenatal nutrition, maternal nutrition and prenatal health. They have a tremendous amount of information that's relevant to everyone, but premenstrual women with a high estrogen balance are next in line after women with toxemia of pregnancy to benefit from increased protein and salt in their diet. Old people in general often have the same difficulty retaining enough sodium. The sicker an old person is, the more likely they are to have an inappropriate loss of sodium from their blood.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the research by Tom Brewer regarding prenatal nutrition and its relevance to premenstrual women?

**RAY PEAT:** The ideal amount of fructose seems to be maybe a third as much as glucose, and so a person can eat a fair amount of starch if they have glucose along with it, but what the fructose does in the cell is to raise the metabolic rate, increase the production of carbon dioxide among other things. And catalyze the ability to burn glucose wherever the glucose came from, sucrose or starch. So it's a catalyst that increases cell activity in very constructive ways. And for example, there have been experiments, one of them compared either sugar or coke. Coca-Cola I think was what they used and found that it improved calcium assimilation, increased their metabolic rate, decreased obesity. I think it was something like a 50% increase in their ability to burn calories when they had a sucrose-based diet rather than a starch-based diet. And... A couple of other experiments showed that the calcium assimilation and retention was better, and in a vitamin D deficient experiment, animals on a starch-based diet had very weak bones that you would expect from the vitamin D deficient diet, but... the ones which had sucrose, despite the vitamin D deficiency, they built strong bones because of that effect on calcium assimilation, and that calcium sparing effect of sucrose or fructose is that metabolic stimulating effect which imitates the active thyroid hormone. Which produces carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide is involved in the way we handle calcium and sodium both in the kidneys and in the cell keeping calcium out of the cells where it shouldn't be and putting it in the bones where it should be. So you reduce your need for vitamin D which is a very... important nutrient in all kinds of systems but you decrease your dependency on that if you shift your calories away from starch to some extent at least towards sucrose and or fructose. But it's very hard to find the natural source of fructose. It's almost always in balance with glucose.

**CONTEXT:** What is your take on the negative hype surrounding fructose, given your recommendations for fruit consumption?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the high phosphorus content is probably just about as important for the average person. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus should be... very high. If you're under stress the phosphate becomes more of a problem and adds to the stress. And meat and whole grains are major sources of phosphates and so you have to be more concerned with with your calcium intake if you have a meat or grain based diet. The tryptophan can be handled pretty well if you otherwise have a good diet because, for example, women are much more susceptible to getting pellagra than men because estrogen, partly because it makes you waste your vitamin B6, estrogen greatly decreases the... production of tryptophan and sends the tryptophan... of production of niacin and sends the tryptophan down the pathway into serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** If a person has a proper working thyroid, can they tolerate eating more muscle meat, or are there other components in muscle meat that inhibit thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Okay. Another question, Dr. Pete, I was hoping to get your opinion on some spices, like if there's some spices that you don't recommend because either they're estrogenic promoting or maybe they inhibit the thyroid. And more specifically also, my girlfriend's been craving garlic and I was just wondering what your opinion is also on garlic and just in general spices, I guess. Oh, I think the main problem with......onion and garlic is, if you're allergic to them, people, low thyroid people very often have symptoms like gallbladder spasms when they're, especially if the garlic and onion are cooked, something happens to the active ingredients that make them more of a trigger to... problems, not just people with thyroid people, but as just foods, garlic and onions are fine.

**CONTEXT:** Do you have any recommendations regarding spices, specifically garlic, and whether any spices should be avoided due to estrogenic or thyroid-inhibiting properties?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the main thing is that... so many of them are allergens.

**CONTEXT:** Are there any spices that you'd completely recommend to stay away from in terms of how they affect the thyroid or anything?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, sometimes if you're just in a temporary stress state, sometimes 10 micrograms will break the whole stress. But if you're not that lucky and are going to need it for... a longer time, then the body normally, ideally, should make 4 or 5 micrograms per hour of T3. And if you take all at once very much more than 10 micrograms, your liver activates enzymes for destroying it or excreting it. And so it goes away quickly when you skip taking it. I... experimented on myself taking 25 micrograms at a time. And after two or three weeks of doing that, 12 hours later, if I didn't take another dose, I would go into a very intense hypothyroid state with my heart stopping every six seconds or so. And that would, 30 seconds after I took more T3, that would kind of... get regular again. But the, if you take your 10 micrograms with a meal, the food is going to delay its absorption, so you get maybe two or three micrograms each hour. And so 10 with each meal is a pretty smooth way to take it.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the proper dosage and timing for taking Cytomel (T3) and Thyroxine (T4)?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, just occasionally a person has some peculiar need where they want to quickly, in just a week or so, get to complete normal functioning. For example, people who had cholesterol levels of 450 or 500 or so, went vegan. Wanted to get their cholesterol down in a week and the only way you can do that is with frequent five microgram doses of cytomel to get your thyroid function up to full normal very quickly, but for example someone who has had a heart attack and doesn't want to put a lot of workload on their heart by energizing their... their system suddenly, they don't want to take more than one microgram at a time. And when you take a big typical dose of, say, 50 or 100 micrograms of thyroxin, which is a typical tablet size for the thyroxin, that depends on your liver for activating it. And so it's sort of unpredictable. What's going to happen when you take a big dose of thyroxine, but the one you have to be very careful about taking in small amounts is the T3 if you aren't backing it up with the T4. The T4 is preferred by most doctors because your liver will seldom make more than it needs. The trouble... with relying on thyroxin is that in women very often the estrogen keeps the liver from making as much T3 as you need from the thyroxin. And so lots of women go around taking fully normal doses of thyroxin while not having enough active thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** Is it always better to take T3 along with T4, or can T3 be taken by itself?

**RAY PEAT:** With all kinds of animal products, the main issue is whether there are microorganisms or parasites in them. And so... the reason for cooking meat or oysters or fish or whatever is to make sure that you've killed the parasites and microorganisms. There's no nutritional benefit at all from cooking them. But with, say, an apple, the typical apple that people buy is likely to be... unripened or partly ripened, and to contain a huge amount of pectin with a little bit of sugar and some minerals mixed in with this large amount of pectin. And the pectin isn't digestible by the person, but it is digestible by bacteria. And so, typically, when you eat a fruit such as an apple or a pear or... a poorly ripened peach, for example, what you're doing is, to a great extent, feeding bacteria. And so if you have nice bacteria, you won't have trouble, but those foods can cause great problems if you have the wrong bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** What is your general opinion on raw versus cooked foods in terms of digestion and absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** No, there was an experiment. In the 1940s, when nutritionists worried about that saw that so many people were eating mostly canned foods, they put one batch of rats on a diet of purely canned vegetables, and another batch they took identical vegetables but fed them raw. And the animals eating the canned vegetables thrived. And the ones eating the raw vegetables didn't.

**CONTEXT:** Is there a significant loss of nutrients and minerals in cooking certain fruits or meats?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, those enzymes are biologically active, and you can buy the enzymes as products. For example, the pineapple enzyme actually can be absorbed into the bloodstream, where it has a systemic anti-inflammatory effect. I think it would help. I'm not sure whether it was approved by the FDA 30 or 40 years ago. I think it was accepted for use in horses because it was so effective at curing lameness. But the production of pancreatic digestive enzymes isn't a stress. I guess it's just... one of our natural functions, so I don't think there's any benefit in, as far as the pancreas goes, to supplementing extra enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the theory that consuming proteolytic enzymes from fruits like papaya or pineapple can reduce the body's stress of producing its own digestive enzymes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and when you haven't been eating a particular kind of food, like if you're avoiding starches, when you do start eating that food, your intestine takes a few days to adapt to it. So changing radically from one type of food to another will cause gas or diarrhea or something for the first couple of days.

**CONTEXT:** Does the intestine need time to adapt when changing dietary habits?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've seen a lot of adults with very low... CO2, sometimes as a result of taking drugs, and the bicarbonate baking soda is very helpful in a lot of ways. Diabetics and people with other problems can see really quick benefits sometimes from... sometimes even digestive problems, the bicarbonate. Helps to adjust the acid production in the digestive system and so on, and it helps to regulate the balance of minerals in the bloodstream, and it can to some extent bring up the systemic CO2. But I think the most effective thing is to check the thyroid function that's in control of producing the CO2.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on using bicarbonate supplements for a child with low CO2 levels?

**RAY PEAT:** That's too low, but it's not as low as some people I've seen who, within a couple of months, got it up to 29 or so. I think it's good to check his thyroid and read some articles on alternative views of how to interpret the thyroid. For example, the... AACE, I think it's the American Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists, has a range of TSH from 0.3 to 3.0, which is quite a bit lower than most doctors currently are going by. But I think the ideal number is towards the low end of that, 0.3 or 4, I think is... is probably the best for most functions. And Mary Showman's... Have you seen Mary Showman's thyroid site on the Internet? There's a lot of good information on thyroid on there.

**CONTEXT:** What is the ideal TSH range, and where can I find more information on thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** We give him squash, spinach. We try to stay away from the broccoli and those kind of things, but we do try to give him like the green leafy vegetables. Are all of the vegetables very well cooked? Yes. Salads are a problem for lots of people. They will cause either diarrhea or constipation in quite a few people.

**CONTEXT:** My son has chronic diarrhea, and we've tried various diets. What vegetables should he eat, and how should they be prepared?

**RAY PEAT:** My symptoms, I was constantly getting sick. I was constantly having... my throat was either infected... or my ears, you know, I did have, at one point, I had lost peripheral vision, and that was pretty much, you know, the start of it.

**CONTEXT:** What were the symptoms that led to your diagnosis of multiple sclerosis?

**RAY PEAT:** It came back. It came back within three weeks. I had it back. The reason I ask is that most of the... I think it was the first five or six people that I saw who had a diagnosis of MS recovered instantly when they took thyroid and one of the common symptoms of low thyroid is enlargement of the pituitary because of a prolactin secreting tumor and that can cause pressure on the optic nerve and it's often misdiagnosed. It's a brain disease and so it's good to check your prolactin and thyroid and it happens that those can often go with the other symptoms. The low thyroid makes you susceptible to urinary tract infections. Rhoda Barnes' books on the thyroid tell many stories about chronic... urinary and oral infections that clear up as soon as they take thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between low thyroid and symptoms like vision loss, and how can it be addressed?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I... You can get doctors to do it, but just in case there's something in your diet, you might try eating a raw carrot every day. For example, shredding a carrot and putting some olive oil, vinegar, and salt on it to make it tasty. That has a germicidal action and stimulates the intestine so that... In the well-diagnosed multiple sclerosis, they know that endotoxin is a very important factor in causing blood vessels in the head to be too permeable, letting stuff leak out of the bloodstream into the brain, and endotoxin can be drastically reduced just by eating a good-sized raw carrot every day.

**CONTEXT:** How can I check for an imbalance of good versus bad bacteria in my body, and what can I do about it?

**RAY PEAT:** Getting enough protein is very important, too. Milk, cheese, and eggs, shellfish. You should try to get around 80 grams of protein at least. I've known probably maybe 30 or 40 people over the years who were convinced that they had MS, who just basically had an intestinal problem, and as soon as they cleared out their intestinal problem, all of their very strange visual and auditory......tactile symptoms disappeared.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of protein intake in addressing symptoms that might be mistaken for MS?

**RAY PEAT:** If your thyroid is low, you won't be converting it and so it will adaptively protect you by being high. There were studies, a Framingham study found that people over 50... who had cholesterol under 200 were more likely to have dementia than people with higher cholesterol. And in a rest home, nursing home study, they found that the longest-lived people averaged up around 270 or 280 cholesterol. And all kinds of animal experiments show that you protect cells. Brain cells, all kinds of cells, by having plenty of cholesterol. It's really a protective factor against all kinds of disease.

**CONTEXT:** If cholesterol goes up when starting a pro-thyroid diet, does that mean there's a deficiency in selenium, glucose, or T3, or will it eventually go down?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, vitamin B1 and coffee can make a tremendous difference in, like if you just want to sit down and memorize the way I learned French to pass my graduate school exam. I did it over a weekend with just plenty of coffee and a few hundred milligrams of vitamin B1. sat down and memorized 4,000 words, I think it was.

**CONTEXT:** Do you have any advice for someone trying to learn a second language, particularly regarding memorization and fluency?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think if you want to speak it, you should memorize the paradigms of the verb forms and pronouns especially. And just get maybe 600 words, you can memorize, if you get a list of the words, you can find cognates and then just, if there aren't cognates, you can just sit and memorize until you have 600 or 800 words and then you can make your own sentences if you have the paradigms and that basic vocabulary. If you have to learn to read it in a hurry, then you want to take a vocabulary list of four or five thousand words and cover that quickly so that you recognize a good portion of the words you run across. And a kid, typically by first grade, a kid will have several thousand words of vocabulary.

**CONTEXT:** How should one approach learning a new language, focusing on vocabulary and memorization?

**RAY PEAT:** It makes you produce energy faster, more carbon dioxide, and it increases circulation to your brain.

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which Vitamin B1 and coffee enhance memory and learning?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh-uh. Well, yeah, the hops in beer are estrogenic. There are a lot of good things in coffee more than in tea. The coffee is a major dietary source of niacin and magnesium. And a couple of studies in England showed that the average English person gets, I think it was 20% of... 6 or 8 nutrients from coffee or tea. So they are a major part of the diet for people who use them.

**CONTEXT:** Should I be concerned about small amounts of plant estrogens in things like tea, coffee, or hops in beer?

**RAY PEAT:** It's just... You're less likely to catch some fairly uncommon infection if they're cooked, but they should be lightly cooked. Just the exposure to oxygen is going to break down the polyunsaturated fats the hotter they are. Eating them raw doesn't really protect you because once you've assimilated polyunsaturated fats, they're going to... eventually cause free radical damage in your tissues. But they're a little better if they're not overcooked. And the same with liver. The less cooking, the better, but even moderately well cooked is still very... liver is still very nutritious.

**CONTEXT:** What is your take on eating raw eggs and raw liver, and should they be cooked?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, six ounces is enough.

**CONTEXT:** How much liver do you recommend eating?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if I eat six or eight ounces of liver......and just ordinary other foods, I often will wake up with a low blood sugar or some symptom during the night, and so I've learned to cook it in a very large amount of butter or coconut oil. There's something about the absence of fat in liver. It's so high in protein that it tends to disturb your blood sugar if you don't have a lot of......both fat and sugar with it.

**CONTEXT:** Why do you recommend cooking liver in butter or coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** In the early studies, one of the first things they found... I think it was Graf, the psychiatrist. Some of his patients reported that besides the thing he was thinking about, they reported that their headaches had disappeared. People with chronic migraines just stopped having them after a couple of sessions of LSD. In the late 50s and early 60s... migraines were pretty well identified as an excess serotonin problem and LSD turned out to be counteracting the serotonin and curing the headaches and there because of the ideology the government demonizing the hallucinogens which were identified as anti-serotonin drugs the pharmacy interests in antidepressants for example wanted to emphasize that they were not going in the direction of the hallucinogenic drugs nd nd so they emphasized that serotonin was a beneficial thing psychologically and that people went crazy because they were destroying their brain serotonin by taking the hallucinogenic drugs and they pretty much fabricated an alternative explanation. for the hallucinogens and for their own drugs and submerged the therapeutic uses such as curing headaches and they were being used experimentally against breast cancer and several very serious diseases lost their funding. And couldn't get the materials anymore to experiment with because of the demonizing of the drugs but the mechanism seems to be that the LSD type drug does in a few situations imitate serotonin. And serotonin has a feedback system in the brain. In which it turns off the nerves that make serotonin. And this is the serotonin-like action of the hallucinogens. They turn off the serotonin-producing drugs in the brain. And so even though they do act on that serotonin receptor, imitating serotonin in that case, their basic function is still... anti-serotonergic, just as in 1953, they were found to act as antagonists to the muscle-tightening effect on blood vessels or uterine tissues and so on, they were identified as antagonistic to serotonin and because of the pharmaceutical industry, wanting to avoid any association to the muscle-tightening effect on blood vessels or uterine tissues and so on. with the anti-serotonin hallucinogens, they created the myth that serotonin is something you want to increase, that it's the happy drug, but actually it's pretty much the misery drug. Any excess of it produces nausea, diarrhea. High blood pressure, tumor growth, fibrosis, arthritis, dementia, and so on. So the scope for new research using these drugs is extremely broad. We've had just recently both a bromo LSD. And psilocybin studies came out showing treatment of either cluster headaches or other organic-type diseases. So it looks like research might be starting up again. One of the early LSD-like drugs was called Lisuride, which is called the... non-hallucinogenic equivalent of LSD, but it's just less in the ordinary doses. It's not hallucinogenic, so it's just a weaker form of LSD. And it's been used against diabetes and cancer and all of the serious degenerative diseases. And bromocriptine is another verdict derived. Drugs that cures pituitary tumors and there's a family used treating Cushing's disease and other pituitary related problems. So I think the research, after skipping 40 years, I think it's......about to get back where it was in the 1960s, recognizing that these anti-serotonin drugs are, in fact, anti-serotonin, and that that's how they produce their beneficial effects.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the therapeutic potential of tryptamine drugs like psilocybin and LSD, particularly regarding their anti-serotonergic effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Sunlight, you say? Have you found...? Sunblocks. Yeah, they are, some of them at least, are directly carcinogenic in contact with the skin. And there's a big phobia about ultraviolet. It will age your skin, but it's best to get... plenty of sunlight, but avoid the sunburn. And you can do that. There were experiments on rabbits a long time ago in which they put rabbits on a saturated fat diet or an unsaturated fat diet, and then they shaved them and exposed them to sunlight. And the animals on the unsaturated fat diet got wrinkly. Sun damaged skin, the ones on the saturated fat diet weren't hurt by the sunlight. The polyunsaturated fats in your skin are the target for the ultraviolet light producing damage. There are other targets, but if, for example, vitamin B2 is locally destroyed by ultraviolet light, but the... if the cells contain a lot of polyunsaturated fats, they act like an amplifier for the damage and cause the damage that accumulates with fibrosis and shrinkage of the skin and such. Other things, you can apply coconut oil to your skin and get some protection because it absorbs and interrupts that... amplification effect from the fats in your skin, and caffeine and aspirin are other things that are antioxidants and stop the free radical effects. So you can spread the solution of aspirin on your skin without the dangers of some of the chemicals that are sold as sunblockers.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on sunscreens and the risks associated with sun exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** Mostly I make oxtail soup or lamb shank soup. But... When I'm using the pure gelatin powder, one way is to mix some sugar with it and moisten it and then heat it in the microwave until it gets clear and then add something like orange juice concentrate or lime juice and make sort of gummy bear candies out of it. As snacks, it makes a chewy, sweet snack that is, since it's been melted, it's more digestible than taking the powder in a plain form or I use it for adding to recipes to make things like mousses and cheesecake equivalents or sometimes just add it to other foods as long as it's dissolved until there are no particles visible and it's digestible. Marshmallows are another way to get some.

**CONTEXT:** How do you use Great Lakes gelatin powder?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. No, not that I know of. It's just... I don't use... The wireless things, I have wire connections for everything because you can get a field meter and find that some of the appliances have a pretty intense field a couple feet away from them. And cell phones, for example, are a serious dose of radiation that... definitely does affect your nerve function and probably increases the brain cancer incidence. And that's why I avoid any of the wireless devices that I can.

**CONTEXT:** Is wireless internet a source of small-dose radiation that I should be concerned about?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I'm... Had we talked about Luca Turin's lectures on the Internet about the way molecules and cells interact? If we did, I don't remember. My recent email talks about some of the biological processes that... have been excluded from science, and a few people are starting up on some of these old approaches to how a cell works, that they're along the same lines of Gilbert Ling and Albert Szent-Györgyi. A researcher at the University of Washington, Gerald Pollock, has some lectures on the Internet. Describing his work with water, the structure of water, and Luca Turin has lectures on the basic ways that drugs or other chemicals interact with cell systems. And it's bringing a connection to stuff that was pretty much suppressed after the 1950s. In favor of molecular biology, in the 1950s and early 60s, they were calling it quantum biology. But it doesn't necessarily involve the whole metaphysical thing of quantum physics. But it's just the idea that the interactions of hormones and drugs and cells can be understood on the electronic level. Rather than the lock-and-key mechanical conception that is current the last 40 years.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on Luca Turin's lectures and the concept of quantum biology in understanding cellular interactions?
