**RAY PEAT:** I think it's driven primarily by the food industry wanting to sell their products, the seed oils. The seed oils were already seen to be toxic. They could cause sterility, degeneration of the brain and the gonads and so on, probably from 1925, but especially in the 1930s and 40s. The very oxidizable seed oils were known to be toxic. That was one of the factors. Researching vitamin E as something to counteract the toxicity of the seed oils, unsaturated fats, as well as the toxicity of estrogen, which happens to interact, synergize with unsaturated fats. And the pig industry had been looking for ways to make their... animals gain weight and eat less food. And the George Burr, who's identified as the inventor of the essential fatty acid concept himself, discovered that the essential fatty acids slow the metabolic rate tremendously. to give more worlds to their deficient animals. Eating sugar instead of unsaturated fats had about a 50% higher metabolic rate, but various people noticed that effect. And they found that feeding soy and corn to the pigs because of the unsaturated fats suppressing their metabolic rate increased the profit. less food in, more pig out. And at the same time, they noticed that it was lowering cholesterol, just as one of its biological effects, a toxic effect, basically. And the paint chemists, the oil chemists, discovered that instead of using the... expensive seed oils that were now being sold largely as pig food, the chemists discovered how to make paints and plastics from petroleum around 1950, and that decreased one of the big markets for soybeans in particular. Henry Ford had imported... soybeans to use in the car industry. He made a car body entirely out of soybean plastic and hoped to replace iron with that. There's a picture of him using the sledgehammer to pound on one of his cars, showing that they were very strong. But by the late 1930s, only doorknobs and steering wheels were still made of the... soybean plastic. But when the petroleum chemists learned how to use petroleum, that freed up the soybean market for pigs. And their production was great enough. They wanted to find new markets to replace the paint and plastics market. And so they started promoting the health idea out there. Soy oil, cotton seed oil, safflower seed oil, and so on. And the only biological effect, other than sterility and dementia, that were established for the seed oils was that they lowered blood cholesterol. And for several decades, people had been noticing. That cholesterol accumulated in the walls of blood vessels, atherosclerosis. And although the first person who discovered that in rabbits had dissolved the cholesterol in unsaturated vegetable oil, he realized that cholesterol by itself wasn't causing the disease. But there have been these experiments that gave a basis for the seed oil people to say cholesterol is found in the hardened arteries and in the blood, and their oil lowers the level in the blood. So they argued by association that if it's in the blood vessel and the blood... that you can lower it in the blood and prevent the disease. But the very people who had made those discoveries had realized that it wasn't so. And in fact, in the 1930s, people had found that a thyroid was enough to prevent... the atherosclerosis, and at the same time, it lowered cholesterol. Over the last 10 or 15 years, a Swedish doctor named Uffe Ravenskov has gone through the literature and shown just beautifully that there is no connection between atherosclerosis, heart disease, and the triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood, they are associated but it isn't causal. And the experiments that have been done in the 30s showed that hypothyroidism and the associated changes caused by the lack of thyroid and metabolism were what caused the atherosclerosis. And... the cholesterol seems to be there as a defensive reaction to protect the injured blood vessels.

**CONTEXT:** Why do you think America is so afraid of cholesterol and saturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it refers to the... A chain of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, in one case, they have all of the hydrogen atoms attached to them that's possible, so they're saturated with hydrogen. And if some of the carbon atoms lack the hydrogen, they just have their electron bonds more exposed to the environment. And that... the absence of the hydrogen makes them more flexible, instead of being sort of like a bottle brush bristling with the hydrogen surrounding the chain of carbons. It's more like a necklace of beads, flexible, where the hydrogens are missing. The bonds can rotate. more freely. You get two or three or four or five of those double bonds and the chain is bent at each place there's a double bond and at the single bonds the molecules rotate freely so you can get very... flexible shapes when you have the purely or highly unsaturated molecules and that flexibility you can see when you put a bottle of oil in the refrigerator. Coconut oil is hard when it's just a little cool, just below room temperature or even at room temperature. Olive oil has to be much cooler before it starts solidifying. That's because it's relatively saturated and canola and corn oil have to be extremely cold before they all solidify. And that's biologically important. One of its meanings is that if the organism lives at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, for example, and it contained butter fat or olive oil, its fats would be solid and wouldn't be manageable. For example, if an animal contains 30% fat and it all hardened, its subcutaneous fat would become stiff, just the way. A steak, when it's in the refrigerator, the fat is stiff. When it's in very warm conditions, it becomes soft and flexible. So in the tropics, even fish in the Amazon River, for example, have fat as saturated as butter fat. And if you grow soybeans or corn... in a very warm climate, their fat is saturated according to the temperature. And chocolate and coconuts grow in a place where the temperature is probably averaging close to 90 degrees, and so they need to have very saturated fat just for the biochemical manipulation of the molecules to happen. And... if you had unsaturated fats, like it's necessary for the cold water polar fish for them to be flexible, they have to have triply or quadruply unsaturated fats. But if you had those in a fish in the Amazon River, the fish would oxidize its fats in just a couple of days. Even with a medium unsaturated oil, such as soy oil or corn oil, if you put a rubber hose into a cork in the top of the bottle and put the other end of the hose in a cup of water and leave the bottle at room temperature, the water will rise up the tube. As the oil is consuming oxygen, it's just a constant process even at room temperature. If you raise it to body temperature, 95 or 100 degrees, then the process is much faster and you have sticky rancid oil very quickly. So it's a biological adaptation. You can make a... a pig have subcutaneous, unsaturated fat depending on the temperature of the weather that it's exposed to. If you put a sweater on the pig, it'll get more saturated. It's quite interesting.

**CONTEXT:** Can you just elaborate maybe the difference between the saturated and unsaturated fats for the listeners?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the polyunsaturated fats that we unavoidably get in our diet. They're constantly breaking down, producing free radicals and tending to cause inflammation and tissue injury. And if anything is disturbing the metabolism of a cell, that's more likely to happen. For example, the normal healthy oxidation through the mitochondrion. It keeps the electrons tightly controlled while they're being transferred from, say, a glucose molecule to an oxygen molecule. But if you take away some of the oxygen, the electrons in the mitochondrion will have no place proper to go, and they will escape as ____. ____ free radical potentiators and so the cell becomes more oxidized in the absence of sufficient oxygen. So any stress of a cell puts out these electrons that can attack the exposed electron bonds in unsaturated fats, but the saturated fats aren't open for stray electrons. So every time you're limited in your delivery of oxygen to a cell, you're putting the unsaturated fats in the way of these stray electrons, and those will then start chain reactions that, at the extreme, they form lumps of material called age pigment, or lipofuscin. And these, the pre-radical oxidized fat fragments attached to proteins and they collect bits of iron and other breakdown products from the pre-radical attacks on whatever is around in the cell. And these......lumps of age pigment because of their iron and fat fragments are able to catalyze the consumption of energy and deliver energy from the enzymes to oxygen so they can create a false mitochondrial effect to the cell. consuming energy and wasting oxygen and then that accelerates the process because the real mitochondrion is further deprived of oxygen by these age pigment lumps. But before that happens, that tends to be at the end of the life, you get degrees of that happening in which oxygen deprivation and stress... cause lower degrees of damage and inefficiency. Signals go out changing the conditions of the organism. For example, sending signals that more energy is needed activating hormones such as cortisol......estrogen and growth hormones and these three hormones are very closely connected to the rising triglycerides and the damage to the blood vessel wall and they tend to interact cortisol increases estrogen, estrogen increases cortisol and they both increase growth hormone and... all of these tend to break down triglycerides in the free fatty acids which are more reactive tend to become oxidized more quickly, cause more cellular injury so the circulating fats in the bloodstream are in the first place......activated by stress and unsaturated fats and then these three main hormones increase the damage they can do even though they normally would be part of a defensive repair process in the presence of the unsaturated fats, they magnify the damage.

**CONTEXT:** What your thoughts are around atherosclerosis and heart disease and stuff like that?

**RAY PEAT:** The whole stress hormone system, the things that Hans Selye popularized and studied for many years... he was concentrating on the steroid system, and that's the most powerful stress-induced system. The pituitary senses something wrong in the organism, increases its ACTH, which drives the adrenal glands in particular to take up cholesterol and to synthesize... cholesterol from raw materials and to direct the cholesterol into the mitochondrion to turn it into pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and finally cortisol. And cortisol is the thing which has a short-term defensive reaction against stress. One of its main effects is to turn protein into sugar so that the sugar can be used for energy to increase adaptive ability to handle the stress. But if you if you keep your cortisone up too long you'll destroy too much of your protein tissues. So the before the cortisol stage of stress the continuously activated adrenal tissue will be first producing our pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA and it's it's only when those aren't enough to handle the stress that the the progesterone will be further converted into the cortisol. So the production of the cholesterol is the first stage of handling stress reaction and then the cholesterol has to be converted into pregnenolone to further the defensive reactions. But......the increased production of cholesterol itself is a primitive defensive anti-stress system, and the later stages, pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA, back up that basic function of cholesterol, giving it more dimensions of protection. But, starting probably around 1920......people were trying to purify cholesterol and see what its biological effects would be. They found that, I think they used about 10 different toxins. Everything from pus from an infection to snake venom, heavy metals, chlorinated solvents. Everything that occurred to them, they would give a lethal dose of the poison to an animal and if they gave it a good dose of cholesterol, it would survive an otherwise lethal dose. And that has been done repeatedly. There have been some more specific things. For example, the testes are stimulated to more efficiently produce sperms in the presence of cholesterol and the cholesterol has a direct activating effect on producing more of the defensive steroids and helping the cell do what it should do as well as interfering with the immune system. toxic effects of chemical stresses and physical stresses. For example, hyperthermia that will cause your red cells to break down if you add enough cholesterol, the cells won't be hurt by an otherwise deadly temperature. So it's just an incredibly broad spectrum protective substance.

**CONTEXT:** Why is cholesterol so important for our physiology, and why does it go up when one is stressed?

**RAY PEAT:** One thing is that makes the food a lot pleasanter to eat. It makes it digest more efficiently and steadily. Experiments with a loop of intestine, they would put just proteins or just... carbohydrates or just fats in at a time and they found that the digestion was very poor until you had all three types of food present at the same time and then it was as if the intestine needed a complex stimulus before it would really effectively start absorbing and digesting the food. Partly in a stimulus to your intestine to handle the protein and carbohydrate effectively. And it's a signal of satisfaction that helps to lower stress to have fat and sugar in your food. So, I... guess that we should ask, in a homeostatic state, which is, I guess, hard to get to for a lot of people, can a person, or should they, live on a quote-unquote fat-free diet? Because the body is going to be working efficiently. Or no, I mean, you highly recommend, especially in this day and age, people definitely increasing their saturated fat content.

**CONTEXT:** If the body can make all the saturated fat it needs, what's the importance, if any, of consuming saturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and no one is really sure what the optimal level of cholesterol is. For example, looking at old people in rest homes, they followed their cholesterol levels and saw that the ones that lived the longest had a pretty... high cholesterol. I think the 270 was the number that corresponded to the longest survival. And in the Framingham study, they saw that people over the age of 50 who didn't have at least a 200 cholesterol level were more likely to develop dementia. And... In a big study of violence, they divided populations into those with at least 180 cholesterol and those below 180, and the violent offenders were clearly connected with the below 180 cholesterol levels. So going back to the dementia, and I think you mentioned in one of your books you talk about people with low cholesterol, whatever that number is, there's a higher incidence of depression. And you talk about cholesterol is precursor to pregnenolone. Can you elaborate on pregnenolone's effects on our brain chemistry? I know you talk about ACTH on it. Can you elaborate on that for the listeners?

**CONTEXT:** You talk about people with low cholesterol, there's a higher incidence of depression. And you talk about cholesterol is precursor to pregnenolone. Can you elaborate on pregnenolone's effects on our brain chemistry?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, several signals can... tell your brain that you're suffering stress, for example. Low blood sugar is one of the basic things. And the various things that amount to stress act on the stability regulators of brain cells. The GABA is a deep-inducing......peptide fragment of the glutamic acid, amino acid. Glutamic acid excites the brain. If you take off the acid, it becomes gamma-aminobutyric acid, which sedates the brain. The stressed brain will activate enzymes to produce GABA and turn off the excitation. And there are specific peptide signals that act parallel with glutamic acid to excite the brain and to interfere with GABA as a stabilizer. And the valium type sedative or tranquilizer acts on the GABA stabilizing system of the brain. If something is preventing the glutamic acid from being turned into sufficient amounts of GABA, valium will fill in. End. Activate the GABA system and activating the GABA system turns off the stress signals and stops the pituitary from producing ACTH to activate the adrenal cortex. And progesterone and pregnenolone and many other things act on the GABA receptor system. Thank you for watching. And it's pregnant and happens to be one that doesn't have many other hormone-like effects. It's basically a stabilizer at all levels of cells in the brain. And its effect is on the GABA system to imitate valium, to tell your pituitary that the stress......is under control and to stop producing so much cortisol. So, in early experiments testing the toxicity of a pregnenolone, someone gave a group of mice or rats 10 grams of powdered pregnenolone made into a slurry injected into their stomachs. And... They didn't have any appetite for a few hours because being so full of powdered pregnenolone. But the only hormonal effect that they saw was that some of the animals that had been stressed and had excessive cortisol or corticosterone before the dose of pregnenolone. When they were getting the huge dose, they were normalized, so the animals were more normal after that big dose than they were before the dose. For a person, that would be like eating a pound of progesterone all at once, or pregnenolone, rather.

**CONTEXT:** Pregnenolone alone, I mean, could nutrition philosophies do enough if you're making the conversion? To raise pregnenolone, to help with brain chemistry, skin tone, and overall stress reduction? Or, do you recommend possibly using a pot of pregnenolone to actually help balance that and lower cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it depends on how far the system has deteriorated. Many years ago, some Russians found just with isolated mitochondria that giving them pregnenolone would structurally restore damaged mitochondria and allow them to begin producing more pregnenolone. And that's similar to what people saw with isolated progesterone on slices of adrenal gland. When they would give the adrenal slice progesterone, it would... increase its production of progesterone. So in both cases, there's a positive feedback rather than the typical negative feedback. You give it some and it makes more, which means that the organism is designed as if it wants as much as it can get. Right. And ordinarily, you can make enough from......converting sugar to cholesterol, and with thyroid and vitamin A converting cholesterol to the other hormones. But when you have been poisoned with not enough of the needed foods or too much of the unsaturated oils, heavy metals causing pre-radical reactions and so on, then... it helps to use all of the supports possible, thyroid supplements, pregnenolone supplements, possibly DHEA and progesterone, saturated fats, sugar, everything that works in the same direction.

**CONTEXT:** Why is growth hormone inflammatory? Is it just in itself inflammatory? Is it the excess of it actually being inflammatory to the system?

**RAY PEAT:** Most of the research is designed to praise its beneficial effects, but there are some very basic observations that... People who have been chronically deficient in it have a remarkable absence of atherosclerosis. The mice that genetically are deficient in the pituitary hormones have no growth hormone. They aren't very big, but they live two or three times as long as normal mice. And one researcher removed the pituitaries from several species of animals and found that they lived much, much longer than animals with their pituitaries if they were given basically a thyroid supplement to keep their metabolism going. So, when you have hypoglycemia... you increase your growth hormone and it tends to come with the other pituitary stress-responsive hormones. And all of these tend to have their side effects. So, they're all beneficial in the right amount at the right time, but they're all harmful when they go on too long or too high a level. People with the giantism acromegaly from, for example, a tumor or overactivity of the pituitary gland, they have an extremely high incidence of atherosclerosis.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain just the... the basics for people in the differences between HDL and LDL?

**RAY PEAT:** Both of them are able to participate in detoxification. The protein that helps to carry the cholesterol in the bloodstream itself has some very specific... anti-stress, even anti-viral activity. So they're part of our ability to respond to stress, the protein as well as the cholesterol associated with the protein. And they're both defensive and both important, but the LDL is mostly the one that carries... cholesterol into the places where it's needed, the brain, the ovaries, testicles, and adrenal glands, but anywhere you're making steroids, and that includes the skin. Skin is probably our biggest endocrine gland, the brain is the next, and then the ovaries, testicles, and adrenals. And the HDL has probably some more specific antitoxic effects where the LDL is more delivery system of cholesterol itself. And toxins will tend to increase the HDL relative to the LDL. Toxins of most types will increase both of them defensively, but the chlorinated hydrocarbons radiation, estrogen and alcohol, for example, will increase the HDL relative to the LDL because it has some more specific anti-toxic effects.

**CONTEXT:** I know you've talked about before how DHEA can actually lower LDL cholesterol. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, anything that is activating the turnover, increasing your metabolism, progesterone redirects your metabolism. DHEA intensifies some of the cellular turnover processes. Thyroid is the basic thing increasing the turnover. And the turnover of cholesterol, besides making more of the pregnenolone, progesterone, it's also important to keep it turning over. So that it doesn't sit around and get oxidized in the presence of the unsaturated fat breakdown product which everyone has exposure to. So everything that increases your metabolic rate such as thyroid, DHEA, coconut oil, and sugar, and salt, all of these things. Can potentially lower your cholesterol just by increasing its use. But it depends on where you're starting. They can potentially increase it if synthesis is the limiting factor. So it's really just going back from cholesterol, the conversion, having those things, sugars, T3, vitamin A, to Pregnenolone to produce THC and so forth?

**CONTEXT:** So, it's really just going back from cholesterol, the conversion, having those things, sugars, T3, vitamin A, to Pregnenolone to produce THC and so forth?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Someone took blood samples every 15 minutes during the night and recorded whether the person was awake or not and... As soon as the lights went off, the cortisol began rising and it continued pretty steadily through the night and sleeping decreased the rate of increase of cortisol, but it shows that the stress system recognizes very immediately. In less than 15 minutes, that darkness is stress in some way. And that seems to be that the intrinsic oxidation free radical production gets out of control in proportion to the exposure to darkness. When you measure the cytochrome oxidase, which is what delivers food electrons to oxygen, it's the last step in the mitochondrial energy production. If you measure that during darkness, it degrades. And after several hours, like in the far north, where you have 15-hour nights... After about 12 to 15 hours, the mitochondria swell up, some of them explode and leak their contents. Just from the 15 hours of darkness is fatal to a large proportion of the mitochondria. And first they produce more and more cortisol, but finally they're overstressed. And simply die. So that's part of the aging process, is being exposed to the prolonged stress of darkness. And when they shined red light on the heads of experimental rats, red light penetrates very easily. But it happens that the cytochrome oxidase enzyme contains copper in the... the blue state of copper oxidation and the blue copper absorbs red light and there isn't very much of it so the red light passes very freely through the tissue without being absorbed randomly and so it's delivered to the copper in the oxidative enzyme and it restores the copper in the cytochrome. to its proper functional role and that's currently what's lost during exposure to darkness. The use of the cytochrome oxidase enzyme, in effect, wears it out in the dark and it needs to be recharged by light. You can see similar effects if you expose......a bit of tissue to sunlight, the blue light and ultraviolet light will excite electrons. The same way x-rays excite electrons in hard tissue especially. The excited electrons can last for years or decades in the hard tissue such as the tooth or bone. But in the soft tissue... these excited electrons can be detected in an electron spin resonance machine for hours after being exposed to sunlight. So you can tell the history of a seed or a bit of tissue by measuring the state of its electrons, whether it was exposed to blue or ultraviolet light. But while you're measuring it in the machine......and expecting it to be able to show excited electrons for hours, if you shine just a burst of red light at the tissue while it's in the machine, it quenches those excited electrons and they go back to their resting state. That's apparently what's happening in the... RAD experiment, restoring the copper by absorbing red light puts the electrons back in the proper arrangement.

**CONTEXT:** So, in a simplistic sense, that light stimulates cellular respiration, progesterone, which is similar to the thyroid, which helps with the......conversion where darkness is more stimulatory towards estrogen, serotonin, those things which are antagonistic to the conversion?

**RAY PEAT:** One thing is that makes the food a lot pleasanter to eat. It makes it digest more efficiently and steadily. Experiments with a loop of intestine, they would put just proteins or just... carbohydrates or just fats in at a time and they found that the digestion was very poor until you had all three types of food present at the same time and then it was as if the intestine needed a complex stimulus before it would really effectively start absorbing and digesting the food. Partly in a stimulus to your intestine to handle the protein and carbohydrate effectively. And it's a signal of satisfaction that helps to lower stress to have fat and sugar in your food. So, I... guess that we should ask, in a homeostatic state, which is, I guess, hard to get to for a lot of people, can a person, or should they, live on a quote-unquote fat-free diet? Because the body is going to be working efficiently. Or no, I mean, you highly recommend, especially in this day and age, people definitely increasing their saturated fat content.

**CONTEXT:** If the body can make all the saturated fat it needs, what's the importance, if any, of consuming saturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, largely because of the effect on the taste system and the intestine reflexes. It helps to handle the other foods efficiently and to make the whole body recognize that it's being fed properly. So it's part of the reflex nervous system that guides eating and it helps to satisfy the appetite. Right. They feel more satisfied when they've had fats, especially saturated fats. And the experiments with the rats, they used a purified diet. And when saturated fats were added, they had similar cancer-free results. It's a very small amount of... of unsaturated fat that is responsible for the stress and cancer production. The equivalent of just about a teaspoonful of unsaturated fat per day is enough to show a threshold increase in the incidence of cancer. And when we eat natural foods, we're always getting some of the unsaturated. And it's hard even eating coconut oil and butter fat and beef fat and so on that they only have about 2% unsaturated fats. But on a normal diet, it's hard to get down to that threshold of about 4 grams of fat per day. And so that's... besides eating the most saturated type of fat, that's one of the arguments for using carbohydrates as a major part of your energy supply, because if we have some extra carbohydrates more than we need to burn at the moment, they will turn into saturated fats. And extend the proportion so that in effect you can lower the unsaturated proportion below the threshold of carcinogenic fats.

**CONTEXT:** What about Niacinamide? With HIV you often have a very high polyunsaturated fat circulating. Niacinamide is something that will help lower the free fatty acids. If you lower the free fatty acids, will the CD4 and CD8 increase again?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. You think so? Because you know what, his doctor advised him to begin the tri-therapy, like ACT, I think. You know, you advise that or you have other recommendations? Because I read a lot of it about coconut oil, I try to explain that coconut oil are very, you know, useful when you have, you contract HIV and I gave him maybe 5 tablespoons per day, but you know, if the CD4 decreases, I don't know how to explain him to that, you know. Sugar, niacinamide and aspirin. These are all things that help to lower the stress and keep the immune system up.

**CONTEXT:** But when you said aspirin, it could be 15 aspirin today?

**RAY PEAT:** Around that.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on why in regards to metabolism, hypothyroidism, the liver, just as much as you can put out there for people?

**RAY PEAT:** Saturated fats have an anti-inflammatory protective effect. A group studying liver disease has found that the fish oils and shorter seed oil unsaturated forms increase liver inflammation and tendency to become fibrotic and cirrhosis. And that can be blocked by the saturated fats. I think it was an Indian that noticed that alcoholics in India who lived in the areas where they had ghee or butter as their main fat didn't develop liver cirrhosis despite being alcoholic. And they began testing that and saw that......alcohol activates the unsaturated fats to react with iron to break down and produce the liver damage. And so all of these saturated fats are protective when you have an inflamed situation. And that goes all the way up to the waxes, such as extracted from beeswax and sugar cane and such. is in the medium chain length. It includes some of the very short chain saturated fats. Mostly it's 14 and 16 carbon chains. The shortness of the chain means that it's very mobile in your system and the shorter saturated fats can be handled in the mitochondria without relying on the transport systems for handling 18 chain carbons for example. The 10 carbon chains. Can be oxidized as easily as glucose, and so instead of interfering with glucose metabolism and switching the whole mitochondrial function, they can participate and even activate the glucose oxidation. And they interfere with the... anti-metabolic effects of the unsaturated fats. By interfering with the anti-metabolites, they let the mitochondria run at full speed. And that works as if you're giving a thyroid supplement. The unsaturated fats interfere with all of the effects of thyroid. is probably getting in the way of the suppressive effects of the polyunsaturated fats, but especially in the mitochondrion where the coconut oil itself is being very quickly burned. And used as energy.

**CONTEXT:** So the interesting thing for the listeners, I'm going to summarize that if I can, is that saturated fats help to protect the body and detox from unsaturated fats. They help with glucose oxidation and kind of re-teaching the liver how to store glycogen and helping with blood sugar regulation. Saturated fats like coconut are pro-thyroid and anti-inflammatory.

**RAY PEAT:** Speeding the metabolic rate, that's the most important thing the thyroid does, and sugar and coconut oil work right with it to maximize the good metabolic oxygen consumption. And it's interesting because, at least with our clients, there's other things we've done, but to lower people's cholesterol, we've actually increased their saturated fat. And most people just get completely... you know, blindsided by that, but it definitely works.

**CONTEXT:** Can you talk about... You've quoted, I think it was you say, in a lot of your articles about coconut oil and its effect on the pancreas, am I correct? Can you talk about that a little bit?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he was experimenting at the time he was working. He was just discovering the... the multiple factors that regulate blood sugar. And they saw that the pituitary would activate the adrenals to increase cortisol and raise the blood sugar while the pancreas was making insulin to lower the blood sugar. And the coconut oil... And sugar worked very similarly to keep the system working to allow insulin both to function and to be produced. And he didn't know... At that time, there were a lot of things about the interactions of pituitary sugar. Adrenal and so on that hadn't been discovered yet, but working just with those few elements, he was on the right track.

**CONTEXT:** Why should people be using milk in their diet? Because most people out there, nutritionists, are actually not promoting it and saying it's actually quite inflammatory. And you actually promote it as something that's anti-inflammatory.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the calcium content besides... It contains such a broad spectrum of all of the nutrients, but the disproportion of calcium is, I think, what makes it anti-inflammatory. And that, there are lots of ways that the calcium is working. One is that it increases the oxygen-using ability of the mitochondria. The same way thyroid does, it specifically activates some enzymes, the uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria that turn on a higher metabolic rate, but systemically it's suppressing the parathyroid hormone, and the parathyroid hormone short-range protective adaptive hormones that, when it continues too long, becomes counterproductive and contributes to degenerative diseases. The people on kidney dialysis tend to get very high parathyroid hormone because of an imbalance of phosphorus. and calcium, and the parathyroid hormone is what eventually tends to kill them, causing all kinds of stress reactions, aging reactions to be intensified. And having a chronically high calcium intake gives you a chronically low parathyroid level, so the parathyroid isn't... taking calcium out of your bones and tending to put it into your arteries and kidneys and so on. Keeping the parathyroid hormone down protects your arteries and kidneys and bones and allows your insulin to do what it should to keep the prefatty acids under control and... the whole system tends to function in a smoother way when you keep these stress hormones minimal.

**CONTEXT:** So the calcium downregulates parathyroid hormones, downregulates inflammation. So you talk about how the dairy in itself is actually pro-thyroid, which can help with the conversion of cholesterol? Is that because of the progesterone in it?

**RAY PEAT:** That's just one minor factor. Human milk at least contains enough progesterone and thyroid to meet the baby's needs. So the babies that are born without a thyroid gland, if they're being breastfed, will not have any hypothyroid symptoms until they're weaned. So human milk has a full. Supportive endocrine system in it for the baby and cow's milk isn't as appropriate for human use but it still has some of the metabolism supporting hormones as well as the nutrients.

**CONTEXT:** Is it the fat content? Is it the protein? Is it the combination of both? Or is there something else in the egg?

**RAY PEAT:** With the industrialization of the egg industry 40 years ago or so, the... cholesterol content of eggs went down quite a bit and the polyunsaturated content went up. So if you can get non-industrial eggs from chickens that have pastures and can eat varied food, the eggs are going to be a lot better. But the cholesterol in the egg seems to be one of its important... nutritional values. Something like 600 milligrams of cholesterol in your diet from some of the experiments increases the oxidative stability of your lipid particles in your bloodstream, makes them less atherogenic.

**CONTEXT:** So basically a lot of people in the paleosphere are under the impression that free fatty acids in their blood are actually beneficial. So I was curious if Dr. P could elaborate on that and perhaps explain how that can be harming to the liver and the thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's my main argument against eating a high-meat diet. That's one of the important functions of sugar, I think, because my next newsletter in four months, I think, will be talking about pre-fatty acids. But basically they're one of the means by which stress causes its damage. I've known people who were eating......two or three pounds of meat a day and who were getting sicker and sicker as their free fatty acids and free amino acids increased. And that started me reading more about the free state of fatty acids in the blood. And just about everything that goes wrong involves... free fatty acid increase. If they're totally saturated fatty acids, such as from coconut oil and butter, those are less harmful, but they still tend to shift the mitochondrial cellular metabolism away from using glucose and fructose. And turning on various stress-related things by lowering the carbon dioxide production I think is the main mechanism.

**CONTEXT:** What does cholesterol have to do with mitochondrial respiration?

**RAY PEAT:** First of all, it stabilizes it, protects it against the pre-fatty acids that are one of the disruptive influences. And besides stabilizing it, it actually stimulates respiration, oxygen consumption, which might be just because of that stabilizing effect. But... It functions as an antioxidant, partly by the way it interferes with the free fatty acids. And cholesterol associates with proteins and nucleic acids, as well as other lipid materials. And I think the way it binds to proteins is... responsible for its stabilizing effect in the mitochondrion. The proteins that make up the mitochondrion have a very liquid property so that you can use an oily solvent, remove all of the oil-soluble materials, and you still have a mitochondrion there. But that shows that......the apparent mitochondrial membrane is really a protein structure member rather than a fat membrane system. And that protein structure is reinforced and stabilized by binding with cholesterol molecules.

**CONTEXT:** So in a sense, would you think though it obviously just helps with the production of... Well, I don't know if it would help with the production of T3, but just the production of carbon dioxide as well?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it stimulates the whole respiratory process, which includes conversion of some cholesterol to the hormones as well as producing carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** Is that because of the salicylates in it or something?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's easier then to get the refined coconut oil if you're having problems with, you know. Some of the components in it. Yeah, I recommend the completely deodorized kind. The research was always done with the filtered kind that had no odor at all. Oh. Even though it tastes really good to make, you know, ice cream or cookies or something out of the very aromatic kind for safety and general use, because some people are allergic to the... aromatic, tasty things in the coconut, making it completely odorless, I think, is safest.

**CONTEXT:** Right, but that's not too processed, though. The bleach, refined, deodorized, RBD, or whatever they call it, you can find ones that are not... They just pass it through diatomaceous earth or full earth. And so it's just a filtering process, no chemical treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, yeah, because, I mean, when we've had the regular virgin coconut oil, I always end up feeling kind of sick or achy or something, like inflammation, sort of like with fermented foods. So I just didn't know what was going on there. It just takes a spoonful of the very odorous stuff to make me sick for about three days.

**CONTEXT:** And how much a day would be for... just an average weight person, just however much they want, a few tablespoons?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a tablespoon with a meal was enough to make me breathe harder, get pinker, have a higher pulse rate, and lose about, I guess it was a pound or two a week.

**CONTEXT:** So could it be too, because some people aren't used to eating saturated fat, and they might have an overburdened liver, a biliary insufficiency, and so forth, so they increase saturated fat too fast? Could it do with CCK, the release of CCK that causes nausea, or do you think it's just the actual...

**RAY PEAT:** Low thyroid people have very touchy gallbladders and it just takes a little grease to trigger a gallbladder reaction and you've got to get your gallbladder in good condition. Getting the estrogen down is the basic thing, but low thyroid people, a very high percentage of them have gallbladder disease.

**CONTEXT:** I got another email from a listener and he wanted to know, he knows you advocate coconut oil and so forth for their antimicrobial properties. But in addition, he'd like to ask about your views on butyric and propionic, propene, I can't even pronounce it. There you go. Acid. Those are produced in the intestine by fermenting bacteria and they have such a protective effect against cancer that people were actually selling butyric acid pills for cancer treatment about 20 years ago.

**RAY PEAT:** But the stuff smells so bad that some people preferred the cancer to the treatment. They sold tongs to pick up the pills before you swallowed them so you wouldn't have to touch such stinky material. But it is one of the components of milk, butter, coconut oil, the four carbon. Fatty acids metabolize into that when they're released from the glycerol in the triglyceride. So it's just a trace of it that gives you the buttery smell when you eat butter. It's what butter gave butyric acid its name. But since it's produced by bacteria......and since people with very good health have no bacteria in their small intestine and the farther up in your intestine that you have bacteria, the likelier you are to have a lot of digestive and other health symptoms. And low thyroid people have slow digestion and the bacteria... tend to occupy most of their intestines, so from the fact that the healthiest people don't have bacteria and the butyric acid is produced by fermenting bacteria, it should be limited to the colon and preferably the materials that feed the bacteria should have been digested and absorbed in the small intestine. So, I think ideally we shouldn't be making any butyric acid in the intestine, and both butyric acid and propionic acid have some pro-inflammatory effect as well as their anti-cancer effect. So, even though they are potential cancer therapies, ultimately... I'm for minimizing the intestinal production of them.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. And I think I'm mostly in the large intestine?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, no. When you have bacteria living up in your bilium, a lot of it's produced there.

**CONTEXT:** What's, first off, what's the risk of not only taking a statin, but what's the risk of lowering your cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** The tendency to become violent or suicidally depressed. Increasing the tendency towards dementia, making your red blood cells less stable, everything becomes less stable, the cholesterol is an intrinsic part of chromosome and DNA function and of cell division regulation. The first things people notice would be the emotional effects probably, and the statins, they have some beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, but at the same time, they do lower your cholesterol and they interfere with that whole chain of synthesis, so they affect your coenzyme Q10 production and anything in that system, and so that probably is a factor in why they cause bones to rot and muscles to break down catastrophically. Muscle pains, cramps and muscle pains. These are very common in people who lower their cholesterol very much with the statins and that can cause what they call a rhabdomyolysis where the muscle is basically dying. And I think it's a similar process that causes what they call a fussy jaw, the interference with our cholesterol. It affects everything.

**CONTEXT:** Right. Of course, with most people you see fatigue, energy issues. And would you see a decrease in libido and hormonal function?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's one of the early things.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. And it's interesting that some of the most common drugs are SSRIs and libido-enhancing drugs as well as cholesterol-lowering drugs, so it's kind of like a little circle going on. So to summarize, what are some foods or what are some things that people can do to help normalize their cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** A daily raw carrot will tend to lower your cortisol and estrogen, and that, by stopping the stress, will let your thyroid work better and increase progesterone. And that should... accelerate the conversion of cholesterol into more progesterone and protective things. And avoiding the polyunsaturated fats is essential for your thyroid to recover. And everything that increases your metabolic rate, such as calcium and sodium, are essential. Of course, to get the vitamin, you could use dairy, liver, eggs.

**CONTEXT:** I think you mentioned before vitamin C. What does vitamin C have to do with lowering cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** It's part of the adrenal and ovarian system. I don't think it has a direct synthetic......relationship, but it's just part of the adrenal. Probably having an antioxidant function in the cell is excited.

**CONTEXT:** Aids in the process, kind of like an adaptogen of some sort?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's like a general adaptogen rather than a synthetic catalyst.

**CONTEXT:** Are there any key points that we might have missed that you feel is important for the listeners?

**RAY PEAT:** The important thing is to not think of the unsaturated fats as anything essential. That has never been proved. And what Berger himself proved was that the unsaturated fats lower metabolism so that the so-called deficient animals had a 50 percent higher metabolic rate. And that means that all of your... nutritional requirements will increase when you shift to a pro-thyroid saturated fat diet, and the increased metabolic rate will increase your need for copper and selenium, the B vitamins, and I'm not sure what the effect on protein requirement is. The protein can contribute to that same intensifying metabolism effect, so I don't know what the ratio should be between the saturated fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it probably varies with the individual's stress level. But as your level of activity increases, the proportion of glucose oxidation increases, decreasing the use of fats. So your activity level governs the amount of saturated fat or carbohydrate and protein that you need.

**CONTEXT:** If everyone's listened and we did a show on polyunsaturated fatty acids, you can go back to our blog talk radio show page. It's blogtalkradio.com backslash East West Healing. And you can download that show and listen to it, but he's talking about a lot of above ground vegetables, nut seeds, legumes, fatty fishes, collard oil fish oil, all those things are the unsaturated fats, which I know is opposite of what everyone's telling you, so definitely get educated. It's important to know what you're putting in your body and what could possibly be causing the issues that you're having. Then you have to make a change. Go for it, Ray.

**RAY PEAT:** You've probably been hearing about the woman doctor who treated her husband's Alzheimer's disease with coconut oil and medium chain triglycerides. That fits right in with the established evidence that... It's the breakdown of the highly polyunsaturated fats that is contributing to the Alzheimer's disease. You can see the chemicals like isoprostanes, the spontaneous oxidation products of the polyunsaturated fats in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. And so the... One of the direct effects of the saturated......medium chain triglycerides or coconut oil is to provide the saturated fats to the brain as well as the ketones and the energy supply.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, it's on the website, the address, Post Office Box 5764, Eugene, 97405. So they just send you a check, let you know what they want with their address, and you'll mail the books to them?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the postage listed there is $3 for one book, but for a group of more than one book, the postage per book is less.

**CONTEXT:** Right, it depends on... the number of books and the particular combination.

**RAY PEAT:** Right.

**CONTEXT:** And you're still taking more time off to see a newsletter?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. And how much is that for the listeners again?

**RAY PEAT:** In the U.S., $28, Canada and Mexico, $38, and elsewhere, $48.
