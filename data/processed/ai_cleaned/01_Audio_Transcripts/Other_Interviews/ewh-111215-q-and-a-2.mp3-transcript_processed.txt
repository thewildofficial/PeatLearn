**RAY PEAT:** Wherever iron gets loose, it is available to react with things like polyunsaturated fats, but also protein and nucleic acids and such. The reactive form of iron is the reduced ferrous form rather than the fully oxidized ferric. That means if you don't get enough oxygen to your tissues, the iron tends to get reduced by glutathione. People talk about oxidative stress, but reductive stress is really what you have to worry about in relation to iron. Alcohol, for example, interferes with the use of oxygen and causes the reduced glutathione to accumulate, to shift the ratio towards reduction. That activates iron, reduces it to the reactive ferrous form, and then that causes the damage. Iron accumulates faster than it should under the influence of estrogen, among other things, but an inability to use oxygen properly intensifies the absorption of iron. That seems to be what estrogen is for: to create the illusion of an oxygen deprivation so that you absorb more iron. A woman, they've tested the absorption percentage of a dose of iron in women versus men, and women absorbed nine times as much iron as a man did. That's primarily the influence of estrogen. The action of estrogen is to create the need for more iron to carry oxygen in the blood, but unfortunately, besides making the body absorb it, it also tends to create the conditions for the body to absorb it that make iron toxic and put it into the reduced reactive form. One of the main things that activated iron attacks and tends to start chain reactions in is the polyunsaturated fatty acid, and that too strongly interacts with estrogen. If you eat polyunsaturated fats to excess, they will activate the estrogen circulating in your blood, and they will also turn on the enzymes that produce estrogen. And then estrogen, in turn, activates enzymes that desaturate and elongate the existing fatty acids, turning, for example, linoleic acid into arachidonic acid. Which again creates a vicious circle in which the estrogen increases the most reactive PUFA, which activate and increase the quantity of estrogen. And both of those contribute to the activation and intensification of iron toxicity. So you can break the cycle in different ways: donating blood to get rid of iron, or doing things to interrupt the estrogen-fatty acid cycle.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the dangers of iron?

**RAY PEAT:** There's no blood test that I know of that will really say anything meaningful about your status of iron, because the iron tends to hide in your liver and bone marrow. The blood tests that people often go by can go in either direction without any relation to the iron stores. The fact that when you give someone an iron supplement, it increases their red blood cell count or their hemoglobin doesn't mean they were deficient in iron, because they used to treat anemia with doses of arsenic. The arsenic creates the stress that tells your body, you need more iron, more blood. So any stress that interferes with oxygen use will make you drive up the blood production system.

**CONTEXT:** Is low hemoglobin due to estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all animals that have estrogen, the female tends to look slightly anemic. It does something to slow the production of red blood cells. Partly lowering the body temperature is one of the actions of estrogen and slowing down thyroid function. So probably the most common cause of apparent anemia, as Rhoda Barnes pointed out, is hypothyroidism. And I think he was the one that mentioned the experiment in which rats whose tail bones normally don't make red blood cells, in this experiment, they folded the tail back and made a hole in the skin of the abdomen and stitched the tail so it was kept in at core body temperature. And it quickly began producing red blood cells, just by raising the temperature. So the first, safest way to treat anemia might be to wear long wool socks to warm the extremities.

**CONTEXT:** What is copper's role in regards to iron?

**RAY PEAT:** Its primary role is in the respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. That, I think, is probably the reason that copper is essential for constructing the hemoglobin molecule.

**CONTEXT:** So you feel that most people have higher amounts of iron in their liver and bone marrow, which is toxic, and along with estrogen, it makes it more toxic, so most people are in an iron overload state?

**RAY PEAT:** In men, it has a direct tendency to accumulate continuously with aging. Menstruation probably helps women. They avoid the accumulation until they stop menstruating, and then the curve is maybe even steeper than men's. It builds up by the age of 60 or 70 to pretty much rival men's. I think menstruation probably is one of the factors that makes women have a greater longevity. There was a study of immigrant fruit pickers' kids in California who didn't get a good diet but they ate lots of oranges. They had on average, I think, a hemoglobin of 10, versus below 12 is considered tending towards anemia. But they found that these kids didn't get infectious diseases like the well-fed city kids who had lots of hemoglobin. And they've seen that same thing in Africa, that when they would have campaigns to give iron supplements, lots of people would come down with malaria because iron activates the growth of germs and weakens our immune system. So one of the tests that's meaningful in the blood but that's seldom done is the iron saturation, and people tend to be resistant to cancer development if the saturation is somewhat low, like 25%.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding ADD-ADHD, is sugar the problem, or could polyunsaturated fats be more of the issue?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's the unsaturated fats. The sugar tends to move everything in the right direction away from brain malfunction. The polyunsaturated fats interfere with the tension and increase adrenaline and the sympathetic nervous system and the stress hormones. I think that's probably the main thing, as well as hypothyroidism, that keeps the front part of the brain from getting enough energy to focus.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the proper way for Hashimoto's disease to be diagnosed?

**RAY PEAT:** Those antibodies interact with cartilage of the joints just about as well as with the cartilage. So it's really a connective tissue inflammatory disease which goes with hypothyroidism. The cartilage is one of the first places that you see hypothyroidism in children. It accounts for quite... hypothyroid kids tend to be knock-kneed and why girls aren't good pitchers often because the cartilage in the knees and the elbows is basically swollen.

**CONTEXT:** You talk about how estrogen affects the colloid in the thyroid and stimulates it but inhibits the proteolytic cells to break it down, leading to Hashimoto's diagnosis due to altered antibody production because of estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** The whole idea of autoimmune disease is, I think, off the mark. The immune system, I think of it as a cleanup, a mess system. The antibodies help the phagocytes remove debris. If the debris is caused by an infection, they'll get the germs too, but if the debris is caused by low thyroid causing the connective tissue to swell, the immune system has to come in and try to help clean out the junk that builds up because of low thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** What is the timeframe for someone whose body temperature has historically been in the low to mid 97s to stabilize if they implement your recommendations?

**RAY PEAT:** I've seen a couple of people do it in three or four days, very skinny little people, just who had been on a pure soy tofu diet or something. As soon as they started eating eggs and oranges, they just popped up out of there. A couple of people who had been diagnosed as having broken pituitary glands with no function at all, all of their pituitary hormones would pop back as soon as they started eating rationally.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on Hans Selye's work regarding an absolute reserve of energy to deal with stress?

**RAY PEAT:** I think where he left it is where the issue of cumulative buildup of iron and PUFA comes in. Both the long-chain polyunsaturated fats and iron accumulate with aging and with stress and under the influence of estrogen. He just wasn't looking far enough and long enough to see how those factors interacted with stress. The stress, well, he was looking at the adrenal glands and first their adaptive phase and then their exhaustion phase. What happens is during prolonged adaptation, estrogen and other hormones, growth hormone, and the inflammatory mediators accumulate. And estrogen buildup from blocking the actions of thyroid function, the buildup of estrogen begins to directly drive the adrenal gland. When that reaches a certain point, you can actually get bleeding in the adrenal gland and death of the cortical cells in the adrenal under the influence of just an excess of estrogen. And you get the same sort of overdriving from the direct hormonal action on the adrenal glands from a buildup of iron or serotonin or polyunsaturated fats. And so the systemic effect of stress, I think, is what you neglected to think about when you talked about the reserve innate amount of energy that we had.

**CONTEXT:** Do you feel that inflammation is actually more of a pathological response, rather than a healthy part of a defensive immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** For Metchnikoff, he saw the white blood cells going in and curing the problem, clearing up the mess. But because of the interpretation, he was an embryologist who saw the development through evolution of the meaning of the immune system. But after the medical establishment took it over, they created the idea of inflammation being the curative process. But the swelling, the redness, the pain that are the medical view of inflammation, these I think are pathological. The immune system should work like in the prenatal state. This is analogous to what Metchnikoff was looking at in his cnidarians and developing embryos and so on. In the embryonic and fetal state, injury is corrected without inflammation. The cells just repair the damage in an efficient way and don't leave a scar. And when you keep the carbon dioxide and sugar where they should be, you basically get fetal or embryonic healing without a scar and without inflammation. So I see it as an inability to deliver what's needed to repair the damage that we see as redness, pain, and inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** When people follow your philosophies, their energy goes up, but they gain weight. Can you elaborate on scenarios that create this and how to halt it?

**RAY PEAT:** Probably isn't the issue. It's gaining inches and bulging. When you're doing everything just right, very likely you will rebuild muscles that were damaged by stress and poor nutrition. As those muscles quickly grow, you should be doing things like feeling your calf muscle, seeing how big it is. You can even use calipers on the contracted muscle and see it grow as you're eating right, but the circumference of your thighs, hips, and belly should be decreasing, even though your weight is increasing. When I experimented first with DHEA, I wasn't expecting anything. I was just wondering what it felt like to take a few milligrams of it. I noticed after a week or two in the mirror that my waist seemed to be reappearing after having been just sort of a straight-sided appearance for previous years. It made me wonder, my pants were getting looser, and so I thought I must be losing weight. So I checked, but I was exactly the same weight. I shrunk around the waist, and what happened was that I was simply growing more lean tissue and burning up some of the fat so that I had more muscles, but was smaller around the waist. So initially, a lot of people, well, of course, people have to work on what they're eating, their ratios and calories, but for a lot of people, and people hate hearing this, but it's actually a sign. Your body is actually moving in the right direction and it's actually healing, because you're rebuilding. But if someone is putting down fat rather than muscle, their pants are getting too tight, they're just eating too much, probably too much fat or total calories.

**CONTEXT:** What are your feelings on aromatase inhibitors?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the... That's... Basically, they're usually selling just powdered cabbage leaves and naming it for that. But that has been tested and found somewhat estrogenic in itself. It changes the metabolism of estrogen, but it has an estrogenic effect directly. And the saturated fats, what I was just talking about, the estrogen aromatase activating effect of PUFA, that's antagonized when you shift the balance to saturated fats. And aspirin, by blocking the formation of prostaglandins and reducing inflammation, interrupting the effect of the PUFA. Aspirin is a very effective aromatase inhibitor, but the drug companies don't want people to know that because they charge tens of dollars for a pill of their stuff where aspirin costs a penny. But at the same time, if people just eat a diet that's low or void of unsaturated fats, a diet of saturated fats, eat the right types of carbohydrates and the right amount of protein in itself, wouldn't that diet, through regulating cellular metabolism, actually inhibit aromatase enzymes or down-regulate estrogen itself? Thyroid inhibits aromatase. Anything that lowers cortisol inhibits it because cortisol is a major activator.

**CONTEXT:** If people start eating this way and increasing saturated fats or taking thyroid glandulars, is it dangerous because the liver is storing so much iron that it could backfire?

**RAY PEAT:** No, no, the iron, if it's in the oxidized state, it's just sitting there doing no harm. It forms like little granules and doesn't get out or go anywhere to do anything.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on coffee, and why do you say it has benefits, contrary to the idea of adrenal fatigue?

**RAY PEAT:** Do you have any idea of who started the idea of adrenal fatigue? I've been trying to find out who is responsible for that word. I think it was a little boy in a sandbox. I don't know. But the coffee contains a lot of good things besides the caffeine. It's an extremely concentrated source of magnesium and a very good source of niacin and some of the other B vitamins. But the caffeine has an antioxidant effect. As long as you use it with food, it tends to stabilize your blood sugar and reduce inflammation. Probably its anti-inflammatory effect is the most important thing.

**CONTEXT:** How should coffee be used, for example, sipping it after a meal with cream and sweetener?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, taking it with or after the meal has basically none of the harmful effects. I've known several people who said that just a sip of coffee would make them feel shattered and shaky for the rest of the day, but I told them to put some heavy cream in it and maybe some sugar and take it with each meal, only with each meal. Within three or four days, these people were happy coffee drinkers.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on regulating metabolism using nutritional philosophy versus utilizing supplements and enzymes?

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on where the supplements come from. People with very sensitive digestive systems have to be very careful of any supplement, just because the factory it's made in might carelessly introduce things, and there might be residue left from the microorganisms that were used in processing it. So you have to be really cautious about allergies.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the idea that fructose is harmful and causes diabetes, as opposed to your philosophy?

**RAY PEAT:** Just a few days ago I heard from someone in New Zealand who said he had been diagnosed a few months ago with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. And he said he started... I didn't get the details of the whole diet, but it included 300 grams of fructose every day. And he now has a new diagnosis. His liver has no fat problem. So everyone else is saying that fructose by itself causes fatty liver, causes high triglycerides, causes diabetes. My article in the newsletter on the sugar questions two months ago goes through the history of how that fructose phobia evolved over the last 50 or 60 years. It's very closely connected to the cholesterol doctrine of heart disease and the idea of essential fatty acids being essential. And if essential, then beneficial, and if beneficial, not toxic. And meanwhile, the actual science was going on for basically 80 years, showing that the essential so-called fatty acids are toxic and carcinogenic. Just straight-line research that was submerged by the oil industry perverting the medical establishment around the cholesterol doctrine of heart disease.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding pigs being fed on soybeans, their fat becomes more unsaturated and unhealthy. If their fat was truly unsaturated, how is it still solid at room temperature?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know which one would be solid at room temperature. What kind is that? I think they're talking about, I think they're saying, you know, you feed a pig, poop in the soil, that unsaturated fat technically is liquid at room temperature. And they're saying, well, if you take out a piece of bacon, they're associating the fat, it's actually solid, it's not liquid. Oh, well, it isn't. If you extract the fat... When I was a kid, I would get blocks of lard from my grandmother, and they were definitely solid at room temperature, just like butter. But the lard that I've seen in recent years, which is now slightly over 30% PUFA, it's soft at room temperature. And the fat droplets in bacon naturally are enclosed in cells and connected by connective tissue. So even if it was 100% PUFA, it would still have a white, firm appearance.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on time-release T3 versus basic Synthroid?

**RAY PEAT:** I've heard from several people who were having either overdose effects from the time release or no effects. And I got some documents from a lawyer who was defending someone, and so they had the compounded time-release T3 analyzed by a couple of different laboratories, and no T3 could be found in it. The T3, if you compound it carelessly, it's very easily destroyed or lost or oxidized or otherwise decomposed. And with the wrong time-release agent that might work for vitamin A or something, it might just permanently bind the T3 or it might release it as soon as it hits your stomach acid. There just hasn't been good research on how to compound a time-release T3. And even a lot of the generic products that they presumably have imitated Cytomel, some of the generic products have very erratic effects. Generally, I don't think the idea of a patented brand name medicine is a good idea. It's usually mostly fakery. But in the case of T3, I haven't seen a good other product.

**CONTEXT:** What is your recommendation on eating shredded carrots, and is there a difference in eating them before, with, or after a meal?

**RAY PEAT:** Usually it's just eating the carrot, but if you're having a problem with low blood sugar or thyroid irregular function, if you eat it with a meal, you might slow digestion to the point that you aren't getting your food as expected. And so you might feel shaky after eating because you're not absorbing your food or activating your thyroid properly. But if a person wants to reduce their fat absorption, eating the carrot with the meal will accelerate weight loss. But you have to fit it in the way that it functions best. And one thing to keep in mind is that if your intestine has been sluggish for a long time and you start stimulating it with the raw carrot, you will be changing the rhythm of the peristalsis, and it takes sometimes a week to set up a new rhythm around a daily carrot, so you can get some side effects while you're adapting, creating a new bowel rhythm.

**CONTEXT:** Can eating carrots constipate people?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, very rarely. One in a thousand or so will react to the carotene. If you're very low thyroid, if the palms of your hands and calluses are orange, then you might want to rinse the carrot after grating it to get some of the carotene out.

**CONTEXT:** Would adding baking soda to orange juice throughout the day help increase carbon dioxide levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, some orange juice is so sour that people tolerate it better if they put a pinch of baking soda in it. The orange juice companies typically add citric acid if they accidentally get ripe oranges, because people are so accustomed to the acidic tang of orange juice. But you tend, if you put it in, acid baking soda is going to bubble off most of the carbon dioxide. Some will dissolve in the water and it might increase your systemic CO2 a little bit. There have been experiments where, like with bicycle racers in Death Valley, they had them take a tablespoon of baking soda before the race and they found that they performed better because of the either the increased sodium or the increased CO2.

**CONTEXT:** Does anything you do nutritionally to downregulate serotonin also upregulate CO2?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure how general it is. Probably. It seems probable.

**CONTEXT:** If someone doesn't have a gallbladder, is coconut oil the best source of fat, or are there other good sources?

**RAY PEAT:** I think just eating things in a mixed form in small amounts is important if you don't have a gallbladder. The bile is still going to be there, but it's coming out in dribbles rather than surges. So mixing your fats with your proteins, carbs in smaller amounts?

**CONTEXT:** In regards to detoxing from PUFAs, is it possible to have more reactive hyperglycemic reactions initially, and is there a way to make it easier?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your blood sugar steady and even adding some saturated fat. The saturated fats inhibit the stress hormones, which means that they also tend to inhibit the release of fat from stores. So sugar and saturated fats and niacin and aspirin and various safe nutrients inhibit the release of fat. So doing everything you can to keep the fat in place. It isn't going to completely stop the reduction of the fat. The fat cells themselves are able to slowly oxidize. I think someone calculated that a person could, just in their fat cells alone, if the fat never leaves, the fat cells will consume about three pounds in a couple of years. That's a very slow reduction, but the minimal release into the bloodstream isn't going to cause the stress symptoms if you're having the saturated fats to turn off the stress reactions outweighing the pro-stress effects of the liberated fats.

**CONTEXT:** What about using foods or topical or powder supplements like Vitamin E or Niacinamide for PUFA detox?

**RAY PEAT:** Niacinamide is an anti-fat liberating substrate and usually 100 milligrams twice a day is all it takes, but it's fairly safe to use larger doses if it's needed.

**CONTEXT:** Can high blood pressure be looked at similarly to high cholesterol, as an adaptation mechanism due to stress?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. When your body senses that it's not getting enough oxygen or glucose or other essential factor, it tells the heart to pump more blood to deliver more oxygen and glucose. And that's the way it should work. But when you're loaded with PUFA, they're tending to give chronic signals to the brain that nothing is getting the glucose and oxygen that it needs, because in truth, the PUFA are interfering with the use of glucose and oxygen, but the PUFA are also telling the pituitary and the nervous system to crank up the stress signals.

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of salt, especially for pregnant women?

**RAY PEAT:** The eclampsia problem is very closely connected to high PUFA, and that goes with low thyroid. And low thyroid goes with the low carbon dioxide and poor ability to retain sodium. And so the sodium is constantly being lost, as well as the magnesium. And as the sodium is lost, the adrenals try to correct things by increasing aldosterone. Which does retain sodium, but at the expense of losing magnesium faster. And if your thyroid is low, you not only lose sodium through the kidneys, but your cells can't retain magnesium. And so, a low sodium intake relative to your hormonal needs, what you're doing is turning on a system that makes the problem worse by letting out the magnesium that is needed for cell energy and controlling inflammation and tension and cramps and so on. So, if you just increase your sodium intake, you're compensating for a low thyroid function, but you're turning off the aldosterone, and getting the aldosterone down directly lowers inflammation and stops some of the magnesium loss. So, just by adding sodium, as Brewer and the people he based his thinking on, they showed that just sodium alone would very commonly cure the whole problem. And that seems to be acting by way largely of the aldosterone system.

**CONTEXT:** Does albumin play a role in regulating water distribution, and how is it affected by estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen interferes with the liver's synthesis of albumin. The polyunsaturated fats, under stress, are going to be circulating in the blood, and the albumin is picking them up, but if you're producing less albumin and having more unsaturated fats, the albumin isn't able to detoxify them very well, but it becomes saturated with unsaturated fats. When albumin is loaded with fats, it goes right into cells. That's part of its function is to deliver saturated fats to stress tissues, so that's part of, if your fat is saturated, the albumin has a logical function to increase the energy supply during a crisis by taking it right into the heart, for example. Saving sugar for the brain to use and so on, but in the kidneys, this being overloaded with fat happens to make the albumin pass right through the kidneys into the urine, and so you tend to lose albumin as well as sodium under the influence of high stress and PUFA, and it shows up as albumin in the urine when you're under great stress. And the albumin, one of its functions is to retain water in association with the open protein molecule. It has sites that associate with sodium, and the sodium associated with water is kept in the vicinity of the albumin molecule. But if you're low in sodium, the albumin can't work, and if your albumin is low besides, then you get a double problem of water retention. So the first thing that happens when you correct your fats and thyroid and estrogen and so on is that you let water out of your body while retaining the sodium, magnesium, albumin, and all the stuff you need. And that's why when women are pregnant, their blood volume goes up so much. It's because of albumin, and Tom Brewer talks about estrogen lowering that affecting blood volume and blood pressure. So the fetus and the brain are being deprived of oxygen and sugar. And so you get the signals to drive up the blood pressure, but the same thing is causing the blood volume to go down. So you've got to get the blood volume up, and salt is the quickest way to do that.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on heavy metal detox, such as IV glutathione or vitamin C drips, or high doses of cilantro or chlorella?

**RAY PEAT:** Hans Selye did experiments with poisoning animals with mercury and showed that a given dose would cause death of the kidneys and such. But then he gave them the same amount of mercury plus vitamin C, and they had no toxic effects at all. The mercury in its reduced form isn't toxic, it's just a metal. But it's like iron, it depends on the exact state of reduction that makes it stick to things. And caffeine is associated with getting the heavy metals out of your tissues, probably as a sort of chelator. But vitamin C from regular foods is an important defense against all of the heavy metals. But if you take these reducing agents in an unphysiological way, they can activate iron. Like I mentioned in the liver, alcohol causes the reduction of iron by activating glutathione. Glutathione is the agent of making iron toxic. So if you put glutathione or another reducing agent into the blood in an unphysiological way, it can increase the pre-radical damage.

**CONTEXT:** Is there an advantage to shredding carrots as opposed to eating them whole or just chewing them?

**RAY PEAT:** There have been experiments with the length of the fiber. And, for example, the experiment with different ways of milling bran. And the one that was called bee-weighing bran had about ten times better function in the intestine than the ordinary way of grinding it to a dust. And it's the same if you put a carrot in a blender, you're destroying a lot of the water-retaining function of the fibers. Your teeth leave large sections of the fiber intact. So chewing it is very good.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on Weston A. Price's work?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, he saw that traditional diets produced good tooth development, generally, and bone development, so his work was basically very good, seeing that you can eat a lot of traditional diets and be healthy.

**CONTEXT:** What are the reasons for low sperm count or quality in men, and what dietary changes can help?

**RAY PEAT:** Low thyroid is probably the main cause of both male and female infertility. And already in the 1940s, people saw that pregnenolone by itself was enough to greatly increase sperm quality. And the polyunsaturated fats, which interfere with the steroid production as well as thyroid function, are a major villain in male fertility.

**CONTEXT:** What are the causes of sleep problems, such as waking up with a high pulse, and how can they be alleviated?

**RAY PEAT:** Taking too much thyroid too soon can do that. Your liver should store enough glucose or glycogen to let you fast for at least eight hours, especially during sleep. But before the liver has regenerated its ability to store glycogen, it should be able to store enough glucose or glycogen for at least eight hours. The thyroid is making your brain and muscles and kidneys need more sugar and oxygen, and so you have to eat more often until the liver is able to adapt.

**CONTEXT:** If someone is eating according to your principles but consistently has high pulses, should they increase carbs or eat more often?

**RAY PEAT:** Eating more often and making sure that the fat is just enough to keep you from absorbing your sugar all at once and burning it, having some fat with your carbohydrate makes it absorb more slowly. So increasing the fat... Yeah, sometimes that helps to sleep through the night, to have a good amount of fat along with your carbohydrate at bedtime. And salt, I've known very young and very old people both with sleep problems who as soon as they tried a very salty snack at bedtime, just had perfect sleep. Salt is very effective at lowering adrenaline.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that sugar intolerance can be overcome by consuming pure fructose, but then sleep problems arose. What are your thoughts on this?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's probably that the starch is getting digested and assimilated more slowly, and that eating some fiber with your carbohydrate, fiber and fat will extend the absorption of it longer. And the normal thing is that the sugar is absorbed quickly in the upper part of the intestine, and starch, if it's slow to break down, can feed bacteria lower in the intestine and cause intestinal inflammation that interrupts sleep.

**CONTEXT:** Could a very high RT3 have anything to do with sleep problems?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's from high stress. And getting your endotoxin and cortisol down, I've seen quite a few people just with a daily carrot get their intestine disinfected enough that their reverse T3 goes down and their cortisol goes down. So the combination of fat and fiber might be a way to make your blood sugar steadier.

**CONTEXT:** What contributes to dental issues, and why is there conflicting information on carbohydrates and fruits for dental health?

**RAY PEAT:** I saw a recent article on dental health in Sweden, and they saw that during the time that cavities have decreased radically, sugar candy and soft drink consumption had actually increased, and they couldn't account for why the teeth were healthier while the basic diet hadn't changed so much, but had increased in the supposedly cavity-causing snack foods. And in my sugar article, I mentioned some of the old studies in which they modified the thyroid or estrogen and found that increased estrogen increased the dental decay, increased thyroid reduced the dental decay. And one whole line of dental research has shown that stress will very quickly cause an outbreak of cavities, and mainline dentistry just thinks in terms of germ growth in the mouth and completely neglects the chemical and immunological function of the saliva. I think the saliva is a mediator of stress.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on fasting and protein restriction for longevity and disease prevention, such as cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Activating your metabolism, running things faster, is going to eat up proteins that shouldn't be there. And one of the main things interfering with the breakdown of protein is the PUFA, especially the long-chain PUFA that accumulate with aging. People like to talk about the membranes as where the fatty acids are active, where they make a difference, but the experimental background of what the membranes consist of is just completely ignored by mainstream medicine. Cholesterol itself is part of our cell division apparatus, part of the chromosomes, part of many functional proteins, so are the free fatty acids and the phospholipids that they participate in. The nuclear structure and the cell division structure is regulated or deranged by the type of fatty acids in your diet. Accumulating the long-chain unsaturated fatty acids with aging is changing the way the cell functions at the deepest levels.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on carb restriction for longevity, as promoted by people like Cynthia Kenyon and Rob Wolf?

**RAY PEAT:** In the short range, just fasting itself will reduce the endotoxin absorption, and so that's always an effect that can help things like arthritis and so on. And dropping your carbohydrate intake will raise your cortisol production. And people feel better very often from either fasting or just dropping the carbohydrate intake because the cortisol excess produces a sort of anesthetic euphoria. People can get addicted to taking cortisol pills because it makes them feel good, makes the pain go away. But in the long run, that's stressful to turn protein into the carbohydrate that your brain and blood cells need. It requires a shift towards a higher cortisol function to break down the proteins. And so what you're doing is running on stress so that the proteins that you eat will be converted to the sugar that you need. And if you have the carbohydrate in your diet, your cortisol is going to run lower, like the monkeys they've studied. When fruits are scarce, they have very high levels of cortisol.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on cell phones and whether they are unhealthy, similar to microwave threats?

**RAY PEAT:** Microwaves are a threat, and so they fixed the ovens so that they weren't irradiating people so much. The ovens used to not have good seals on their doors and used to actually emit very intense fields. And the telephones, the same way. There have been experiments for over 50 years showing that there are real biological effects from even moderately weak fields. But here it's the doctrine of the cell membrane again. The standard medical doctrine is that a cell has a fat membrane around it because it needs something to seal in a watery solution of chemicals to isolate it from the environment because you have high potassium and magnesium in the cell, low calcium and sodium, and to maintain that balance they visualize needing this barrier membrane. And so they see a random solution of chemicals in water as being what life of the cell is. And therefore, for a radiation to affect the chemistry of the cell, it has to be just like the effect of the same radiation on those chemicals in a test tube. And they show that you have to basically have enough microwave energy to cook an egg or something before you see damage to the chemistry of those enzymes and such in the test tube. But in the cell, the whole problem is that there is no such barrier membrane. It's the whole structure of the cell which does the regulation, not a magical barrier at the surface that keeps a random solution inside. The whole cell is so highly organized that many of the regions have an antenna-like function that respond to very low levels of electromagnetic energy. And if you actually do the experiments, you can see that an animal's behavior, the chromosome function, reproduction, and so on, will change at the same time. At very low levels that aren't heating the enzymes, aren't heating the organism noticeably. But it's this very persistent doctrine in medicine that the inside of a cell is a random solution. That's the basis for saying that microwaves are harmless.

**CONTEXT:** When you talk about thyroid, are you always referring to T3? Do you recommend thyroid glandulars if people need thyroid support?

**RAY PEAT:** If a person's cholesterol is down around a hundred milligrams percent, then they have to be careful with everything. They're very fragile. The cholesterol is a basic anti-stress substance, and you've got to get the cholesterol up to at least normal, minimum 160 milligrams per cent, preferably somewhat higher, before you worry about increasing your general metabolic rate and energy production. And orange juice is usually the safest first way to get your cholesterol up to normal. Then if your cholesterol is up and you're getting enough of the vitamins and minerals that are essential, then the thyroid will very quickly make your adrenal glands adapt. And with the balanced thyroid hormones that were in the traditional thyroid glands that people got in fish head soup or chicken stew where the neck included the thyroid gland, you clearly don't need that. Those traditional diets, the thyroid consisted of about three parts of T4 to one part of T3. And as the liver gets energy in the form of glucose, it will convert T4 to T3 to adjust the amount of T3 and energy production. If you don't have sugar and take your glandular, you just experience about 25% of the potential effect of it. Your liver is not going to activate the rest of the T4. So the glandular is in a way safer because it lets your liver handle your physiology to a great extent. If you try to take just T3 and completely satisfy all your thyroid needs with pure T3, your TSH goes down, your thyroid stops working momentarily. But if you don't take your T3 during the night, your TSH is going to rev up and turn on a lot of inflammatory processes. And you'll experience acute hypothyroidism in just 8 to 12 hours of not taking your T3. So it's most convenient for most people to have some of the T4, as in the glandulars. The trouble is the technology of making a glandular product seems to have been lost. And it's murder. It was making their traditional thyroid product for about 85 or 90 years. And Revlon, the cosmetics company, bought the product and went through several changes of ownership. And in the process, the new owner decided to extract thyrocalcitonin to have a new product. And so they kept selling the remains of the thyroid gland, minus the calcitonin, and subject to whatever process was needed to separate it. So the new thyroid gland dealer, even in these so-called traditional armor, is no longer what it used to be. And there has been research to catch up with the new product, so if you think about the research that was done with armor for all of the 20th century, you can't necessarily say that it's going to apply to whatever is being made with the so-called armor equivalent or generic material. If the manufacturer is selling part of it separately, it isn't really the traditional product.

**CONTEXT:** What is the correlation and roles between magnesium and calcium, and what is the optimal ratio?

**RAY PEAT:** Coffee is a great source of magnesium, but you get if you're not under stress and your thyroid is good, your cells have a tremendous ability to retain magnesium because it binds to the ATP molecule, becomes part of the molecule. And if your thyroid is low and you don't produce ATP fast enough, the cell doesn't have the main thing that binds magnesium intracellularly. And so it tends to go out into the bloodstream and get lost in the urine. So your thyroid status is the main thing that determines how much magnesium you need. A low sodium intake will make you lose magnesium by increasing the aldosterone production. And you can't talk about the ideal ratio of the minerals in abstract because it's the interaction. And the same with calcium. Calcium lowers a lot of the excitatory, inflammatory things, which would tend to make you lose magnesium and sodium. And so if you have a diet that seems to be deficient in one of these, you can very often solve the problem with any of the other four: potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium. William Frederick Koch, who was one of the first people to study the parathyroid gland, would remove the gland and cause the muscle contractions from the absence of the parathyroid hormone. But he found that he could cure the spasms with any of the minerals, not just calcium, but potassium, sodium, or magnesium would also cure the spasms. So it's a matter of having a total of these alkaline minerals, not an exact balance. And one thing that is another factor that interferes is the phosphorus or phosphate intake. A lot of Americans get seven times as much phosphate as calcium, and it takes many years for the effects to show up, but one of the functions of fructose is to make you lose phosphate faster than otherwise, and that's supporting the function of the parathyroid gland to improve the ratio between calcium and phosphorus. If your fructose intake is high, then you don't have to worry too much about the exact ratio of calcium to phosphorus, but the ratio in milk, 1.3 to 1, is very close to a very safe ratio, but you can easily get by with two or three times as much phosphate as calcium, especially if your sugar intake is good, and then if you're getting plenty of salt and calcium, you don't have to worry much about the other two calcium minerals.

**CONTEXT:** Does calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And then a lot of people that do, because a lot of people will take magnesium or a calcium supplement because they have restless leg syndrome, you know, restless leg syndrome, etc. So a lot of the times, if they're deficient in calcium, the cells are taking up calcium. By taking calcium alone, you can actually decrease that excitatory nature and upregulate magnesium itself without any intake of it. Is that true too? Yeah. That's why potassium and sodium and calcium will often prevent cramps or spasms and such. They're helping you retain your magnesium more efficiently.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the research regarding cell membrane and membrane signaling in the biotech field?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it's very good business because they can sell anything if they say it's working on signals via the cell membrane. But basically, if a cell is stressed, it's a waste of time to do the research, so I don't. It will admit things that it wouldn't otherwise and lose things that it shouldn't lose. If a fat is attached to a substance, it'll get into the cell where it wouldn't otherwise. But when they talk about surface receptors, very often, if they actually experiment, it can be demonstrated that the substance is acting inside the cell, not just to the surface. This goes back 80 years probably. Well, 150 years if you look at the whole history. But people in the 30s were showing that their experiments showed clear entrance of large molecules right into the cell in large quantities. Albumin was repeatedly seen to massively enter cells of all different types and carry with it whatever it carried. But immunoglobulin, several iron transporting proteins, a whole range of our normal proteins just zip in and out of cells freely. So the membrane is not very relevant to actual cell physiology. And if you want to look at some of the mainstream research, Frithjof Sjostrand, who was a professor at UCLA for many years, founded the Journal of Ultrastructure Research and was the chief editor for about, I guess, 30 or 40 years. His work pretty much all by itself made the conventional ideas about plasma membranes on the outside of the cell, mitochondrial membranes, mitochondrial function. His work is just completely incompatible with the doctrine that is so popular.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the changes in the manufacture of Vitamin E?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin E is another thing that has undergone radical changes. When ADM bought the old Eastman Distillation Products factory for making vitamin E, they changed the methods and the consistency and appearance of vitamin E changed a lot. And then the FDA told them they had to start acknowledging that they were diluting it with soy oil and such, but the still the product that's commonly in use looks very different from from the old material. When I was working at the university lab, the freezer had some old vitamin E from Sigma that they had used in research in the 50s. And I tested some of that with experiments I was doing on liver extracts and got reactions that were extremely interesting that I've subsequently tried with the newer vitamin E's that I get no reaction at all. So there were chemical functions present that are interfered with by something that's occurring in the vitamin E. And the research up until about 1990, from the 1920s on, was just unanimously about its beneficial effects, except for the periodic attacks in, generally, the American Medical Association. But then, in the last 10 or 15 years, there have been more publications about ineffectiveness of vitamin E or possible adverse effects. I've been thinking about what some of the changes from the original 1930s and 40s product might have been. The saturated long-chain alcohols, octacosanol and triacontanol, were always associated with the original ways they made vitamin E that increased the viscosity. Vitamin or wheat germ oil was a common starting material, and that was rich in these very long-chain, completely saturated alcohols, which immediately metabolized into long-chain saturated fatty acids. And if you look up the research on octacosanol and triacontanol, you see that there was a lot of endurance effect, improved endurance from the use of small amounts of these. And I suspect that the original vitamin E research, which showed that it protected against the polyunsaturated fatty acids and their toxic effects, I think a large part of that might have been from adding the completely saturated, long fatty acids along with the vitamin E, sort of neutralizing the PUFA. Similar to Hans Selye's research in which he showed that canola would cause death of heart cells. But if he added chocolate fat, cocoa butter, to the same amount of canola, the heart had no injury at all. So the saturated fats have a defensive antitoxic effect that I suspect were part of vitamin E's original action.

**CONTEXT:** What is the correlation between Mexican children not getting polio and the milling of wheat, and what are your thoughts on other vaccinations and the infectious disease model?

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that the same thing that the Mexican immigrants in California, the kids were immune to a lot of the childhood infectious diseases just because of their relative iron deficiency. I think that is probably a big factor in the traditional Mexican diet and the traditional tortillas, interestingly, are very high in calcium because they boil it in lime and it leaves a large amount of calcium. My dentist in Mexico tells me that her clients with braces are all patients who have just started eating fiber blah blah blah. So it is a big factor. Some tooth problem might come in when they are 80 or 90 years old and want a painful tooth extracted. She said sometimes it takes her all afternoon to get a tooth out of one of these old people and she thinks it's the high calcium intake for their lifetime diet of tortillas. An undoubted anti-stress effect along with the low iron intake on average. About vaccination, I wanted to mention Ivan Illich's books, Medical Nemesis, for example. He does some good stuff on the history of vaccination.
