**RAY PEAT:** One of the things I've been interested in for a long time is the function of carbon dioxide in cells. In some observations, people have seen that the most improbable organism is unable to live without carbon dioxide, even though they can live without oxygen. And ordinarily, we think of oxygen turning into carbon dioxide as a waste product, but it really seems to be even more essential for life than oxygen. And carbohydrates are a very good source of carbon dioxide. They oxidize and produce a lot of carbon dioxide. And if carbon dioxide is that essential to life, then obviously the best food to produce it is going to be carbohydrates.

**CONTEXT:** What are the body's alternative energy sources and why are carbohydrates important for energy production?

**RAY PEAT:** In these recent newsletters, I've been pointing out some things that are becoming fairly common knowledge now. A failing heart, for example, when you're sitting at rest, the quiet muscle burns almost pure sugar and oxygen, pure glucose and oxygen. But as soon as it starts exercising, it shifts over to fat oxidation, and at maximum exercise, it's burning mostly fat and very little oxygen, very little sugar, but it's producing quite a bit of lactic acid because it's wasting sugar. It's burning the fat pretty thoroughly, but it's wasting the sugar and turning it over into lactic acid. The failing heart does the same thing. It's exerting its maximum, and in doing that, it's burning fatty acids primarily rather than sugar. And this process in general of substituting fat burning for sugar burning was called by PJ Randall a cycle. It isn't really a cycle, but now it's called the Randall cycle, which means that if you burn fatty acids, that stops your burning glucose, oxidizing glucose, and instead, you're turning it into lactic acid. And diabetes consists of living on fatty acids and not being able to oxidize glucose, but still turning glucose into lactic acid, so that lactic acidemia becomes a problem in diabetes. And obviously, to make lactic acid out of glucose, it has to get into the cells. So this whole thing of transporting glucose into the cell being where the failure comes in heart failure or diabetes or whatever, just isn't the case because if you're making lactic acid, obviously the sugar is getting into the cell. Something goes wrong in the oxidation process, and the cell begins to favor the oxidation of fat rather than glucose, and that doesn't produce as much carbon dioxide, and that seems to be a basic problem for the cell that leads it down the path of reduced function and eventual non-survival. And a very similar thing happens in cancer cells. They begin turning glucose, if not into lactic acid, then on into fat, and then they oxidize the fat. And in treating heart disease over the last five years or so, there's been quite a movement towards thinking of ways to stop the oxidation of fatty acids, allowing the heart to avoid the Randall cycle and get back to oxidizing glucose instead of turning it into lactic acid.

**CONTEXT:** Clarify what is meant by "carbohydrates" and why they are important for energy production, especially in contrast to fat.

**RAY PEAT:** We can turn protein into both sugar and fat equivalents, so when you're talking about energy, you have to consider that some of it might come from protein, but in the case of oxidizing protein, that's very wasteful besides being expensive. It produces a lot of waste material, ammonia, for example, and it turns on machinery which resembles the stress reaction. When we're in stress, we break down protein and turn it into energy materials. But the mechanism of oxidizing fat somewhat gets into the process of creating stress. Especially the polyunsaturated fatty acids activate the same stress metabolites, stress-responsive enzymes that burning too much protein will activate. By carbohydrate, people generally mean both starches and sugars. It's simply anything that's made up of that same proportion of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. And starches are just long chains of sugars. But in the case of most of the food starches, they're composed of pure glucose molecules. And so when you're getting energy from starch, you're really burning pure glucose. And sucrose, the standard table sugar, that's also the main sugar of sweet fruits. And it consists of only half glucose and half fructose. And fructose happens to be able to metabolize without relying on the use of insulin. And so it has been used for feeding diabetics and for avoiding some of the stresses produced by the ups and downs of the insulin reactions. So getting the right amount of carbohydrates in relation to protein and fat is one way to basically increase glucose oxidation. And if you're relying on fat, then you're inhibiting glucose oxidation, is really what you're saying in a simplistic sense. And glucose, assuming you're eating a sugar such as fruits.

**CONTEXT:** How do CO2 production and antioxidants relate to cellular energy and health?

**RAY PEAT:** Running the oxidative process through the mitochondria very fast happens to be an anti-oxidative process in terms of avoiding toxic free radicals. And so the faster you burn oxygen, oxidizing sugars, the less you have to worry about taking care of the free radical toxic products that really develop when you slow down the respiratory process of burning fats and especially polyunsaturated fats. Vitamin E and vitamin C and uric acid, which is produced in our body, is a major antioxidant. But the marketing of the idea of antioxidants has created a big confusion in the area of the antioxidants in our body have to fit together with uric acid, which is naturally there, and the enzymes which naturally break down free radicals. And if you put things in that don't fit, an apparent antioxidant in a test tube can become a pro-oxidant in the body. Things have to fit together so that vitamin A and vitamin E lock together, and vitamin E and vitamin C lock together, uric acid and vitamin C lock together. The glucose and other sugars have to be streaming through the systems of enzymes turning into carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide has to be flowing out of the cell properly. The whole antioxidant system is really one piece, and if you try to stuff in any super antioxidants like they're selling as health products, you're likely to create more oxidation than you had without it. A recent publication saw that cataracts are twice as common in men over the age of 65 who took big supplements of vitamin E and vitamin C. Almost doubled their rate of cataracts.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of Vitamin E, and is it primarily an antioxidant or something else?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin E, in particular, has a peculiar history that it started out in the 1930s being called a fertility drug, a fertility nutrient. And the Schutz family of doctors studied it in treating women with clotting problems and fertility problems both. They saw that it prevented abnormal clotting, which is a feature of excess estrogen. Estrogen has many problem side effects when it's excessive and unopposed. And the Schutz and others in the 1930s saw that vitamin E restored fertility and prevented heart disease by functioning as an anti-estrogen. Around that same time, the polyunsaturated fats were being seen to have estrogen-like effects and to cause clotting circulatory problems. Animals that were fed on a high polyunsaturated fat diet were sterile. The various forces, such as the estrogen industry, didn't want estrogen associated with sterility and heart disease, and various pressures turned vitamin E into an antioxidant rather than an anti-estrogenic material. So by 1950, the whole history of vitamin E had been turned into an antioxidant, and so I don't see it as primarily an antioxidant; I see it as anti-inflammatory and anti-estrogenic, with this potential side effect of protecting against free radicals if it's in the right concentration and balance with other chemicals.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen relate to cellular oxygen utilization and inflammation, and how does Vitamin E counteract this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, both estrogen and anything that creates inflammation wastes oxygen and that tends to lead to lactic acid production. And vitamin E, by stopping the inflammation and estrogen effects, is also making more oxygen available and reducing lactic acid problems.

**CONTEXT:** Explain the relationship between estrogen, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), cell metabolism, and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid is the hormone that activates our whole oxidative system and leads to the production of carbon dioxide when it's working properly. And estrogen, besides working at the cell level to waste oxygen, happens to block the enzymes that secrete thyroid hormone. And the fatty acids that are saturated happen to oxidize with fair safety. The polyunsaturated fatty acids are the ones that are more likely to break down and produce free radicals. But cells distinguish between these two types of fatty acids and prefer to oxidize the saturated fats. That means that anytime you eat a little bit of excess unsaturated fat, it primarily goes into storage because the cells prefer not to oxidize it but to store it instead. But estrogen prefers those oxygen-wasting, free radical-producing fats. It preferentially causes them to be liberated from storage. So under the influence of estrogen, all of the free fatty acids increase. Women have on average higher levels of free fatty acids circulating, but preferentially estrogen brings the polyunsaturated fats out of storage, especially the very long-chain polyunsaturates. And these are the ones that most interfere with other levels of thyroid function, not just the secretion, which estrogen directly does, but with the transport and metabolism of the thyroid hormone. So at many levels, estrogen and the polyunsaturated fats are working together to inhibit the function of the thyroid hormone and the oxidative system.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's influence on insulin, adrenal hormones, and glucose metabolism contribute to a stress response and energy depletion?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen directly stimulates the secretion of insulin, and that tends to lower blood sugar and create fat storage if you've eaten more than enough. It also directly stimulates the adrenal cortex, increasing aldosterone and cortisol, and that causes the whole system to go into the emergency reaction process. The cortisol tends to bring blood sugar up, where the insulin tends to lower it, and so the more estrogen is increased and unopposed by protective things such as progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone and thyroid, then the more system stresses and tendency to failure there are.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of estrogen and unsaturated fats in conditions like endometriosis, and how can this cycle be broken?

**RAY PEAT:** Desjardins and his group were interested in many of the side effects of estrogen on the brain, not just the effects on the pituitary, but the endorphins, the effects of iron accumulation and the fatty acids and their interactions and the liver. Because of the estrogen-thyroid effects and the constant pushing up of the growth hormone in particular from the pituitary, the liver from an early age is feminized. And this shows up in studies of liver transplant plants from female donors to male donors and male donors to female donors and various combinations. They found that apparently because of this process of stress hormones and the growth hormone feminizing women's livers, they make poor candidates relative to the livers of men for transplant, and the women have more trouble receiving. Because of estrogen's interaction with the thyroid and liver causing stress for both of the organs.

**CONTEXT:** Is endometriosis primarily an inability to detoxify excess estrogen or a lack of progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it involves the liver and the pituitary, but estrogen is very central to the actual lesion or abnormal tissue of endometriosis. Simply by reducing estrogen exposure, you can alleviate the symptoms of endometriosis. The cells begin producing estrogen. They contain the enzyme aromatase, which manufactures estrogen, which they used to think existed only in the ovary, then it turned out to exist in fat cells, breast cells, skin cells, bone, and muscle. Everywhere that's under stress will begin to produce estrogen molecules. And when that happens in the endometrial tissue, it should be exposed to estrogen for only about 12 hours each month, and then progesterone should surge up to 50 or 100 times higher concentration and cause the cells to give up their production of estrogen and release what they had. But instead of that, the aromatase keeps churning out estrogen, and the estrogen excites the tissue, turns on the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which turns polyunsaturated fatty acids into prostaglandins, creating inflammation that causes the pain, contractions, and all of the symptoms. And the inflammation from the prostaglandin in turn creates more aromatase, and so it gets a vicious cycle going. And the simplest, most physiological way to stop it is to eat a diet with adequate protein and sugar and trace minerals and vitamins, but to make sure your thyroid is functioning. I've seen people who had been constantly for months or years suffering painful endometriosis who in two or three days completely stopped the symptoms permanently just with quick-acting thyroid and a good diet. And aspirin or other blockers of prostaglandin production all by themselves can greatly reduce the formation of estrogen and break the cycle.

**CONTEXT:** How do polyunsaturated fats activate aromatase enzymes, and how does this relate to estrogenic effects and endometriosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, they're central to endometriosis. That's right.

**CONTEXT:** Can aspirin therapy inhibit the aromatase enzyme and up-regulate energy production?

**RAY PEAT:** In cancers, bowel or breast or whatever, the cells that are stressed begin to produce estrogen. And the estrogen in the other tissues, no matter what it is, as long as there's polyunsaturated fat available, the estrogen is going to activate the cyclooxygenase enzyme that makes prostaglandins, which keep the aromatase active, producing more estrogen. So even if you aren't eating it currently, the polyunsaturated fat that was incorporated into your tissues is going to break down under stress, flow into the bloodstream, and feed the production of estrogen, whatever tissue it's in, but especially in the irritated, inflamed, cancerous tissue. Niacinamide is another thing that simply limits the release of these fatty acids from the tissues. So both sugar and niacinamide back up the function of aspirin.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary and therapeutic approaches can help individuals with endometriosis?

**RAY PEAT:** So people suffering with endometriosis should consider getting the right amount of carbs, regulating their thyroid, using niacinamide, and possibly aspirin therapy.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen affect body temperature and pulse, and how does this relate to endometriosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Even though estrogen is turning on the stress hormones, and the stress hormones tend to protect the body temperature, the body temperature at a certain point of estrogen dominance, even the adrenaline which tends to tighten up blood vessels in the skin and make your hands and feet cold to keep the brain and heart temperature up for the function, and the cortisol which should keep churning your tissues over producing heat, even those aren't enough to keep your body warm, and so your temperature falls after a certain total exposure to unopposed estrogen. And the reason progesterone and thyroid, progesterone all by itself without driving the oxidative process, can drastically and quickly increase your temperature. While at the same time lowering the stress hormones that normally keep your temperature up in an emergency, the progesterone is blocking the estrogen's effect, simply letting you return to a more normal set point in your temperature. And in doing that, it stops these mechanisms that cause flushing, such as nitric oxide, that causes vasodilation and turning red and feeling hot, which causes the falling temperature.

**CONTEXT:** How do tribes like the Northwestern Indians, who historically consumed a lot of salmon, manage their health with a diet potentially high in polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** The Northwest Indians had a lot of varied foods. I don't know how much salmon they really ate year-round, but I imagine they dried quite a bit of it. They had various mixtures of bear fat and berries and fruits, were very well able to survive travel and storage and such, and so those were, I think, usual staples among them.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of bear fat consumption in relation to saturated fats and diet?

**RAY PEAT:** All of what I've seen was bear fat. Yeah, yeah, okay. So that wouldn't actually be even a ruminant fat, would it? Okay. But that would probably be a pretty saturated fat, though, wouldn't it? Yeah, because bears like to eat a lot of fruit and grass, and they aren't primarily carnivores. When they've looked at their stomach contents, it looked like they were fruit eaters.

**CONTEXT:** How do animals like grizzly bears and deer, which consume seasonal diets including salmon, acorns, and grasses, manage their metabolism and hibernation, and what is the role of serotonin and PUFAs?

**RAY PEAT:** The squirrels have been studied pretty well. They found that when they kept them from eating the acorn-type, highly unsaturated things in the fall, they didn't hibernate. But it was the puffa that, yeah, the puffa increased the serotonin, put them to sleep. But it wasn't even good sleep. Typically, they'll wake up a few times during the winter to sleep normally. But the serotonin, it's a type of torpor that they like to wake up from and have a sleep.

**CONTEXT:** Can animals adapt to seasonal stresses, like consuming PUFAs, leading to hibernation as a survival mechanism?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's a gradual adaptation to a seasonal stress. That people get depressed in the winter, but they aren't able to spend four or five months sleeping off.

**CONTEXT:** Why do some women experience hot flashes, and why does estrogen therapy sometimes alleviate them?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that it slows the metabolism enough that they aren't going in and out of the state.

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying mechanism for infant colic and eczema, and how can mothers address these issues, particularly concerning blood sugar regulation and food intolerances?

**RAY PEAT:** In animal experiments, some people saw that the mildest allergen would produce a deadly allergic reaction if they lowered the blood sugar. And the mother's system can pass allergens through the milk so that even the baby can experience the interaction of ups and downs, blood sugars and allergens. But with these animal studies, they found that if they increased the blood sugar artificially, just putting a tube in with some glucose, the deadliest allergens that had killed normal animals would just cause a little sniffling when they were getting extra glucose pumped into the bloodstream. But lowering the blood sugar from whatever cause would cause a mild allergen to kill the animal in shock from an allergic reaction, releasing histamine and serotonin. And that I've seen many times in people who used to rush to the hospital for a shot or glucose or something, or who carried an adrenaline pen with them for an allergic exposure or a bee sting or something, instead they would keep a big bottle of Coke in the fridge and drink the Coke quickly as soon as they had the exposure and stop going to the hospital.

**CONTEXT:** Is postpartum colic and eczema related to a hyperglycemic reaction, inability to regulate blood glucose, and estrogen dominance due to low progesterone and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** The hormones. Even when a woman has had a very happy pregnancy, sometimes because the pregnancy itself is driving her hormones and keeping things in balance. As soon as she has the baby, there's a letdown in which she discovers her own hypothyroid, progesterone-deficient state, which becomes very excessively estrogen-dominated, and that causes the postpartum depression syndrome, along with a whole range of other possible consequences, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and MS, and allergies, seizures, and so on.

**CONTEXT:** What can be expected from lab results after discontinuing thyroid medication, and what are the optimal TSH levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you want to keep your eye on TSH if you have the opportunity. You don't want it to go too high because it will start creating the symptoms of hypothyroidism. It creates inflammation and changes your blood viscosity and heart rhythm and so on. So it's safest to keep your TSH down, and you can do that usually just by eating a good balanced diet, lots of fruit.

**CONTEXT:** What is the ideal TSH range for optimal health and thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** I would say that three is always too high. Three is too high, okay. Yeah, and below one is where I feel more comfortable with it, and in a big population, the freedom from thyroid cancer is best when the TSH is below 0.4.

**CONTEXT:** How can stored polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) be eliminated from the body?

**RAY PEAT:** That really is a problem. It's worse than storing DDT, I think, because we do have the ability. The liver can treat them like a poison and excrete them so they pass out through the urine without having to be oxidized. But if the liver isn't just very well supported, the polyunsaturated fats can block those enzymes in the liver the way estrogen does. So you have to make sure that your liver isn't under stress. Don't go too long without eating or getting rest and so on.

**CONTEXT:** What do body temperature and pulse indicate about energy metabolism, and how do they compare to thyroid panels?

**RAY PEAT:** The mouth is quicker than the armpit usually, and I found that some people had fat armpits and it would take about two hours to get the temperature up through that thick layer of fat. And then in hot, humid weather, one summer we had 90-degree weather, and all of the hypothyroid people had normal temperatures, so I checked their pulse. These people coming in with 98.6 temperatures, a lot of them had 45 per minute pulse rates, and I realized you have to look at more than one indicator when you have an environment that would keep.

**CONTEXT:** What is the Achilles reflex relaxation test, and how does it indicate thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** The Achilles reflex relaxation test is a very quick, very definite indicator of thyroid function as it affects the nerves and muscles. Some people on the internet have demonstrated something that's useless for the thyroid. You want the toe to hang freely and relaxed when you kneel in a chair so that if you thump it and get a twitch, your toes go away from your body. The foot should relax with complete instantaneous relaxation so that it looks just like a piece of jelly flopping there. After the outward twitch, the relaxation should be utterly relaxed and floppy if your thyroid is good.

**CONTEXT:** How do temperature and pulse reflect cellular utilization of glucose, oxygen, and thyroid hormones, and what is the timeline for seeing consistent regulation?

**RAY PEAT:** You can, if you add to the good diet, a supplement of pregnenolone and thyroid, for example, you can get there pretty quickly, but to get there just with diet, it depends on how much PUFA you have stored in your tissues, for example. A big fat person has a lot of work to get rid of some of the toxic stuff. A very skinny person can sometimes just, apparently, like this woman mentioned, it just took a little while for the diet to bring her metabolism up. I've seen people, in as little as a week, pop out of a chronic state of stress and start metabolizing.
