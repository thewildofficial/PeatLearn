**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s and 60s, I was interested in psychology and language, and I started a school in Mexico, Blake College, that was just a general liberal arts school for both United States students and local Mexican students, but in the process I noticed that lots of the local people in Mexico were eating a very bad diet and a couple of my friends had family members who were very sick and having read Adele Davis' books, I suggested some of her nutritional therapies. For example, a friend's nephew had been on a diet for more than a year and he was on the hospital for two or three days with diarrhea that they couldn't control and the third day I think was they said she wouldn't live to night and at that point my friend decided to try the vitamin B6 supplement that was one of Adele Davis' recommendations for diarrhea. He gave the little kid this 10mg tablet of vitamin B6 and within the hour her diarrhea had stopped, she was recovered in just a couple of days. These are no more problems, just a single vitamin did what the whole hospital staff put in place to manage with intravenous treatments and so on. So I realized that a lot of information wasn't getting into the medical system. I decided after coming back to the U.S. to study biology instead of just the humanities, language, psychology, and literature, and in graduate school, I ran into the same dogmatism and ignoring the really important practical information. I had planned to study brain biology, but I saw that the professors were locked into a dogmatic view of how a nerve works, and looking through the whole University of Oregon, I found that the reproductive physiology department was actually doing open research trying to discover what causes the infertility of aging and what the real factors in fertility and maintaining pregnancy are, so I've shifted from brain biology to reproductive physiology and in examining what the factors are that make it possible for a fertilized ovum to develop the whole organism and a nervous system, I found that the brain is governed and formed by the same factors that govern the question of fertility and infertility. It's a very simple sort of a spectrum. The same things that cause infertility cause bad development of the brain. The brain is really the most sensitive part of the organism. The same factors that make it healthy make it possible for the ovum to implant in the uterus. So I concentrated on the factors that are regulated by the hormones of fertility and I realized that the drug industry at that time already for almost 30 years had been propagandizing the public with the idea that estrogen is the female hormone and in our lab we saw that estrogen was the contraceptive hormone, not the hormone of fertility and pregnancy. The pharmaceutical industry knew that estrogen made a good contraception pill. It was actually causing abortions, but they didn't want to call it the abortion pill. So they called it the anti-conception pill and the real hormone of fertility and brain development turns out to be progesterone, which works by providing energy to the developing embryo in the form of oxygen and glucose primarily, making energy most efficiently by oxidizing glucose, and estrogen is just one of the factors that interrupts that process. It creates a local sort of implant in the uterus, a kind of wound that will allow the ovum to be embedded in the tissue. If the estrogen stays dominant, it kills the ovum. So the function of the progesterone is to knock the estrogen out of the tissue and shift that wound physiology or local stress inflammatory physiology into a supportive, oxidative, sugar-rich wound.
**CONTEXT:** What initially sparked your passion for understanding hormones, stress, and thyroid function, and how did your academic journey lead you to this focus?

**RAY PEAT:** The way I define stress, I would say that it is the factor in all of the diseases that we're dealing with. If you define it as a mismatch between organism and environment, then even the so-called genetic diseases are, for example, if you have sickle anemia in your genes, it happens that in Africa that's a defensive gene and if the people are eating a certain type of diet that maintains an oxidative condition in the cells, there is no sickle cell disease. It's simply a defensive mutation in that environment. But when you don't have that environment, then it shows up as a disease. But when you're under stress, the cells change shape and cause pain and sickness and possibly death. So the genetic diseases turn out to be a disease of stress when the environment isn't properly supportive. So you can see even genetic and infectious diseases as diseases of stress. If you have good nutrition, then the various bacteria in the environment would cause dysentery, for example, because your immune system takes care of them and stops the whole inflammatory process. And inflammation is the basic factor in why stress causes disease, and it's almost entirely overlooked as a factor in stress. Now it's coming to be recognized as a matter of all kinds of disease; heart disease and obesity are seen to originate with a stress physiology, but what they're missing is that stress leads to inflammation, and that leads to the various specific diseases.
**CONTEXT:** You've spoken about stress being a primary driver of disease. Can you elaborate on how you define stress and its connection to inflammation and various illnesses?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's when the environment is putting demands on you that you don't have the internal resources to meet them. For example, an 18 or 20-year-old person who is well-fed can meet all kinds of changes of weather and climate and physical demand, work, exertion, and so on and so forth, without any stress at all. That same activity would kill someone who wasn't well-fed or maybe who was 80 or 90 years old, so it's the matter of what kind of resources you have internally in proportion to the stress.
**CONTEXT:** When you refer to "stress," are you encompassing all forms of stressors, including environmental factors like radiation and artificial light, as well as emotional and mental stress?

**RAY PEAT:** The industry, the drug industry, but all kinds of technological industries have tried to cover up the fact that they are causing not only the disease of the people to their products and byproducts, but even to the offspring, descendants of those people that they're exposing.
