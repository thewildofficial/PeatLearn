**RAY PEAT:** Well, it isn't the sex hormones as a group, because estrogen rises when you're under stress along with cortisol. And when the androgens in general decrease, that usually goes with a decrease of progesterone. And that creates a susceptibility to stress. And everything harmful practically will increase both your estrogen and cortisol. And the first barrier to harm is the group of steroids, pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, testosterone. All of these have broadly overlapping protective effects that protect your energy apparatus, your sensory apparatus, keep things stable and working. And injury simply doesn't happen when you have a great abundance of those things. You can run a marathon or swim in ice water, do all sorts of things that could kill a more fragile person. You're really well supplied with pregnenolone and its derivatives down to testosterone. It's got endurance so you don't experience. When something happens that you're not abundantly producing the protective steroids, then any little thing becomes stressful. Just walking can be a stress. Breathing harder, you will shift over to the lactic acid metabolism. With increasing age or malnutrition, anything that interferes with the production of these protective steroids makes you then shift over to the emergency production of cortisol. And all of these protective steroids block the effect of cortisol so that you can take a cortisol pill or prednisone or whatever and have very little harm from it if you're fairly saturated with progesterone, DHEA, testosterone, because they're preventing the action as well as taking care of some of the things that cortisol would produce. For example, cortisol maintains your blood sugar level so that you can keep working, but it does it by converting your protein-eating tissues, muscles, skin, thymus gland, lymphatic tissues in general, and finally digestion system, liver, and intestine will be cannibalized to make sugar and energy under the influence of cortisol. The protective effect of testosterone was demonstrated by the fact that sugar and once using radioactive testosterone molecules, they injected it into athletes and thought that they would see the radiation coming out of their muscles, but what they saw was the most of the radiation was coming from their heart. Testosterone is most concentrated in the organs that are most vital to survival. So it concentrates in the heart, lungs, and brain at the highest ratio to protein. Even though it's responsible for making an athlete's muscles bigger and bigger under the influence of testosterone, what it's doing is preventing those being used up for energy. So with age, if you're producing less of the protective steroids, a given amount of cortisol might not look extremely high in relation to the standards, but if your pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone are lower than average, even a moderate amount of cortisol begins eating up your muscles and skin, and eventually it can start deteriorating at your heart.

**CONTEXT:** Why might cortisol be so high in so many people right now and sex hormones be down?

**RAY PEAT:** It's usually a gradual deterioration from poor nutrition or eating foods that are irritating or toxic, or things that, for example, foods that suppress your thyroid function. Thyroid is necessary to produce these protective steroids. Thyroid is necessary to produce these protective steroids and the other protective steroids if you have vitamin A and thyroid hormone adequately. But if you're deficient in either of those, the cholesterol will rise in your blood. That generally means that you're not making enough DHEA and testosterone, for example. So low thyroid, which causes high cholesterol, the real meaning of that is that you're not making enough of the protective testosterone and related steroids. And when that happens, your cortisol and other stress hormones rise. So low thyroid is the most common thing responsible for a bad ratio of cortisol to testosterone.

**CONTEXT:** Could overtraining or over-exercising lead to this imbalance?

**RAY PEAT:** I even did an experiment putting people on a treadmill and measuring their active thyroid hormone, T3. And they had them walk at, they kept their pulse rate at 120 per minute or less, just very mild walking on the treadmill, and in an hour, they had become hypothyroid in the sense of reducing their activation of thyroid in the T3. But doctors are now being taught that they should ignore T3, the active hormone, and think about only thyroid-stimulating hormones, age, and only thyroxine or T4. But when you're an athlete, for example, is depressing their T3, their thyroxine will actually rise in the future reaction. And so doctors are being taught things that will make them necessarily miss the effects of stress on your thyroid, and that leads to misinterpretation of everything downstream. For example, when your thyroid goes down from stress, your estrogen normally is being excreted and kept at a low level systemically by the thyroid activating the liver metabolism. The liver solubilizes estrogen, making it leave through the kidneys and be excreted. If your thyroid drops from stress very quickly, your estrogen will rise. And then the estrogen activates directly on the adrenals, it increases cortisol production and many other levels. It activates your pituitary to stimulate cortisol production from the adrenals and it activates your brain in many different ways through the corticotropic release factor (CRH) to activate the adrenals and pituitary. So just dropping the active thyroid, you very quickly turn on both the estrogen and the whole cortisol stress system.

**CONTEXT:** What about intense overexertion like CrossFit?

**RAY PEAT:** The Russians were 50 or 60 years ago being accused of using testosterone because they had worked out the way to entertain, avoid overexertion and keep their stress hormones down and their cortisol up. It takes really a very moderate amount of muscle-building exercise to increase testosterone and lower cortisol. The muscle itself becomes an endocrine organ in a constructive sense. Under stress, your muscle will actually produce cortisol and not testosterone. When it's properly stimulated, the muscle becomes a testosterone-stimulated. It isn't just the gonads that produce testosterone if you're doing things.

**CONTEXT:** So, chronic output from intense classes like CrossFit or heavy-duty weight training is detrimental?

**RAY PEAT:** A woman doing just one or two minutes of mild dumbbell lifts and a few squats for the big leg muscles can shift her balance from cortisol to testosterone. It just takes a minute or two, three times a day, whatever it takes to increase the muscle mass. It's really a very small amount of muscle lifting type exercise.

**CONTEXT:** So, lifting heavy things is beneficial, but not hour-long classes pushing the body to the limit every day?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes.

**CONTEXT:** Can you talk about sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that is the body's defense against estrogen. When it's high, a woman has a lower risk of breast cancer because it keeps the estrogen out of cells. It actually tends to pull estrogen out of cells protectively. When it's high in response, depending against estrogen, it can also interfere with testosterone effect.

**CONTEXT:** How are adrenaline, cortisol, and estrogen intertwined?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the stress hormones interfere with the conversion of T4. And in fact, instead of making the effective respiration-promoting T3, they convert thyroxine into reverse T3. They dispose of the precursor and turn it into an interfering, inactive suppressor of respiration. And those same stress hormones that produce the inactive blocking reverse T3 also tend to suppress the pituitary TSH, making it look like you're inactive hyperthyroid because doctors are taught to diagnose hyperthyroidism in terms of abnormally low TSH. But in fact, the stress which is lowering most people's TSH is causing hyperthyroidism, the hypothyroidism, and is caused by hypothyroidism. So a low thyroid person raises their estrogen, cortisol, and adrenaline. And these add up to lower your TSH and make it look like you have too much thyroid according to the way doctors are being indoctrinated.

**CONTEXT:** So that's why people exhibit signs of low thyroid but doctors see high thyroid on tests?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know what the real power for this is, but the indoctrination has become more intense in just the last two or three years, telling doctors, don't look at T3, even just look at TSH. Don't worry, even if the TSH is as high as 10, which is dangerous, it's horribly toxic. TSH itself is an inflammation-promoting hormone. Even if a person isn't hypothyroid in the sense of not having enough T3, if their TSH is increased, they will get the worst heart disease signs of hypothyroidism. So part of the disease effects of hypothyroidism are really an excess of TSH rather than the direct lack of metabolic stimulation from T3.

**CONTEXT:** What is the importance of adequate testosterone for women, and what are the symptoms of low testosterone and high cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** It has to be balanced, both in men and women, it has to be balanced with DHEA and cortisol, and normally it is, unless you're supplementing it as a drug. But all of these, especially the DHEA, is an activator of fat oxidizing. And your muscle is the organ that is most equipped for oxidizing fat. Your brain and heart don't do well oxidizing fat compared to glucose, but the muscles are perfectly adapted for burning fat. And everything you do to increase your muscle's production of testosterone and reduction of cortisol is favoring that. So just the right amount of exercise to build muscle will shift your metabolism to safely consume fat in your muscles while leaving adequate glucose for your brain and certain delinquent.

**CONTEXT:** What are other symptoms of high cortisol and low testosterone besides weight gain?

**RAY PEAT:** Depression. The whole stress system that ends up increasing your cortisol and decreasing DHEA, progesterone, testosterone, that whole system is related to the inflammatory and degenerative processes, and depression is how we experience that process. The body senses it is being destroyed by the stress hormones and it wants to stop everything, to sort of hibernate or go into hiding until the stress is over. So what you experience is depression, anxiety, and aggression. Aggression comes up when you're being over-stressed and made to anxiety. It's all different sides of the same reaction, but when your body is being damaged, you get these negative emotions: aggression, anxiety, and depression.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on fasting and intermittent fasting for improving hormones and lowering cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** Glucose in the form of glycogen, and you can go, if you're healthy, you can go up to 24 hours on your short glycogen. And the body senses stress. Lowering the T3 slows the rate of fuel use. So when your glycogen has gone away, that means you have to start using your tissue to make glucose out of your muscles. And if your thyroid didn't slow down when you have this prolonged stress or fasting situation, if your thyroid didn't drastically shut down your oxygen requirement, you would eat your whole body up in just a few days. But since the depressive process turns off the metabolism, it makes you want to eat more, to hibernate. That slows the rate of degeneration of all of your organs. If you at least give a little bit of glucose and minerals, just some sodium chloride, then you're good to chloride and calcium, magnesium, and potassium during the fasting or low-calorie period, you can greatly reduce your tissue loss on a low-calorie diet. For example, a person on just a water fast for 10 days, they found that I think it was 80% or more of their weight loss came from destruction of their muscle and skin mass. But if they had a 500 or 600-calorie diet with a 100-calorie diet with a 100-calorie adequate minerals, almost all of the fat weight loss was in the form of fat loss rather than muscle. So a complete fast is very destructive to the body.

**CONTEXT:** What happens to the liver during fasting?

**RAY PEAT:** The liver is the organ of detoxification, and when you're depriving the liver of sugar and exposing it to cortisol, not only does the estrogen rise, but it loses its ability to detoxify other things. And the reason the estrogen rises is that the cell facials, the cell facials, the cell and glucuronidation detoxifying systems are shut down by fasting, and so it's exactly the opposite of detoxifying.

**CONTEXT:** How does the liver's function relate to testosterone production?

**RAY PEAT:** In the case of progesterone, which in a woman is produced even in greater quantities than a man produces testosterone, during the premenstrual time, the daily progesterone production is maybe 30 milligrams a day. But the liver adapts to that very large production. After two weeks of that high production, the enzymes increase and start excreting progesterone as well as estrogen and testosterone. So the synthesis of new progesterone stops, and for two weeks, the liver has very low exposure to progesterone, meaning that it will have a chance to reset its detoxifying enzymes to zero so that at ovulation, it's all ready to let your body experience the full force of the progesterone. If a man is supplementing testosterone every day, if he exceeds the liver's normal preference for a level of testosterone, the same thing happens. If he takes 30 milligrams by injection, for example, the liver experiences the same thing that women's liver experiences with high levels of testosterone, and the man throws off the testosterone very quickly. So after a week or two of being exposed to high testosterone, he is now excreting it very fast and probably is getting about as much estrogen effect as testosterone effect. And medical use of testosterone that they sometimes give 50 or 100 milligrams at once, so their liver experiences this gigantic overdose where it should be four or five milligrams a day in the young man. The liver goes into a testosterone destroying condition.

**CONTEXT:** How does chronically elevated cortisol relate to cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** The low behind the rise of estrogen and cortisol and the fall of thyroid is the tissue level of stress. And in the alimentary canal, histamine and serotonin are massively produced. 95% of our serotonin in the body comes from the intestine. And stomach ulcers can just by an excessive serotonin. And the intestine is involved in all stress, but especially in prolonged, ultimately carcinogenic stresses. And as the histamine and serotonin increase in the digestive system, that allows endotoxin and nitridoxin to rise. All of those interfere with our ability to produce respiratory energy, shift over to the esophagus, and lactic acid activates the stress hormones and promotes inflammation. And lactic acid is carcinogenic in itself. It not only is produced by cancer, but it promotes all of the features of cancer: inflammation, accelerated cell division, and so on. The serotonin is one of the most powerful activators of the cortisol stress hormone system, and it acts powerfully on the part of the hypothalamus that makes the CRH, corticotropin release hormone, and that is produced not only in the brain but in all of the peripheral tissues, and it's a promoter of tissue inflammation and shift of metabolism. So stomach cancer and intestinal cancer are very deeply involved with excess serotonin. It's really a base activator of the whole stress system. It works directly on the pituitary, as well as on the brain and other tissues, and accidentally, other tissues besides the adrenals are potential cortisol producers. Even our skin can make cortisol when it's under stress.

**CONTEXT:** Are there habits, besides food, that contribute to this stress response and hormone imbalance?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Regular sleep is a powerfully protective thing. It should be somewhere in the range of six to nine hours every night, but the regularity is very important. It becomes a built-in, almost a machine-like, once you get a schedule set, and any variation of that schedule puts the whole thing, the 24-hour cycle, into a stress pattern. So it isn't just the number of hours, but the regularity with which you get those hours of sleep that is anti-stress. And high progesterone, testosterone, and DHEA are promoters of working sleep. Cortisol really interferes at all levels, sleep restoration as well as daytime maintenance. And prolonged starvation, for example, anorexia nervosa, usually it's young women, and they've given made MRI pictures of their brain during and then during the recovery. And during the anorexia, their brain, especially the frontal lobes, shrink, and then when they feed, it rebuilds itself. So it's actually causing brain damage to pass too much. And a stressful pregnancy with too much exposure to estrogen and dissociated cortisol does the same thing where androgens, DHEA, and testosterone, and progesterone protect the athlete, the brain. Heart and lungs are protected by those, but prolonged exposure to high estrogen, even in pregnancy or anorexia, will shrink the frontal lobes of the brain that handle long-range perspective.

**CONTEXT:** How can we rebuild our bodies and get back into a calm state?

**RAY PEAT:** It's very much like exercise, but you have to stop the stress first before you can exercise effectively. Because they know that a given activity, for example, taxi drivers have a bigger part of the brain that handles memory. They know every street in a big city, and that requires a bigger part of that brain. One of my first students at the naturopathic college was a taxi driver who I decided to study medicine, and she was just spectacular. She was able to put things together unlike the students who had just gone to college. She had this global ability to perceive how things interact, and that kind of exercise works. It's best if you maintain the protective hormones, even supplementing pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone, combined with the kind of mental activity that you want to develop, that will, in a relatively short time, rebuild and it changes your attitude. Learned helplessness, for example, from prolonged stress can be overcome.

**CONTEXT:** Can you expand on learned helplessness?

**RAY PEAT:** That can be repaired with any of these protective hormones or with behavioral insight. But the stress process that causes it is used to become helpless or obsessive or over-analytic or whatever. Stopping the stress is the first thing, and that requires good nutrition. And good nutrition should include plenty of carbohydrates so that you don't have to rely on the cortisol to convert protein amino acids into glucose. And usually something more than 100 grams per day of carbohydrate, preferably in the form of sucrose, but it can be, if you're very active physically, two or three hundred grams a day of carbohydrate, especially sugar, can be restorative to the brain.

**CONTEXT:** What are the dangers of a sugarless diet?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the things that trigger the stress hormones involve interference with glucose metabolism. Hypoglycemia itself is a powerful activator of the stress system. Excess of free fatty acids, which will block the ability to use glucose, will activate the stress hormones. Lactic acid, which results when you're not using your glucose properly, it's a sign that there's in effect a deficiency of glucose that activates cortisol production. All of these stress signs, inflammation, over exertion, these require more glucose to suppress inflammation, to get energy production going. So the obvious way to stop the stress reaction is to provide enough glucose and oxygen along with the other nutrients. If you provide only protein and fat as your bulk nutrients, you're going to increase your cortisol just to convert the protein to the amount of glucose that your brain and blood cells need, and that cortisol, even though it's being fed with protein, is going to have all of these indirect actions that are harmful in the long run. It's going to change the way your immune system works, for example.

**CONTEXT:** What foods can help lower cortisol and increase progesterone and testosterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the reason I talk so much about milk and orange juice is that they are the most available foods that have the most components that tend to shut down excess cortisol production, lower adrenaline, reduce serotonin, nitric oxide, all of the harmful mediators of inflammation and stress. Everyone can... Uh, we have some work and good milk and sweet orange juice. Those each of them has hundreds of beneficial factors. The calcium itself in milk and the minerals, potassium, and the other minerals in orange juice lower these stress factors in multiple ways. Most people are having a borderline calcium and vitamin D deficiency in most of the world. And when you're borderline in vitamin D and calcium, you increase your parathyroid hormone. If you're borderline in your mineral, especially sodium intake, your aldosterone and angiotensin increase. These parathyroid hormone and aldosterone interact very closely and turn off your energy production, shift you over to wasting sugar, increasing your cortisol, destroying your protein tissues. So getting your aldosterone and parathyroid hormone as low as you can will at the same time increase your metabolic efficiency and so reduce your exposure to the stress hormones.

**CONTEXT:** Do foods that help with thyroid production also lower stress and improve hormone production?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and people are being misinformed about what thyroid does. It isn't a stimulant and a catabolic hormone. It is anabolic, and the anabolic function goes with what should be a reduction of adrenaline and cortisol. So it is required for deep restorative sleep and relaxation. So doctors tell people that it's a stimulant and a catabolic, are exactly the opposite of the truth.

**CONTEXT:** What are your favorite pro-thyroid foods that help lower stress?

**RAY PEAT:** Avoiding the polyunsaturated fats is a universal benefit as far as possible. Not to add, for example, fish oil or algae oil to your diet, not to use safflower, canola oil, none of the liquid oils. Those are all anti-thyroid, anti-progesterone, anti-DHEA, and so on, and in effect, they increase your stress hormones. They're the precursors for the prostaglandin-like materials which amplify all of the inflammatory or stress reactions. So just cutting out the polyunsaturated fats, if she increases your thyroid function and lowers the stress hormones.

**CONTEXT:** Do saturated fats help lower cortisol and increase progesterone and testosterone?

**RAY PEAT:** When you are not eating the proof of polyunsaturated fats, if you eat extra calories, you produce the saturated fats. And so your tissues will gradually, over a period of several years, gradually become more saturated. If you look at the ratio of saturated fat to polyunsaturated in your tissues, the saturation index corresponds to lifespan of animals with the highest saturation index. The lowest polyunsaturated fat in their tissues have the longest life expectancy. A lot of that is related to thyroid and these protective steroids.

**CONTEXT:** What are your favorite sources of protein for lowering cortisol and increasing hormones like progesterone, testosterone, and DHEA?

**RAY PEAT:** Gelatin happens to be fairly close to an ideal protein for an adult. Milk protein has a fair amount of tryptophan, cysteine, and these are pro-inflammatory amino acids that are used in milk. It is ideal for growing and has anti-inflammatory, anti-stress factors, but for an adult, I think it should be supplemented. We have something like gelatin as an extra protein. It lacks the pro-inflammatory growth-related amino acids.

**CONTEXT:** So, a blend of collagen gelatin, milk, and coffee for breakfast?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I use about eight or nine ounces of milk with an ounce or two of extremely concentrated coffee for my breakfast.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on cancer and how high cortisol can play into that?

**RAY PEAT:** The low behind the rise of estrogen and cortisol and the fall of thyroid is the tissue level of stress. And in the alimentary canal, histamine and serotonin are massively produced. 95% of our serotonin in the body comes from the intestine. And stomach ulcers can just by an excessive serotonin. And the intestine is involved in all stress, but especially in prolonged, ultimately carcinogenic stresses. And as the histamine and serotonin increase in the digestive system, that allows endotoxin and nitridoxin to rise. All of those interfere with our ability to produce respiratory energy, shift over to the esophagus, and lactic acid activates the stress hormones and promotes inflammation.

So stomach cancer and intestinal cancer are very deeply involved with excess serotonin. It's really a base activator of the whole stress system. It works directly on the pituitary, as well as on the brain and other tissues, and accidentally, other tissues besides the adrenals are potential cortisol producers. Even our skin can make cortisol when it's under stress.
