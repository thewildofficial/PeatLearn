**RAY PEAT:** I never exercise. Well, once about every 10 years, I do some exercises just to see how they're working, but the idea of exercise, I think, is not biologically sound. I think all of your activities should be intentional in some way, constructive or at least a place for giving. The idea of exercise seems to be a more fulfilling duty or obligation rather than doing something just because.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on the current fitness trends and what does your daily exercise look like?

**RAY PEAT:** If you have a very pretty place to run in like the natives of northern Mexico have canyons and interesting sceneries to run through just to do their social visits and tend to their chores and such. So running is part of their lives, but it's also meaningful in many ways. It isn't just running down the street, to a certain point, and coming back. The rote-ness of it, the predictability and the sameness of it, I think, is actually somewhat harmful to your nervous system.

**CONTEXT:** Is it beneficial for a woman to run on a regular basis for enjoyment, and does she need to be more vigilant as far as PUFA intake and environmental estrogens?

**RAY PEAT:** The brain, the mind has to move at least as much as the body and when you're on a treadmill or running down a certain track your your mind is not moving. Your body is moving, but your mind is in a rut. And being in a rut is bi-electrically harmful.

**CONTEXT:** So sometimes these exercises that we're trying to do to get our bodies in shape, if we don't enjoy them, they can actually be stress-inducing?

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, and deepening the habit of doing something that isn't pleasurable or meaningful that deepens your tolerance for meaninglessness and you're at risk of sinking into a routine behavior, a routine life.

**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between a dairy allergy and lactose intolerance? What different symptoms would we expect between the two? And what can we do if it's actually a dairy allergy or if someone has an intolerance?

**RAY PEAT:** An allergy can be deadly. A mild allergy is just annoying. If it's on the tongue or mouth, it makes it burn and maybe swell up a little. If it's serious, it will make your membranes swell up just to a hideous extent so that you can't move your tongue, and any of the surfaces that it reaches, if it's a real allergy, it can stop the function and make it impossible to breathe, for example, which is fatal. Lactose intolerance is simply the inability to absorb and digest milk, milk sugar, and if you have a sugar in your intestine that can't be absorbed, it has a lactic effect and it tends to run through you, or if you have the wrong kind of bacteria, the bacteria can convert it to gas, and so gas is the most common symptom for lactose intolerance.

**CONTEXT:** If somebody does have an intolerance, how can different approaches towards nutrition help that individual develop a tolerance and be able to eat dairy?

**RAY PEAT:** Deficiency of thyroid hormone creates various inefficiencies metabolically. Low production of digestive enzymes is typical. Low stomach acid sometimes. Enzymes to digest lactose, among other things, will be low when your thyroid hormone activity is low. And so most people with thyroid issues, to some extent, have a lactose intolerance and just fixing the thyroid function will improve their digestion of milk. There were studies of people who were theoretically genetically unable to digest lactose because of their race. And tests done in those people starting with half a glass of milk or a quarter of a glass of milk every day, doing that for a few weeks, they found that these genetically intolerant people were able to induce the enzyme. The enzyme is there in infancy and it's just a matter of time before the enzyme is released or kept active or re-induced as an adult by giving your intestine the exposure to a daily amount of lactose.

**CONTEXT:** What would be the cause if someone could digest dairy in their older years but suddenly can't anymore? Would that have to do with low thyroid or low caloric acid or vitamin deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin deficiencies and thyroid deficiencies often go together. That's your digestive system slows down from low thyroid. You will absorb poorly and be more likely to get a vitamin deficiency.

**CONTEXT:** What is the root cause of grinding of the teeth, or bruxism?

**RAY PEAT:** Serotonin excess is one of the things that happens during the night and usually an irritation in the intestine during the night as your blood sugar goes down your nerves and immune system become more irritable because of the falling energy supply and that irritability during the night even though the food wasn't causing an allergic reaction during the daytime during the night the falling blood sugar makes you start sensing relatively toxic things in your intestine or irritating things and that causes the intestine to increase its production of serotonin and serotonin is closely connected with bruxism.

**CONTEXT:** So someone would want to get their serotonin levels down in order to prevent that from happening?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, usually just looking at your diet and finding things that are not well digested. Green salads are the worst offenders. They never can be digested by a human being. And so they feed whatever bacteria or fungus happens to be in your system. And then the fungus or bacteria will make toxins that irritate the intestines so that it overproduces things such as histamine, serotonin, and nitric oxide.

**CONTEXT:** What do you feel are the better exercises, foods, supplements for middle-aged women in regards to lowering chronic stress or cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** If you live in a woodsy, cold climate, cutting wood and stacking it in the summer months is a good, useful exercise that uses your muscles. And in the winter or if you don't have wood to cut, dumbbells are the closest thing to getting muscle use. And with a good cross-cut saw you can saw logs for the fireplace and get push and pull exercise on your arm muscles doing using alternate arms on a cross-cut saw. It's like a very expensive exercise machine.

**CONTEXT:** What supplements or nutrition do you recommend as far as lowering chronic stress and cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** Blood sugar are the most powerful anti-stressors. Calcium, keeping the ratio of calcium to phosphate very high in your diet has a relaxing anti-stress effect. When your muscles are active and growing, they actually produce some testosterone. When they're under stress and not being used properly, they tend to convert cholesterol into cortisol and actually create the stress syndrome. The unused muscle is slightly toxic under some conditions where the used muscle is adding to your steroid protective hormones.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on jicama as far as a food that might be good for digestion or not, or what do you think about jicama in general?

**RAY PEAT:** It's in a very different family but it's probably a different set of allergens and androgens.

**CONTEXT:** Does Dr. Pete advise those coming from calorie-restricted eating and intermittent fasting protocols to slowly increase food intake and possibly count calories?

**RAY PEAT:** The important thing is to watch your temperature and pulse rate as indicators of how energetic your metabolism is. It's normal for your metabolic rate to go down during the night, but after breakfast you should pop right up to a working temperature of 37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 Fahrenheit and the pulse rate of more or less 80 or 85 beats per minute I think is good during the day.

**CONTEXT:** Should we take T4 with T3 or does Dr. Pete advise just taking T3?

**RAY PEAT:** The value of T3 in a free form is that if you're in a hurry to correct a problem, you can use a physiological replacement amount of T3 such as between one and four micrograms per hour and like with a meal where you're going to be absorbing food for two or three hours, 10 micrograms with the meal is a pretty physiological amount and you can see if that relieves your symptoms. I've seen very serious symptoms disappear in as little as a minute after taking a 5 or 10 microgram dose of T3. Insomnia will very often disappear five minutes after chewing up a bit of T3. You don't have the usual delay in getting to sleep and pains, arthritic pains or breast pains for example, will disappear in from five to 15 minutes after taking some. So it's valuable for its actually instantaneous repair functions, but it goes away almost as fast as it takes effect. And I for a time was taking 25 micrograms in the morning, all at once. After doing that for a couple of weeks at sunset, my heart would begin stopping every 10 seconds for two or three seconds at a time. Once it stopped so long that I started blacking out with a shrinking visual field and had to cough repeatedly, yet my heart started again. And so I realized that taking an outsized dose all at once after a week or two, your liver starts eliminating the tissue free after the election. saturated rate because it doesn't recognize that as an actual process and after 12 hours of the liver excreting it at that high rate if you don't replace it suddenly you've gone to an extremely hypothyroid state which leads to heart arrhythmia as the worst symptom. And if you take T4 only, a very healthy person, they tested it in the 1940s on male medical students and said thyroxine T4 only had exactly the same effect that the full thyroid substance had on these healthy young men. But they didn't test it on women and it happens that estrogen affects the liver and the thyroid gland, blocking secretion of the hormone from the gland and slowing the metabolic process of the liver. So it turns out that women have about five times the incidence of a thyroid related disease and autoimmunity is closely connected to that feminine thyroid estrogen interaction. So T4 is very fine as a replacement. Not only for healthy people, but for people who have a metabolic problem, mostly women. It's exactly the wrong thing to use. Since you don't want to have to take four micrograms of T3 half a dozen times a day, if you take T4 in the evening, for example, once a day, a dose of T4 will help to sustain things through the night, but it should be accompanied by, ideally, a dose of T3 in the morning and one or two doses of T3 during the daytime. Sustaining the effect of T3 during the night means that when you're exposed to the T3, it should activate your liver. Keep the estrogen from accumulating. The liver excretes excess estrogen and the active liver will activate the thyroid gland, protecting it from the blocking effect of estrogen. So given the supporting effect of T3, a woman's liver can metabolize T4 just like a man's.

**CONTEXT:** If you take T3 and after a couple weeks you no longer can notice the difference, would that be because the liver is starting to push some of it out since they're taking it and now they need to up their dose?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. If you take 5 or 10 or 20 micrograms at once, your liver is going to develop super excretory enzymes to lower it faster than normal.

**CONTEXT:** Taking T3 sounds like a way to remove excess estrogens from the body, is that correct?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, yeah, and that will help you handle the T3.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think of anti-aromatase products like ExzemaStain, also known as Aromazin?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, yeah, those generally have fairly serious eye defects. The one of them which is a steroid, I forget whether that's a steroid or not. When you named the steroid-based one, it's the least toxic of the aromatase inhibitors.

**CONTEXT:** So probably needs to be careful with that then if there are some pretty harsh side effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And there are safe aromatase inhibitors, aspirin, and the thrown, for example, do a very good job.

**CONTEXT:** I'm losing weight and my hands and feet are cold even with natural thyroid medication and I'm getting colder, so why is that?

**RAY PEAT:** It's important to check temperature as well as how you're feeling. If you have been reducing your intake of nutrients, you might have produced semi-saturated nutrient so much that you're in a stress state. High cortisol can make you lose weight under stress but it will be primarily muscle weight. Dieters used to go on a very low calorie diet, or even fast, and find that they could lose ten or twelve pounds in a week or ten days. Someone did a study analyzing what was happening to the body, and they found that on an extremely low calorie diet, they could lose ten or twelve pounds in a week or ten days. Weight loss was about an 80% protein and only something like 15 or 20% fat. If they took a moderate amount of nutrition, enough to reduce the stress hormones, they could lose 80% fat and only 15 or 20% protein tissue. So it's essential to keep your adequate nutrition while lowering calories.

**CONTEXT:** Yes, the adrenaline will come up and bring cortisol after, and cortisol is what makes you lose muscle weight. So instead she might try adding some more calories and would it serve her if her adrenaline is high to add carbohydrates?

**RAY PEAT:** Definitely, yeah. The carbohydrate at the right amount will spare the protein. So 80 grams of protein a day, for example, if you're getting the carbohydrate from orange juice, for example. With minerals, potassium has a sparing effect on the protein besides the sugar, so fruit juice plus the adequate amount of protein will keep your metabolism up and tend to promote fat loss rather than protein loss.

**CONTEXT:** She doesn't have a uterus because she had it removed and her doctor told her that she doesn't need to take progesterone. She's taking progesterone, but her doctor said you don't need to take progesterone if you don't have a uterus. Is that true?

**RAY PEAT:** I have many doctors thought that was true 60 years ago but I didn't know anyone still said that. Last time I saw that was I think 1970 roughly but it's a kind of horrifying thing to think that a doctor still can believe that progesterone has use only for the uterus. Progesterone is one of the most basic molecules in the universe and starting right from the ovum itself, it is involved in the uterus. Progesterone is one of the structure of the ovum, which organizes the genes, the cell division mechanism, everything. From the beginning of the organism up and as the organism matured, even before puberty, progesterone is in charge of brain development. If progesterone is low during gestation, the brain fails to develop. When it's given as a supplement, the brain becomes super super able, bigger, bigger, and more more functional in animal experiments as well as humans. And in the mature adult brain, progesterone is a major steroid, 10 times higher in the brain, for example, than circulating in the blood. So you might say that the uterus is a very minor field of action for the progesterone molecule. It governs brain growth, brain function. If it's low, a woman will experience epileptic seizures. When the brain progesterone falls too low, mood, depression, deficiency of progesterone affects every aspect of life.

**CONTEXT:** Are sulfur supplements good or bad, such as in the form of MSM?

**RAY PEAT:** When people email me that question, I send them a couple of articles from about 40 years ago, I think it was, a woman in a California hospital was brought in and she exploded in the operating room and several, she died and several of the staff were injured and analyzing the chemistry of what happened, the best hypothesis seems to be that she was using MSM to treat a cancer, using very large amounts of it, and some fluke in the way it metabolized led to that toxic explosion. Only happened once, but I think it's good for people to be aware of that chemical analysis that was sent in California just as an indicator of how little is known about the supplements that people so commonly use without knowing very much about the actual chemistry.

**CONTEXT:** Why do people take MSM, and is there something they could take instead if they're doing it as an anti-inflammatory?

**RAY PEAT:** If they're doing it as an anti-inflammatory, yeah, there are lots of anti-inflammatory things. The safest approach, I think, is to try to look at causes and see what the particular problem is. Low blood sugar leads to infection. Too much unsaturated vegetable oil in the diet amplifies inflammation. Too much phosphate in the diet relative to calcium is a very powerful promoter of inflammation. Things that over-activate the parathyroid gland will lead to inflammation, fibrosis, calcification. The thing that these supplements are recommended for, they almost always have a clear cause that can be approached. Supplementing calcium, for example, avoiding things that are over-rich in phosphates. Too much tea, too many beans, too many nuts, for example, those are all heavy on phosphates.

**CONTEXT:** What is your stance on colostrum powder and powdered milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Colostrum is a good idea. Powdered milk is a good idea. A wonder food for convenience. I've used hundreds of pounds of it myself, but recently running across this bit on the new technology, just so that the powder will flow easily, they have actually microstatically coated it with nanoparticles and I haven't found any industry source which admits that they're using it, but on the internet you can look at nanoparticles and powdered milk products. You can find lots of articles about the use of it, people selling the technology to be used. And these nanoparticles, if they're in a particular size range, are carcinogenic and pro-inflammatory and so for several months I haven't been recommending some of my favorite recipes such as the powdered milk pancakes, flourless pancakes and biscuits and so on because of the uncertainty of how these powders are being produced.

**CONTEXT:** Can you ask Dr. Pete about pheochromocytoma, paragangliomas, adrenal tumors, what we can do with this disease and is there a connection to thyroid diseases and pheochromocytomas?

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that there is. The people that I've known with the diagnosis, I have urged them to check their thyroid function and it happens that the people who have been diagnosed with that were actually suffering from a lack of thyroid. In the absence of good thyroid function, the body looks for alternative ways to keep working. And one is to over-activate that particular kind of cell. It can go in different directions. Excess serotonin is one of the products. Excess adrenergic chemicals is another route. But I think of it as the body is inventing ways to get around an energy block or limitation. That happens with many of the regulatory endocrine systems. For example, with animals, many years ago they found that if you removed one ovary of an animal, the other ovary was very likely to develop a tumor. The mechanism was because the pituitary gland was producing enough activating gonadotropin for two hormones, it became more active to make one ovary work for two ovaries, it was overstimulating that ovary, driving it to the point that it became a tumor or a cancer. And in thyroid, there's good evidence that the same thing happens. When you're deficient in some nutrient needed to make the thyroid hormone or have something blocking the production of the hormone, your pituitary becomes hyperactive, your TSH rises and chronically overstimulates the thyroid gland, leading to thyroid cancer. And women, I think, I don't know what the proportion is, but they're more susceptible to developing thyroid cancer because of the estrogen blocking the secretion of the hormone and the pituitary having to work harder. I think it's the same chemicals that can be used for a prolactin-secreting tumor, bromo-cryptine or cabergoline or liserite, I think, or the chemicals used to treat a prolactin-secreting tumor. Some of those can be used to treat Cushing's syndrome. And I think if you keep the pituitary under control so that it isn't overstimulating your adrenals, you will reduce the risk of all of those. Once you get a tumor in the adrenal, it's too late to work on the level of the pituitary. It leads to increased prolactin, for example, as well as the thyroid-stimulating hormone. And the excess of gonadotropins often follows the excess of thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin. And serotonin, which rises from either irritation in the digestive system or from a response to hypothyroidism. Serotonin happens to drive all of the pituitary hormones. So a stress that leaves you with chronic serotonin excess can contribute to all of the tumor developments that are driven by the pituitary gland, which would include different types of adrenal tumors, thyroid tumors, ovarian tumors, all of the endocrine tumors.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the herbal form of ephedra, also known as Ma Huang? Is this something that can be beneficial?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've used it from the time I was four years old, I think, and first had migraines like headaches. My grandmother made me one tea, a desert tea it was called. And it's a powerful stimulant. It wakes you up. And so some people have used it for an excessive, chronic way, just for its stimulating purpose or for weight loss, for example, and in chronic excessive use, it contains things that are toxic to the liver. But if it's used just occasionally, additionally, for example, to treat nausea.

**CONTEXT:** With regard to weight loss, it kind of stimulates the beta receptors, is that right? So it's harder, like for the stubborn fat areas?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but free fatty acids are the result, and free fatty acids are what make fat toxic, so it's better to eliminate fat slowly and carefully rather than pushing it out with a stimulant like ephedra.

**CONTEXT:** What is your remedy for cellulite? What would be your cure-all or a way to begin to heal a cellulite issue?

**RAY PEAT:** The immediate thing is to check your temperature, metabolic rate. Look at your calories and water consumption. You should be evaporating at least two liters of water every day that you can't account for. So if you drink, for example, two quarts of orange juice and two quarts of milk, you should produce a moderate amount, maybe a quart of urine per day. If most of your water intake appears in the form of urine, that means that you're not evaporating at a proper rate, and so your metabolic rate is low. Your temperature should be kept right around 98.6 during the daytime, the pulse rate well above the 60s, preferably in the 80s per minute, and to do that might require supplementation, some extra calcium, making sure you're getting enough sodium in your diet. Vitamin D blood test is a good idea to make sure your level is up around 50 nanograms per milliliter. And vitamin D and thyroid work very closely together. The sodium and calcium work closely together to suppress the stress hormones and to activate the protective hormones such as DHEA and progesterone. And if you still have a tendency to what they call cellulite, for a quick remedy, supplementing progesterone and DHEA, rubbing it into those areas, and taking five or ten milligrams orally, can activate the connective tissue metabolism to toughen up the tone of the skin and help them get rid of the water.

**CONTEXT:** What is your favorite pastime, like what do you do for fun?

**RAY PEAT:** Whenever I can get someone to sit for me, like portraits.

**RAY PEAT:** My website, RayPeat.com, has a lot of my newsletters and articles, but at the email address for my newsletter is raypeatsnewsletter.com.
