**RAY PEAT:** A fiber cut, such as a raw carrot, if you shred a carrot, it's fairly fine. and maybe olive oil and a little vinegar and salt. It's a pleasant enough food that you can eat it every day. And it happens that they care. contains a germicidal but harmless substances. Root vegetables growing underground have to resist. our mold and back area attacks, but material has the same disinfectant effect in the intestine, and olive oil and vinegar also have a germicidal effect, so the salad is a good protective daily stimulating food, the bulk stimulates the intestine, so generally the transit time is reduced if you eat raw carrot every day, the average American according to one survey had I think it was Three three-day transit time the average person in Africa had less than a one-day transit time but if you can get your your intestinal activity increased that itself has benefits far beyond the reducing the endotoxin because your liver is constantly processing toxins and hormones especially estrogen is instantly inactivated when it reaches the liver and some of it goes into the bile some of it is eliminated through the kidneys but the estrogen in the bile if you don't have enough fiber in your intestine the estrogen can be reabsorbed and returned to the liver and when the liver is exposed to too much estrogen it slows down and loses its ability to detoxify estrogen so having a good flow of fiber through your intestine. Not only suppresses the endotoxin, but it binds the bile and the estrogen content of the bile, preventing its reabsorption. So any kind of fiber has that anti-estrogen effect, but rockyard is a very safe one.
**CONTEXT:** How can someone get rid of endotoxins in the body since we know how detrimental they are?

**RAY PEAT:** I did an experiment putting lettuce in a closed plastic bag to imitate the intestine's absence of oxygen, and kept it at room temperature for a few days, and then I put it in the fridge for a few days, and then I put it in the at about 80 or 90 degrees in the intestine, that's close to almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit. But even by keeping it at around 90 degrees, after two or three days, the lettuce was just horribly rotten. It supported a terrible bacterial growth. It was stinky and foul-smelling, and since we don't have enzymes to break down cellulose, the same kind of process happens when you eat a raw leafy material such as lettuce.
**CONTEXT:** When you said salad, you're talking the raw carrot salad, not necessarily a dark leafy green salad, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Well-cooked oat bran is a pretty functional alternative, although research in Australia found the chronic use of oat bran itself has some estrogenic and carcinogenic properties. genetic effects on the intestine.
**CONTEXT:** So, stick to just the raw carrot salad if you really want to remove those endotoxins, right? And what about other fiber sources?

**RAY PEAT:** In studies in pigs, it didn't work so well. It supports either bacterial or fungal growth.
**CONTEXT:** What about coconut flour, since that's pretty high in fiber?

**RAY PEAT:** The coconut oil, if it's oil-refined and clean, it's a good fungus.
**CONTEXT:** That's interesting since most of most other coconut products we can trust in because they actually help it mitigate some of the fungus and yeast in the colon, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Back, neck, wing. and feet are all high in collagen and if you cook them thoroughly and then let it stand and skim off the fat then that's very good high collagen.
**CONTEXT:** What does Dr. Pete think about bone broth, specifically chicken broth?

**RAY PEAT:** You have to be careful getting them from a farmer. that you know because a big processor is likely to have processed the chickens with and sometimes the feet soak up a lot of the antiseptic.
**CONTEXT:** You have to be careful getting the chicken feet from a farmer that you know?

**RAY PEAT:** The diet really is the main thing, keeping your... Stress levels low and your activity comfortable doesn't have to be anything special because the Stress involves several things that, you know, fear with bone repair and renewal, that even a deficiency of salt, a low-salt diet can create... that harms the bone, and so old people have been told to keep their salt down for blood pressure control. That's adding to their stress, increasing adrenaline, bringing up the parathyroid hormone that goes down the bone, keeping a very, very high ratio of calcium. in the phosphate in your diet is helpful because that helps to suppress the parathyroid hormone. blocks the use of oxygen in all of your tissues and that leads to the production of lactic acid in the bone which dissolves the bone and contributes in the long run to osteoporosis but that same bone destroys the lactic acid in the bone and that leads to the production of lactic acid in the bone which dissolves the bone and contributes in the long run to osteoporosis. effect, lowers the energy production in all of our cells. High calcium intake increases our metabolic rate and efficient oxidative metabolism. All through the body, not just the bone.
**CONTEXT:** Ben asks, what about weight training for bone density? He mentioned that you said that weight training, you know, various moves are efficient, but do we need to do regular weight training for bone density, or is there something else we can do?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, yeah, absolutely, vitamin D. The older person is the less cholesterol the skin contains, and it's the ultraviolet light interacting with the cholesterol, the X-vitamin D. So a person, especially a dark-skinned person, doesn't need to worry about the cholesterol, the X-vitamin D, and it's the ultraviolet light interacting with the cholesterol, the X-vitamin D, and it's the ultraviolet light interacting Anyone over the age of 50, it needs a lot more exposure to sunlight to get their vitamin D level up adequately.
**CONTEXT:** Would you also say that these individuals, or all of us, would want to be outside in the sun? Will that help with bone density as well?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's something that feels productive and isn't stress-inducing just by boredom. You can see the product of your labor, and that is anti-stress.
**CONTEXT:** You also mentioned that chopping wood is actually a really great form of exercise. So that would be a way to increase bone density, I would think, too.

**RAY PEAT:** No, the chronic stress elevates the sleep. fatty acids in the blood, women in particular have the problem of chronically high pre-fatty acids because estrogen causes a great activity. The growth hormone, which is a major producer of free fatty acids, and it's free fatty acids in general, and especially unsaturated free fatty acids, that interfere with the use of... So keeping your fat intake low is somewhat helpful, but anything that lowers stress, lowers estrogen, is going to increase your insulin sensitivity in the... your ability to use glucose, everything that lowers stress tends to lower estrogen and improves your ability to use oxygen productively, converting sugar to carbon dioxide when you're stressed or high estrogen or have too much pre-fatty acids in the blood, any sugar that's present tends to produce... lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide, and lactic acid itself has many toxic degenerative effects.
**CONTEXT:** Sergei asks, I'd very much like to know how Dr. Pete would recommend to deal with insulin resistance and early type 2 diabetes. Should one be afraid of elevated blood glucose after saying goodbye to low carb or keto?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the ketogenic diet is always stress promoting. And that means that they are ketogenic to some extent. It isn't really the diet that produces ketosis. It isn't strictly generating ketones. The hydroxyde use rate is included as a ketone. It's actually, uh, an- alcohol, not a ketone. And, uh, studies that have, um, looked at the, uh, the difference between actual ketosis and the presence of a high proportion of hydroxybutyrate shows that the hydroxybutyrate stimulates cancer growth and other stress-related things. Um, so, so, uh, if you, uh, had, uh, an artificial source of ketones... There were real ketones. That would probably be very beneficial, but when you generate them yourself, you're under stress and you're increasing... cancer-promoting degenerative type of situation.
**CONTEXT:** So it sounds like the stress of going into ketosis is part of the problem that's creating almost this diabetic effect on these individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, playing a musical instrument or painting or just doing anything interesting. If there's wood to chop, that's a good activity.
**CONTEXT:** What is your favorite way to de-stress?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the culture is designed pretty much to... uh, keep people under maximum stress, uh, uh, uh, sort of, sort of like, uh, uh, uh, idle hands, uh, err. They're likely to get in trouble, and so the economy is designed to keep everyone under maximum stress so that they don't get in trouble, but naturally it doesn't work that way.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that the culture is designed to keep people under maximum stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. When the weather's good, that's... different podcast is that cortisol is evil and must be reduced but a certain amount of cortisol is necessary for our bodies isn't it and without any cortisol we would die so can you address those who have a low cortisol and how to balance that in the right ratio And they're known diagnosed as having an adrenal deficiency of some sort, but when you look at their blood tests, they're doing fine on cortisol. But the adrenals use cholesterol to turn into cholesterol, which is a very high level of cholesterol. and then in the DHA and progesterone and cortisol and aldosterone. cortisol and aldosterone are increased by almost any stress and only a very small fraction of your pregnenolone or cholesterol or progesterone. makes it into our cortisol, so there has to be a great deficiency of cholesterol, pregnenolone, and progesterone. before you experience an actual deficiency of cholesterol, and by the time you reach a real deficiency of cortisol, you're experiencing a whole range of symptoms and problems from low pregnenolone and low progesterone. You can tolerate lots of stress-induced cortisol if it's backed up with plenty of pregnenolone, progesterone, and DACA. that doesn't have to worry about their stress if they have lots of anti-stress buffer hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Can you address those who have a low cortisol and how to balance that in the right ratio, and they're diagnosed as having an adrenal deficiency of some sort, but when they look at their blood tests, they're doing fine on cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** You know, it will, in experiments unwrapped 60 years ago, They looked at the hormone level of all of the rats they were experimenting with, and some of them were under stress from the handling and such, and they had higher than average cortisol, and then they gave them all the equivalent for a person would be a cup full of powder. They killed their stomachs, I think it was 10 gram dose per ramp, just a gigantic dose so they couldn't eat anything for a few hours, but there were no cases in their steroid hormones except the ones who were under stress to start with. They had brought their cortisol down to normal, so you can't push upstream. in the adrenals, the more pregnenol or progesterone you take. The more normal you become, it's the end point hormones that are produced normally only in extreme situations. like aldosterone, estrogen and cortisol, these are dealing with specific problems, if you supplement those beyond what the body would be making, then you have potential problems with all of them.
**CONTEXT:** Would that be something that they would want to look into supplementing if they, you know, considering taking like a pregnenolone supplement, if they find that they have very low cortisol?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there was a well-known book about 20 or 30 years ago. on the natural use of hydrocortisone or cortisol, and it is examples of the daisies that he on were very good examples showing that a tiny supplement like 5 or 10 micrograms of cortisol could improve a woman's menstrual cycle, for example, but I happen to know some of his patients, who he was giving what he called a physiological dose of natural... Cortisol and after two or three months they all started getting puffy faces Typical... King's disease, that was at 20 milliliters. per day dose, in divided doses, which is... What the body normally makes but if you supplement that it can be risky
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that a tiny supplement like 5 or 10 micrograms of cortisol could improve a woman's menstrual cycle, but you also know some of his patients who were getting puffy faces.

**RAY PEAT:** Probably the majority of people have those viruses and so it's a matter of keeping them from expressing themselves and keeping your ability to handle stress. Optimize is the important thing and when you look at studies of general infections, not just those, but the more serious infections, a pulse or all of the things that they vaccinate for measles and mumps and so on. If you supplement vitamin A and vitamin D along those two vitamins are just about as effective as a huge vaccine. campaign, and the viruses that are resident in the majority of people aren't doing any harm if their immune system is okay. If you're overweight, your blood level might seem to show a normal amount of vitamin A and vitamin D, but your tissues can be very deficient. the person will benefit from bringing their bike. and vitamin A among other nutrients up to a functional level with vitamin D serum level of 50 or 60 nanograms. per milliliter corresponds to a low rate of diabetes, various infections, flu infections basically disappear when the person keeps their blood levels at least at Kiske. in the trench for a little later.
**CONTEXT:** Leanne asks, what would be a good strategy to help with my immune system? I recently found out I have cytomegalovirus expressed and also Epstein-Barr virus and I would like to increase my body's immune function. What do you say to that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've known several people who used to have maybe five episodes every day. every fall and winter of colds or flu, when they started taking vitamin D, not another episode. From multiple cases every year to none in several years.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that keeping vitamin D levels up can prevent colds and flu.

**RAY PEAT:** That probably is helpful in an emergency situation but I don't think you need it. Magnesium is another nutrient that many people are deficient in. If your diet has too much phosphate, you just can't get enough calcium and magnesium to balance it, and if your thyroid is low, your cells don't retain magnesium, and the magnesium deficiency opens up your... immune system to throbs of these endogenous viruses, herpes, Epstein-Barr, and so on.
**CONTEXT:** As far as like other immune boosters, what do you think about colostrum? What do you think about it?

**RAY PEAT:** The guy who was not theorizing that about 10 or 15 years ago asked me to join in the to promote it, but I asked him if... any safety studies of it and he got huffy and said I was anti-scientific but I've looked for safety studies and I'm not convinced those things in any of the lipid things that are germicidal they can also be disturbing to our digestive system.
**CONTEXT:** What about your thoughts on like monolaurin, which is like from lauric acid, like from coconut oil? I know people use that as kind of an immune system booster.

**RAY PEAT:** When we eat a fat like butter or coconut oil, it is in the triglyceride form and our digestive system is very well equipped to handle quite a bit of that natural triglyceride fat and it breaks the particles up in the tiny kilomicron particles. Those will pass into the lymphatic system. The chylomicrons are formed only when you have the right amount of the right type of chylglycerides. When you have the right amount of the right type of chylglycerides, you will pass into the lymphatic system. other emulsifying things or very abnormal lipids. disrupt our ability to make chylomitrons and since the chylomitrons are a major pathway for absorbing vitamins and A, K, uh, V and E, uh, uh, if, if you, uh, uh, disturb the pyelomicrons, uh, for too long, then you can get deficient in the fatty vitamins.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that when we eat fat like butter or coconut oil, it's in triglyceride form and our digestive system is well-equipped to handle it.

**RAY PEAT:** The two hormones most protective for the kidneys are progesterone and thyroid. and the vitamins that I've just been mentioning, especially vitamin D, is extremely protective for the kidneys and making sure that you get The essential minerals, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, in a generous amount every day is protective for the kidneys. Drinking too much water rather than milk or juices. The water can, as she said, wash the minerals out of you just by not providing it fills up your stomach and satisfies your thirst, but it doesn't provide any nutrients, so it's better only to drink water when you're thirsty. Milk, juice, and coffee are accompanied by some... essential nutrients in each one.
**CONTEXT:** With kidney issues such as frequent urination and seeming to dump all my minerals daily with frequent bouts of urination, what do you suggest to calm down the kidneys and also help them to function more optimally?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, um, if you open up a fresh green coconut... It's very nice, but I don't press any of it commercially sold because I've seen some of it containing a preservative, but I imagine if you're sure it doesn't... have a preservativeness, just pasteurized and bottled, that is probably good.
**CONTEXT:** Are you a fan of coconut water?

**RAY PEAT:** It works for some people, but it does have other ingredients. So the tannin type substance in any herb can be irritating. the intestines, it's pretty much a personal matter whether it works for you.
**CONTEXT:** Can white willow bark be taken instead of aspirin?

**RAY PEAT:** It has many functions, anti-inflammatory functions, but the thing that has been studied most is blocking the production of prostaglandins, and those are formed from The inflammation tends to trigger the formation of these... acting hormones, but all of them have some very harmful side effects besides what they primarily do. Most of them are simply amplifiers of the inflammation, and they're produced in the brain, in every organ, heart, and so on, in response to a minor trigger of inflammation. So they're produced in the brain. proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated fat incorporated into all of these tissues and as the age increasing. sharply in the teens as our growth slows down so that we're, our metabolic rate slows and we aren't diluting them or oxidizing them as fast as a baby does. From about the age of 20 we very efficiently keep adding polyunsaturated fatty acids into our tissue structures so that from the age of 20 to 40 We're probably doubling the amount of PUFA in our tissues and PUFA is what converts to prostaglandins. in the event of inflammation. So a fetus or a newborn baby heals in the injury without scars all through childhood. Injuries heal very, very quickly and with relatively little inflammation, but as a proofer in our tissue accumulates... would heal more slowly, cause more inflammation, and can leave scars that are interfering with function. whenever you have a systemic inflammation producing lactic acid and prostaglandins. Both of these are increasing the deposition of collagen in the tissues, so with itching the body becomes approaching something like a big scar with a very high collagen content. That's the difference between. A kid's skin gloves and leather boots is a matter of the age of the animal. An old animal has a very thick leathery skin because of the high collagen content and all of these inflammation related things, prostaglandins or lactic acid contribute to that age process of thickening of the tissues and aspirin by blocking prostaglandins and several other inflammatory mechanisms is important protection from inflammation and aging.
**CONTEXT:** Can you tell people just a few thoughts about how you feel that aspirin is beneficial?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it lowers the pituitary ACTH production, and ACTH also brings up the adrenal elastron, which contributes to the collagen production of aging and deterioration in general. So not just protecting against cortisol, but a whole range of degenerative processes.
**CONTEXT:** And I think my favorite feature, too, is that it helps to lower excess cortisol, is that correct?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. Well, the cod liver oil, at least, is giving you an A, which is beneficial if you don't have another source, but I think it's good to use... fish oil derived, vitamin A and D, if most of the other fish oils have been removed, because the studies of the fate of intestine have......trial are very interesting, if you look at them... in a bottle. I did experiments with a bottle of unsaturated oils. I have never公布過 and put the other end of the rubber tube in water, and every day the water climbed up the rubber tube because of the oxygen consumption of the saturated fat. Fish oils are extremely quick to react with oxygen, and in these studies they found that before they reached the bloodstream, the majority of them had been oxidized. very quick to be stored if they make it into the bloodstream so with aging the brain accumulates these oxidizable fatty acids but the oxidation continues in the brain and the Neuroprostane is what they call the breakdown product when they happen in the brain, isoprostane. in other tissues is the randomly produced equivalent of the prostaglandins. The neuroprostains are made from the type of fatty acid that predominates in fish oil. But before they reach storage, a very large part of these fish oils are already oxidized and they are immunosuppressive. We detect an immune system can temporarily reduce inflammation by damaging the cells that would react to harm. So for about six months, they are anti-inflammatory by blocking... some of the immediate inflammatory reactions of the immune system, but after that the immune deficiency starts showing up and the animals experimented on with fish oils then became more susceptible to all kinds of infections.
**CONTEXT:** Nick asks, I've been taking cod liver oil pills for vitamin A and vitamin D. He says in a previous interview to avoid fish oils, which I've never heard before, so does that include cod liver oil? Should I stop?

**RAY PEAT:** Historically, it was made of very good varnish because it oxidizes so thoroughly. And if you imagine that happening in your body, you don't want that varnish to... So if you have any leftover fish oil at home, just start using it as varnish for your furniture at home. Don't ingest it.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that if you have any leftover fish oil at home, you should use it as varnish for your furniture, not ingest it.

**RAY PEAT:** It happens that the... Only non-animal proteins that are really adequate for human needs are potatoes and mushrooms. And you can thrive as far as protein goes. either potatoes or mushrooms, and mushrooms happen to generally have more of the trace minerals than potatoes. So you can get your iron from the mushrooms and all of the other nutrients except B12. and vitamin A from potatoes and some people said that mushrooms can provide B12, I'm not sure of that, but adequate bacteria and intestines won't make vitamin B12, and so vitamin A is the main problem. And keratin, if your thyroid function is good, and if you have vitamin B12, those are needed for converting keratin into the actual vitamin A, which is... needed for making progesterone, which is essential for maintaining good periods. And so the problem becomes that so many vegetables block your thyroid function. As long as you can keep your thyroid function up, you're good to go. functioning and have vitamin B12, then you can convert carotene adequately to vitamin A to make your hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Victoria asks, can women who are vegans or vegetarians successfully follow Dr. Pete's nutritional guidelines and maintain a healthy menstrual cycle?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, but potatoes and mushrooms are very rich in all of B vitamins, all the nutrients except for iron and vitamin A and sometimes B12 might be a limiting factor. Potatoes and mushrooms provide the energies of sodium. Calcium and sugar are necessary for making the thyroid you need to make seed. of progesterone, but there are no foods that directly go to the progesterone system.
**CONTEXT:** As far as like for vegans, vegetarians, would something like nutritional yeast, would that bring in some B vitamins since it is kind of high in B12?

**RAY PEAT:** I've noticed that the yam story, people were trying to sell yams as a progesterone promoter, but the... Here all, in the end, is actually estrogenic and very toxic, uh, uh, Russell Marker, who quickly developed his protection of protectionism. Drunk from yams at one point decided to try the raw yam powder. to see what it would do, and the next morning he said he looked like he had been run over by a truck. He was all black and blue and his head had broken. so many blood vessels that we was bleeding internally. It's very dangerous stuff in the crude form.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that the yam story, people were trying to sell yams as a progesterone promoter, but it's actually estrogenic and very toxic.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, that was very sweet, but I'm not that sure it's safe to use it. Try to regulate their blood pressure in a pinch at 10. Uh, lower blood pressure, but, uh, uh, uh, I don't think there's, uh, uh, any- Real problem with hypotensive is if you're eating well and keeping your thyroid function alright. So, hypothyroidism is... It's almost always behind hypertension, other nutritional deficiencies. can sometimes do it. A magnesium deficiency or a vitamin D deficiency sometimes but usually it's just a low thyroid problem.
**CONTEXT:** Elisa asks, what does Dr. Pete think of stevia?

**RAY PEAT:** Just eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla.
**CONTEXT:** How do you do your custard?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm just trying out different ways of handling it with the traditional, pretty much. The Central Americans developed, I think, all of the best recipes, quesadillas, for example.
**CONTEXT:** Do you have kind of a recipe that you're working on now with the masa?
