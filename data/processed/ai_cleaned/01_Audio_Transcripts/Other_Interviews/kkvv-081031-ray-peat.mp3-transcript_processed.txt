**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, 35 years ago. When I moved to Eugene from southern Oregon, where there's a lot more sun, I wondered why I was feeling lethargic and depressed, and I realized we hadn't had a day of sunlight for about two months straight. And that was when I really started getting interested in the hormonal effects of sunlight."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about seasonal affective disorder and its connection to sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "I keep about 500 watts shining down on me all the time when I'm indoors. They have a clear front and a reflector built in, but they have a warmer temperature, lower temperature than the usual incandescent bulb. That means that the light penetrates more deeply. It's rich in red and orange frequencies."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how Dr. Peat corrected his lethargy and depression related to lack of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I have... an 80-year-old mercury vapor lamp that I use for getting extra vitamin D once in a while, but I also take some vitamin D. I like to take it through my skin because I never have much confidence in how pure the excipients are in supplements, but taking it through my skin, it works fine for me. Keeping my vitamin D up."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about using ultraviolet light.

**RAY PEAT:** "If your blood sugar is low, almost anything becomes a serious allergen. With animal experiments, they found that the weakest allergen... If they lowered the blood sugar with insulin, the animals would die in shock from a very weak allergen. But if they gave them extra sugar, even the allergic animals could... they would get nothing but mild sniffles from a deadly, super strong allergen."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between blood sugar and allergies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Normally when you are exposed to a stress or an allergen, you put out a little extra cortisol to......improve your immunity and lower your inflammation, but that can start suppressing your thyroid function and lowering your liver's detoxifying ability, and your intestine always has allergens in it. And especially if you're exposed to some special allergens, the chronic exposure to cortisol......suppressing your liver function and thyroid function allows those toxins and allergens from your intestine to get into the bloodstream. And endotoxin is a basic substance produced by bacteria in the intestine. And that poisons our energy-producing systems. It almost turns off mitochondrial function. And that wastes the blood sugar so that you can create hypoglycemia by exposing yourself to too many of these stresses."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the vicious cycle of stress, cortisol, and allergies.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the quickest way to break out of this cycle is to eat... a well-balanced natural diet, but emphasizing a lot of fruits. Orange juice, for example, because of the high potassium content, which lets you handle and absorb blood sugar without disturbing your insulin. The potassium itself handles the sugar without triggering the insulin. And when your liver is receiving enough sugar... from the combination of potassium and sugar in the fruit, it is able to activate the thyroid hormone, restoring the poisoned function of your mitochondria and letting you use oxygen efficiently. So it can bring you out of a chronic allergic hypoglycemic state and get you back to a steady blood sugar, sometimes just in a day or two."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for the quickest way to break out of the stress-allergy-hypoglycemia cycle.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most people don't understand. Many years ago wrote a very good book called hypoglycemia. It's your liver not your mind and He was one of the first people To emphasize that most of the active thyroid about 70% of it Is produced in your liver rather than in the thyroid gland the gland Itself in your neck produces about 30% of the active hormone, but anytime your blood sugar falls If you go without eating for eight hours, for example, your blood sugar is likely to fall and that your liver doesn't want to convert your tissues to food and so your liver stops making thyroid so your metabolism decreases, your temperature goes down at some point when you have stopped eating so that you don't burn up your body too fast as you would if your metabolic rate stayed high without eating."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the liver's role in thyroid hormone production and its connection to blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several tissues produce quite a bit of it. The pituitary gland can detect T4 because the inactive form of the thyroid......thyroxin, and since it can convert it, it doesn't distinguish very strongly between whether you're taking T4 or T3, it turns off its activity whenever it sees T4 or T3. And so, since it produces just a tiny amount for its own detecting purposes, if you accumulate too much thyroxin... in your tissues, your pituitary thinks you have enough thyroid but your liver might not be producing any active thyroid hormone from it at all."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if thyroid hormone conversion happens at the cellular level.

**RAY PEAT:** "The liver became fully activated with a modest amount of thyroxin added. The kidneys converted a little of it and were slightly activated by thyroxin. The muscles were not activated at all. But the brain, when thyroxin was added, was actually suppressed because the brain normally has an extremely high... concentration of the active T3 part of the hormone in relation to T4 and so locally the too much T4 affects your brain in an anti-thyroid direction but very few doctors are aware of the risks of prescribing plain thyroxine."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about where thyroid hormone is active and its effects on different organs.

**RAY PEAT:** "That is true and because of I think it is the result of pressure from the pharmaceutical industry making their synthetics. The FDA has begun forcing the producers of the natural thyroid products such as Armour Thyroid USP to put on their label the ingredients in terms of T4 and T3, but natural thyroid contains neither of those. It's a protein with only the tiniest trace. It has a contaminant sometimes of Cyroxin or the active T3, but now people look at the label and they see T4 and T3 even listed on natural thyroid products and it just isn't there. When you digest the protein, your digestive system releases those hormones and the gland, when you digest it... or when it digests itself in normal functioning, that protein breaking down releases about three or four parts of thyroxin for each part of the active T3, and that's why your liver has to convert the thyroxin, which is about 70% of the output of your thyroid gland. Similarly, when you take a supplement of Armour Thyroid, when you digest it, it's in that same ratio, so your liver still has to activate three quarters of it, and that means that you can't go very far wrong when you're taking the natural substance, because the ratio entering your blood is within the range. It's produced by your normal gland, so your liver can make the decision as to whether to activate it or not."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the difference between synthetic thyroid (Synthroid) and natural thyroid products like Armour Thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, many people have told me that when they were given supposedly the right dose of thyroxine, they began getting symptoms like ringing sounds in their ears and prickly sensations, a fairly common......symptoms of hypothyroidism, but they would start when they would go on thyroxin and when they added T3, the symptoms would go away and they would be okay."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the suppressive effect of thyroxine on the brain and other symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** "The way they did it in the 1930s before the drug companies came on the scene and basically took control of the journals and the medical schools and made everyone over the next 30 or 40 years forget. How to treat thyroid patients, the way they originally did it was to look at symptoms and when they saw definitely too many symptoms they would give them a basal metabolic rate test, how much oxygen they consume at rest and that's really the absolute way to determine... what's happening. It doesn't matter how much is in your blood if it's being blocked. For example, if you have eaten too many polyunsaturated fats or too much cabbage or other anti-thyroid factors, you can have an excess of thyroid hormones in your bloodstream and still not be consuming very much oxygen. Some people are 20%, 30%, 40% below normal. Oxygen consumption, and the ideal way would be to give the dose of thyroid until the oxygen consumption is at least normal. Except Americans, in comparison with other countries where they don't eat so much of the artificial food, Americans on average are about 25% hypometabolic or hypothyroid."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for the best way to test thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "So temperature is just one of the indicators and there's a reflex, the Achilles tendon relaxation rate. If you have a person kneel and thump their Achilles tendon so that it makes their toe twitch away from their body, a person with almost any thyroid function will have the reflex, but what you want is how quickly your foot relaxes back to its resting position. And a hypothyroid person's foot looks like it has a pneumatic door closer on it. So you want to do that carefully. Or in jerks, returns slowly to where it was at rest. But a person with good thyroid function, the jerking foot looks like a piece of rubber. It relaxes and bounces. It comes back so fast."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about other physiological indicators of thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "The liver is a big source of disposal of the cholesterol, but the ovaries, the gonads, and the brain itself, and the adrenal glands all use considerable amounts of cholesterol. For example, in one experiment... Blood containing a known amount of cholesterol was pumped into an ovary, and the amount of progesterone coming out corresponded exactly to the amount of cholesterol going in. If you lowered the cholesterol, you lowered the amount of progesterone being produced. That same conversion happens in the brain, and adrenal glands, and various other tissues to some extent. So if you're forcing your cholesterol down with a drug, you're likely, for example, many studies have shown increased rate of accidents, cancer, and even suicide, and death by homicide, I think was one of the major events in people who were drugged to lower their cholesterol. Thanks. And the Framingham study following people over many years found that people whose cholesterol was below 200 when they were over the age of 50 were much more likely to become demented because cholesterol makes those protective hormones, makes progesterone, for example, in the brain, which is extremely protective against all kinds of... injury and toxins."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between high blood fat (cholesterol) and low thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "The usual thing is to check the diet, make sure the person is getting enough good protein because a protein deficiency makes the liver unable to activate the thyroid hormone the same way a lack of sugar does. So you need at least 80 grams of high quality. Protein for example milk or cheese or eggs will okay give you good protein to? Make the liver able to process the thyroid and a low thyroid function of the symptoms you mentioned are very classical hypothyroid symptoms because the brain needs energy to go to sleep properly. Hypothyroid people have been given EEG's which show that they never can get into deep restful slow wave sleep they stay in superficial sleep which isn't restful and even worse than that they often have insomnia and have trouble going to sleep because when your nerves or your muscles are not producing enough energy fatigue accumulates and they're unable to relax it's the same thing as the Achilles reflex test you're slow to relax any cell any muscle or nerve and when you get fatigued your brain needs thyroid to relax."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks for medication recommendations for insomnia and weight gain, suspecting a thyroid issue.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid helps you to relax and helps your reflexes to recover. He mentioned the pulmonary reflex of the eye as well as your Achilles tendon reflex as well as now the body being able to relax and go to sleep at night."

**CONTEXT:** The host explains how thyroid hormone aids relaxation and sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** "The red light or sunlight that penetrates deeply into your cells activates processes that protect you against cortisol activity. Lipid peroxidation and free radicals and it just takes about an hour of darkness and your mitochondria start losing efficiency because the free radicals start interfering with them and so when darkness has lasted for several hours your blood sugar becomes a problem and that's why your cortisol rises. after you've been asleep for a couple hours, it keeps getting higher and higher until dawn. And that allows you to stay asleep because the cortisol is breaking down your protein, turning it to sugar, letting the thyroid function, letting your nerve cells repair by getting enough sugar. But the combination of reactions to the low blood sugar... If your liver didn't store enough glycogen, very quickly, early in the night, you'll have an adrenaline reaction trying to get more glycogen out of your liver to compensate for the low thyroid function. Low thyroid people very often have 30 or 40 times more adrenaline being produced than a healthy person. And that keeps you awake or makes you wake up. With a start after you've been asleep for a while. And the adrenaline makes your heart beat faster and wakes you up. But it triggers increasing cortisol. And the cortisol will start damaging your tissues. Making your muscles gradually be converted to sugar to keep your brain working during the night. And these low thyroid people who... compensate with very high amounts of adrenaline and cortisol will sometimes wake up with a temperature of 98.6 or 99 degrees which is definitely not in what most people think of as the hypothyroid range which is usually 95 or 96 degrees. But if you take their temperature about an hour after they've had some orange juice and other food in the morning. You'll find that their temperature is down in the extremely hypothyroid range. It's only the stress hormones before breakfast that Keep them up to a normal temperature."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the sleep-wake cycle, cortisol, adrenaline, and their impact on body temperature in hypothyroid individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the problems that I see in the thyroid testing is what they're checking is T3 uptake which is a mathematical guesstimation. They're not usually checking T3 RIA which is a more accurate assessment of the active thyroid. So if your child has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and T3 is elevated, that doesn't make sense. That's a total contradiction in terms."

**CONTEXT:** The host questions the accuracy of T3 uptake tests in diagnosing hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are three times when women are more likely to become hypothyroid and you can very often see the signs even if they aren't experiencing any symptoms. You can see the thyroid gland enlarging around puberty and again at pregnancy and again around menopause. And what happens is they've studied it. With slices of the tissue in a culture dish, as estrogen rises, the brain senses that you need more thyroid hormone, puts out more TSH, but the estrogen blocks the enzymes that digest that protein in the thyroid gland so it stops secreting the active hormone. And progesterone happens to activate TSH. those enzymes and allow the gland to secrete but you can pretty much depend on the slowing down of the thyroid whenever there's a situation that raises estrogen and puberty is the most common one. Typically girls in their teens will have an enlarged thyroid compared to boys because that's the standard. Effective estrogen even when you're healthy."

**CONTEXT:** The host explains why women are more prone to hypothyroidism during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.

**RAY PEAT:** "The reverse T3 rises when you're under stress and exposed to too much cortisol and a very bad diet can be enough to put you into that chronic stress state and the quickest way out of it is with a supplement. A reliably formulated supplement of T3 but the Armour Thyroid and a traditional product made by the same company called Thyrolar which was a synthetic made to be equivalent to the natural thyroid. Those will provide enough T3 for most people but there's people almost always prefer to have a little. More T3 than that if they want to quickly get over their symptoms."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Wilson's syndrome and whether T3 can correct it.

**RAY PEAT:** "The traditional doctors. Did find just going by signs and as many of the measures as they knew were reliable such as oxygen consumption and the cholesterol level and they would look at the palms of a person's hands. A low thyroid person can't convert keratin to vitamin A and so they will typically accumulate orange in the calluses of their hands and feet. Their skin, their hands and feet are almost always cold because their metabolic rate is low even though their core temperature might be kept up by adrenaline and cortisol. Their fingers and toes are likely to be cooler than other people's at the same environmental temperature. And cold feet interestingly can cause serious inflammatory problems. elsewhere in the body. So a first aid for some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is just to get some woolly underwear and fix stockings and keep your extremities warm because you can actually cure anemia even without correcting your whole metabolic situation just by keeping your long bones warmer and reducing the inflammatory substances produced in cold feet."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses traditional methods of diagnosing hypothyroidism, including palm appearance and extremity temperature.

**RAY PEAT:** "I had a friend who was in his 70s and... had an accident and immediately started developing arthritis and was crippled pretty suddenly by arthritis in his hands and feet and knees and he luckily had a doctor who had been educated in the 1930s who immediately tested his thyroid because stress and injury can lower your thyroid and my friend was... was grumpy and said I didn't go to have you fix my thyroid I wanted you to fix the arthritis but within two weeks his arthritis cleared up and he lived 15 years more with never any more arthritis. In the 30s it was standard knowledge that arthritis was usually a sign of hypothyroidism."

**CONTEXT:** The host shares an anecdote about arthritis being a sign of hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I do advocate eating saturated fats, they can have some therapeutic effects. I'm also an advocate of fruit-centered diet. There are animals that live on fruit, for example, the squirrel monkey, which lives about three times as long as a squirrel monkey....other animals of its size and has an extremely high metabolic rate and in the wild it lives exclusively on fruit and that's sort of a way to think about the effect of fruit on your physiology because the fruit contains the things needed to stimulate your thyroid function and protect against stress. So it is possible. to live entirely without fat in your diet because your body can make the saturated fats that it needs."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the role of saturated fats and a fruit-centered diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "On the other hand, you have a lot of patients who are taking these unsaturated fatty acids which are actually inhibiting thyroid. Thoroughly, it inhibits the thyroid. It inhibits secretion, transport and reaction to the thyroid. In the early part of the last century, several researchers showed that animals on a fat-free diet were completely free of spontaneous cancer and lived longer than normal."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the negative impact of unsaturated fatty acids on thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "There's the Thyroid by Thomas MacGaffic."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a concluding book recommendation.
