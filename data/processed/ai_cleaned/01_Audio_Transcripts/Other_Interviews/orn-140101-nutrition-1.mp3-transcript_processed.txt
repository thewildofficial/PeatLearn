**RAY PEAT:** "Doctors tend to indoctrinate the person to believe that they have what has been diagnosed in them. But if you look at them as an individual, very often that's not a problem at all."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about how Dr. Peat approaches diagnosing patients, and if patients often know what's wrong with them.

**RAY PEAT:** "The actual figures show that even by medical standards accidents are misjudgment by the medical industry are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans every year and if you interpret the evidence looking outside of hospitals that's just hospital accidents. Account for a hundred thousand or so but it's close to a million people a year even by conventional medical standards who are being killed unnecessarily by these accidents."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the significance of blood pressure readings like 160/90 or 180/100.

**RAY PEAT:** "Occasionally, for it to get up to 160 over 90 isn't bad, but that same person, if you look at them in the afternoon when they aren't listening to the news or something that irritates them, they might be 140 over 90, and that's perfectly okay for a middle-aged person. But in the morning, when they are... sort of dehydrated during the night, their blood will be thicker and they might be 150 every morning. But if it goes down to 130 in the afternoon, that's perfectly healthy."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lower blood pressure readings like 110/60 are always better.

**RAY PEAT:** "We are a very tough organism compared to rats for example, we can stand a tremendous stress that other animals couldn't stand for many reasons, our high metabolic rate and a big brain and a powerful glandular system."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about individual differences in nutritional needs.

**RAY PEAT:** "What would be an example of that? is that some of the nearly vegetarian villages in Africa and South America, people age very fast and are dying off by the time they're 40 of infectious diseases."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked for examples of diets that show objective signs of being unhealthy.

**RAY PEAT:** "The explorer who about 80 years ago was studying the diet of the Eskimos he observed that they could avoid scurvy by eating purely meat diet and he popularized the idea that you don't need the fruits and vegetables because meat is a good source of vitamin C but he himself observed that the people eating that traditional high meat Eskimo diet I looked very prematurely aged and just in the last two or three years that is being explained as a phosphate poisoning, basically. The ratio of phosphate to calcium, when it's too high it accelerates degeneration."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the Eskimo diet and scurvy.

**RAY PEAT:** "A pure grain diet or a pure meat diet, either one, so it can be vegetarians or meat eaters who are basically causing the same kind of toxic inflammatory reaction."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the source of high phosphate in the diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ruminants live on basically leaves by preference, and leaves have an extremely high ratio of magnesium and calcium to phosphorus, and so their milk is a pretty safe ratio. It's got about one and a third calciums per... phosphate which is a very safe amount but vegetarians who either eat lots of fruit or who cook their greens, there are some diets that have up in the high altitude areas of South America and Asia, there have been people who eat lots of cooked greens as well as usually... sheep or goat cheese and milk and that's a very longevity supporting kind of diet."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the dietary habits of ruminants and longevity-supporting diets.

**RAY PEAT:** "We can't digest them in the raw form just because the cellulose encloses the nutrients. and makes them inaccessible to our enzymes. There was a study in about 1945 with feeding, people were talking about the loss of nutrients in canned vegetables and so they fed one group of rats vegetables out of cans and another group of fresh vegetables of exactly the same kind. and the ones eating the canned vegetables thrived. They grew normally and the ones eating the raw vegetables just couldn't digest enough to grow properly."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why cooking greens is beneficial and discusses a study comparing canned and raw vegetables.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, some people have a very vigorous peristalsis. And they can get it through and it sweeps out their intestine and that can be a very good effect because the liver puts out some of its toxins in the bile and tries to get rid of the toxins by excreting them through the intestine. But if you have a sluggish bowel and not much moving through it, the intestine reabsorbs. Those toxins, and so they recycle, and many toxins accumulate, especially estrogen. The liver should make all of the estrogen that it experiences into a soluble form and excrete them. But if you don't have bulk or movement in your intestine, you reabsorb those, and that messes up your whole endocrine system."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the nutritional value of raw salads.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the great interest in fiber. Developed in the United States, partly there was a trend around 1900 but it came back with the oat bran publicity in the 1970s. But the person who had studied the effect of fiber in preventing bowel cancer in Africa came to the U.S. and said, why is everyone eating oat bran? He was talking about potatoes, cooked potatoes in the diet, which are a great and pretty safe kind of fiber. But Australian studies found that oat bran in particular promoted bowel cancer in rat study."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the history of fiber research and the findings on oat bran.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, very good. Really? The New Guineans live on basically, the traditional diet was almost pure potatoes for 51 weeks out of the year than they would have pork feast for one week. No kidding. And how long did they live? A long time? They didn't have any heart disease, not a high rate of cancer, any degenerative disease."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the health benefits of cooked potatoes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the starch, all the starches do turn to sugar. But the other ingredients in potatoes are very different from the cereals. The cereal is a storage form that has to be dormant for several months until the next season. The potato... is always moist and metabolizing, and so it's always in a physiological state, not concentrated and dehydrated, and that means that it has a good balance of all of the intracellular minerals associated with the starch, so you have a better balance of phosphorus and calcium, for example, than in seeds, the high phosphate concentration in the seed is in the form of phytic acid or a similar thing that binds minerals, so that the minerals are concentrated in association with this phytic acid, and when it sprouts, then it forms cells and becomes relatively good nutrition. But a potato was always in that really living state with just granules of starch within functioning cells."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why starches in potatoes are different from cereals.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh boy so how do we find out if we should be eating those things? Well if you lay off some for about a week you'll see if your symptoms."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to determine if one has an allergy to nightshades.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well sweet potatoes are a special issue if they're orange colored. The carotene interferes with the breakdown of the starches and they're likely to be, to have... more fibrous starch than a white potato and so a sweet potato can cause a lot of gas because it's slow to digest because of the carotene in it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why orange sweet potatoes can cause digestive issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, for ease of digestion and the protein quality in it. Any potato is higher than the protein quality of an egg, so you can't look at a chart which shows you two or three parts of starch for every part of protein, because much of the protein value is present in the form of small molecules that are equivalent to the essential amino acids. So it just doesn't show up in the analysis as protein, but when you eat it, it counts. It's better than egg yolk."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat compares the protein quality of potatoes to eggs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Especially with butter, because pure starch digests quickly. It turns into pure glucose rather than half fructose. And the pure glucose is a powerful stimulant to insulin secretion, fat production. Adding butter or cream slows the digestion, so it isn't such a powerful insulin stimulant. But it also reduces the chance of what's called persorption of starch granules. A starch granule, a potato starch granule, happens to be very big. Other starches are more the size of a red blood cell, but a potato granule. A starch granule is several times fatter than that, but even these huge granules bigger than cells can get squeezed right through the wall of the intestine, enter the lymphatics and the blood system. So within 30 minutes after you eat starch without fat, you see these starch grains circulating through your blood and if they're big they'll plug up your arterioles. Studies in mice showed that a high raw starch diet accelerated their aging and you could demonstrate areas of every organ that were being killed by plugging up the arteries feeding the areas. So the fat is key, the fat is key to have with starches. Yeah, good thorough cooking plus some fat."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the importance of fat with starches.

**RAY PEAT:** "They are relatively deficient, nutritionally deficient food, but if you need the calories... that's their basic value and traditionally wheat in Asia and corn in the Americas, these grains go way back, but they were processed by boiling the seed either in lye made from ashes or in active calcium hydroxide. To break down the toxic components, you can get somewhat the same effect by sprouting the grain, but the traditional way and very quick and producing a tasty product was to boil it in the alkali. Most people don't know. Hominy, that's a form of ____ treated corn and when you grind up hominy, you make the traditional tortilla or tamale and that, if people eat their corn in that form or the wheat in a similar form, they aren't susceptible to ____ for example because niacin is created ____. in the calcium treatment and it lowers the problem of too much leucine in the diet from the corn so it nutritionally corrects the natural problems of the grain and after or separately from those very ancient processes the Europeans for generations. Processed their flour by soaking it to let yeast grow in it to leaven it to produce a soft bread. And the process of soaking it and letting yeast grow naturally in it takes about 12 hours at a moderate room temperature. And in that process enzymes break down the storage proteins that are so allergenic. And release the minerals from the storage forms such as phytic acid. And so the traditional leavened bread was much richer in B vitamins and protein and minerals. And if you eat your grains without any of those old processes, you're going to have the... the lack of those positive nutrients as well as the excess of phosphate."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the historical processing of grains like wheat and corn and the benefits of traditional methods.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because in much of the world, calories are the thing to keep alive."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked if people in China and Japan eating white rice are primarily getting calories.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, if you... What would you do? If it hasn't been either roasted or irradiated before you get it, if it's still alive, then you can just soak it for a few hours and it gets softer and less starchy the longer it soaks, but also more nutritious. The enzymes... that are breaking down the toxic stuff are releasing nutrients but also synthesizing new proteins. The storage forms of the protein are always either irritating or allergenic or toxic, but as the enzymes process them, they turn into living enzymes and structural proteins. Just like the plant."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked how to prepare brown rice for better nutritional value.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it's especially good for promoting fat production and the insulin, if you're having enough protein with it. The insulin also can stimulate muscle building."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the benefits of rice with protein for fat and muscle production.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, the trouble with a pure meat diet is that your brain and blood for example need sugar and your body is always going to produce some sugar, some glucose, and if you're eating a pure meat or pure protein diet. Your body is going to turn some of that into glucose and some in the fat for energy. But the process of breaking down the protein to make sugar is also going to affect your own physiology. And I've known people who, a woman for example, was told by her doctors to eat more protein because they saw that her urine contained a lot of amino acids. And she went up to, I think it was three pounds of meat a day, and she was getting weaker as well as fatter because her cortisol production was extremely high because that's involved in turning amino acids into sugar."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the potential issues with a pure meat diet and protein metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The main thing that keeps your blood sugar stable is the ability of your liver to store sugar wherever it got it. And the thing that it needs to store sugar is the active form of the thyroid hormone. The thyroid hormone also makes you use your sugar very sparingly, producing many times more ATP molecules per unit of food than you get if you burn it or if you metabolize it into lactic acid, which you do when you don't have enough thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses foods that help stabilize blood sugar and the role of thyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "So, thyroid makes you spare your glucose, not waste it, and store it in the liver. So it's the basic thing for stabilizing your blood sugar. And if you have the cholesterol, which is produced only if your liver is in good condition, low cholesterol is behind a serious adrenal failure, because cholesterol is the raw material for making... the steroids, pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and cortisol. And if your cholesterol is low and your thyroid is low, then you can't make any of these. And if you don't make enough of the other steroids, then you will turn any trace of progesterone or pregnenolone into cortisol and get excess cortisol. So you can get either adrenal failure or adrenal overactivity as a consequence of having a sick liver or an underactive thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the connection between thyroid, cholesterol, and adrenal function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, anywhere between 160 and 230. is a little more active, the cholesterol will probably go down to 200 or 190. There's this mirror image relationship between cholesterol and thyroid function."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the relationship between cholesterol levels and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the Russians in Moscow and Leningrad tremendous rate of obesity and their diet was heavy on bread. And they had a terrible milk supply, they went across the border to Helsinki and everyone there was slim and all the stores were full of cheese and milk and that started me thinking about the role of calcium and dairy products in preventing obesity and degenerative diseases. It turns out that the calcium itself is a major factor in......preventing the inflammation process, which is important in turning on the fat storage business."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his observations on obesity in Russia and Finland and the role of calcium and dairy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's the best practical major protein because of the very high calcium ratio to phosphate."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat endorses cow dairy, specifically raw, grass-fed milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well, I always recommend drinking orange juice and milk because of the sugar and the anti-inflammatory. other ingredients in the orange juice, the high mineral content."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends orange juice and milk for pregnenolone production and general health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and these minor ingredients, naringin, for example, they're very important anti-estrogenic foods and anti-inflammatory. They're going to probably turn out to be major. supplements when the orange industry finds a way to concentrate them cheaply out of the peelings."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the anti-estrogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of compounds in orange juice.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, it comes with these high potassium which works to dispose of the sugar safely and some magnesium. And the calcium and so on that also help to stabilize the blood sugar."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why the sugar in orange juice is not problematic.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's where the... the milk or cheese is very important to keep the metabolic rate up and watch the thyroid function and there are several ways without having a blood test that you can make a pretty good guess about what your thyroid is doing. If your hands and feet are cold, colder than average, that's because your adrenaline is is holding your temperature up for your brain and... and heart by cutting the circulation in the extremities. And so the oral temperature is a good indicator in general but the cold extremities are the first sign of failing thyroid function."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat addresses a listener's experience of feeling cold after drinking orange juice and discusses signs of failing thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that some kind of a systemic inflammatory problem is involved causing the inability of the body to clear that out, but I don't know of any reliable way other than it's usually a very simple surgery just to have a lipoma cut out under the skin."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses lipomas and their potential causes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, no, it's there have been studies in which someone would eat a huge amount of cornstarch, for example, at bedtime, and that would turn off their hot flashes during the night. But how it works is pretty well worked out. It just isn't well publicized, but there have been studies demonstrating that the flushing, especially around menopause, this periodic flushing involves the release of nitric oxide in the blood vessels. causing vasodilation, causing heat loss and the brain has a temperature regulator which activates the production of nitric oxide to cause this heat loss because something is setting this thermostat in the brain lower. Your brain is telling your body to cool off even though it's already subnormal temperature usually. And what happens is the stress apparatus, usually they talk about the pituitary and the adrenals, but above the pituitary there is the corticotropin release hormone in the hypothalamus which turns on the whole stress system. This CRH, corticotropin release hormone, directly activates the... nitric oxide in the blood vessels causing the flushing and the things that turn on the stress reaction are primarily related to hypoglycemia. So if your brain senses it isn't getting enough sugar, it wants to, in effect, hibernate, reduce the body temperature so it doesn't waste the sugar which it's short of. And so if you can tell your brain that you... have plenty of sugar, that will suppress the corticotropin release hormone and that will stop turning on the nitric oxide and stop the flushing."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the mechanism behind hot flashes and how sugar intake can alleviate them.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hyperventilation is often involved in that and a hormone imbalance and checking the thyroid, probably having a blood test for all the steroids as well as the thyroid hormones."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses potential causes of panic attacks and recommends hormone and thyroid testing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when your progesterone is low or your estrogen is high, that tends to cause hyperventilation. And once you start hyperventilating, the loss of carbon dioxide causes... your blood cells to release serotonin and other nerve transmitters that cause all kinds of nervous and emotional effects. So that's why people breathe into a paper bag."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the link between hormone imbalances, hyperventilation, and anxiety.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I've seen people lower their blood pressure in two or three days and never have another... problem of, for example, 160 over 90 or 100 blood pressure with several times a day for two or three days. People can very often get their blood pressure down as easily as that."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the effectiveness of breathing into a paper bag for lowering blood pressure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but not only the brain, it also happens to activate the mitochondria all through your body, so it's making things more efficient."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how breathing into a paper bag can improve mitochondrial function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the medical opinion is often that people don't breathe enough during the night, but when you look at their changes of pH and the actual blood chemistry, the usual thing is that they hyperventilate during the night because as their blood sugar is pushed down to go to sleep. Their adrenaline comes up periodically and the adrenaline and changed disposition of the sugar makes them have in effect higher estrogen, higher inflammatory hormones that drive hyperventilation and blow off too much carbon dioxide and then they don't breathe for a while so they wake up with a feeling that they have died or haven't been breathing enough and the best chemical treatment for that is a chemical called diamox or acetazolamide that causes the body to retain more carbon dioxide which keeps stimulating the brain to keep breathing at the right speed but it prevents the body from losing the carbon dioxide that holds it in the blood."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why people wake up feeling like they haven't been breathing enough and introduces Diamox (acetazolamide) as a treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** "Acetazolamide. It's a diuretic is its traditional use, but it's probably most often used now for high altitude sickness."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides the chemical name for Diamox and its common uses.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a very practical simple thing is a glass of warm milk with an ounce or two of either sugar or honey in it. The milk makes the sugar or honey absorb more slowly, and the effect of the sugar is to lower your adrenaline, which the older a person gets, the more problem they have with sleep hypoglycemia causing increased adrenaline, and that can lead to high blood pressure problems. Old people who are told to take a blood pressure drug will often get worse insomnia as their blood sugar falls and their adrenaline goes up, and sometimes just by eating enough sugar and salt during the day and a little extra at bedtime, they can not only cure their insomnia, but it can also lead to high blood pressure, which can lead to high blood pressure, and sometimes their blood sugar is corrected enough that the blood pressure problem disappears."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends warm milk with sugar or honey for better sleep and discusses the role of blood sugar and adrenaline in insomnia and high blood pressure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, especially when it's with a food like milk or something that keeps it in the stomach for a while. Like butter or something? Yeah, ice cream."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the benefits of consuming sugar with foods like milk or butter before bed.
