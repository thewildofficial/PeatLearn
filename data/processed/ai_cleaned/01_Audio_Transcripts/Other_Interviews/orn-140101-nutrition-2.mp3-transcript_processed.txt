**RAY PEAT:** The phosphate has to get excreted. And the phosphate shows up in urine and precipitates. In the presence of either magnesium or calcium. And it only precipitates if the pH is above a certain point. And so if you have a very high protein diet, most of the time your urine will be acidic. And it will be clear despite having a tremendous amount of phosphate in it. But when something raises the pH of your urine, which can be... eating a lot of fruit or vegetables, or hyperventilating is another thing. If you blow out too much carbon dioxide, the pH of your urine goes up to keep your blood at the right pH, slightly alkaline. And when your urine pH is above, is neutral or higher on the alkaline side, then any phosphate and calcium... is going to precipitate and make it cloudy.
**CONTEXT:** What does cloudy urine indicate? Is it the body wasting calcium or a yeast infection?

**RAY PEAT:** I've known... quite a few women who took it every day and kept cycling without any problem. But what they should be aware of is that if you take a little extra just before the expected time of ovulation, it will trigger early ovulation and then if you stop taking it or take less, it will bring on an early menstruation. So if you're going to take it every day, it has to be every day the same amount.
**CONTEXT:** Brenda asks if there would be any harm in continuing to take Progest E non-stop, even if it means missing a period or two.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, behind the... the problem with the balance of progesterone and estrogen, the basic thing is almost always low-thyroid, and some women will use a quick-acting thyroid so that as soon as they start getting a symptom of PMS, they take just a little extra quick-acting stuff, and they can adjust the hormones on a day-to-day basis that way. Other people increase just knowing that they don't want to have PMS. They will take a little more of their glandular thyroid starting at ovulation, and the opposite happens when a person is hypothyroid. They might not have any ovulation at all, or they might have extreme and prolonged menstruation, and it's a very reliable treatment. For prolonged menstruation to just get the right amount of thyroid, you can usually turn off a hypothyroid excess menstruation in two days with a supplement.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding perimenopausal women experiencing prolonged periods and PMS, what can be done to help regulate their cycle and alleviate symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, usually in the U.S. it's a T3 such as Cytomel is a prescription.
**CONTEXT:** Is quick-acting thyroid generally a prescription?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's a purely synthetic, but it's exactly the same chemical that we make or would get from an animal.
**CONTEXT:** Is Cytomel derived from animals?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the body can exchange them. The fructose enters the glycolysis process almost the same place glucose does and then is oxidized the same way glucose is. A lot of doctors are saying that the brain... muscles and heart and such can't use fructose, but actually there is evidence that they do have the particular so-called fructose transporter or glucose transporter that that works for fructose so that the brain and heart can use fructose and Ketones are are good if you get them from fruit or vegetables such as potatoes but If you have to produce the ketones they are only produced under stress in the body and so They're good when you can get them, but you it's hard to make them yourself.
**CONTEXT:** Mark asks why burning sugar for fuel is healthier than burning ketones, and how fructose can be used by cells if they need glucose, and if the body converts fructose to glucose.

**RAY PEAT:** In 1954, a professor from the University of Guadalajara had an article in Prevention magazine describing his success using a purge for his laxative patients to get their intestine clean because that's something that's been known for probably 3,000 years that laxatives. are helpful for cancer patients because of the toxins produced in the intestine. He happened to use a cup of linseed oil or flax oil as the purge. It would rush right through and clean out the intestine. But until that time, Johanna Budwig had published as co-author a couple of articles. In a soap and fat journal and wasn't doing anything at all unconventional. But right after that article came out in Prevention magazine, she started developing her theory of the N-3 fats. My theory was that she had gone insane during that period when she stopped being a research associate. And shortly after that, several little booklets came out published by a Disney subsidiary in Europe describing her theory in very crazy terms. Anyone who's interested in doing her program should get a look at those books because they were... radically changed when they were presented in English, to make it sound much saner than they were. But her diet consisted of mostly cottage cheese, or the equivalent, curds. And because of the low iron content of cottage cheese, both milk and cottage cheese are very good protective foods. for people with cancer. Fruits and milk, because of the low iron content and low PUFA content, are good for cancer patients. But I think as far as the flax oil can work as a laxative, it's beneficial. But when it's working as a food... then it has the risk of suppressing your metabolism.
**CONTEXT:** John asks why the Budwig diet has success with omega-3 flaxseed oil when Ray Peat's work concludes unsaturated fatty acids are not good for us.

**RAY PEAT:** For one thing, we don't really need mineral transporters. People like Gilbert Ling, many years ago, showed the doctrine that the cell is enclosed in an impermeable or semi-permeable membrane. It simply isn't so. When they got isotopes that they could actually see the type of sodium atom that was being added to a system, they could demonstrate that the sodium atoms were freely moving in and out of cells, no barrier function at all at the surface. And this applies to all of the dissolved... minerals and other substances. There's just no barrier there to deal with. So that's the basic thing. We don't have any need for a mineral transporter because minerals move freely in and out.
**CONTEXT:** John asks about Hans Nieper's mineral transporters and why they are not discussed anymore.

**RAY PEAT:** Too much iodine is probably the problem. Too much iodine that can actually lower the thyroid? Yeah. How do you know what's a good amount of iodine? Well, I've got a list of I think it's 70 articles from around the world looking at the incidents of thyroid cancer and thyroiditis and they see that above half a milligram of iodine per day chronically increases the incidence of thyroid disease.
**CONTEXT:** Jesse is taking sulfur and iodine and notes their thyroid hormones have gone down. They ask if sulfur removes iodine and if they need extra Lugol's. They also ask how to know a good amount of iodine.

**RAY PEAT:** I think normalizing thyroid. It's the best thing. I had an experience with a woman who was, I think she was 40 at the time, and hadn't had any kids and wanted to get pregnant, and had a fibroid plugging the end of her uterus by the fallopian tubes about the size of a tennis ball. And I explained the physiology to her and got her confident. She knew what was happening and she adjusted taking enough thyroid that she could keep her estrogen level down with the other hormones up. And it happened that her pulse averaged about 110 per minute and her doctor told her she would die from keeping her pulse that fast but she had an ultrasound every month and every month that she kept her. Thyroid at that level, the fibroid shrank and I think it was around March or April that she started and by August the fibroid had disappeared and she was pregnant.
**CONTEXT:** A follower asks for suggestions on the best way to get rid of uterine fibroids, noting that enzymes have not worked.

**RAY PEAT:** No, generally it's not. Now we've already been told it is, like I've been exercising a lot. My pulse gets pretty, pretty low, just my resting pulse sometimes 50 or so because I do the rebounder. So that could actually be a sign of some kind of weakness? Yeah, very often it's hypothyroid, long distance runners. Oh, you mean low thyroid? Yeah, if you put a person on a treadmill and in one experiment they had them walk. So their pulse stayed about 120 beats per minute, and in less than an hour their blood showed almost no T3, the active hormone, and if a person is healthy, as soon as they catch their breath and rest for a day, their T3 is right back where it should be, but if there's anything wrong with their diet, just that moderate amount of exercise every day can push your thyroid lower and lower, and one of the ways that you might see a bad effect of a low pulse is if the distance between the top and the bottom blood pressure is very great. It should be no more than 50 points difference. And blood pressure difference, okay. Yeah, it's called pulse pressure. Okay. So the systolic minus the diastolic should be... 50 or less. But if it's less than 50, a low pulse is... Well, sometimes it goes with a big surge of pressure, like from a blood pressure diastolic of 60 to 120. That's a 60 point spread, which is more than desirable. Okay, so that would indicate perhaps a low thyroid. Yeah. And you'd want to get that. Checked out and maybe get that thyroid boosted up. So, so people that exercise a lot, it's not necessarily that their heart, but isn't your heart stronger if it's you're beating less per minute? Not necessarily. You can give a person an anti-thyroid drug and their heart rate will just go slower and slower. Low anti-thyroid. In other words, lower the... Lower the efficiency of the thyroid and your pulse slows down. Yeah, I've known people who had a 40 or 50 pulse at rest and who were really very miserable and when they got their pulse up to 70 or 80 at rest by taking thyroid, they felt much better.
**CONTEXT:** Is a slower pulse necessarily better?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can often do that just by diet, avoiding the foods that are blocking your thyroid function. Which are? Mostly, in America, it's mostly the polyunsaturated fats, but some people, I've known people who were eating a pure soy diet or a lot of raw cabbage and broccoli. And... those people, just stopping the diet for a week or two, popped right back so that... So the poofers in the soy, they're definitely anti-thyroid, but what about broccoli, cauliflower, the cruciferous, but if you cook them, are they okay? They're still slightly anti-thyroid, but some people don't have any problem with them. If a person wants to really... test what low thyroid is like, they can juice some cabbage or broccoli raw and drink a glass or two of that per day. And you can feel it.
**CONTEXT:** What foods block thyroid function, and are cruciferous vegetables problematic even when cooked?

**RAY PEAT:** The milk and orange juice.
**CONTEXT:** What are some things that boost thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, so-called. Most of the autoimmune things, the antibodies really are part of a recovery process. Okay. Anytime you injure a tissue, your immune system will try to eat up the junk and it treats the tissue as if it had been infected. So that's why they started calling it- So it's not the immune system attacking your thyroid. It's doing what it's supposed to do. Yeah, if you block the thyroid function for some reason, then you have to stimulate it more strongly with thyroid-stimulating hormone. And just that stimulation creates a type of inflammation. And if that goes on too long, for example, blocking it with too much iodine or too much PUFA or estrogen, then your immune system will come up in and clean up some of the junk.
**CONTEXT:** Ann asks about Hashimoto's, questioning if it's an overactive or autoimmune thyroid issue, and if the immune system is attacking the thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Usually some good tropical fruit and or orange juice and milk or cheese will get the thyroid back to normal functioning, but in the short run, a thyroid supplement, there have been studies where just giving even the synthetic thyroid for five or six months will correct the antibody problem. In the Hashimoto's uh-huh and then what if somebody has kind of hard time with casein or lactose can that be corrected if you'd like to try some cheese and milk? Um, yeah, there's no lactose in cheese. So if there's a lactose problem cheese will take care of it like a raw cheese Maybe raw grass-fed if you can Yeah, preferably without attitudes sure and then the casein and the milk Oh, um It's a good protein as many good features, but An even better protein is the the juice out of a potato in a Few extreme cases where a person had no digestion for any kind of ordinary protein If they juiced some raw potatoes and then cooked that juice They could instantly assimilate it And I'll be done Got over their sensitivities of those proteins.
**CONTEXT:** Ann, experiencing headaches before her period and following a paleo diet, asks for suggestions on balancing hormones. She also asks if casein or lactose intolerance can be corrected to consume dairy.

**RAY PEAT:** The that term can apply to testosterone progesterone dhe a thyroid Any of those but it is also applied to? Estrogen and it happens that the most dangerous of the estrogens estradiol is bioidentical so it doesn't make it safer whether it's synthetic or natural estrogen you still have to be very careful.
**CONTEXT:** A question is posed about bioidentical hormone replacement, including testing protocols and when to stop treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, well I already talked about that. It's a matter of stress. Anything that stresses you cannot turn on your production of ketones. So it's better to have some sugar in your diet so you don't have the stress that makes the ketones. But if you can get ketones from fruit and potatoes, for example, they're fine.
**CONTEXT:** What are Ray Peat's thoughts on the ketogenic diet, high fat, low carb, low protein?

**RAY PEAT:** A lot of people tell me they are doing that, but cream in the coffee is so good and it mixes nicely where the coconut oil and butter just float on the surface. So it probably does the same thing.
**CONTEXT:** What about bulletproof coffee, where coconut oil or butter is whipped into coffee?

**RAY PEAT:** That's the only thing I've used because I used to occasionally get some homemade coconut oil that was just delicious for making ice cream, coconut ice cream with fresh coconut. It's just a fantastic taste, but it happens to be allergenic if you have... any stress problems or digestive problems, it's better to use the refined deodorized coconut oil.
**CONTEXT:** What about refined bleached coconut oil or expeller-pressed coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** There have been studies of people 60 years, I think it was, after Hiroshima and 20 years after Chernobyl, in which they could still see inflammatory... processes in the blood could be traced to the radiation exposure and so it's really a lingering inflammation that you have to deal with. With that kind of radiation, nothing is actually placed in the body like with fallout. The stuff we're getting from Fukushima now is actual isotopes which stick in the body. Those are a different kind of problem but the... Lingering effect of external radiation puts you into an inflammatory state and all of the things we've been talking about, the good high energy foods, milk, cheese... Have to heal that. Yeah, keeping your thyroid function up activates the repair system which lowers inflammation and... anytime your energy falls, you move towards inflammation and so don't hyperventilate, do everything to keep your blood sugar steady and the inflammation will gradually subside. The anti-inflammatory hormones are all protective in their situation but basically diet and thyroid are...
**CONTEXT:** Brian asks for advice on overcoming radiation therapy damage.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, he's right about the fish oil. There's no evidence that it's an essential fat. Also, there's no evidence that I've seen that the PEOs do it either. It sounds good.
**CONTEXT:** William, a naturopathic doctor, asks about Brian Peskin's claims that omega-3s are unnecessary and that parent essential oils (PEOs) are better than fish oil.

**RAY PEAT:** The blood tests are often misinterpreted. You can see a reaction in the blood but sometimes it's just showing that the person tolerates, has been exposed to a food. It doesn't really correlate with the symptoms of allergy, so I think testing the food, leaving it out of your diet entirely for at least a week, if the symptoms go away then you can guess that you're allergic to it. But there's no real chemical test for the allergic reaction. And then an issue when you're sitting down and standing up, you got some kind of... high estrogen. Affects the nervous system so that your sympathetic side is weak and the parasympathetic is overactive and that's why women get varicose veins so much more often than men, especially around pregnancy. High estrogen weakens the wall of the vein. Progesterone tones up the veins. When the veins aren't returning the blood to the heart, when the blood falls into your legs, then your heart has to beat faster. And so progesterone and thyroid are the things needed to tone up the veins and return the blood to the heart so that the heart has a good strong beat.
**CONTEXT:** Catherine asks about the best way to test for food allergies and describes her symptoms of POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome).

**RAY PEAT:** My last few newsletters have been talking about the problems of stress. For example, learned helplessness, it's called learned despair of an animal. is restrained and doesn't have the experience of being able to escape. They might just, if they fall into a tank of water, might let themselves drown in two or three minutes where a normal rat with better experience would swim for days. That's from too much of the parasympathetic activity. I've been... working out some of the implications of what happens after middle age that are equivalent to learned helplessness, where the body has experienced so many problems that it can't deal with that it starts shifting too strongly to the parasympathetic. And when we go to bed at night, normally we don't need to expend a lot of energy. So the parasympathetic lowers our blood sugar, but after middle age, it can lower the blood sugar so much that then the other side of the nervous system reacts with surges of adrenaline and cortisol, and that's where the degenerative things come in, but they can be triggered by compulsive overactivity of the parasympathetic and vagus. Liver disease, for example, they found that they can prevent inflammation and fibrosis of the liver just by cutting the vagus nerve so it doesn't reach the liver. So you don't want to overstimulate the parasympathetic, and the Gulf War Syndrome, a lot of it had to do with exposure to ____. Organophosphate nerve gases, but people are being exposed to similar chemicals in insecticides or even in the airliners, which comes from the lubricants in the air pressurizing system, puts basically a little bit of nerve gas into the air. And all of these exposures are creating....an overactive vagus syndrome, so that many people in the general population have something like the Gulf War syndrome. Just from the chemicals. And the drugs that the Army used to treat nerve gas poisoning, atropine was the main drug. That can be used for... an extreme case of some of these stress-related learned helplessness syndromes.
**CONTEXT:** What are Ray Peat's recommendations for rebuilding or healing the vagus nerve and encouraging the parasympathetic system?

**RAY PEAT:** It's usually something in the intestine, not necessarily what you ate in this meal, but sometimes... what you ate yesterday or the day before will be farther down your intestine, and eating starts the peristalsis, and it moves an irritant down to a sensitive place in the intestine, and runny nose and sneezing are the main, most common symptoms, but that kind of stimulation in the intestine, animal experiments, and even... One doctor's experiments on his medical students showed that just pressure in the rectum or intestine can trigger migraine headaches, runny noses, and coughing and sneezing, and even epileptic seizures. Just from stimulating the intestine, but disturbed blood sugar intensifies the sensitivity of the intestine and makes those reactions worse.
**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying cause of severe allergies, runny nose, and sneezing that occur after a meal, and how can it be corrected?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's important to measure reverse T3 if you're going to measure the thyroid hormones at all. You can't interpret the T3 itself, which is the active hormone, unless you know how much reverse T3 there is because that can interfere with the active hormone. So you have to look at the ratio of active to reverse T3.
**CONTEXT:** Is there such a thing as thyroid resistance, with high reverse T3 that doesn't show up on blood tests?

**RAY PEAT:** That could be but when it lingers for a long time there could be several things. A nutritional deficiency might have been co-acting with the allergy and a lot of B vitamin deficiencies can make sores around the mouth and inflammation in the intestine can activate viruses. To break out inside the mouth or on the lips. So a food allergy is often responsible for a coated or cracked tongue for a lot of different mouth symptoms. The Benadryl lotions are antiseptic and soothing. Another ointment that you can get at a drugstore are benzocaine ointments. And similar local anesthetics, benzocaine happens to be antiseptic as well as anesthetic and will often clear up a little skin problem, whether it's a virus or germ or fungus, a benzocaine ointment can help.
**CONTEXT:** A person experienced mouth cracking and inflammation after eating peanuts, with a lab indicating fungus (Candida). They ask if it was simply a peanut allergy.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, people can email me through my...the website has my contact. But if a particular brand of thyroid doesn't work... I think it's good to change brands. Armor thyroid is fairly reliable. There's a synthetic called Proloid S, which is an old established brand that is available in many countries. Seno Plus is made by companies related to the ones that make cytomel. Seno Plus is very similar to Nature Throid and Armor, but being......synthetic, it lacks some of the potential allergens that the natural thyroid might have. So just trying different brands and otherwise changing the diet to make sure there's more of the metabolic promoters such as calcium and the anti-inflammatory foods.
**CONTEXT:** Lindsey is on 120 milligrams of Nature-Throid for low thyroid but still experiences symptoms and asks for help finding support.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are articles on my website about... related to diabetes and explaining how the unsaturated fats are an essential problem in causing diabetes, and sugar is not a problem and has been used as a cure. So, getting the right diet and making sure the thyroid function is optimized. Those are the basic things. Aspirin is... well-known to help to regulate blood sugar and lower inflammation problems associated with diabetes.
**CONTEXT:** What is the ideal diet for type 2 diabetes, what foods should be avoided, and should L-tryptophan for sleep be discontinued?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid and vitamin A are the basic things, but the... the skin and the intestine are very closely connected so that you want to make sure you aren't eating any foods that aren't well-digested or that irritate your intestine, because that can contribute to inflammatory and even problems with excretion of fats and sweat and so on. They can be influenced by irritation in the intestine.
**CONTEXT:** Stella has persistent acne despite saunas and chlorella smoothies and asks for solutions.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, niacin sometimes refers to nicotinic acid. Or even it's a slow release form. And nicotinic acid happens to increase your histamine, serotonin, and prostaglandins, all of which are inflammatory. And so I don't think it's good for anyone to take nicotinic acid, other than as it occurs in food. And niacinamide is a form of that same vitamin. That is active in cells and doesn't release those inflammatory problem material. So niacinamide is safe? Yeah. That's a B3, is that B3? Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Leis asks about using a far-infrared sauna with niacin for broken capillaries from rosacea.

**RAY PEAT:** Sometimes it does, but thyroid is the basic thing. The tryptophan and serotonin happen to turn on a trigger that increases prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone. They tend to go together. And if your thyroid doesn't respond adequately to the rising......thyroid-stimulating hormone, it isn't able to lower the prolactin. They're tied closely together and so a supplement of thyroid is sometimes needed. But without that, sometimes increasing the salt in your diet and using a vitamin B6 supplement, those can sometimes correct the prolactin. The B6 is involved in... correcting the tryptophan, serotonin metabolism so it doesn't cause the inflammation and hyperlactin.
**CONTEXT:** Brenda asks about natural ways to reverse high prolactin levels in women and if Progest E might help lower prolactin.

**RAY PEAT:** It's normal the whole thing that we've been talking about the Parasympathetic system increasing at night lowers your blood sugar. Okay, and that increases adrenaline and finally during the night it will increase your cortisol so that almost everyone has their highest cortisol of the day at dawn and that's because basically darkness is very stressful and cortisol is protecting us against all of those inflammatory stress processes that develop during the night and if you can keep the adrenaline and cortisol lower by what you eat at bedtime or even snack on during the night and having some fluid in the night helps to keep your blood thin and circulating so that you are less likely to have a stroke from the high cortisol when you wake up. The high cortisol and thickened blood are fairly dangerous in the morning so it's good to start with orange juice for example. To get some fluid and minerals into your blood in the morning. Yeah, and to get the cortisol down What would you drink in the middle of the night? Just water? That's better than nothing but if you're having a sleep problem then maybe juice or milk sugared milk and even chicken soup, something that... Oh really, maybe chicken broth. Yeah, a good chicken consommé with plenty of salt will lower your adrenaline. It lowers your adrenaline, the salt does. Yeah, it's good for the adrenals. Yeah, there have been studies on people with... old people with both hypertension and insomnia who are on a low salt diet. And low salt is very often responsible for... serious problems such as that. And again, foods then that lower adrenaline and cortisol at night would be? Oh, milk and honey or sugar, fruit, oranges, tropical fruits, gelatinous things such as consomme. Oh, a bone broth, like the Western Price bone broth stuff, that kind of thing? Well, you don't want to use marrow bones because the... high iron content. So, the joints that have the tendons and cartilage attached. Oh, just kind of leg bones and stuff like that. Or tailbone. Tailbones, but not the joints where they get all the... You do want the cartilage and the tendons. You don't want the hard bone with the marrow in it. Oh, you... Okay, you want the more... Joint, so you don't want the hard marrow bones. Yeah, so the tail is all joints, and so that's... Gotcha....very good. So chicken feet and stuff like that are good, but not shin bones and that that you give the dog. Those big hard bones, they have too much iron in the marrow? Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Carl, in his 70s, observed lower thyroid, testosterone, and muscle tone, with increased estrogen. He adopted a high-fat diet, which improved his energy and sleep but led to an adrenaline state and waking with a higher temperature and pulse. He asks what is happening and if he should avoid foods that stimulate insulin production in the morning. He also asks about ideal nighttime snacks to manage cortisol and adrenaline.
