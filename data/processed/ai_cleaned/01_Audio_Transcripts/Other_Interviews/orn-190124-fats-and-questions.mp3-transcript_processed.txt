**RAY PEAT:** "Any grain should be highly processed such as with lime or lime to degrade the toxins and just soaking a fresh grain if you soak it for a day or two that activates enzymes and turning it into basically a sprout then the toxins are reduced. The root and the shoot will have some toxins but the main, the worst toxins are in the seed itself."

**CONTEXT:** What is the best way to prepare grains to reduce their inherent toxins?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "So, if one wants to consume a good organic brown rice or something like that just soak it for 24 hours is the best way to do it before cooking it? Yeah, it loses some of its characteristic taste but it's a lot safer."

**CONTEXT:** Regarding grain preparation, is soaking for 24 hours before cooking the optimal method for safety?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with grains and leaves is that the plants produce these defensive toxins. And if a cow... ate those and didn't process them in some way, the cow would succumb to all of those toxins. But the cow has an extra stomach that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast process out those toxins. So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids. And our sugars into the blood that the plant material has been very detoxified. So you're getting all of those nutrients, multiply filtered, filtered before it gets into the bloodstream and from the bloodstream to the other, it's filtered again. So it's the most highly refined and refined food that we can get economically."

**CONTEXT:** What makes milk a superior food source compared to grains and leaves, considering plant toxins?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but even low-fat, pasteurized milk is still the best food available, even if it isn't organic and raw."

**CONTEXT:** Is pasteurized, low-fat milk still considered a beneficial food, even if not organic or raw?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The samples that I tried 30 or 40, 50 years ago always were chokingly rancid, dark color and deteriorated by oxygen because it's so highly polyunsaturated. I think it's a very toxic oil, but it does have the vitamin E in it. If you've refined it to any degree, then it is a source of vitamin E, but I think it's very dangerous because of how easily it gets rancid."

**CONTEXT:** What are the concerns with wheat germ oil?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Commercial lecithin generally ranges from yellow to brown to black, depending on how deteriorated it is. Commercial lecithin is pure white. It's the polyunsaturated fats turning to pre-yellow fat. It turns yellow right in the bottle."

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If the chickens have been fed good stuff. If they range in the pasture. And in Mexico people feed their chickens. Tortillas and such things, vegetables, fruits, tortillas, and let them eat bugs, then the eggs are very saturated. I've looked up the degree of polyunsaturated fats in eggs over the last, I think it was 80 years, and there's a tremendous, the commercial eggs are now mostly polyunsaturated fat. 100 years ago, they were extremely saturated."

**CONTEXT:** How does the diet of chickens affect the fatty acid profile of their eggs?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, and you want to check the box to see that they haven't given them flax or any of the omega-3. Because those make the egg taste fishy."

**CONTEXT:** When selecting eggs, what should one look for to avoid a fishy taste?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, fish oil, krill oil, fatty fish, people advocating salmon, but I stopped eating salmon 45 years ago, I guess. And then the various cooking oils, soy, corn, safflower oil. All of the highly unsaturated oils should be avoided perfectly."

**CONTEXT:** Which oils and fish should be avoided due to their high polyunsaturated fat content?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If the avocado oil comes from the seed, it's pretty saturated and safe. But if they use the whole fruit, that would be very unsaturated. So I think you shouldn't eat a lot of fresh avocados regularly."

**CONTEXT:** What are the concerns with avocado oil and fresh avocados regarding their fat content?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I use a little... olive oil for some foods, have quite a bit of butter for frying eggs, and for frying chicken wings, for example, saturated hydrogenated coconut oil is ideal."

**CONTEXT:** What are the preferred cooking oils for different applications?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Ghee. Oh, ghee. Yeah, that's fine. Fresh butter is just a way of concentrating the fat from butter, but I actually like the taste of fresh butter better than ghee, but ghee is nutritionally good."

**CONTEXT:** What is the opinion on ghee compared to fresh butter?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with TSH is that the medical profession practically totally ignores the factors that regulate TSH. When you're under stress, the stress hormones lower it, so you can look like you're hyperthyroid. You can have 0.005 on your TSH and seem to be a hyperthyroid person, but it could be your stress hormones lowering it. And if you don't measure the stress hormones and your T3, reverse T3 is also increased by those same stress hormones. So people are being diagnosed as hyperthyroid when they're extremely stressed and hypothyroid with very low real T3 relative to reverse T3. So you have to measure several things at the same time to know what the TSH means. I've never seen a person who really felt good whose TSH was as high as 2. 0.2 or 2.0 and people are healthiest when their TSH is 0.4 or less."

**CONTEXT:** What are the limitations of TSH as a sole indicator of thyroid function, and what is the optimal TSH range?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The thyroid is really the source of acid. There, you're back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen. It's named means the source of acid and thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid, and that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic, and the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production. to produce the hydrochloric acid, and so in ability to use oxygen and thyroid, it increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation, and so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion, including the acid."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between thyroid function, oxygen utilization, and stomach acid production?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "By the tests that were used up to 1940, easily 40% of the American population is hypothyroid. Just by the medical standards up to 1940, then the drug companies got involved, sold their phony tests like the protein bound iodine test. In the late 1940s, convinced everyone who had been taking thyroid, they showed normal on that test and so they stopped taking thyroid. Doctors taught everyone that the reason they're fat and lethargic is because of their bad character rather than low thyroid because the test showed they were normal. Twenty years later, that test was shown to be absolutely unrelated to thyroid function. So for 20 years, people were indoctrinated to believe that 95% of the population has good thyroid function, where it was a phony test, but on the basis of that belief that only 5% might be hypothyroid, the new test, TSH, is meaningfully related to thyroid, although ambiguously, but those new tests... were interpreted in terms of the 95% not needing thyroid, so no matter how good a test it is, if your assumptions are wrong, the test isn't going to do you any good."

**CONTEXT:** How have historical testing methods and industry influence affected the diagnosis and understanding of hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** "The adrenal gland is very good nutritionally. It contains pregnenolone and a small supplement of pregnenolone, if you can find a safe source, which I can't. But pregnenolone used to be a good reliable support for adrenal problems. But it's hard, you can't find a clean one."

**CONTEXT:** What are the nutritional benefits of adrenal glands, and what are the challenges in supplementing with pregnenolone?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The protein is okay. The hemp protein? Yeah, but you have the seed protein problem. It should be properly processed. Lime processing would make it more digestible. But the oils are highly unsaturated, so I think it's good to be very cautious with them. They're poofers."

**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations regarding hemp protein and hemp oils?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The high... polyunsaturated is the main problem. There are some good components but some bad. Most people who use the flaxseed as a laxative or bulk are absorbing very little of the substance. So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay. You aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff."

**CONTEXT:** What are the negative effects of flaxseeds, particularly when used as a laxative or for bulk?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people. Well-cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people. Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years. But then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots apparently."

**CONTEXT:** What are some safe and effective fiber sources?

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate. Sugar because calcium regulates everything and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid and people sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient but vitamin D part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone when you're low in calcium and vitamin D. The parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher and that causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level."

**CONTEXT:** What are the key supplements and dietary factors that support thyroid function and overall health, particularly when reducing thyroid medication?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "A quart or two of orange juice is very supportive to your thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended intake of orange juice for thyroid support?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What is the prevailing narrative regarding salt and sugar consumption?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there is a lot to that, but the particular practitioners, I think, drove it into the ground by trying to sell their particular treatments. But yeah, there are... various alternative forms and it relates to a bigger question. We actually have pleomorphic cells, stem cells in our tissues, which are pleomorphic in the sense that they are pluripotent. They can develop into what we need unless we're poisoning them with PUFA and heavy metals and radiation. And our tissues should be able to change form as needed. And incidentally, when you eat a particular food like beef or chicken or fruit, you are absorbing and integrating some of their DNA into your own structure. And that increases I think in the long run. our capacity to produce the changes that we need. We have only about five percent of our DNA is really in use. And we have that big reserve that we can draw on under stress."

**CONTEXT:** What is the perspective on pleomorphism, and how does it relate to cellular adaptability and DNA integration?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's, again, the adrenaline. Oh, the adrenaline. Yeah. And sugar and salt. Calcium, milk, milk and vitamin D are behind the thyroid function to keep your blood sugar steady."

**CONTEXT:** What is the likely cause of teeth chattering at night, and what dietary factors are involved in regulating adrenaline and thyroid function?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, you could eat fungal enzymes to break down cellulose and such, but the problem is that you get traces of the fungus along with the enzymes. So I think it's better to try to not break down cellulose in your intestine. The cellulose is having a good function to sort of sweep things along, help them. Not to be reabsorbed. Your liver excretes toxins into the bile and if you have fiber moving through your intestine, that will prevent that toxin being reabsorbed so you can excrete it."

**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations regarding digestive enzymes, particularly fungal enzymes, and the role of cellulose in the digestive tract?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The thyroid is really the source of acid. There, you're back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen.

**RAY PEAT:** "One gram of dehydrated gland is equal to 15 grains of thyroid. I knew someone who liked chicken necks when he worked on the farm. On the day they had chicken, he would eat five necks and he said that afternoon he was always too hot to work very well. He was getting about five grains in one meal, and that can make you overheat, so one grain would be 15, one gram of dehydrated beef thyroid would be equal to 15 grains of the medical."

**CONTEXT:** What is the potency of dehydrated thyroid gland compared to medical preparations, and what are the potential effects of consuming too much?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The equivalent, and doctors will often supply only thyroxine, only T4, and that will suppress your TSH down to zero, but you aren't necessarily getting any thyroid function from that because... It depends on good sugar supply and selenium for your tissues to convert T4 to the active T3. So, using a glandular thyroid or the equivalent such as Xenoplas or Tyrolar, you should think in terms of a healthy person being able to produce four grains. You can usually maintain a good function at two grains, but just in case symptoms show up, you shouldn't resist taking the full four grain supplement."

**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between T4 and glandular thyroid supplements, and what is the appropriate dosage for thyroid support?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you don't use the the marrow, avoid the long bones, use just the joints, so there's a lot of... cartilage and ligaments. Those are the source of the gelatin. Very little comes out of the bone itself."

**CONTEXT:** What are the best sources of collagen from bone broth, and which parts of the animal should be used?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Niacinamide raises your cellular... NAD, and that's what you want. But if you inject things intravenously, I think you're risking reactions unwrapped to the cell. Niacinamide is taken up and the cell does no harm in the cell, and it's converted to NAD so you can raise it in a safe way."

**CONTEXT:** What is the opinion on NAD-IV treatments, and what is the safer alternative for raising NAD levels?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on what's in your diet. Often people will include a green salad and whole grain bread and maybe legumes. Some things that are high in toxins, the number of people who are chronically sick because they're eating green salads, it's amazing. I've seen people get well from chronic problems just by leaving out their green salads."

**CONTEXT:** Are there any supplements that are universally recommended, and what are the potential issues with consuming green salads?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It's the defensive chemicals in the leaf. They aren't as intense as in the seed. But they are designed to block digestive enzymes in the grazers. Cows, goats and insects and worms and things that would eat their leaves get poisoned unless they, like a cow, have a rumen to detoxify those. And people don't have the detoxifying system and so their digestive enzymes are simply blocked by the chemicals in the grazers."

**CONTEXT:** What are the "defensive chemicals" in leafy greens, and how do they affect digestion?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The basic problem is usually that a low thyroid person has slow digestion and so foods are feeding bacteria in the intestine. Bacteria produce endotoxin and if your intestine is irritated and hypothyroid you absorb that endotoxin into the system along with some allergens and so the combination of low thyroid and slow digestion will help. cause various inflammatory degenerative processes and when you're low thyroid you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones and so if your cholesterol is very high that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA and I've seen... people supplement like a woman came visiting from Sweden to give lectures in Eugene and she had had I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because her all of her joints were getting so deformed. She spread progesterone. Over all of her body and spent two or three days in Eugene walking around seeing the sights with absolutely no joint pain."

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying cause of joint pain and inflammation, and how can progesterone supplementation help?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "People have experimented with that experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement watching what is happening with the glands output. They would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing and then they would stop the dosing and measure the return and it's almost immediate. I've seen people who... could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose. Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose, and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been. So I stopped taking it. The very next morning my neck was smooth. It had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces. So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed."

**CONTEXT:** What is the body's response when thyroid supplementation is stopped, and how quickly can the thyroid gland recover?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50 your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure. In 30 minutes, you can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right? Yeah, it has to be directly onto the skin."

**CONTEXT:** How does age affect the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight, and what are the optimal conditions for sun exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** "The PUFA's are the great enemy of thyroid and if we aren't allowed to get it in our natural chicken soup or fish soup then... we're dependent on getting it as a supplement and Armour made a great supplement for almost a hundred years then they sold their company to Revlon, the cosmetics company and the price went up about tenfold and in a series of sales the pills went from less than one cent each up to close to a dollar each, simply as a matter of financial arrangements but still Armour has gone with the new owners Armour has gone through a series of problems because they changed the formula added various junk to it, but insisted it hasn't changed because it's still called Armour Thyroid but since then... Other companies have taken over more or less the traditional Armour formula, but it depends on who they are getting their glandular material from. The Armour descendant Forest Pharmaceuticals said several years ago that they were using the raw material of the gland to extract......thirocalcitonin to regulate calcium. That used to be a part of the natural thyroid supplement. So now it's hard to know whether your thyroid glandular has been pre-extracted losing the calcitonin component. So since the 1990s, I've been using a product made in Mexico called Sino Plus which... imitates the Armour formula. The Armour company made a synthetic equivalent of the glandular and called it Cyrolar and that formula was exactly copied by a couple other companies, but Sino Plus continues to make the Armour equivalent in a synthetic form. When I started buying it. A hundred tablets cost 60 cents and now they're selling for about $20 for a bottle but still it's cheaper. The equivalent made in the U.S. is close to $100 for that many tablets."

**CONTEXT:** What has led to the scarcity and changes in thyroid medication like Armour Thyroid, and what are the alternatives?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were some studies in the 1980s of various things related to heart rate. They found that brain function closely corresponded to heart rate. They looked at kids in school and high school and saw that their grade average corresponded to their heart rate and that led them to look at people with pacemakers. They would give a person with a pacemaker set at 70 beats a mental test and then they would just turn the regulator up and give them an 85 per minute heart rate and their mental functions all improved. And there were studies that showed that if your blood pressure and heart rate increased every year a little bit on average you were doing well. So that was pretty cool. They saw that if for example at the age of 70 or so your pulse rate stopped increasing or even started decreasing those people didn't have a long life expectancy."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between heart rate, brain function, and longevity?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If your hands are cold as you're increasing your heart rate, that means you're running on adrenaline, which is not good. Your hands should be warm and your oral temperature shouldn't be too much above your hand temperature. Keeping your adrenaline low will let your heart rate... correspond to your metabolic rate and when you get your temperature up so that your temperature rises to about 98 when you wake up and then gets up to 98.5 or 6 or 7 when you're moving around, then your heart will have a corresponding increase in rate and that goes with... also an increased stroke volume of the heart so it delivers more blood per beat. If you're having high adrenaline or other stress hormones, your heart is going to have a short stroke, not deliver very much per beat and so it has to beat faster and that leads to inefficiency and tissue stress."

**CONTEXT:** How can one differentiate between a healthy increase in heart rate and one driven by adrenaline, and what are the indicators of optimal metabolic rate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when your metabolism is going at a good high rate, you're producing carbon dioxide in proportion to your oxygen consumption and the carbon dioxide has a relaxing constructive effect."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of carbon dioxide in a healthy metabolic state?

**RAY PEAT:** "Broder-Varnes spent most of his career up in Colorado at a high altitude. Where people were seldom overheated with with high humidity and in Eugene in the summer with Some days were very humid and hot. I found that hypothyroid people would come in with normal temperatures and I realized that even a dead person would have a fairly good temperature when the environmental temperature is very high, so I started. Looking at the pulse rate as well as the temperature and there were lots of experiments with the quality of brain function according to brain temperature as well as pulse rate and delivery of blood, glucose and oxygen to the brain. Someone devised sort of a heating pad integrated with a helmet so they could heat the head specifically. And again, they would give people mental tests, mental calculation and memory and so on. And they found that when they heated the head up to, I think, 101 degrees or slightly more, their mental abilities increased with each degree of warmer. And if you look at some fairly small brained... animals, if they have a high body temperature, like crows and parrots, run around with well over 105 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, with a very small brain, they're extremely intelligent. It isn't brain volume, it's a combination of brain volume plus the working temperature. The warmer you can stand... You don't want to force yourself to get warmer because your liver has to keep supplying a good stream of glucose and your lungs have to regulate the oxygen delivery efficiently. But if your system can stand it, the brain works better the warmer it is."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between body temperature, brain function, and intelligence, and how does environmental humidity affect temperature readings?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can't have cold hands and feet, except during stress. Emotional stress raises your adrenaline and will make your hands and feet and nose get cold. But if your thyroid is low, you experience stress almost all the time. So people run around doing their business with cold hands and feet, and wonder why they're... they're inefficient. If you're highly stressed, for example during the night, cortisol rises to a peak in the morning because your blood sugar is falling. Low thyroid people have extremely high cortisol in the morning, as well as sometimes adrenaline. That can make your morning temperature misleadingly warm, because the cortisol is tearing down your protein-y tissues to turn them into glucose. My gosh. And the adrenaline will make your skin cold to increase your core temperature so it can be misleading unless you check all of those things. The cortisol and adrenaline will show up as your increased morning temperature and heart rate. But then if you have some orange juice and milk, for example, a couple of hours later if your temperature and pulse rate are slower, the cortisol level will suddenly go down a third. That means you're under heavy stress during the night."

**CONTEXT:** What causes cold hands and feet, and how do stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline affect body temperature and metabolic indicators?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everything is less stressful when your thyroid is good. If we had a good thyroid medication possible, are you okay with with people doing that for a little bit to keep your thyroid up or you like to do other ways? I'll recommend other ways to get the thyroid just working good. Sure, unless you're eating a chicken neck soup or fish head soup every week, everyone really needs a certain amount of thyroid supplement by the time they're 30 or 40."

**CONTEXT:** Is thyroid supplementation necessary for most people over 30 or 40, and what are the alternatives to medication?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you're on a farm or where you get the... They're real good stuff, huh? Yeah, for a while at Safeway stores I found that chicken necks contained, about one in ten contained the whole thyroid gland. But when I mentioned that, everyone started buying it and Safeway stopped selling their necks because they didn't want to get in trouble with the agriculture department."

**CONTEXT:** What is the nutritional value of chicken necks, and why are they no longer readily available in some stores?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, here's an email Patrick and Adam have been recently discussing Dr. Emmanuel Rivisi and his use of the periodic table to correlate catabolic and anabolic imbalances in the body can Mr. P discuss how the thyroid might be an influence to those states and how we supplementing with thyroid extract could be possibly correct the imbalances uh... yeah Rivisi was very good on noticing the effect of the day-night cycle uh... and uh... uh... i uh... started thinking about that about forty or fifty years ago that you have to look at the hormones in context if your liver is in very good condition and your muscles are working right uh... your body should store several ounces maybe ten ounces of sugar which can be drawn on during the night if you didn't store your sugar efficiently because you were not producing lactic acid not producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid that wastes your sugar so during the night you run out of sugar and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol and you start breaking down your tissues Releasing whatever fat is stored and that's what causes bone loss during the night for example and if you can Keep your your body well stocked on sugar Then you can avoid that nighttime deterioration stress."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence anabolic and catabolic states, and what is the role of sugar storage in preventing nighttime tissue breakdown?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well stocked with sugar and how do we do that? And avoiding the proofer is the essential thing and eating adequate carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** How can one ensure adequate sugar storage, and what is the role of avoiding PUFAs and consuming adequate carbohydrate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Salt has a similar effect because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine and when you have too much pufa in your body that poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar and so in making... lactic acid from glucose, you use several times more glucose per minute than when you're making carbon dioxide. It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body. So within an hour or two of going to sleep, your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar. It turns on the stress hormones and so if you have... sometimes just a little salty snack will do it because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar more efficiently and lower stress hormones. For example, a tablespoon of sugar and a glass of milk could be honey will usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours. But you said actually a salty snack would do the same thing. Very often it does. I've seen people with hyperactive kids who never wanted to go to bed gave them a little bit of salty consummate or something and just write out like they've been given a shot of morphine or something."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which carbohydrates and salt can improve sleep, and how do PUFAs interfere with this process?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Good oranges are very important. Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially is from unripe oranges. And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges, they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect. So good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach. And coffee... the various brands vary, but coffee is always somewhat acidic and it's much easier on the stomach if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar. That kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it, the heavy cream? Yeah, makes it taste better and is much easier on the stomach and you absorb the caffeine more slowly."

**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations for consuming orange juice and coffee, and how can heavy cream and sugar improve their digestibility?

**RAY PEAT:** "Experimenters have produced aneurysms in as short a time as one hour giving the angiotensin hormone. You produce angiotensin when the kidneys aren't getting what they need. Kidneys send out signal renin which causes many tissues to produce angiotensin and the angiotensin converting enzymes. The inhibitors are used as drugs. That's one of the few drugs that has a logical basis. If you give an animal an overdose of angiotensin, it immediately damages the arteries so much that it has an aneurysm. If you block that angiotensin, you can reverse aneurysms. Simply restoring the energy to the blood vessels and you don't produce excess angiotensin if your kidneys are getting the blood supply they need, the nourishment they need.

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with grains and leaves is that the plants produce these defensive toxins. And if a cow... ate those and didn't process them in some way, the cow would succumb to all of those toxins. But the cow has an extra stomach that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast process out those toxins. So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids. And our sugars into the blood that the plant material has been very detoxified. So you're getting all of those nutrients, multiply filtered, filtered before it gets into the bloodstream and from the bloodstream to the other, it's filtered again.

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with TSH is that the medical profession practically totally ignores the factors that regulate TSH. When you're under stress, the stress hormones lower it, so you can look like you're hyperthyroid. You can have 0.005 on your TSH and seem to be a hyperthyroid person, but it could be your stress hormones lowering it. And if you don't measure the stress hormones and your T3, reverse T3 is also increased by those same stress hormones. So people are being diagnosed as hyperthyroid when they're extremely stressed and hypothyroid with very low real T3 relative to reverse T3. So you have to measure several things at the same time to know what the TSH means. I've never seen a person who really felt good whose TSH was as high as 2. 0.2 or 2.0 and people are healthiest when their TSH is 0.4 or less."

**CONTEXT:** What are the limitations of TSH as a sole indicator of thyroid function, and what is the optimal TSH range?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The thyroid is really the source of acid. There, you're back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen. It's named means the source of acid and thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid, and that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic, and the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production. to produce the hydrochloric acid, and so in ability to use oxygen and thyroid, it increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation, and so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion, including the acid."

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between thyroid function, oxygen utilization, and stomach acid production, and how does this relate to digestive issues with age?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "One gram of dehydrated gland is equal to 15 grains of thyroid. I knew someone who liked chicken necks when he worked on the farm. On the day they had chicken, he would eat five necks and he said that afternoon he was always too hot to work very well. He was getting about five grains in one meal, and that can make you overheat, so one grain would be 15, one gram of dehydrated beef thyroid would be equal to 15 grains of the medical."

**CONTEXT:** What is the potency of dehydrated thyroid gland compared to medical preparations, and what are the potential effects of consuming too much?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The equivalent, and doctors will often supply only thyroxine, only T4, and that will suppress your TSH down to zero, but you aren't necessarily getting any thyroid function from that because... It depends on good sugar supply and selenium for your tissues to convert T4 to the active T3. So, using a glandular thyroid or the equivalent such as Xenoplas or Tyrolar, you should think in terms of a healthy person being able to produce four grains. You can usually maintain a good function at two grains, but just in case symptoms show up, you shouldn't resist taking the full four grain supplement."

**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between T4 and glandular thyroid supplements, and what is the appropriate dosage for thyroid support?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you don't use the the marrow, avoid the long bones, use just the joints, so there's a lot of... cartilage and ligaments. Those are the source of the gelatin. Very little comes out of the bone itself."

**RAY PEAT:** "Niacinamide raises your cellular... NAD, and that's what you want. But if you inject things intravenously, I think you're risking reactions unwrapped to the cell. Niacinamide is taken up and the cell does no harm in the cell, and it's converted to NAD so you can raise it in a safe way."

**CONTEXT:** What is the opinion on NAD-IV treatments, and what is the safer alternative for raising NAD levels?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on what's in your diet. Often people will include a green salad and whole grain bread and maybe legumes. Some things that are high in toxins, the number of people who are chronically sick because they're eating green salads, it's amazing. I've seen people get well from chronic problems just by leaving out their green salads."

**CONTEXT:** Are there any supplements that are universally recommended, and what are the potential issues with consuming green salads?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It's the defensive chemicals in the leaf. They aren't as intense as in the seed. But they are designed to block digestive enzymes in the grazers. Cows, goats and insects and worms and things that would eat their leaves get poisoned unless they, like a cow, have a rumen to detoxify those. And people don't have the detoxifying system and so their digestive enzymes are simply blocked by the chemicals in the grazers."

**CONTEXT:** What are the "defensive chemicals" in leafy greens, and how do they affect digestion?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The basic problem is usually that a low thyroid person has slow digestion and so foods are feeding bacteria in the intestine. Bacteria produce endotoxin and if your intestine is irritated and hypothyroid you absorb that endotoxin into the system along with some allergens and so the combination of low thyroid and slow digestion will help. cause various inflammatory degenerative processes and when you're low thyroid you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones and so if your cholesterol is very high that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA and I've seen... people supplement like a woman came visiting from Sweden to give lectures in Eugene and she had had I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because her all of her joints were getting so deformed. She spread progesterone. Over all of her body and spent two or three days in Eugene walking around seeing the sights with absolutely no joint pain."

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying cause of joint pain and inflammation, and how can progesterone supplementation help?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "People have experimented with that experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement watching what is happening with the glands output. They would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing and then they would stop the dosing and measure the return and it's almost immediate. I've seen people who... could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose. Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose, and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been. So I stopped taking it. The very next morning my neck was smooth. It had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces. So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed."

**CONTEXT:** What is the body's response when thyroid supplementation is stopped, and how quickly can the thyroid gland recover?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate. Sugar because calcium regulates everything and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid and people sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient but vitamin D part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone when you're low in calcium and vitamin D. The parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher and that causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level."

**CONTEXT:** What are the key factors for boosting thyroid function while reducing reliance on thyroid medication, and what is the role of vitamin D, calcium, and sugar?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50 your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure. In 30 minutes, you can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right? Yeah, it has to be directly onto the skin."

**CONTEXT:** How does age affect the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight, and what are the optimal conditions for sun exposure?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Enough good sugar in the diet. That's why I recommend orange juice. A quart or two of orange juice is very supportive to your thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** What dietary components are crucial for supporting thyroid function, and what is the role of orange juice?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What is the general perception or marketing surrounding salt and sugar?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were some studies in the 1980s of various things related to heart rate. They found that brain function closely corresponded to heart rate. They looked at kids in school and high school and saw that their grade average corresponded to their heart rate and that led them to look at people with pacemakers. They would give a person with a pacemaker set at 70 beats a mental test and then they would just turn the regulator up and give them an 85 per minute heart rate and their mental functions all improved. And there were studies that showed that if your blood pressure and heart rate increased every year a little bit on average you were doing well. So that was pretty cool. They saw that if for example at the age of 70 or so your pulse rate stopped increasing or even started decreasing those people didn't have a long life expectancy."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between heart rate, brain function, and longevity?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If your hands are cold as you're increasing your heart rate, that means you're running on adrenaline, which is not good. Your hands should be warm and your oral temperature shouldn't be too much above your hand temperature. Keeping your adrenaline low will let your heart rate... correspond to your metabolic rate and when you get your temperature up so that your temperature rises to about 98 when you wake up and then gets up to 98.5 or 6 or 7 when you're moving around, then your heart will have a corresponding increase in rate and that goes with... also an increased stroke volume of the heart so it delivers more blood per beat. If you're having high adrenaline or other stress hormones, your heart is going to have a short stroke, not deliver very much per beat and so it has to beat faster and that leads to inefficiency and tissue stress."

**CONTEXT:** How can one differentiate between a healthy increase in heart rate and one driven by adrenaline, and what are the indicators of optimal metabolic rate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when your metabolism is going at a good high rate, you're producing carbon dioxide in proportion to your oxygen consumption and the carbon dioxide has a relaxing constructive effect."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of carbon dioxide in a healthy metabolic state?

**RAY PEAT:** "Broder-Varnes spent most of his career up in Colorado at a high altitude. Where people were seldom overheated with with high humidity and in Eugene in the summer with Some days were very humid and hot. I found that hypothyroid people would come in with normal temperatures and I realized that even a dead person would have a fairly good temperature when the environmental temperature is very high, so I started. Looking at the pulse rate as well as the temperature and there were lots of experiments with the quality of brain function according to brain temperature as well as pulse rate and delivery of blood, glucose and oxygen to the brain. Someone devised sort of a heating pad integrated with a helmet so they could heat the head specifically. And again, they would give people mental tests, mental calculation and memory and so on. And they found that when they heated the head up to, I think, 101 degrees or slightly more, their mental abilities increased with each degree of warmer. And if you look at some fairly small brained... animals, if they have a high body temperature, like crows and parrots, run around with well over 105 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, with a very small brain, they're extremely intelligent. It isn't brain volume, it's a combination of brain volume plus the working temperature. The warmer you can stand... You don't want to force yourself to get warmer because your liver has to keep supplying a good stream of glucose and your lungs have to regulate the oxygen delivery efficiently. But if your system can stand it, the brain works better the warmer it is."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between body temperature, brain function, and intelligence, and how does environmental humidity affect temperature readings?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can't have cold hands and feet, except during stress. Emotional stress raises your adrenaline and will make your hands and feet and nose get cold. But if your thyroid is low, you experience stress almost all the time. So people run around doing their business with cold hands and feet, and wonder why they're... they're inefficient. If you're highly stressed, for example during the night, cortisol rises to a peak in the morning because your blood sugar is falling. Low thyroid people have extremely high cortisol in the morning, as well as sometimes adrenaline. That can make your morning temperature misleadingly warm, because the cortisol is tearing down your protein-y tissues to turn them into glucose. My gosh. And the adrenaline will make your skin cold to increase your core temperature so it can be misleading unless you check all of those things. The cortisol and adrenaline will show up as your increased morning temperature and heart rate. But then if you have some orange juice and milk, for example, a couple of hours later if your temperature and pulse rate are slower, the cortisol level will suddenly go down a third. That means you're under heavy stress during the night."

**CONTEXT:** What causes cold hands and feet, and how do stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline affect body temperature and metabolic indicators?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everything is less stressful when your thyroid is good. If we had a good thyroid medication possible, are you okay with with people doing that for a little bit to keep your thyroid up or you like to do other ways? I'll recommend other ways to get the thyroid just working good. Sure, unless you're eating a chicken neck soup or fish head soup every week, everyone really needs a certain amount of thyroid supplement by the time they're 30 or 40."

**CONTEXT:** Is thyroid supplementation necessary for most people over 30 or 40, and what are the alternatives to medication?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you're on a farm or where you get the... They're real good stuff, huh? Yeah, for a while at Safeway stores I found that chicken necks contained, about one in ten contained the whole thyroid gland. But when I mentioned that, everyone started buying it and Safeway stopped selling their necks because they didn't want to get in trouble with the agriculture department."

**CONTEXT:** What is the nutritional value of chicken necks, and why are they no longer readily available in some stores?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, here's an email Patrick and Adam have been recently discussing Dr. Emmanuel Rivisi and his use of the periodic table to correlate catabolic and anabolic imbalances in the body can Mr. P discuss how the thyroid might be an influence to those states and how we supplementing with thyroid extract could be possibly correct the imbalances uh... yeah Rivisi was very good on noticing the effect of the day-night cycle uh... and uh... uh... i uh... started thinking about that about forty or fifty years ago that you have to look at the hormones in context if your liver is in very good condition and your muscles are working right uh... your body should store several ounces maybe ten ounces of sugar which can be drawn on during the night if you didn't store your sugar efficiently because you were not producing lactic acid not producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid that wastes your sugar so during the night you run out of sugar and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol and you start breaking down your tissues Releasing whatever fat is stored and that's what causes bone loss during the night for example and if you can Keep your your body well stocked on sugar Then you can avoid that nighttime deterioration stress."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence anabolic and catabolic states, and what is the role of sugar storage in preventing nighttime tissue breakdown?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well stocked with sugar and how do we do that? And avoiding the proofer is the essential thing and eating adequate carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** How can one ensure adequate sugar storage, and what is the role of avoiding PUFAs and consuming adequate carbohydrate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Salt has a similar effect because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine and when you have too much pufa in your body that poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar and so in making... lactic acid from glucose, you use several times more glucose per minute than when you're making carbon dioxide. It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body. So within an hour or two of going to sleep, your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar. It turns on the stress hormones and so if you have... sometimes just a little salty snack will do it because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar more efficiently and lower stress hormones. For example, a tablespoon of sugar and a glass of milk could be honey will usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours. But you said actually a salty snack would do the same thing. Very often it does. I've seen people with hyperactive kids who never wanted to go to bed gave them a little bit of salty consummate or something and just write out like they've been given a shot of morphine or something."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which carbohydrates and salt can improve sleep, and how do PUFAs interfere with this process?

**RAY PEAT:** "Good oranges are very important. Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially is from unripe oranges. And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges, they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect. So good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach. And coffee... the various brands vary, but coffee is always somewhat acidic and it's much easier on the stomach if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar. That kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it, the heavy cream? Yeah, makes it taste better and is much easier on the stomach and you absorb the caffeine more slowly."

**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations for consuming orange juice and coffee, and how can heavy cream and sugar improve their digestibility?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What is the general perception or marketing surrounding salt and sugar?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were some studies in the 1980s of various things related to heart rate. They found that brain function closely corresponded to heart rate. They looked at kids in school and high school and saw that their grade average corresponded to their heart rate and that led them to look at people with pacemakers. They would give a person with a pacemaker set at 70 beats a mental test and then they would just turn the regulator up and give them an 85 per minute heart rate and their mental functions all improved. And there were studies that showed that if your blood pressure and heart rate increased every year a little bit on average you were doing well. So that was pretty cool. They saw that if for example at the age of 70 or so your pulse rate stopped increasing or even started decreasing those people didn't have a long life expectancy."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between heart rate, brain function, and longevity?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If your hands are cold as you're increasing your heart rate, that means you're running on adrenaline, which is not good. Your hands should be warm and your oral temperature shouldn't be too much above your hand temperature. Keeping your adrenaline low will let your heart rate... correspond to your metabolic rate and when you get your temperature up so that your temperature rises to about 98 when you wake up and then gets up to 98.5 or 6 or 7 when you're moving around, then your heart will have a corresponding increase in rate and that goes with... also an increased stroke volume of the heart so it delivers more blood per beat. If you're having high adrenaline or other stress hormones, your heart is going to have a short stroke, not deliver very much per beat and so it has to beat faster and that leads to inefficiency and tissue stress."

**CONTEXT:** How can one differentiate between a healthy increase in heart rate and one driven by adrenaline, and what are the indicators of optimal metabolic rate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when your metabolism is going at a good high rate, you're producing carbon dioxide in proportion to your oxygen consumption and the carbon dioxide has a relaxing constructive effect."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of carbon dioxide in a healthy metabolic state?

**RAY PEAT:** "Broder-Varnes spent most of his career up in Colorado at a high altitude. Where people were seldom overheated with with high humidity and in Eugene in the summer with Some days were very humid and hot. I found that hypothyroid people would come in with normal temperatures and I realized that even a dead person would have a fairly good temperature when the environmental temperature is very high, so I started. Looking at the pulse rate as well as the temperature and there were lots of experiments with the quality of brain function according to brain temperature as well as pulse rate and delivery of blood, glucose and oxygen to the brain. Someone devised sort of a heating pad integrated with a helmet so they could heat the head specifically. And again, they would give people mental tests, mental calculation and memory and so on. And they found that when they heated the head up to, I think, 101 degrees or slightly more, their mental abilities increased with each degree of warmer. And if you look at some fairly small brained... animals, if they have a high body temperature, like crows and parrots, run around with well over 105 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, with a very small brain, they're extremely intelligent. It isn't brain volume, it's a combination of brain volume plus the working temperature. The warmer you can stand... You don't want to force yourself to get warmer because your liver has to keep supplying a good stream of glucose and your lungs have to regulate the oxygen delivery efficiently. But if your system can stand it, the brain works better the warmer it is."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between body temperature, brain function, and intelligence, and how does environmental humidity affect temperature readings?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can't have cold hands and feet, except during stress. Emotional stress raises your adrenaline and will make your hands and feet and nose get cold. But if your thyroid is low, you experience stress almost all the time. So people run around doing their business with cold hands and feet, and wonder why they're... they're inefficient. If you're highly stressed, for example during the night, cortisol rises to a peak in the morning because your blood sugar is falling. Low thyroid people have extremely high cortisol in the morning, as well as sometimes adrenaline. That can make your morning temperature misleadingly warm, because the cortisol is tearing down your protein-y tissues to turn them into glucose. My gosh. And the adrenaline will make your skin cold to increase your core temperature so it can be misleading unless you check all of those things. The cortisol and adrenaline will show up as your increased morning temperature and heart rate. But then if you have some orange juice and milk, for example, a couple of hours later if your temperature and pulse rate are slower, the cortisol level will suddenly go down a third. That means you're under heavy stress during the night."

**CONTEXT:** What causes cold hands and feet, and how do stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline affect body temperature and metabolic indicators?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everything is less stressful when your thyroid is good. If we had a good thyroid medication possible, are you okay with with people doing that for a little bit to keep your thyroid up or you like to do other ways? I'll recommend other ways to get the thyroid just working good. Sure, unless you're eating a chicken neck soup or fish head soup every week, everyone really needs a certain amount of thyroid supplement by the time they're 30 or 40."

**CONTEXT:** Is thyroid supplementation necessary for most people over 30 or 40, and what are the alternatives to medication?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you're on a farm or where you get the... They're real good stuff, huh? Yeah, for a while at Safeway stores I found that chicken necks contained, about one in ten contained the whole thyroid gland. But when I mentioned that, everyone started buying it and Safeway stopped selling their necks because they didn't want to get in trouble with the agriculture department."

**CONTEXT:** What is the nutritional value of chicken necks, and why are they no longer readily available in some stores?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, here's an email Patrick and Adam have been recently discussing Dr. Emmanuel Rivisi and his use of the periodic table to correlate catabolic and anabolic imbalances in the body can Mr. P discuss how the thyroid might be an influence to those states and how we supplementing with thyroid extract could be possibly correct the imbalances uh... yeah Rivisi was very good on noticing the effect of the day-night cycle uh... and uh... uh... i uh... started thinking about that about forty or fifty years ago that you have to look at the hormones in context if your liver is in very good condition and your muscles are working right uh... your body should store several ounces maybe ten ounces of sugar which can be drawn on during the night if you didn't store your sugar efficiently because you were not producing lactic acid not producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid that wastes your sugar so during the night you run out of sugar and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol and you start breaking down your tissues Releasing whatever fat is stored and that's what causes bone loss during the night for example and if you can Keep your your body well stocked on sugar Then you can avoid that nighttime deterioration stress."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence anabolic and catabolic states, and what is the role of sugar storage in preventing nighttime tissue breakdown?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well stocked with sugar and how do we do that? And avoiding the proofer is the essential thing and eating adequate carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** How can one ensure adequate sugar storage, and what is the role of avoiding PUFAs and consuming adequate carbohydrate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Salt has a similar effect because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine and when you have too much pufa in your body that poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar and so in making... lactic acid from glucose, you use several times more glucose per minute than when you're making carbon dioxide. It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body. So within an hour or two of going to sleep, your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar. It turns on the stress hormones and so if you have... sometimes just a little salty snack will do it because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar more efficiently and lower stress hormones. For example, a tablespoon of sugar and a glass of milk could be honey will usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours. But you said actually a salty snack would do the same thing. Very often it does. I've seen people with hyperactive kids who never wanted to go to bed gave them a little bit of salty consummate or something and just write out like they've been given a shot of morphine or something."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which carbohydrates and salt can improve sleep, and how do PUFAs interfere with this process?

**RAY PEAT:** "Good oranges are very important. Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially is from unripe oranges. And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges, they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect. So good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach. And coffee... the various brands vary, but coffee is always somewhat acidic and it's much easier on the stomach if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar. That kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it, the heavy cream? Yeah, makes it taste better and is much easier on the stomach and you absorb the caffeine more slowly."

**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations for consuming orange juice and coffee, and how can heavy cream and sugar improve their digestibility?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, cheese and eggs and milk and occasional shellfish. I think the average person benefits from having liver two or three times a month because so many of the foods are unreliable for nutritional content."

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of consuming dairy, eggs, milk, shellfish, and liver?

**RAY PEAT:** "The cosmetics companies have caught on to the fact that old people's free cholesterol decreases tremendously. The skin aging is basically a cholesterol deficiency syndrome, the way Alzheimer's disease gets the fatty acid. Ester, which is toxic, but the real cholesterol is down by about 50% in aged skin. The cosmetics companies are building on experiments which showed that if you add cholesterol to the skin, it restores the cell function, live cells come back, the dead, flaky cells aren't produced when there's adequate cholesterol. Actually adding cholesterol to the cosmetic creams and that biologically is very appropriate because the reason old people need more vitamin D is because vitamin D is made when sunlight hits the cholesterol in the skin and if you're old, the skin has only half as much cholesterol as a young person so you produce half as much vitamin D. So an old person... They need twice as much sunlight as a young person."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cholesterol in skin aging and vitamin D synthesis, and how do cosmetic companies utilize this knowledge?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were studies in the U.S., too, in which people in rest homes and such, they looked at their cholesterol and checked how long they lived. 250, 260 were the longest living. It's the same idea. If you look at how much progesterone an ovary produces, it's exactly proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary. Same with your adrenals and brain, any tissue. It makes its hormones like DHEA, pregmenolone and progesterone by converting. Cholesterol straight into the steroid hormone and to do that thyroid is the catalyst."

**CONTEXT:** What is the correlation between higher cholesterol levels and longevity, and how does cholesterol relate to hormone production?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, 180 is good for a middle aged person but by the time a person is 50 according to the Framingham study, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is higher in people who are not over 200 in their cholesterol."

**CONTEXT:** What are the optimal cholesterol levels for preventing Alzheimer's disease, particularly in older adults?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Experimenters have produced aneurysms in as short a time as one hour giving the angiotensin hormone. You produce angiotensin when the kidneys aren't getting what they need. Kidneys send out signal renin which causes many tissues to produce angiotensin and the angiotensin converting enzymes. The inhibitors are used as drugs. That's one of the few drugs that has a logical basis. If you give an animal an overdose of angiotensin, it immediately damages the arteries so much that it has an aneurysm. If you block that angiotensin, you can reverse aneurysms. Simply restoring the energy to the blood vessels and you don't produce excess angiotensin if your kidneys are getting the blood supply they need, the nourishment they need. And so thyroid and a diet adequate and free of PUFA is what keeps your kidneys getting the nutrients they need so they don't raise your angiotensin."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism behind aneurysms and strokes, and how do thyroid function and a PUFA-free diet play a role in preventing them?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and salt is another thing that guarantees adequate blood volume perfusing the kidneys so they don't produce those toxic angiotensin reactants. Salt lowers your aldosterone. Produced by the adrenals and aldosterone works parallel to the amphetensin causing tissue degeneration. There are now drugs coming out to lower or oppose aldosterone to protect the failing heart. High aldosterone is produced by chronic deficiency of sodium in your diet and aldosterone causes fibrosis. It causes aging of all of the tissues but the heart is usually the first one that shows up the effect as heart failure. So the low sodium diet is one of the most dangerous things."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of salt in kidney function and blood pressure regulation, and why is a low-sodium diet considered dangerous?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, even a fourth of a teaspoon is very helpful."

**CONTEXT:** What is a beneficial amount of salt to consume, particularly before sleep?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with grains and leaves is that the plants produce these defensive toxins. And if a cow... ate those and didn't process them in some way, the cow would succumb to all of those toxins. But the cow has an extra stomach that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast process out those toxins. So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids. And our sugars into the blood that the plant material has been very detoxified. So you're getting all of those nutrients, multiply filtered, filtered before it gets into the bloodstream and from the bloodstream to the other, it's filtered again. So it's the most highly refined and refined food that we can get economically."

**CONTEXT:** What makes milk a superior food source compared to grains and leaves, considering plant toxins?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but even low-fat, pasteurized milk is still the best food available, even if it isn't organic and raw."

**CONTEXT:** Is pasteurized, low-fat milk still considered a beneficial food, even if not organic or raw?

**RAY PEAT:** "The samples that I tried 30 or 40, 50 years ago always were chokingly rancid, dark color and deteriorated by oxygen because it's so highly polyunsaturated. I think it's a very toxic oil, but it does have the vitamin E in it. If you've refined it to any degree, then it is a source of vitamin E, but I think it's very dangerous because of how easily it gets rancid."

**CONTEXT:** What are the concerns with wheat germ oil?

**CONTEXT:** How does the diet of chickens affect the fatty acid profile of their eggs?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, and you want to check the box to see that they haven't given them flax or any of the omega-3. Because those make the egg taste fishy."

**CONTEXT:** When selecting eggs, what should one look for to avoid a fishy taste?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, fish oil, krill oil, fatty fish, people advocating salmon, but I stopped eating salmon 45 years ago, I guess. And then the various cooking oils, soy, corn, safflower oil. All of the highly unsaturated oils should be avoided perfectly."

**CONTEXT:** Which oils and fish should be avoided due to their high polyunsaturated fat content?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50 your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure. In 30 minutes, you can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right? Yeah, it has to be directly onto the skin."

**CONTEXT:** How does age affect the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight, and what are the optimal conditions for sun exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** What is the general perception or marketing surrounding salt and sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were some studies in the 1980s of various things related to heart rate. They found that brain function closely corresponded to heart rate. They looked at kids in school and high school and saw that their grade average corresponded to their heart rate and that led them to look at people with pacemakers. They would give a person with a pacemaker set at 70 beats a mental test and then they would just turn the regulator up and give them an 85 per minute heart rate and their mental functions all improved. And there were studies that showed that if your blood pressure and heart rate increased every year a little bit on average you were doing well. So that was pretty cool. They saw that if for example at the age of 70 or so your pulse rate stopped increasing or even started decreasing those people didn't have a long life expectancy."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between heart rate, brain function, and longevity?

**RAY PEAT:** "If your hands are cold as you're increasing your heart rate, that means you're running on adrenaline, which is not good. Your hands should be warm and your oral temperature shouldn't be too much above your hand temperature. Keeping your adrenaline low will let your heart rate... correspond to your metabolic rate and when you get your temperature up so that your temperature rises to about 98 when you wake up and then gets up to 98.5 or 6 or 7 when you're moving around, then your heart will have a corresponding increase in rate and that goes with... also an increased stroke volume of the heart so it delivers more blood per beat. If you're having high adrenaline or other stress hormones, your heart is going to have a short stroke, not deliver very much per beat and so it has to beat faster and that leads to inefficiency and tissue stress."

**CONTEXT:** How can one differentiate between a healthy increase in heart rate and one driven by adrenaline, and what are the indicators of optimal metabolic rate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when your metabolism is going at a good high rate, you're producing carbon dioxide in proportion to your oxygen consumption and the carbon dioxide has a relaxing constructive effect."

**RAY PEAT:** "Broder-Varnes spent most of his career up in Colorado at a high altitude. Where people were seldom overheated with with high humidity and in Eugene in the summer with Some days were very humid and hot. I found that hypothyroid people would come in with normal temperatures and I realized that even a dead person would have a fairly good temperature when the environmental temperature is very high, so I started. Looking at the pulse rate as well as the temperature and there were lots of experiments with the quality of brain function according to brain temperature as well as pulse rate and delivery of blood, glucose and oxygen to the brain. Someone devised sort of a heating pad integrated with a helmet so they could heat the head specifically. And again, they would give people mental tests, mental calculation and memory and so on. And they found that when they heated the head up to, I think, 101 degrees or slightly more, their mental abilities increased with each degree of warmer. And if you look at some fairly small brained... animals, if they have a high body temperature, like crows and parrots, run around with well over 105 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, with a very small brain, they're extremely intelligent. It isn't brain volume, it's a combination of brain volume plus the working temperature. The warmer you can stand... You don't want to force yourself to get warmer because your liver has to keep supplying a good stream of glucose and your lungs have to regulate the oxygen delivery efficiently. But if your system can stand it, the brain works better the warmer it is."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between body temperature, brain function, and intelligence, and how does environmental humidity affect temperature readings?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can't have cold hands and feet, except during stress. Emotional stress raises your adrenaline and will make your hands and feet and nose get cold. But if your thyroid is low, you experience stress almost all the time. So people run around doing their business with cold hands and feet, and wonder why they're... they're inefficient. If you're highly stressed, for example during the night, cortisol rises to a peak in the morning because your blood sugar is falling. Low thyroid people have extremely high cortisol in the morning, as well as sometimes adrenaline. That can make your morning temperature misleadingly warm, because the cortisol is tearing down your protein-y tissues to turn them into glucose. My gosh. And the adrenaline will make your skin cold to increase your core temperature so it can be misleading unless you check all of those things. The cortisol and adrenaline will show up as your increased morning temperature and heart rate. But then if you have some orange juice and milk, for example, a couple of hours later if your temperature and pulse rate are slower, the cortisol level will suddenly go down a third. That means you're under heavy stress during the night."

**CONTEXT:** What causes cold hands and feet, and how do stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline affect body temperature and metabolic indicators?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everything is less stressful when your thyroid is good. If we had a good thyroid medication possible, are you okay with with people doing that for a little bit to keep your thyroid up or you like to do other ways? I'll recommend other ways to get the thyroid just working good. Sure, unless you're eating a chicken neck soup or fish head soup every week, everyone really needs a certain amount of thyroid supplement by the time they're 30 or 40."

**CONTEXT:** Is thyroid supplementation necessary for most people over 30 or 40, and what are the alternatives to medication?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you're on a farm or where you get the... They're real good stuff, huh? Yeah, for a while at Safeway stores I found that chicken necks contained, about one in ten contained the whole thyroid gland. But when I mentioned that, everyone started buying it and Safeway stopped selling their necks because they didn't want to get in trouble with the agriculture department."

**CONTEXT:** What is the nutritional value of chicken necks, and why are they no longer readily available in some stores?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, here's an email Patrick and Adam have been recently discussing Dr. Emmanuel Rivisi and his use of the periodic table to correlate catabolic and anabolic imbalances in the body can Mr. P discuss how the thyroid might be an influence to those states and how we supplementing with thyroid extract could be possibly correct the imbalances uh... yeah Rivisi was very good on noticing the effect of the day-night cycle uh... and uh... uh... i uh... started thinking about that about forty or fifty years ago that you have to look at the hormones in context if your liver is in very good condition and your muscles are working right uh... your body should store several ounces maybe ten ounces of sugar which can be drawn on during the night if you didn't store your sugar efficiently because you were not producing lactic acid not producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid that wastes your sugar so during the night you run out of sugar and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol and you start breaking down your tissues Releasing whatever fat is stored and that's what causes bone loss during the night for example and if you can Keep your your body well stocked on sugar Then you can avoid that nighttime deterioration stress."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence anabolic and catabolic states, and what is the role of sugar storage in preventing nighttime tissue breakdown?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well stocked with sugar and how do we do that? And avoiding the proofer is the essential thing and eating adequate carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** How can one ensure adequate sugar storage, and what is the role of avoiding PUFAs and consuming adequate carbohydrate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Salt has a similar effect because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine and when you have too much pufa in your body that poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar and so in making... lactic acid from glucose, you use several times more glucose per minute than when you're making carbon dioxide. It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body. So within an hour or two of going to sleep, your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar. It turns on the stress hormones and so if you have... sometimes just a little salty snack will do it because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar more efficiently and lower stress hormones. For example, a tablespoon of sugar and a glass of milk could be honey will usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours. But you said actually a salty snack would do the same thing. Very often it does. I've seen people with hyperactive kids who never wanted to go to bed gave them a little bit of salty consummate or something and just write out like they've been given a shot of morphine or something."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which carbohydrates and salt can improve sleep, and how do PUFAs interfere with this process?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Good oranges are very important. Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially is from unripe oranges. And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges, they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect. So good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach. And coffee... the various brands vary, but coffee is always somewhat acidic and it's much easier on the stomach if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar. That kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it, the heavy cream? Yeah, makes it taste better and is much easier on the stomach and you absorb the caffeine more slowly."

**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations for consuming orange juice and coffee, and how can heavy cream and sugar improve their digestibility?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, cheese and eggs and milk and occasional shellfish. I think the average person benefits from having liver two or three times a month because so many of the foods are unreliable for nutritional content."

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of consuming dairy, eggs, milk, shellfish, and liver?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The cosmetics companies have caught on to the fact that old people's free cholesterol decreases tremendously. The skin aging is basically a cholesterol deficiency syndrome, the way Alzheimer's disease gets the fatty acid. Ester, which is toxic, but the real cholesterol is down by about 50% in aged skin. The cosmetics companies are building on experiments which showed that if you add cholesterol to the skin, it restores the cell function, live cells come back, the dead, flaky cells aren't produced when there's adequate cholesterol. Actually adding cholesterol to the cosmetic creams and that biologically is very appropriate because the reason old people need more vitamin D is because vitamin D is made when sunlight hits the cholesterol in the skin and if you're old, the skin has only half as much cholesterol as a young person so you produce half as much vitamin D. So an old person... They need twice as much sunlight as a young person."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cholesterol in skin aging and vitamin D synthesis, and how do cosmetic companies utilize this knowledge?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were studies in the U.S., too, in which people in rest homes and such, they looked at their cholesterol and checked how long they lived. 250, 260 were the longest living. It's the same idea. If you look at how much progesterone an ovary produces, it's exactly proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary. Same with your adrenals and brain, any tissue. It makes its hormones like DHEA, pregmenolone and progesterone by converting. Cholesterol straight into the steroid hormone and to do that thyroid is the catalyst."

**CONTEXT:** What is the correlation between higher cholesterol levels and longevity, and how does cholesterol relate to hormone production?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, 180 is good for a middle aged person but by the time a person is 50 according to the Framingham study, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is higher in people who are not over 200 in their cholesterol."

**CONTEXT:** What are the optimal cholesterol levels for preventing Alzheimer's disease, particularly in older adults?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Experimenters have produced aneurysms in as short a time as one hour giving the angiotensin hormone. You produce angiotensin when the kidneys aren't getting what they need. Kidneys send out signal renin which causes many tissues to produce angiotensin and the angiotensin converting enzymes. The inhibitors are used as drugs. That's one of the few drugs that has a logical basis. If you give an animal an overdose of angiotensin, it immediately damages the arteries so much that it has an aneurysm. If you block that angiotensin, you can reverse aneurysms. Simply restoring the energy to the blood vessels and you don't produce excess angiotensin if your kidneys are getting the blood supply they need, the nourishment they need. And so thyroid and a diet adequate and free of PUFA is what keeps your kidneys getting the nutrients they need so they don't raise your angiotensin."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism behind aneurysms and strokes, and how do thyroid function and a PUFA-free diet play a role in preventing them?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and salt is another thing that guarantees adequate blood volume perfusing the kidneys so they don't produce those toxic angiotensin reactants. Salt lowers your aldosterone. Produced by the adrenals and aldosterone works parallel to the amphetensin causing tissue degeneration. There are now drugs coming out to lower or oppose aldosterone to protect the failing heart. High aldosterone is produced by chronic deficiency of sodium in your diet and aldosterone causes fibrosis. It causes aging of all of the tissues but the heart is usually the first one that shows up the effect as heart failure. So the low sodium diet is one of the most dangerous things."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of salt in kidney function and blood pressure regulation, and why is a low-sodium diet considered dangerous?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, even a fourth of a teaspoon is very helpful."

**CONTEXT:** What is a beneficial amount of salt to consume, particularly before sleep?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with grains and leaves is that the plants produce these defensive toxins. And if a cow... ate those and didn't process them in some way, the cow would succumb to all of those toxins. But the cow has an extra stomach that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast process out those toxins. So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids. And our sugars into the blood that the plant material has been very detoxified. So you're getting all of those nutrients, multiply filtered, filtered before it gets into the bloodstream and from the bloodstream to the other, it's filtered again. So it's the most highly refined and refined food that we can get economically."

**CONTEXT:** What makes milk a superior food source compared to grains and leaves, considering plant toxins?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but even low-fat, pasteurized milk is still the best food available, even if it isn't organic and raw."

**CONTEXT:** Is pasteurized, low-fat milk still considered a beneficial food, even if not organic or raw?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The samples that I tried 30 or 40, 50 years ago always were chokingly rancid, dark color and deteriorated by oxygen because it's so highly polyunsaturated. I think it's a very toxic oil, but it does have the vitamin E in it. If you've refined it to any degree, then it is a source of vitamin E, but I think it's very dangerous because of how easily it gets rancid."

**CONTEXT:** What are the concerns with wheat germ oil?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Commercial lecithin generally ranges from yellow to brown to black, depending on how deteriorated it is. Commercial lecithin is pure white. It's the polyunsaturated fats turning to pre-yellow fat. It turns yellow right in the bottle."

**CONTEXT:** What is the issue with commercial lecithin and its color variations?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If the chickens have been fed good stuff. If they range in the pasture. And in Mexico people feed their chickens. Tortillas and such things, vegetables, fruits, tortillas, and let them eat bugs, then the eggs are very saturated. I've looked up the degree of polyunsaturated fats in eggs over the last, I think it was 80 years, and there's a tremendous, the commercial eggs are now mostly polyunsaturated fat. 100 years ago, they were extremely saturated."

**CONTEXT:** How does the diet of chickens affect the fatty acid profile of their eggs?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, and you want to check the box to see that they haven't given them flax or any of the omega-3. Because those make the egg taste fishy."

**CONTEXT:** When selecting eggs, what should one look for to avoid a fishy taste?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, fish oil, krill oil, fatty fish, people advocating salmon, but I stopped eating salmon 45 years ago, I guess. And then the various cooking oils, soy, corn, safflower oil. All of the highly unsaturated oils should be avoided perfectly."

**CONTEXT:** Which oils and fish should be avoided due to their high polyunsaturated fat content?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If the avocado oil comes from the seed, it's pretty saturated and safe. But if they use the whole fruit, that would be very unsaturated. So I think you shouldn't eat a lot of fresh avocados regularly."

**CONTEXT:** What are the concerns with avocado oil and fresh avocados regarding their fat content?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I use a little... olive oil for some foods, have quite a bit of butter for frying eggs, and for frying chicken wings, for example, saturated hydrogenated coconut oil is ideal."

**CONTEXT:** What are the preferred cooking oils for different applications?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Ghee. Oh, ghee. Yeah, that's fine. Fresh butter is just a way of concentrating the fat from butter, but I actually like the taste of fresh butter better than ghee, but ghee is nutritionally good."

**CONTEXT:** What is the opinion on ghee compared to fresh butter?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with TSH is that the medical profession practically totally ignores the factors that regulate TSH. When you're under stress, the stress hormones lower it, so you can look like you're hyperthyroid. You can have 0.005 on your TSH and seem to be a hyperthyroid person, but it could be your stress hormones lowering it. And if you don't measure the stress hormones and your T3, reverse T3 is also increased by those same stress hormones. So people are being diagnosed as hyperthyroid when they're extremely stressed and hypothyroid with very low real T3 relative to reverse T3. So you have to measure several things at the same time to know what the TSH means. I've never seen a person who really felt good whose TSH was as high as 2. 0.2 or 2.0 and people are healthiest when their TSH is 0.4 or less."

**CONTEXT:** What are the limitations of TSH as a sole indicator of thyroid function, and what is the optimal TSH range?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The thyroid is really the source of acid. There, you're back to the thyroid again. Yeah, oxygen. It's named means the source of acid and thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid, and that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic, and the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production. to produce the hydrochloric acid, and so in ability to use oxygen and thyroid, it increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation, and so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion, including the acid."

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between thyroid function, oxygen utilization, and stomach acid production, and how does this relate to digestive issues with age?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "One gram of dehydrated gland is equal to 15 grains of thyroid. I knew someone who liked chicken necks when he worked on the farm. On the day they had chicken, he would eat five necks and he said that afternoon he was always too hot to work very well. He was getting about five grains in one meal, and that can make you overheat, so one grain would be 15, one gram of dehydrated beef thyroid would be equal to 15 grains of the medical."

**CONTEXT:** What is the potency of dehydrated thyroid gland compared to medical preparations, and what are the potential effects of consuming too much?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The equivalent, and doctors will often supply only thyroxine, only T4, and that will suppress your TSH down to zero, but you aren't necessarily getting any thyroid function from that because... It depends on good sugar supply and selenium for your tissues to convert T4 to the active T3. So, using a glandular thyroid or the equivalent such as Xenoplas or Tyrolar, you should think in terms of a healthy person being able to produce four grains. You can usually maintain a good function at two grains, but just in case symptoms show up, you shouldn't resist taking the full four grain supplement."

**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between T4 and glandular thyroid supplements, and what is the appropriate dosage for thyroid support?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you don't use the the marrow, avoid the long bones, use just the joints, so there's a lot of... cartilage and ligaments. Those are the source of the gelatin. Very little comes out of the bone itself."

**CONTEXT:** What are the best sources of collagen from bone broth, and which parts of the animal should be used?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Niacinamide raises your cellular... NAD, and that's what you want. But if you inject things intravenously, I think you're risking reactions unwrapped to the cell. Niacinamide is taken up and the cell does no harm in the cell, and it's converted to NAD so you can raise it in a safe way."

**CONTEXT:** What is the opinion on NAD-IV treatments, and what is the safer alternative for raising NAD levels?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on what's in your diet. Often people will include a green salad and whole grain bread and maybe legumes. Some things that are high in toxins, the number of people who are chronically sick because they're eating green salads, it's amazing. I've seen people get well from chronic problems just by leaving out their green salads."

**CONTEXT:** Are there any supplements that are universally recommended, and what are the potential issues with consuming green salads?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It's the defensive chemicals in the leaf. They aren't as intense as in the seed. But they are designed to block digestive enzymes in the grazers. Cows, goats and insects and worms and things that would eat their leaves get poisoned unless they, like a cow, have a rumen to detoxify those. And people don't have the detoxifying system and so their digestive enzymes are simply blocked by the chemicals in the grazers."

**CONTEXT:** What are the "defensive chemicals" in leafy greens, and how do they affect digestion?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The basic problem is usually that a low thyroid person has slow digestion and so foods are feeding bacteria in the intestine. Bacteria produce endotoxin and if your intestine is irritated and hypothyroid you absorb that endotoxin into the system along with some allergens and so the combination of low thyroid and slow digestion will help. cause various inflammatory degenerative processes and when you're low thyroid you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones and so if your cholesterol is very high that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA and I've seen... people supplement like a woman came visiting from Sweden to give lectures in Eugene and she had had I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because her all of her joints were getting so deformed. She spread progesterone. Over all of her body and spent two or three days in Eugene walking around seeing the sights with absolutely no joint pain."

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying cause of joint pain and inflammation, and how can progesterone supplementation help?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "People have experimented with that experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement watching what is happening with the glands output. They would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing and then they would stop the dosing and measure the return and it's almost immediate. I've seen people who... could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose. Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose, and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been. So I stopped taking it. The very next morning my neck was smooth. It had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces. So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed."

**CONTEXT:** What is the body's response when thyroid supplementation is stopped, and how quickly can the thyroid gland recover?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate. Sugar because calcium regulates everything and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid and people sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient but vitamin D part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone when you're low in calcium and vitamin D. The parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher and that causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level."

**CONTEXT:** What are the key factors for boosting thyroid function while reducing reliance on thyroid medication, and what is the role of vitamin D, calcium, and sugar?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but if you're over 50 your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger and it takes from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure. In 30 minutes, you can do it right at the middle of the day. And you want to get on the skin, right? Yeah, it has to be directly onto the skin."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, here's an email Patrick and Adam have been recently discussing Dr. Emmanuel Rivisi and his use of the periodic table to correlate catabolic and anabolic imbalances in the body can Mr. P discuss how the thyroid might be an influence to those states and how we supplementing with thyroid extract could be possibly correct the imbalances uh... yeah Rivisi was very good on noticing the effect of the day-night cycle uh... and uh... uh... i uh... started thinking about that about forty or fifty years ago that you have to look at the hormones in context if your liver is in very good condition and your muscles are working right uh... your body should store several ounces maybe ten ounces of sugar which can be drawn on during the night if you didn't store your sugar efficiently because you were not producing lactic acid not producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid that wastes your sugar so during the night you run out of sugar and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol and you start breaking down your tissues Releasing whatever fat is stored and that's what causes bone loss during the night for example and if you can Keep your your body well stocked on sugar Then you can avoid that nighttime deterioration stress."

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid function influence anabolic and catabolic states, and what is the role of sugar storage in preventing nighttime tissue breakdown?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well stocked with sugar and how do we do that? And avoiding the proofer is the essential thing and eating adequate carbohydrate."

**CONTEXT:** How can one ensure adequate sugar storage, and what is the role of avoiding PUFAs and consuming adequate carbohydrate?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Salt has a similar effect because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine and when you have too much pufa in your body that poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar and so in making... lactic acid from glucose, you use several times more glucose per minute than when you're making carbon dioxide. It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body. So within an hour or two of going to sleep, your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar. It turns on the stress hormones and so if you have... sometimes just a little salty snack will do it because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar more efficiently and lower stress hormones. For example, a tablespoon of sugar and a glass of milk could be honey will usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours. But you said actually a salty snack would do the same thing. Very often it does. I've seen people with hyperactive kids who never wanted to go to bed gave them a little bit of salty consummate or something and just write out like they've been given a shot of morphine or something."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which carbohydrates and salt can improve sleep, and how do PUFAs interfere with this process?

**RAY PEAT:** "Good oranges are very important. Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially is from unripe oranges. And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges, they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect. So good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach. And coffee... the various brands vary, but coffee is always somewhat acidic and it's much easier on the stomach if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar. That kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it, the heavy cream? Yeah, makes it taste better and is much easier on the stomach and you absorb the caffeine more slowly."

**CONTEXT:** What are the considerations for consuming orange juice and coffee, and how can heavy cream and sugar improve their digestibility?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, cheese and eggs and milk and occasional shellfish. I think the average person benefits from having liver two or three times a month because so many of the foods are unreliable for nutritional content."

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of consuming dairy, eggs, milk, shellfish, and liver?

**RAY PEAT:** "The cosmetics companies have caught on to the fact that old people's free cholesterol decreases tremendously. The skin aging is basically a cholesterol deficiency syndrome, the way Alzheimer's disease gets the fatty acid. Ester, which is toxic, but the real cholesterol is down by about 50% in aged skin. The cosmetics companies are building on experiments which showed that if you add cholesterol to the skin, it restores the cell function, live cells come back, the dead, flaky cells aren't produced when there's adequate cholesterol. Actually adding cholesterol to the cosmetic creams and that biologically is very appropriate because the reason old people need more vitamin D is because vitamin D is made when sunlight hits the cholesterol in the skin and if you're old, the skin has only half as much cholesterol as a young person so you produce half as much vitamin D. So an old person... They need twice as much sunlight as a young person."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cholesterol in skin aging and vitamin D synthesis, and how do cosmetic companies utilize this knowledge?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there were studies in the U.S., too, in which people in rest homes and such, they looked at their cholesterol and checked how long they lived. 250, 260 were the longest living. It's the same idea. If you look at how much progesterone an ovary produces, it's exactly proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary. Same with your adrenals and brain, any tissue. It makes its hormones like DHEA, pregmenolone and progesterone by converting. Cholesterol straight into the steroid hormone and to do that thyroid is the catalyst."

**CONTEXT:** What is the correlation between higher cholesterol levels and longevity, and how does cholesterol relate to hormone production?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, 180 is good for a middle aged person but by the time a person is 50 according to the Framingham study, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is higher in people who are not over 200 in their cholesterol."

**CONTEXT:** What are the optimal cholesterol levels for preventing Alzheimer's disease, particularly in older adults?

**RAY PEAT:** "Experimenters have produced aneurysms in as short a time as one hour giving the angiotensin hormone. You produce angiotensin when the kidneys aren't getting what they need. Kidneys send out signal renin which causes many tissues to produce angiotensin and the angiotensin converting enzymes. The inhibitors are used as drugs. That's one of the few drugs that has a logical basis. If you give an animal an overdose of angiotensin, it immediately damages the arteries so much that it has an aneurysm. If you block that angiotensin, you can reverse aneurysms. Simply restoring the energy to the blood vessels and you don't produce excess angiotensin if your kidneys are getting the blood supply they need, the nourishment they need. And so thyroid and a diet adequate and free of PUFA is what keeps your kidneys getting the nutrients they need so they don't raise your angiotensin."

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism behind aneurysms and strokes, and how do thyroid function and a PUFA-free diet play a role in preventing them?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and salt is another thing that guarantees adequate blood volume perfusing the kidneys so they don't produce those toxic angiotensin reactants. Salt lowers your aldosterone. Produced by the adrenals and aldosterone works parallel to the amphetensin causing tissue degeneration. There are now drugs coming out to lower or oppose aldosterone to protect the failing heart. High aldosterone is produced by chronic deficiency of sodium in your diet and aldosterone causes fibrosis. It causes aging of all of the tissues but the heart is usually the first one that shows up the effect as heart failure. So the low sodium diet is one of the most dangerous things."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of salt in kidney function and blood pressure regulation, and why is a low-sodium diet considered dangerous?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, even a fourth of a teaspoon is very helpful."

**CONTEXT:** What is a beneficial amount of salt to consume, particularly before sleep?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The problem with grains and leaves is that the plants produce these defensive toxins. And if a cow... ate those and didn't process them in some way, the cow would succumb to all of those toxins. But the cow has an extra stomach that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast process out those toxins. So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids. And our sugars into the blood that the plant material has been very detoxified. So you're getting all of those nutrients, multiply filtered, filtered before it gets into the bloodstream and from the bloodstream to the other, it's filtered again. So it's the most highly refined and refined food that we can get economically."

**CONTEXT:** What makes milk a superior food source compared to grains and leaves, considering plant toxins?

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but even low-fat, pasteurized milk is still the best food available, even if it isn't organic and raw."

**CONTEXT:** Is pasteurized, low-fat milk still considered a beneficial food, even if not organic or raw?
