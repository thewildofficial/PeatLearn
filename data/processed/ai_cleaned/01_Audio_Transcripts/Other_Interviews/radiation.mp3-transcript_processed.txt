**RAY PEAT:** The strength of the field is so much lower, it isn't much of a worry. But the cell phone produces really not quite a brain-melting field, but definitely a biologically significant field. So they have to be much more powerful to go further.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between cell phones and remote phones in terms of their radiation output?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, radar is, you know, they used to talk about radar range. I think that was the brand of microwave ovens. That range... It's short for radio waves, like a shortwave radio is in a few meters length, radar is in the centimeter length, a few inches, and television, the television band overlaps a little bit with the shortwave band. Television is a fairly short wave. I noticed that my body would resonate with one of the channels and the cat's body would resonate with channel 11 so that the TV would go out of tune when the cat walked near it on channel 12 and out of tune on I think it was channel 6 for me. So you can visualize the way the waves resonate with an animal of a certain length. And after the second world war they had killed a few people, a few sailors would walk in front of a radar antenna and so they would die and they would find that they had been cooked, their brain would be cooked and so they did experiments on monkeys and they found that the size of the organ or brain would determine how hot that organ got in a field of a given wavelength so that a monkey with a little brain would have its brain cooked by a shorter wave, higher frequency radar.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the concept of resonance in relation to different wavelengths and biological organisms, using radar and television as examples?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if it's the wrong frequency, you don't resonate very well. It's like the difference between the cat and me and the different channels of TV. That theoretically, you could design a frequency of microwaves that would cook a tumor selectively. People have tried to use microwaves. They're still doing it to to kill tumors, but generally, it's something about the anti-scientific mind of the medical people. They don't get very subtle, and so they'll treat a breast cancer by jamming an antenna through the person's chest or really gross ways of applying the microwave microwave frequency where it is at least theoretically possible to tune the microwave to a solid tumor. The MRI molecular resonance imaging uses a very fine version of this; you can tune in to one type of molecule rather than another type. The resonance can distinguish one kind of atom from another kind of atom. Wow. And that involves just having a strong steady magnetic field and scanning microwave, and you can distinguish water from drier tissues. How much water a tissue has in it, and so on. And since cancers are wetter, they're young, and so the cells are, if they're growing faster, they're younger and more water-loaded than mature cells, and so you can visualize a cancer very easily by this microwave absorbing ability of their water molecules. And some people have suggested that just because of the high water content, you could selectively heat and kill tumors. That hasn't been developed as far as I know, but the solidity and size of a round tumor can allow it to be selectively heated.
**CONTEXT:** How does the principle of resonance apply to the selective heating of tumors with microwaves, and how does MRI utilize this principle?

**RAY PEAT:** The heating effect is one in which water molecules, for example, infrared rays selectively resonate with water molecules. The rotation and vibration of water is fairly specific for infrared. Infrared doesn't go through water very far, and water molecules have different degrees of association with proteins and fats in the living cell, and so different wavelengths and different energies will select out different conditions of the water molecules with which they resonate. And so you can distinguish the looseness or the freeness of the water molecule by how it resonates to the microwaves. And these effects have been known as long as the technique of molecular resonance has been known. And so there's no big mystery to why cells should be able to detect and respond to and be harmed by microwaves far below the strength at which they would be cooked to death because they resonate to really very weak environmental fields. In a steady magnetic field, they tend to align their... electrons and nuclei with that field, and then the alignment with that field governs how they're going to interact with a microwave coming through. So you have competing alignments, basically, between the oscillating field and the steady field.
**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on how different wavelengths interact with water molecules in biological systems and how this relates to cellular sensitivity to microwaves?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, this is the alignment of the nucleus of the atom and the electrons. In some situations, the electrons are relatively free to resonate, and the living state is full of these relatively free electrons, like free radical electrons, but all of our metabolic system is full of these free radical electrons. Processes depend on some relatively free electrons, and these are very susceptible to electromagnetic field interference. Changing their alignment changes their ability to associate or resonate with each other since they have to resonate with each other to perform the biological functions. Then, external fields interfere with the ways that they interact with each other.
**CONTEXT:** How do free radical electrons in biological systems interact with electromagnetic fields, and what is the consequence of this interaction?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so that's a very subtle biological response that you can see in animal experiments. You can train animals to respond to ____. A microwave field, for example, that is very far below the heating threshold. In 1968, I had been reading the work of Yuri Holodov on sensing magnetic fields, and I went to Moscow to visit him, and he gave me a reading list. He told me about his work, and he knew more about the sensitivity of cells to electric fields, the work that was being done in the United States, than my nerve biology and physiology professors at the university knew. He had tremendous access to world research which my professors didn't even want to hear about.
**CONTEXT:** What kind of subtle biological responses to electromagnetic fields have been observed in animal experiments, and what was the significance of Yuri Holodov's work?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1960, Linus Pauling proposed a theory to explain how anesthetics work. He called it the clathrate theory of anesthesia, in which it's analogous to something that happens in... of deep sea areas where methane is being produced, the methane causes freezing of the water. It orders the water molecules so that ice forms even above the freezing temperature of water. And this same phenomenon sometimes causes sludging in natural gas pipelines. Ice forms. Even at room temperature. And corn plants can form ice crystals above the freezing temperature of water. The clathrate principle is well established. But Linus Pauling just said, well, maybe this will explain anesthesia because... I mean, they didn't know how it works.
**CONTEXT:** What was Linus Pauling's clathrate theory of anesthesia, and what natural phenomena does it draw parallels with?

**RAY PEAT:** No, they still don't know how anything works, they being the medical establishment, the science establishment. But Linus Pauling, being an alert person, said, well, why not use this established physical principle for explaining how a similar chemical? He said, you can't even conceive or theorize about how the noble gases... create anesthesia. At high pressure, nitrogen will anesthetize you, as in deep sea divers, but that functions as a noble or inert gas. At extremely high pressure, helium will do the same thing, and as you approach atmospheric pressure, the heavier noble gases are anesthetic. So that neon, krypton, xenon, xenon and krypton are anesthetic close to atmospheric pressures. He said, these are not chemically reactive, how are you going to explain anesthesia by xenon and krypton? Right. And he showed that the clathrate principle. It explains this perfectly that the noble gases work just like the natural gas, methane, and organic molecules in general that immobilize water molecules. And he said maybe this is simply intensifying a process that normally occurs in the resting cell and it locks cells into the resting. I was in a relatively insensitive state.
**CONTEXT:** How did Linus Pauling propose that the clathrate principle could explain the anesthetic effects of noble gases?

**RAY PEAT:** And two of the researchers that Yuri Holodov referred me to had books published in English, but their books were purely unknown. Madeleine Barnathy and her husband published some books on bio-magnetism. The founder of the science of bio-meteorology was named Salko Tromp. He was in Holland and he wrote some very impressive books in English as early as I think 1940 or so, his first book. He surveyed the physical world, looking for ways in which the environment interacts with organisms. Liquid crystals were known way back in the 20s and 30s, but no one knew what to do with them. Falco Tromp, looking the way Linus Pauling did for physical principles that explain interactions between such things as atmospheric pressure and electromagnetic fields. I saw the phenomenon of liquid crystals and said the cells behave in many ways like liquid crystals, organized but liquid. If people had read his books on bio-meteorology, they would have come up with liquid crystal display screens about 30 years earlier. Because he was explaining the same things, the same biological events that Madeleine Barnathy and her husband demonstrated that people and other animals can detect a change even in a steady magnetic field at a very low level. The facts are there, the methods are there, liquid crystals and clathrates. And organized cell structures respond to these very low energy fields.
**CONTEXT:** Who were some of the key researchers in bio-magnetism and bio-meteorology, and what was their contribution to understanding cellular sensitivity to environmental fields?

**RAY PEAT:** But the Navy physicists and medical people didn't want to have their draftees worrying about subtle effects, so they said that radar will only hurt you if it cooks your brain or your liver. That propaganda put out by the government in the 1950s to say that microwaves will only hurt you if they cook you, that was, it fit in with what the government was saying about low-level radiation from nuclear fallout, that if it doesn't blister you, it won't hurt you at all, there's a threshold of harm. Right. Basically, it's an interlocking system in which the government's lies about nuclear radiation meshed with the lies about microwave and radar radiation, and then it created a culture in which doctors who didn't want to get sued for treating dandruff and acne with deadly doses of x-rays had a very powerful motive. They really did that? Yeah. I knew people whose faces collapsed because they had had such intense doses of radiation. I had never heard that. The bones simply disappeared in their faces. And they treated dandruff and ringworm with x-ray. And the brain, Yuri Horodov showed that the brain and the testicle are the two organs most sensitive to radiation of any sort. Ionizing or magnetic or microwave. It's disgusting if they did that. So the medical community had this starting at the turn of the century. They had this very strong built-in motive not to be held liable for damages or murder. And so they loved the government's stories about it. Radiation and microwaves, and so the medical scientific community from the 50s on built up this idea that if it doesn't cook you or if it doesn't ionize your cells, then it's harmless. It's below the threshold of harm. But people are still saying this. I saw recent articles in which they said microwaves don't have enough energy to ionize, so therefore they can't do anything to you.
**CONTEXT:** What was the government's propaganda regarding the harmful effects of microwaves and low-level radiation, and how did it influence medical practices and perceptions of harm?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and now we have towers going up. I just drove back from the Midwest and I was really impressed along the highway. It seems like a giant 120-foot tower with what I believe are microwave repeaters on top for all the cell phone traffic. And I know in the city it's even worse. I believe you have to have one in every corner of every block so that you can have uninterrupted phone service as you walk down the street. And I believe that's very close. You know, it's not very high off the ground, and people are walking right under it. I don't know how do you feel about the exposure from the towers themselves.
**CONTEXT:** What are your concerns about the proliferation of cell phone towers and the resulting exposure levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, most cities now, downtown, they have such a high field intensity from microwaves, telephone microwaves especially, that they are way up in the danger range known to produce leukemia and mutations. In the 70s and 80s, they knew that quail eggs, for example, that hatched near power lines, the sex ratio of the hatchlings was... grossly distorted. I think it was practically all females. The males died or were modified. And someone who knew about that looked at the children of telephone linemen and saw that they had children with an extremely distorted sex ratio. Male, the Y-chromosome... The sperm cell seems to be more fragile, and microwaves can break chromosomes, among other things, on the grosser level.
**CONTEXT:** What are the known health risks associated with high microwave field intensity in urban areas, and what evidence exists regarding the impact of electromagnetic fields on reproductive health?

**RAY PEAT:** How do you feel about microwave ovens? They used to put out leakage that would be harmful at three or four feet, but I think the government... standards coming in in the 80s clamped down on those leakers, and I've measured the fields around them, and beyond three feet, I think they're nowadays safe. So you don't want to stand there reading a book while your coffee is heating up.
**CONTEXT:** What is your assessment of the safety of microwave ovens, particularly regarding leakage and proximity during operation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the little remote phones that only transmit 100 feet, I think those aren't enough to worry about because walking downtown on the downtown streets, you're getting much higher intensity radiation just from the cell phone, just from the repeater stations. Yeah, and radio waves like this FM station right here, we're sitting inside of this. Yeah, I hope your I hope your tower isn't near you. It's about 50 feet away, I'd say. Really? The transmitting tower? Yeah, that's not probably safe.
**CONTEXT:** Are the 900 MHz cordless phones in homes considered safe compared to cell phones, and what about the proximity of a radio station's transmitting tower?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can put you can ground a big screen or a metal roof that's grounded. Yeah, it's shielding. Um, there are many reasons for having a tin roof, but uh, electromagnetic shielding is an important reason. Yeah, I've noticed it does affect my phone at home, the uh, and the radio reception. How about cinder block? Is that a block? No, that doesn't do anything. That doesn't do anything. But if you have a cinder block with a tin roof and ground tin roof, then you're pretty good.
**CONTEXT:** What are effective methods for shielding oneself from electromagnetic radiation, such as using a grounded metal roof or cinder blocks?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, um, did you get that? That little news item I sent you, email? Yeah, I didn't bring it with me, but it it looked like that exposure to the people in Poland that the study was on basically doubled their cancer rate. Yeah, some types of cancer, six or eight times, I think one was 13 times higher. Wow, and they said they broke it down into different age groups and I don't think that was in there. No. But the results were. No, I haven't seen the article, just the abstract. Right. Yeah, I found it. Pretty condemning of it. And this Englishman, Sir Richard Dahl, was denying it for a long time but has now affirmed that leukemia is caused by electromagnetic fields.
**CONTEXT:** What were the findings of the study on electromagnetic field exposure in Poland, and what is the significance of Sir Richard Doll's affirmation regarding leukemia?

**RAY PEAT:** This is a story of how John Goffman went from being... the government's main apologist for low-level radiation in the 50s. He went around lecturing against Linus Pauling, who was warning about the dangers of fallout. The government took Pauling's passport away for disloyalty because he wanted to protect the American public. And John Goffman was the AEC's counter... Linus Pauling leader. And he describes what happened to him. He says while he was giving a lecture saying that if we can't prove that these low levels are causing harm to the population, we shouldn't. And at that point he realized what he had been saying for 10 years was insane. And since then he's shifted. And has become the leader of the anti-radiation movement. But he was fired as soon as he had that moment of sanity.
**CONTEXT:** Can you describe John Goffman's shift from being a government apologist for low-level radiation to an anti-radiation advocate, and the consequences he faced?

**RAY PEAT:** The government has been making its policy official that community controlled radio isn't really to be promoted. It's to be displaced by corporate radio. That's exactly right, and that's what's going on here. I'm trying to start a low power radio station, which is tiny. It's only got a six-mile diameter, I think. And supposedly it was something that the last FCC Commissioner, Kennard, was bringing out. And at the last minute, believe it or not, NPR campaigned against it because they were afraid it would cut into their, well, they said they were afraid it was going to interfere with handicapped broadcast, broadcast of the hearing impaired and stuff. But that was really a red herring. I think they're really afraid it's going to cut into their market because what could be more community radio than something within 10 miles of your home? And again, speaking of radio emissions and the beans, ADM is a major funder of NPR. What is? The soybean monopoly. Oh, is that right? Yeah, the vitamin E and saving the world by growing soybeans advertisements. Wow, yeah, yeah, that's right, ADM, here, their marketplace to the world. Yeah, they seem pretty compromised. Most of their reporting is pretty wishy-washy, I feel like. Every once in a while they have a good news report, but for the most part they seem to be toeing the corporate line. Yeah, the government and the bean monopoly of controlling radio broadcasts.
**CONTEXT:** What is the government's policy regarding community-controlled radio, and how does corporate influence, such as from ADM funding NPR, impact its promotion?

**RAY PEAT:** We've been trying to apply for this license for this low power radio station down where I live, and it's very hard to get a frequency. All the frequencies have been taken up by religious stations. I guess if you apply for one that takes it off the available list. Yeah, it's too bad someone doesn't have a religion of their own. True scientific information. That is too bad. Well, maybe we can start a cult.
**CONTEXT:** What are the challenges in obtaining licenses for low-power radio stations, and what is the significance of the prevalence of religious stations?

**RAY PEAT:** In the short run, microwaves and radio waves can be used. You can touch an antenna and feel that it's warm, and doctors use radio waves of many different frequencies. Shortwave bands have, I don't know if they still do it, but they used to a lot, a diathermy band so that chiropractors and such could emit. Pretty intense signals into the knees of their arthritic patients to heat the joint, and it would show up as a funny sound on the shortwave band. They do have therapeutic value in the short run, but the problem is that if it's a constant factor in your life, it biases. Those subtle electronic and molecular processes, the way water is organized in relation to the proteins, and has a chronically disorganizing influence.
**CONTEXT:** What are the therapeutic applications of microwaves and radio waves, and what are the long-term consequences of chronic exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** I know some people, I think if you talk on a cell phone for long enough, it gets warm. Is that true? Oh yeah, then that's definitely causing biological damage, because... the distance between the warming energy and the biologically harming range. Once you get up in the warming range, then you know it's biologically harmful.
**CONTEXT:** Does a cell phone getting warm during use indicate biological damage, and what is the relationship between heat generation and harm?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, I think if your antenna is outside the car, then that's much safer. Well, you're probably driving down the freeway now, right? Talking on a cell phone? Oh, and I should mention that beans and cell phones aren't completely unrelated subjects. Is that right? You get some of the same kinds of damage from eating beans that you do from radiation. Wow, you actually connected the two subjects. I didn't think that was possible. So, what is the similar damage as cellular? Cellular communications are disrupted, and the immune system is the most sensitive to both of them.
**CONTEXT:** How does the placement of a cell phone antenna in a car affect safety, and what is the connection between beans and cell phones in terms of cellular damage?

**RAY PEAT:** How did you deal with it indeed in the event of ionizing radiation? It kills your white blood cells very easily, but lower levels of radiation will disrupt your immune system if they are chronic, and that is what the PHA and other lectins do. They first mess up your immune system, but then gradually they will cause growth. Abnormalities in your liver, thymus, and pancreas and intestine and different organs.
**CONTEXT:** How does ionizing radiation affect the immune system, and what are the long-term consequences of chronic exposure to lower levels of radiation or lectins like PHA?

**RAY PEAT:** And Ernest Sternglass was one of the people who studied Three Mile Island, but he... He had been studying other reactor leaks that we never heard much about and found just from ordinary emissions, so-called ordinary emissions, that horrendous amounts of isotopes were being released, and it's the normal releases that the government allows the nuclear industry. Which everyone should be worried about, not just the mining and the storage problems, but the legal releases that the industry is always doing. Yeah, I would not want to live near a nuclear plant myself. I don't feel like they're honest in their... where they communicate with the public, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is certainly not looking after the public interest.
**CONTEXT:** What were Ernest Sternglass's findings regarding radiation releases from nuclear facilities, and why should "ordinary emissions" be a cause for concern?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even Linus Pauling was misled by the propagandists of the industry and the government. Their favorite argument was, if you fly in an airplane or live in Denver, you get so much radiation. Why do you want to worry about the radiation that comes from nuclear fallout or the nuclear industry? Yeah. And Linus Pauling was convinced that living at high altitude or flying in an airplane was carcinogenic because it increased your radiation exposure. But in fact, high altitude gives you a different kind of cosmic ray. The higher you are, the more primaries you get and the fewer secondaries and tertiaries. Basically, it's like one beam coming in producing a shower which produces another shower, and the third shower is the one that's most carcinogenic, and that's what happens at ground level. So the industry was comparing. Totally unrelated things. It brings the safest natural radiation with their isotopes which radiate from inside your body. So one isotope basically produces one cancer because it is 100% absorbed because it is produced inside your body.
**CONTEXT:** How did the nuclear industry and government propagandists mislead people about radiation exposure, and what is the fundamental difference between natural radiation and internally absorbed isotopes?

**RAY PEAT:** And I know that the nuclear industry wouldn't exist if Congress hadn't passed the Price-Anderson Act, I think it was called, which absolved them of all liability, or at least up to a certain point. And so the whole thing is just totally propped up by money and politics, I guess.
**CONTEXT:** What role did the Price-Anderson Act play in the existence of the nuclear industry, and what is the underlying support structure for the industry?

**RAY PEAT:** Alvin Solomon's newspaper column yesterday was about the price-and-the-roll of the journalism school's training liars. He said they used to train people in journalism to find out the truth. Now they're training public relations people to help industry and government distort the truth. Yeah, that makes sense. It seems like that's what we're getting. I mean, the media seems to be dropping the ball. More and more, very few reporters I trust at this point. So I guess it pays to get your information from a variety of sources and cross-reference it.
**CONTEXT:** How has journalism education changed, and what is the impact of this shift on the media's role in reporting truth versus distorting it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and your station can't have too many programs like this. No, but we have more than the normal radio, I think. Mostly just because it's individuals from the community doing shows. It doesn't really go through much of a screening. If you're interested in something, you can do the show.
**CONTEXT:** What makes this radio station different from typical radio programming, and what is the significance of community involvement in show production?

**RAY PEAT:** The government has been making its policy official that community controlled radio isn't really to be promoted. It's to be displaced by corporate radio.

**CONTEXT:** What are the challenges in obtaining licenses for low-power radio stations, and what is the significance of the prevalence of religious stations?

**RAY PEAT:** The government runs Medline. Oh, they do. The National Library of Medicine. I didn't know that. Well, now they have changed it to PubMed. But years ago, I used to look up a given subject and I would check. Index Medicus, which was the same indexing system that became Medline and then PubMed. I would check to see if they had anything that I hadn't found in Chemical Abstracts or Biological Abstracts. I would generally find that something that had been researched for more than a decade, ten or twenty or thirty years, and had abundant information in Biological or Chemical Abstracts, there would be nothing in Index Medicus. And then after about twenty years, something might start showing up in Index Medicus. After the animal research had established something, then a generation later, a little bit would show up in the medical index. And basically, our librarian posted a sign when they got a computer that would search Medline or PubMed. They put a big card sign on top of the monitor that said, "Medline is not a science data page." And so librarians have known. That fact that if you are looking for science, you don't go to Medline or PubMed. But even though librarians know it, and anyone who has tried to look for information seriously finds it out very quickly. I found some letter for doctors that had published one of my newsletters and said that he had searched Medline and couldn't find anything similar. He was a university professor who thought he had searched the database because he looked in Medline. For professors to think that they are doing science when they look in Medline, it's a... It's like a brain surgeon looked in a podiatry database. It's just really depressing that professors think they are doing science by looking on the computer for what the Library of Medicine has.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between Medline, PubMed, and scientific literature, and why is it problematic for researchers to rely solely on these databases for scientific information?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we were reading the book and it just sounds like... What the AMA was trying to do back then was basically control all of the information that was getting out about anything. They don't want the public to know unless they screen it first. Yeah, that book has, I think, the story of the fraudulent article published in JAMA that they would never retract. Right, so it's been going on a long time. It sounds like it's just getting more consolidated.
**CONTEXT:** What was the AMA's historical approach to controlling information, and what is the significance of fraudulent articles being published and not retracted?

**RAY PEAT:** You must use search engines to search on the internet or any of the journals online? Well, I subscribed for a while to a thing called Current Contents. A subscription to Biological Abstracts costs $4,000 or $7,000 a year or something like that. For a few hundred dollars, you can get Current Contents and you can select a broader spectrum of science journals, biology journals, than you get on the PubMed. But the only way to really do it is to go to a library that, if you want to only go back 30 years, libraries will have computers that go back, I'm not sure how far. Back the computers go in Chemical Abstracts, which they have good nutrition references and a lot of medical references in Chemical Abstracts and Biological Abstracts, but if you're really going to want to know what's going on in the subject, you have to use the bound volumes, and the books are big, and so you get your exercise by taking down these. 10-pound books and yeah, but so that stuff hasn't been edited to the computer yet. No, and I don't think anyone is going to do it because the whole trend is away from making information available but making people think it's available. Right, so you have the PubMed to just make you think you have access. Yeah, it's a problem. The stuff leaks through into PubMed, but it's a matter of leakage rather than being sought.
**CONTEXT:** What are the limitations of online search engines and databases like PubMed for accessing comprehensive scientific information, and what are the best methods for thorough research?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think the little remote phones that only transmit 100 feet, I think those aren't enough to worry about because walking downtown on the downtown streets, you're getting much higher intensity radiation just from the cell phone, just from the repeater stations. Yeah, and radio waves like this FM station right here, we're sitting inside of this. Yeah, I hope your I hope your tower isn't near you. It's about 50 feet away, I'd say. Really? The transmitting tower? Yeah, that's not probably safe.
**CONTEXT:** Are the 900 MHz cordless phones in homes considered safe compared to cell phones, and what about the proximity of a radio station's transmitting tower?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the little remote phones that only transmit 100 feet, I think those aren't enough to worry about because walking downtown on the downtown streets, you're getting much higher intensity radiation just from the cell phone, just from the repeater stations.
