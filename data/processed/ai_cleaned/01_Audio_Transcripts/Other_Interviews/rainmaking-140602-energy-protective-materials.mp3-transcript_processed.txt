**RAY PEAT:** If we actually had a different kind of perspective, we would understand that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on this new perspective on living matter?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, when you look at the substance of a cell rather than having to be assembled through a billion years of evolution, it means that the principles governing the way we function... also govern the way the organism holds itself together, or forms itself, makes new cells, and rather than a cell being isolated from the environment by a lipid membrane, the famous white-layer lipid membrane, the functional principle is what Bungenberg de Jong demonstrated, was that these complex mixtures of protein fats... and carbohydrates primarily, spontaneously separate things from the environment and cause their chemical change and integration. So that, for example, if you take a piece of hair made up of completely dead cells and wash it completely free of all of the sodium and potassium and calcium ions and so on, and then you dip it in the serum, it will pull out... the potassium and bind potassium to itself against a gradient excluding sodium, it will bind magnesium excluding calcium and so on. So this demonstrates that you don't need membrane pumps, it's simply an ion exchange phenomenon that dead cells can do and this is behind the way of looking at matter that Gilbert Ling, Bungenberg, De Jong, these non-mainline... researchers. I think of it as the real main line of science and that the membrane school is the peripheral irrelevant part except they're more numerous.

**CONTEXT:** You're saying there's so much even about hydration that's said that you have to get through the membrane of the cell to hydrate the cell. Do you agree with that?

**RAY PEAT:** I agree that that's the paradigm but that's been totally disproven so many times. The idea of the membrane is that the arrangement of chemistry inside is unstable relative to the outside. This whole idea that we're negentropic and that entropy tends to kill us, tends to make everything die. This view is that we are a stable form of matter as long as energy runs through us. And that it's a chemically favored arrangement of matter that doesn't need pumps in the membrane to maintain it. It's simply the composition which maintains itself.

**CONTEXT:** What is your view on cell hydration?

**RAY PEAT:** Gilbert Ling, just sort of incidentally to his main work, has demonstrated that hydration is regulated by energy. The amount of energy the cell is producing and holding prevents the cell from taking up too much water, but it binds water and prevents its loss below a certain level. And so if you lose the adequate amount of energy, the cell will control the water. The water starts to take over and control the cell. This explains many medical problems involving edema and swelling that the membrane theory is totally confused about. Doctors will tell you stop eating so much salt to reduce your edema. But in many situations, restricting sodium is exactly the wrong thing. It will make the edema worse, especially in premenstrual women. And very old people, I've seen people solve their swelling problems, their high blood pressure problems, appetite control and so on just by solving their food according to what tastes good rather than what the doctor advises.

**CONTEXT:** You know how there was a guy who got the Nobel Prize for identifying the aquaporin channel in the cell? What do you think about it?

**RAY PEAT:** Since Ling explains the balance between proteins and water adequately to take care of everything, and the channel idea goes with the idea of a membrane, which is a barrier to salt and water, and so it needs channels. But Ling demonstrated that there is no such barrier. There might be something that you can stain that looks like a membrane. With different preparations you get different membrane appearances. But there is no barrier to sodium entering the cell. As soon as isotopes became available in the 1940s, it was discovered that sodium freely leaves and enters the cell, that there's no semi-permeable membrane keeping sodium out. What about keeping water out? It's the same thing. If you have a fat layer which can keep sodium out and potassium in, that would obviously be keeping water out. One of the early persons criticizing the idea of a lipid membrane, it was being described as basically a lecithin membrane made out of phospholipids with their fatty acids stuck together in a layer. He commented that lecithin has a great affinity for water and it will swell in the presence of water. So it's a very bad choice for postulating as limiting.

**CONTEXT:** You talk about the distinction between water and ions, that we need to really understand more about the play of water and ions.

**RAY PEAT:** The thinking is partly sustained just because some of the methods becoming so complicated that doctors and researchers use approximations and don't really calculate. What's going on with ions and pH and so on. And a lot of that derives from the definition of what an acid and a base is. Gilbert Lewis defined acids in a very different way in which protons aren't involved. The whole medical idea of acid and base involves the concentration of protons. That's what pH stands for. Gilbert Lewis. He demonstrated that you don't need protons at all to have acids or bases. It's all a matter of how the electrons are handled. And since electrons are what are involved in metabolism and energy production, it's much better to use his concept of acid-base rather than the proton pH idea. Peter Stewart redesigned the handling mathematics for acids and base. And he showed that almost always the crucial factor is carbon dioxide gas pressure, not the bicarbonate ions that hospitals are measuring and calculating. It happens to be that Peter Stewart and the Gilbert acid theory are simply physically correct, and Gilbert Ling doesn't talk about these particular aspects of the theory, but his way of calculating ion distribution. is so physically simple and correct that some of the first people to accept his calculations were the engineers designing water softeners and ion exchange resins because his calculations worked perfectly for any physical system, not just cells.

**CONTEXT:** Would you talk a little bit about CO2 because since 2009 and since the EPA declared war on CO2, carbon dioxide, and since the whole global warming thing and anything connected to climate changing, people are scared to death of CO2. Explain what carbon dioxide is, and what does carbon dioxide have to do with aging and health?

**RAY PEAT:** About 60 years ago, some people working with microorganisms did a survey and found that although some bacteria, protozoa and so on, can survive without oxygen, like in deep sea vents, there are organisms that totally live without oxygen and use. Sulfuric acid is their oxidant, for example. These experimenters tested many different types of organisms and even those which can live without oxygen can't live without carbon dioxide, so it really should be considered the basic material of life, not oxygen. The purpose of oxygen, from that point of view, is to make carbon dioxide. And if you consider it in the context of Gilbert Ling's cell structure, with the protein itself is a weak acid, and the weak acid is electrically charged with a negative charge which attracts positive ions, so that it spontaneously binds things like potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium. But if you adjust the composition as a whole......the whole colloid or coacervate of the cell, the water softener prefers to bind calcium over sodium. But if you put a very high concentration of salt through your water softener, you can wash out the calcium......and then it will extract calcium from your hard water. Because of its chemical nature, an acidic group of the right size will prefer one ion over the other. And carbon dioxide is... one of the factors that cause our proteins to prefer potassium over sodium. At the same time that the cell is regulating its salt and ion balance by having the right amount of carbon dioxide, it's producing a steady stream of carbon dioxide flowing out of the cell. into the blood and as it leaves the mitochondrion it reacts with water forming carbonic acid and the carbonic acid has a negative charge so as it flows out of the cell it drags along positive ions with it. In this case calcium and sodium are constantly flowing out of the cell just because of the flow of carbon dioxide and as we exhale that carbonic acid in the blood is constantly changing back into carbon dioxide which leaves in the lungs and that leaves these calcium and sodium ions stranded in the blood as the carbon dioxide leaves them. That accounts for the blood having a more alkaline test pH equivalent than the inside of the cell. Then the kidneys finish keeping the... the balance again by adjusting the change between carbon dioxide and carbonic acid, allowing the kidneys to select in one direction or the other these ions. One of the functions of carbon dioxide is to regulate the acidity of tissues and prevent the uptake of too much water and to keep the energy intake going. Shock is a typical extreme... situation in which cells become unable to make energy and take up too much water. So that, for example, your capillaries take up water and swell shut. Cells become so fat they close the aperture. Arterials get swollen so that blood hardly passes through them. The mechanisms obviously relate to the known mechanisms of shock, except that the shock industry is committed to the idea that something fails. In the circulatory system, as the primary event, but not necessarily the closure, simply the heart stops pumping enough, maybe because the blood vessels have relaxed too much and can't return the blood, but they neglect the fine structure of what's really happening. In the early part of the century, Yandel Henderson, a Yale professor, became interested in carbon dioxide physiology. As a regulator of oxygen metabolism, shock at that time was being seen in relation to the nervous system as something that can turn off or turn on energy production of cells all through the body. But he was simply looking at what happens with more or less carbon dioxide. And in one of his studies published in 1910, another one in 1911 on what happens to the circulation in the absence of carbon dioxide. He was one of the first people to see that carbon dioxide relaxes the arterioles and allows blood to flow freely through the body. But if you turn off the energy production and stop producing carbon dioxide, then you have less relaxed blood vessels. The heart has a harder job pumping. So he was looking at the feature of shock that fails to return blood to the heart and fails to pump it. The First World War, all of that research relating to the chemistry of metabolism and how it relates to the function of arteries, capillaries and veins and the heart, all of that was displaced by a simple mechanical failure of... of the blood to pump without explanation for the mechanism behind it and that elimination of carbon dioxide metabolism became institutionalized as hospitals have simplified things by supplying oxygen in an emergency where Yandel Henderson showed that you could cause quicker recovery of oxygenation by adding eight or ten percent of carbon dioxide to your oxygen. The whole idea of physiology changed largely as a result of the war research. At the time of the Second World War, a Russian researcher who was looking at the appearance of high metabolizing animals in the world, how the expensive energy-producing brain of humans could evolve, what the factors in the environment are that are needed. To maintain and develop the brain, he saw that the environmental carbon dioxide is an essential factor for good brain function and he predicted that the natural development of the planet's ecosystems would be to increase the metabolic rate, increase the brain size of populations and do it by the interaction of increasing carbon dioxide. Stimulating oxygen metabolism and stabilizing the big brain and in the history of the deposition, the carboniferous age of fossils, for example, at that time when evolution advanced so rapidly, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was many times higher than at present. So he predicted that the Earth would go through other phases of... greatly increased atmospheric CO2 that would increase the whole vitality of life on the planet. Vernadsky died around the end of the war in 1945 or 6, but around 1970 a Russian researcher looking at the length, birth weight and head size of babies born over a period of decades saw that around the world the head size......had been increasing in correspondence to the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere. Seeming to validate the prediction of Vernadsky made 25 years earlier.

**CONTEXT:** What does that mean? That we don't have to worry about increasing the atmosphere because it's stimulating life at all levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I do, actually. I had Dr. Sherwood Itso on to do a whole show on CO2 with regard to plants and life itself, but you're a whole other side of it with health. Going to a high altitude is one thing an individual can do. Changing the diet to include lots of fruit. Anything that supports thyroid function, avoiding polyunsaturated fats, avoiding electromagnetic fields and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Do you agree that if we got more carbon dioxide in our systems, that we would be healthier?

**RAY PEAT:** Up to a certain point. The insurance industry, more than 100 years ago, recognized that all of the degenerative diseases cause less death at very high altitudes. They had figures from all over the world at the beginning of the 20th century showing that cancer, brain diseases... heart disease, all the circulatory diseases caused many fewer deaths at altitudes of 8,000 to 10,000 feet.

**CONTEXT:** Why do you think that is?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, Jan Del Henderson, a professor at Yale in the early part of the century, did most of the basic human physiology relating to carbon dioxide. He showed that oxidation of the tissues depends on carbon dioxide. If you have too much oxygen in your environment, which at sea level we do have, that reverses all of these ion balancing processes and energy giving processes and pushes too much carbon dioxide out of our blood when it reaches the lungs. That shifts the whole balance so that as the blood reaches the cells carrying its load of oxygen, it requires... the carbon dioxide being produced in the cell to release the oxygen to the cell. And if your whole system has been depleted beyond a certain level of the necessary carbon dioxide, your red blood cells don't give up enough oxygen to the tissues. And so you will starve your peripheral tissues. If you hyperventilate for a couple of minutes, breathing deep and fast, you will notice that maybe your... fingers and toes go into a cramp. That same process happens under any circumstance that is depriving you of carbon dioxide. Giving pure oxygen, 100% oxygen, will create the same situation. And in the brain, too much oxygen and the deprivation of carbon dioxide shrinks the blood vessels. So that just a couple of years ago, using MRI and other imaging, they... have shown that too much oxygen breathing lowers the availability of oxygen in the brain by constricting the blood vessels.

**CONTEXT:** So what would you suggest for the listeners to get their carbon dioxide levels up? I noticed you brought up the breathing method of Buteyko? Talk about that for a minute. Isn't that a Russian breathing method?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he was a Russian doctor who... Starting in the 1950s, he noticed that sick and dying people tended to hyperventilate and he found that if he could calm them down and get them to breathe more slowly, they often recovered. I don't think he was aware of the research that E. N. L. Henderson did, but Henderson got the emergency firefighters and such from the 1930s into the 1940s. It was standard to use 8%. or even 10% carbon dioxide in their respiratory tanks with oxygen to treat suffocation victims, carbon monoxide poisoning and such, because the carbon dioxide is so essential to restoring respiration, and it even activates the Krebs cycle. I personally think it's involved in the actual formation of ATP from ADP by facilitating the dehydration. Withdrawal of water from the phosphate precursors to form the ATP itself.

**CONTEXT:** So what do you suggest for people so that they get more CO2 in their system?

**RAY PEAT:** The diet is very important. Some foods interfere with metabolism, cause you to tend to produce lactic acid, which displaces carbon dioxide. Polyunsaturated fats block respiration. and thyroid function. Alkaline acid balance is another thing that tends to make you blow out too much carbon dioxide and not form enough.

**CONTEXT:** You know, the healthy cell producing a lot of carbon dioxide, which is a Lewis acid, it contains no protons, but it has an acidic reaction all by itself. It being formed and the oxygen which forms it. Oxygen is named as the acid former. The acid that it forms is in the cell carbon dioxide. So the function of oxygen is to make the carbonic acid which gives the cell in its healthy condition an acidic reaction below seven pH. When it gets sick and can't make carbon dioxide as in cancer the pH of the cell becomes alkaline, but in the healthy condition you have. Inside the cell, a mild acidic condition as the CO2 drags minerals out of the cell and drops them in the blood, the blood becomes alkaline, but as the urine retains the alkaline minerals that it needs, the right balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, sodium, and potassium, the kidney ideally should be producing an acidic urine to maintain that alkaline bloodstream. So when people are measuring their alkaline acidity balance with an alkaline piece of paper and they're testing their urine, it's not giving the right reading, is it?

**RAY PEAT:** No, you want your blood to be alkaline, and to do that, your urine ideally usually is on the acidic side. And people with alkaline urine tend to deposit minerals just because of the physics of the situation.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think about hyperbaric oxygen chambers that cancer patients have gone into to try to get rid of the damage from radiation and chemo?

**RAY PEAT:** If the circulation is completely destroyed to an area, as in gangrene, high pressure oxygen can get the tissue. Keep it alive simply by diffusing into the tissue. So for like a wound, a puncture wound with damaged blood vessels, high pressure oxygen can help it recover. But the situation in the brain in which too much oxygen shuts down the blood vessels, the oxygen is actually preventing proper delivery of oxygen to the brain. I knew someone who was treating cancer patients with high-pressure oxygen, I think 200% of normal pressure. He tried adding some carbon dioxide to the atmosphere inside the chamber, and he got a little too much in and the patient lost consciousness. He hadn't been able to speak at all because of cancer in his throat, but he was unconscious in the machine for a while as the person tried to remedy the excess. Carbon dioxide. And during that time, the windows steamed up so that the doctor couldn't see what was happening in the chamber. It doesn't sound like a very stable scenario. I have a very scary situation. When he finally got the pressure down and the chamber opened, the person was recovered as the CO2 went down. He woke up and he could talk. But what does this mean? The bedding he had been lying on was soaked. He was almost floating in water from perspiration and his breath had produced so much vapor that fogged up the windows. The carbon dioxide basically improved the acidity of his cell proteins so that they could excrete the water. In the cancer situation, cells lose their carbon dioxide production and, with the low energy, become waterlogged. Soak up. too much water and can't do anything but grow. So apparently the carbon dioxide helped his cells to excrete the water very fast. So it was just pouring out of all of his pores and through his lungs and kidneys and he could talk normally and felt very good when he woke up.

**CONTEXT:** So what should we do to enhance our carbon dioxide experience and get more of that into our cells and our blood?

**RAY PEAT:** Chemicals in the environment, estrogenic materials, stimulate hyperventilation. Estrogen pills of all sorts increase hyperventilation and imbalance the blood, minerals and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Would you talk a little bit about the distinction between progesterone, Pregnenolone and estrogen just in terms of giving a frame of reference to the public?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen is essentially... anti-oxidative and anti-thyroid. Thyroid is our basic oxygen-using hormone. So, if you can have good thyroid function, you're going to be producing enough carbon dioxide. And estrogen, in many ways, it actually blocks the secretion of thyroid hormone. But on the cellular level, it changes the way oxygen is used. Diverting it from making carbon dioxide to consuming energy, shifting away from glucose metabolism, which produces carbon dioxide, to fat metabolism, which makes less CO2, and stimulating the uptake of water as a result of this shift in energy production. So estrogen causes the breasts, and the uterus, and pituitary to swell up by taking water into the cell. The extra water stimulates cell division, so it causes the uterine growth and the breast growth and so on.

**CONTEXT:** So I take it from listening to you and from reading your work that you are not into anti-aging, even bioidentical anti-aging hormones via estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** Definitely not, because the older and more stressed a cell or tissue is, the more estrogen it tends to produce. A young healthy person produces estrogen primarily in the ovaries, with some in the adrenal glands cortex. With stress, aging, falling thyroid function, ability to synthesize progesterone, every cell in the body develops the ability to make estrogen and loses the ability to excrete it into the bloodstream. So, simply by becoming deficient in... progesterone, your blood test won't show that you are deficient in estrogen because progesterone is needed to get the estrogen from the cell into the bloodstream. But inside the cell is where estrogen works. And so your fat cells and brain cells, skin, every tissue in the body has the capacity to make estrogen when it's under stress. People with diabetes, their tissues... all through the body are producing excess estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think of the fat cell relationship to estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's the major bulk of it, and some of that is actually getting into the bloodstream. But the breast tissue itself starts producing estrogen. Even though it's thought of as the target of the estrogen, it becomes the source of estrogen, too, and the uterus.

**CONTEXT:** You know, there's some people Dave Asprey from the Bulletproof Executive. He's popularized butter and coffee. What do you think of that?

**RAY PEAT:** Each one is good, but I think cream is better in coffee.

**CONTEXT:** You mean tasting?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it tastes better. He's talking about not margarine but butter to get your saturated fats in get the CLA in the brain first thing in the morning The butter just floats on the coffee and the sort of messy but not when you mix it in a blender You don't need to do that if you use good cream I use both.

**CONTEXT:** Let's get to coconut oil. I was sitting at a Thai place about a year ago This guy walks in and he sat down near me. I ordered a coconut one of those pure coconuts and I go oh I just love coconuts and he goes you Americans are crazy with the coconuts already and the coconut oil. What is it with you? I said it's really good for you and we started to talk but they laugh at us but yet they live on coconuts and coconut oil. Talk to the public about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** Again in the 1970s. I was attracted to it by reading an article in which they had fed several groups. I think it was 15 groups of rats on different diets including either a high fat saturated fat, a low saturated fat diet, a very high polyunsaturated fat diet, and a very low fat diet with only polyunsaturates and so on. So that they had 15 different compositions. Very high fat, very low fat, pure saturated. Pure unsaturated. And at the end of their life, the leanest rats were the ones that ate the saturated coconut oil diet, regardless of whether it was high fat or low fat and the fat animals were the ones that had the pure polyunsaturated fat. Again, even a low fat diet, if it was purely polyunsaturated, made them the fattest animals. So it wasn't the quantity. It was the unsaturation. In the last several years, people have started talking about the saturation index, meaning the proportion of saturated fats to polyunsaturated in your tissues. And cancer patients are very low on the saturation index. So it's not only obesity producing, it's associated with high incidence of cancer to have highly polyunsaturated fat diet.

**CONTEXT:** I have a question about thyroid and the kind of thyroid that you recommend people to take. I realize that you're not to prescribe anything on the show, but do you agree that people are still taking Armour thyroid or do you have a particular thyroid that you think is more effective for what's going on today?

**RAY PEAT:** The original Armour product was pretty stable for, I think it was 90 years, and they tested all of their batches on mice and would adjust. The composition, because it varied from animal to animal, and they would test it to make sure that it had exactly the same potency, and when the finished product was tested and compared to others, it was much more consistent than, for example, the synthetic Synthroid product, which varied a lot from batch to batch. But Armour was an extremely well controlled product. Within, Revlon bought it, and the price went up from When I was getting it as late as 1990, it was eight dollars for a thousand tablets, and after Revlon bought it, the price doubled or tripled. They don't own Armour Thyroid, do they now? It went through three or four changes of ownership each time with the price doubling. So from eight tenths of a cent per tablet, it now is over fifty cents per tablet. Right, but that's a pharmaceutical industry phenomenon, right? Yeah, but at the same time they were changing the additives in it, and there have been periods when the tablets wouldn't dissolve, or they had different behavior, so I stopped using it in the early 90s, because some people found the pills were going through undigested. So I started using synthetic products. Cyrolar was the armor company's synthetic. Equivalent, since they tested every batch on mice, different synthetic compositions, and got one that acted just like the original armor product, so the sale of the company involved the sale of that product for several years. I recommended that one, but then it became hard to get. Luckily, two or three other companies had copied their formula. Proloid had been a colloid purified from the gland, and they changed. Proloid S, meaning synthetic, but the product is basically the similar composition, in effect, to thyrolar and a couple of other products. Seno Plus is one that I've used for a long time, and it's very steady and reliable.

**CONTEXT:** Is that also a synthetic?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Some people listening are going to say, why, Dr. Peter, are you recommending a synthetic over something more bio-identical or bio? Well, the Armored Company... invested a tremendous amount of work and research in their product. Smaller companies haven't had access to that research, and when they change their additives, for example, sometimes it changes the way the product works. I didn't know there were additives to thyroid. Most of the products have had some changes over the years. Armored used only sugar and magnesium stearate, I think, for the binders. They would adjust the amount of sugar slightly according to the animals they used, so that it always had the same functional potency. But now the companies don't have the resources to test every batch on animals, and there just can't be the quality that Armored had achieved.

**CONTEXT:** What happened to Cytomel? Remember Cytomel?

**RAY PEAT:** In its foreign forms, it's called senomel or cynomel. Okay. But it's made by the same recipe. And so it has been very valuable and consistent.

**CONTEXT:** You know the whole testing of both the thyroid and the hormone matrix in men and women has really changed over the years. I remember that to test the thyroid they would take your blood. And some people now say to test the thyroid take your urine? They used to do that with male and female hormones. Instead of the blood they say the active. Hormones are showing up more effectively in the in a 24-hour urine sample. Do you agree with that?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think it's a better business The blood isn't such a great test for thyroid anyway Because if you have more estrogen more cortisol more free fatty acids different amounts of protein A given amount of t3 or t4 in your blood isn't going to have the same effect on the cells and even the reverse t3 which goes up under stress interferes with the action of t3 unless you have a computer program to understand the whole physiology there's not much point in looking at the t3 and t4 you mean in the blood yeah

**CONTEXT:** What about free t3 because the anti-aging community says the real action and heart of the thyroid activity what's happening is in the free t3 do you agree with that

**RAY PEAT:** Ask them what they mean by free exactly the idea of a free hormone is very vague and contradictory the way they measure it I think currently they're still using a dialysis method that what passes through a dialysis membrane is called free but in the blood hormones actually travel with proteins and fats and in and on the blood cells some people talk about it traveling on the red blood cells but actually all of the hormones go in and out of red blood cells so you have to break down the red blood cells really to know what is actually in the blood and available to the cells the thyroid hormones can bind to albumin for example albumin has free access in and out of cells even into the nucleus so anything bound to the albumin is going in and out of cells

**CONTEXT:** So how do we test for thyroid? What's the most effective way to test for the condition of our thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Broder Barnes, who was educated in the 1930s, reflected a lot of the understanding that was based on the good research of the Armour Company. He advocated temperature, morning temperature especially, as a very important indicator in the functioning of the thyroid. He was one of the first other doctors in the 1930s. He used a combination of indicators. For example, some people showed that there was a mirror image relationship between blood cholesterol and thyroid. When you removed someone's thyroid gland, immediately the cholesterol increased in the bloodstream as the oxygen consumption decreased. If you then gave them a thyroid supplement, it was a mirror image again. Increasing thyroid and oxygen metabolism caused the cholesterol level to come down to normal. I've seen people lower their cholesterol. They were in a hurry to pass an insurance health test. Lower their cholesterol two to three hundred points in a week by using hourly doses. Not take a huge dose at once, but just adjust and keep their thyroid where it should be. Keratin was another. Low thyroid people had high keratin, and keratin is antagonistic to the female hormones in particular, but also it tends to block the thyroid. Reaction tests, the speed at which your muscles react or relax corresponds to your thyroid function and oxidative metabolism. Achilles tendon reflex relaxation. Great is what was used in the 1930s, but a lot of doctors look at how far you jump when they hit a reflex trigger, but it's the rate at which the muscle relaxes that corresponds to good thyroid function and your brain undergoes those same reactions so that on an electrical measurement of your brain waves or an electrocardiogram showing the speed and quality of the T wave, which is the relaxation rate wave. Those all improve under the influence of thyroid, so any indicator of quick relaxation, quick energy restoration, normalizing of cholesterol and various blood components, all of those help with the diagnosis.

**CONTEXT:** How many tablespoons of coconut oil a day do you have?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I haven't eaten it regularly for a long time. Incidentally, I've always used the cheap refined stuff. Now I use it just for... occasionally frying things. When I had a tablespoon or two every day over a period of, I guess it was six or eight weeks, I lost weight that I had had for about 20 years. Went back to my 1970 body weight.

**CONTEXT:** And you think it was just from that alone? You don't think it was from Pregnenolone?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I had used Pregnenolone before without any change when I experimented. In around 1980 with DHEA I noticed that I was looking slimmer, had a smaller waist, but when I weighed myself I weighed exactly the same. It turned out I had grown a little at the age of something like 44 and built more muscles so that even though I looked slimmer I was actually the same weight. But then about 12 years after that was when I started using a little coconut oil and went down about 14 pounds.

**CONTEXT:** You made a point of saying that you use the refined coconut oil and not the unrefined, which everybody recommends, the unrefined, you made a point of saying that, why?

**RAY PEAT:** Because a lot of people are allergic to the extraneous material other than the fat in the oil. So you use the refined? Yeah, the deodorized, basically tasteless kind. If you're not allergic to it, the very aromatic unrefined kind. It's nice for making ice cream, for example, cold-flavored, but for frying eggs, it tastes... Smells terrible. Yeah, it tastes terrible. Some people love it, but I don't know how they love it. They must do something with it.

**CONTEXT:** I want to ask you a little bit about serotonin. So many people, as they get older, start to lose their serotonin production or it goes down. Do you agree?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know. The way it's measured, I think the only simple way to measure it is by the breakdown product called 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA. That indicates how much you're destroying or excreting. To do a blood test, you want to see how much is in the platelets and how much is in the free liquid of the plasma, because the total amount in the platelet... As long as it's inside the cell, it isn't hurting you, but if it's free in the liquids of your body and is deficient in the platelet, that means something is causing it to be not retained properly as if they're excited. The normal function of the platelet is 95% of your body's serotonin is made in the intestine. Anything that inflames your intestine, even mechanical irritation, stretching it with a gas blow up, or irritating allergenic foods, all of these increase the intestines production of serotonin. And the serotonin moving from the intestine into the blood is picked up by the platelets and if they bind it firmly, they carry it to the lungs where the situation of the carbon dioxide-oxygen exchange causes them to release it where enzymes in the lungs destroy the serotonin. Negative ions in the air seem to help the lungs to destroy the serotonin in an oxidative process. If your lungs and platelets aren't getting rid of the excess serotonin made in an irritated intestine, then it gets to the brain and can cause things such as anxiety, aggression, and even depression turning on the inflammatory system. Serotonin is a major stimulant of the corticotropic release hormone which activates your pituitary to turn on your adrenal stress reaction. So serotonin reaching the brain is a powerful stressor. If people have a hard time relaxing, they have a hard time sleeping at night. Most often it's either poor nutrition or hypothyroidism. Some of the old people I mentioned who solved their problems by adding salt to their food noticed that when they followed the doctor's orders to not eat so much salt, they developed insomnia. In the study where they were told it was okay to add salt, their insomnia was cured. That led me to realize that salt is a major factor in lowering the stress hormones, especially adrenaline. One of its functions is to counteract the effect of too much serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** How is it that it is said, and this is a popular myth then, that serotonin in people over 50 is dropping and that's why they should take tryptophan at night because tryptophan produces more melatonin, but doesn't it also produce serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** Experiments show that especially the hydroxy tryptophan very directly corresponds to increased serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** And isn't serotonin the happy hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** No, the name means the pressure increase or the serum toner. It was identified in the 1950s as the cause of emotional disturbances, blood pressure disturbances, many circulatory problems. In the 70s, this myth about it being a happy hormone, on my website I explain some of the circumstances accounting for that very odd myth.

**CONTEXT:** Is that in the article serotonin, depression and aggression, the problem of brain energy?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's one of them. There are several of them.

**CONTEXT:** Let's talk about radiation. We're covering a lot of subjects. I know we're going quickly on these, but there's a lot to say on this for women over a certain age. We're all told that we need to have an annual... not only breast exams but we need to have a mammogram which I refuse to do. I do a thermogram. We're told that we need to have annual x-rays at our dentist. I know people who have had MRI after MRI after MIRI and they're being radiated. Let's talk about it. What's your take on the whole thing?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s I got interested in the issue and I've been following it ever since. In the 1950s. The government would basically destroy the career and reputation of anyone who said radiation was harmful. They were in the business of selling their atomic bombs and atmospheric testing, so they had to say it wasn't killing Americans to drop radioactive fallout on them. But later calculations showed that in fact at a minimum it killed 15,000 Americans, not to mention the rest of the world. That was a minimal calculation. But in the 1950s, one of the big mouthpieces was John Goffman, who happened also to be a promoter of the cholesterol theory of heart disease. I considered him sort of a demon because every time someone would point out the dangers of fallout, he was there to say it hasn't been proven that it causes cancer or sterility or mutated children or mutated great-grandchildren and so on. Always don't worry, it's probably harmless, but in the 1960s he later reported that he came to consciousness in the middle of one of those lectures and realized that he was saying insane things, but he had been a very influential government spokesman ever since the late 40s through the 60s and his whole life after that was trying to bring some sanity back to the radiation business. One of his last works, it might have been his last major book, was on the radiation influence on health. Medical radiation, he showed, was currently the biggest cause of breast cancer and heart disease because of flowing radiation through the chests of millions of people at frequent intervals. The heart and the breasts were getting exposed by chest x-rays and mammograms. He showed, for example, that the incidence of these diseases corresponds to the availability and use of medical services, so that the rich areas around San Francisco, for example, had the country's highest rate of breast cancer and very high heart disease. West Virginia, with the lowest access to medical care on average, had the country's lowest incidence of breast cancer, lowest mortality. That corresponds with all of the honest animal research. It overlaps very interestingly with estrogen cancer research. People who did studies, including both radiation and estrogen exposure, showed that they synergized. You get a certain amount of cancerization from either radiation or estrogen, but when you have both of them, it's even more than additive. It's compounding.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think about Homeland Security doing low-level ionizing radiation equipment on people that are trying to travel?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know the current motivation, but one of their apparatuses that was irradiating people for a time, the business was owned by the head of the agency. By Michael Chertoff, correct? I think it's primarily. Money making business as well as keeping the population fearful.

**CONTEXT:** Having to do with health, what do you think of people going through those machines?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, all of those types of radiation are known to be harmful.

**CONTEXT:** Do you know what they told me at the airport last year? Somebody said when I refused to go through the machine and I said, it's okay, you can do a pat down, then I won't even tell you what happened on that. The woman said to me, when you fly in the air, you're getting just as much radiation.

**RAY PEAT:** That's a story that was invented by both the people doing the atmospheric bomb testing and by the nuclear power industry, which was closely involved with the bomb industry. The whole thing was a single culture, people going in and out of military bomb manufacture and private electrical power generation. Their story was that these ions, the radioactive isotopes of various metals and other compounds that are released from bombs and from the nuclear reactors, including Chernobyl, Fukushima, and any operating reactor, for example, the area around the Rancho Seco reactor in California, the water supply contains isotopes from that reactor. that are probably still causing cancer many years later. These deadly particles that release radiation in your body after they've been ingested or breathed in have almost an absolute carcinogenic effect. Each one destroys a series of cells, mutates them, and the radiation from an x-ray, which is powerfully carcinogenic, is many times less carcinogenic than breathing in these particles. But the low-voltage X-ray that produces the best image of a breast, for example, and is still being the devices that produce the low-voltage, sharp-imaging mammogram devices, these are still being promoted, even though it's known that low-voltage, low-energy X-rays are much more carcinogenic than the high-voltage. The principle is that low-energy... radiation is more easily absorbed by tissues. Gamma rays will penetrate through a meter or more of concrete, which means that passing through your body, relatively little of their energy is absorbed by the tissues. So the extremely low energy of ultraviolet, for example, 100% of it stops in the first few millimeters of your skin, so you get a very intense sunburn. The higher the energy is... the less tissue damage there is for a given amount of radiation because it passes through without doing anything. The radiation you get in an airplane, it's similar to living at a higher altitude. This is high energy cosmic radiation primarily. Isn't that a gamma ray? It releases gamma rays which are much less harmful than low energy x-rays. Much less of it is absorbed with cosmic rays. It almost all passes through your bodies harmlessly. It's going at such a high velocity that it leaves a stream of minor ionization, but it seldom produces carcinogenesis. And studies looking at the cancer incidence in the United States, or even within a state like Texas, where there's a variation of a stable population at different altitudes. They see that there's a negative correlation between cancer and altitude. That corresponds to the fact that at high altitude you get a lot of cosmic rays, but they're high energy and pass through you. At low altitude, those same rays have passed through a thicker layer of atmosphere running into more oxygen and nitrogen atoms causing collisions that release radioactive particles. So you're actually getting more radiation from cosmic rays at sea level than at high altitude. But the industry, which has known that, and that the actual incidence of cancer increases at the lower altitude, the industry has been lying about that for 50 years.

**CONTEXT:** You know, I just found out I'm taking this trip to Spain this May, and I found out that Spain is the second highest country elevation in Europe. First is Switzerland and the second is Spain. Have you ever been?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I've never went to Spain.

**CONTEXT:** So I'll be at a very high altitude having a good laugh. Do you live in the mountains?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Do you live at low altitude? I'm surprised. I have a house in Mexico that I hope to get to soon at 6,600 feet, but it's close to... the volcanoes where you can get up to 17,000.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, wow. The higher I went, the better I felt. It's something you can feel immediately as a lack of stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Let's go back to how we get more protective CO2, because I don't think we finish that, do you?

**CONTEXT:** No, in an acute situation, you can apply it for high blood pressure, for example, or anxiety or other acute symptoms, you can... Breathe, re-breathe into a paper bag for a minute or two at a time until you've got the feeling that you're suffocating and then breathe some fresh air and doing that two or three times a day is usually enough to, over a period of a few days, to lower your blood pressure and it'll stop the anxiety quickly. But for something like arthritic knee or foot or a broken bone or sprained ankle or such... that you can put in a plastic bag filled with carbon dioxide. This has been done mostly in Europe. That's the only place I know of hospitals that have done it. But I've seen people do it and radically increase the healing of injured tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** Once I was coming home with a huge tank, must have been a 35-pound tank or so, holding it with the valve at the top and I stumbled on the steps to a brick walk. And I didn't want to drop the tank and risk breaking the valve off, which would create a rocket effect. So I hugged the tank to my body and went down, fell on my wrist against the bricks with my body and the tank on top of it.

**CONTEXT:** I saw it immediately start to turn blue and I rushed in the house, got a plastic bag and filled it with carbon dioxide and held my hand in it for an hour. And brought my hand out. There was no injury.

**RAY PEAT:** How did you get the CO2? I had the tank right there in my hand.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I've never went to Spain.

**CONTEXT:** So I'll be at a very high altitude having a good laugh. Do you live in the mountains?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Do you live at low altitude? I'm surprised. I have a house in Mexico that I hope to get to soon at 6,600 feet, but it's close to... the volcanoes where you can get up to 17,000.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, wow. The higher I went, the better I felt. It's something you can feel immediately as a lack of stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Let's go back to how we get more protective CO2, because I don't think we finish that, do you?

**CONTEXT:** No, in an acute situation, you can apply it for high blood pressure, for example, or anxiety or other acute symptoms, you can... Breathe, re-breathe into a paper bag for a minute or two at a time until you've got the feeling that you're suffocating and then breathe some fresh air and doing that two or three times a day is usually enough to, over a period of a few days, to lower your blood pressure and it'll stop the anxiety quickly. But for something like arthritic knee or foot or a broken bone or sprained ankle or such... that you can put in a plastic bag filled with carbon dioxide. This has been done mostly in Europe. That's the only place I know of hospitals that have done it. But I've seen people do it and radically increase the healing of injured tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** Once I was coming home with a huge tank, must have been a 35-pound tank or so, holding it with the valve at the top and I stumbled on the steps to a brick walk. And I didn't want to drop the tank and risk breaking the valve off, which would create a rocket effect. So I hugged the tank to my body and went down, fell on my wrist against the bricks with my body and the tank on top of it.

**CONTEXT:** I saw it immediately start to turn blue and I rushed in the house, got a plastic bag and filled it with carbon dioxide and held my hand in it for an hour. And brought my hand out. There was no injury.

**RAY PEAT:** How did you get the CO2? I had the tank right there in my hand.

**CONTEXT:** You know, I just found out I'm taking this trip to Spain this May, and I found out that Spain is the second highest country elevation in Europe. First is Switzerland and the second is Spain. Have you ever been?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I've never went to Spain.

**CONTEXT:** So I'll be at a very high altitude having a good laugh. Do you live in the mountains?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Do you live at low altitude? I'm surprised. I have a house in Mexico that I hope to get to soon at 6,600 feet, but it's close to... the volcanoes where you can get up to 17,000.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, wow. The higher I went, the better I felt. It's something you can feel immediately as a lack of stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Let's go back to how we get more protective CO2, because I don't think we finish that, do you?

**CONTEXT:** No, in an acute situation, you can apply it for high blood pressure, for example, or anxiety or other acute symptoms, you can... Breathe, re-breathe into a paper bag for a minute or two at a time until you've got the feeling that you're suffocating and then breathe some fresh air and doing that two or three times a day is usually enough to, over a period of a few days, to lower your blood pressure and it'll stop the anxiety quickly. But for something like arthritic knee or foot or a broken bone or sprained ankle or such... that you can put in a plastic bag filled with carbon dioxide. This has been done mostly in Europe. That's the only place I know of hospitals that have done it. But I've seen people do it and radically increase the healing of injured tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** Once I was coming home with a huge tank, must have been a 35-pound tank or so, holding it with the valve at the top and I stumbled on the steps to a brick walk. And I didn't want to drop the tank and risk breaking the valve off, which would create a rocket effect. So I hugged the tank to my body and went down, fell on my wrist against the bricks with my body and the tank on top of it.

**CONTEXT:** I saw it immediately start to turn blue and I rushed in the house, got a plastic bag and filled it with carbon dioxide and held my hand in it for an hour. And brought my hand out. There was no injury.

**RAY PEAT:** How did you get the CO2? I had the tank right there in my hand.

**RAY PEAT:** I bought it from a welding shop.

**CONTEXT:** You know, I just found out I'm taking this trip to Spain this May, and I found out that Spain is the second highest country elevation in Europe. First is Switzerland and the second is Spain. Have you ever been?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I've never went to Spain.

**CONTEXT:** So I'll be at a very high altitude having a good laugh. Do you live in the mountains?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Do you live at low altitude? I'm surprised. I have a house in Mexico that I hope to get to soon at 6,600 feet, but it's close to... the volcanoes where you can get up to 17,000.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, wow. The higher I went, the better I felt. It's something you can feel immediately as a lack of stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Let's go back to how we get more protective CO2, because I don't think we finish that, do you?

**CONTEXT:** No, in an acute situation, you can apply it for high blood pressure, for example, or anxiety or other acute symptoms, you can... Breathe, re-breathe into a paper bag for a minute or two at a time until you've got the feeling that you're suffocating and then breathe some fresh air and doing that two or three times a day is usually enough to, over a period of a few days, to lower your blood pressure and it'll stop the anxiety quickly. But for something like arthritic knee or foot or a broken bone or sprained ankle or such... that you can put in a plastic bag filled with carbon dioxide. This has been done mostly in Europe. That's the only place I know of hospitals that have done it. But I've seen people do it and radically increase the healing of injured tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** Once I was coming home with a huge tank, must have been a 35-pound tank or so, holding it with the valve at the top and I stumbled on the steps to a brick walk. And I didn't want to drop the tank and risk breaking the valve off, which would create a rocket effect. So I hugged the tank to my body and went down, fell on my wrist against the bricks with my body and the tank on top of it.

**CONTEXT:** I saw it immediately start to turn blue and I rushed in the house, got a plastic bag and filled it with carbon dioxide and held my hand in it for an hour. And brought my hand out. There was no injury.
