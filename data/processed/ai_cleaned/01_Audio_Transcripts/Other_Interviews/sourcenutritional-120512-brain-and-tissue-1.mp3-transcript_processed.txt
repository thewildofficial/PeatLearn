**RAY PEAT:** I had been teaching linguistics and painting alternately, but I had been interested in science from childhood. But I saw medical so-called science going off in very perverse directions through the 1950s. And so I didn't think of going to the university graduate school in in biology because they my bad experience in high school biology, very very retarded textbooks and so on, it made me think that there wasn't much science in the biological field. But finally, I decided that I needed to use laboratory instruments that were too expensive to get myself, so I enrolled in graduate school and figured that just by not arguing with the teachers, I could get through the program and get to use the labs, which I did.
**CONTEXT:** What caused you to get into this field of hormones and progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** A group of 13 estrogen......companies got together in 1942, when it was already known that estrogen caused miscarriages, sterility, cancer, seizures, and so on, but they had a product, and they wanted to sell it as the female hormone, even though it's also a male hormone, but they got together, and with advertising, and pressure, political pressure, they convinced the FDA to approve the use of estrogen to prevent miscarriages, which it caused, actually, and by advertising, they got the public interested in estrogen as an anti-aging hormone, so it started really with a definite conspiracy of 13 companies in 1942.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the pharmaceutical industry's role in promoting estrogen. Can you elaborate on the history of this promotion?

**RAY PEAT:** The body has many protective systems for inactivating estrogen, the strong estrogen, and so it has enzymes to oxidize in different ways this fairly reduced form of estrogen. It also has several other systems for destroying estrogen efficiently. If your metabolism is working very well, estrogen should be totally eliminated after about 12 hours following ovulation and implantation. It should be disposed of thoroughly within a few days of ovulation.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that the body has ways to inactivate estrogen. Can you explain how this process works and how quickly estrogen should be eliminated?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen is just supposed to be biologically active as an excitant at an early stage of injury, like it slightly inflames the uterus to cause the growth of cells preparing a place for the embryo to implant. But if the estrogen stays at the present too long, it kills the embryo by overexciting the surrounding cells. In the 1950s, my thesis advisor Soderwald was demonstrating that by giving an estrogen supplement to a pregnant animal, the day that the animals have become pregnant. You can prevent implantation by a small amount such as is used in birth control pills and that's how they work by a quick abortion actually rather than preventing conception they're preventing implantation and he found that on the second third fourth days and so on following implantation if you gave just slightly larger amounts of estrogen all the way Until delivery, staying on the same slope of increasing doses of estrogen, you could kill the embryo or the fetus just by adjusting the dose of estrogen to counteract the increasing progesterone which is there to maintain pregnancy. So at any stage, estrogen produces abortion on it.
**CONTEXT:** You've discussed how estrogen can be harmful in pregnancy. Can you explain the mechanism by which estrogen can cause abortion or prevent implantation?

**RAY PEAT:** When a woman is either having a sluggish liver, low thyroid, so that her estrogen is chronically too high or her progesterone is chronically low, she will often bleed every month, several months into the pregnancy as if she were menstruating on cycle. And during any of those cyclic surges of estrogen, that's when miscarriages are most likely to happen.
**CONTEXT:** How does a woman's hormonal balance, specifically estrogen and progesterone levels, affect the likelihood of miscarriage during pregnancy?

**RAY PEAT:** It damages the sexual differentiation. And so this will lead to so many private rooting reasons. There is some research that stress prematally causes an intersexual differentiation.
**CONTEXT:** How does a highly estrogenic environment during pregnancy affect the sexual differentiation of the child?

**RAY PEAT:** The main thing is that the male has smaller genitals and the distance between the genitals and the anus is decreased in proportion to the estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** What are the specific physical manifestations of intersexual differentiation in males due to prenatal estrogen exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're seeing the distance that characterizes the estrogen exposure of male genitals decreasing in recent decades in the polluted countries. And so would you say that oftentimes when people say, hey, I was born this way, as in men who are gay, women who are lesbian, truly are born this way due to this? Sure, I think that's a big part of it. You can see it in crocodiles and alligators and ocean otters and fish and frogs. Everyone is affected by the estrogen pollution.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that the distance between the genitals and the anus in males is decreasing. How does this relate to the concept of being "born this way" and its potential connection to sexual orientation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, two or three papers were published. I discussed them in my radiation newsletter in January of a year ago. They showed that estrogen was synergistic with radiation. In causing cancer, and that the same way that progesterone blocks cancer produced by estrogen, it also blocks cancer produced by radiation. And so if someone knew that they had a history of a lot of diagnostic x-rays, one of the ways they could possibly prevent some long-term effects is to start using progesterone on a regular basis? Yeah, I think that on the long-term, that is protective. They know that when they do the so-called gamma knife brain treatment, that the symptoms of nerve cell degeneration aren't seen for usually more than 18 months, sometimes several years later, the cells stay in an inflamed condition, like they've seen the blood serum 20 years after the Chernobyl, 50 years after the Japanese bomb exposures. They've seen a chronically inflamed condition that shows up even in the blood serum decades after exposure. So I think that's the sort of thing that can be reversed even at a late date so that the chronic inflammatory state doesn't persist.
**CONTEXT:** You've stated that x-rays are estrogenic. How does progesterone protect against the cancer-causing effects of radiation, and can it be used preventatively after exposure to diagnostic x-rays?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin A works with progesterone as another protective thing but it also happens to sensitize you to the radiation that the the radiation breaks down the vitamin A in your tissue and so if you replace it after the injury. That helps counteract the estrogen-like effects.
**CONTEXT:** Besides progesterone, what other substances can help protect against radiation damage, and how does Vitamin A play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** A low thyroid person can get symptoms of vitamin A poisoning from just a very small amount, like 5,000 units. When I was in my teens and twenties, I found that I needed 50 to 100,000 units to prevent having acne or even leukoplakia. Following dental x-rays, I would get these white spongy growths inside my cheeks that the dentists said were either cancerous or pre-cancerous, and I found that these big doses of vitamin A would clear it up completely in a week, and that's a pre-cancerous estrogen stimulated condition that also appears on the surface of the uterus. And vitamin A and progesterone similarly will reverse that.
**CONTEXT:** What is a safe and effective dosage of Vitamin A, especially for someone with low thyroid function, and what benefits have you observed with high doses of Vitamin A in treating conditions like leukoplakia?

**RAY PEAT:** The basic thing that thyroid does is increase your oxidative metabolism. And when the synthroid product came on the market, only thyroxin rather than the complete combination of T3 and T4, when that came on the market, they wanted to say that thyroxin was the real thyroid hormone and it happens that it doesn't stimulate oxidative metabolism until it's turned into T3 and so for about 20 years there was the doctrine that thyroid doesn't stimulate oxidative metabolism as its basic mechanism but in fact the thyroxin interferes with the oxygen. Oxygen metabolism if it's out of balance and it's really the increased consumption of oxygen and production of defensive energy systems that makes thyroid valuable and for example the oxidative energy is used to convert cholesterol into a pregnant woman progesterone. DHEA, male hormones and so on to counteract estrogen as part of the defense against estrogen and so if you have excess cholesterol it's usually because your thyroid is deficient or your vitamin A is deficient and you aren't converting it to the protective progesterone testosterone hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the fundamental role of thyroid hormone in metabolism and how the shift from T3/T4 combinations to thyroxin-only formulations impacted our understanding of thyroid's function?

**RAY PEAT:** Lately, everyone's been calling their stuff organic. I was getting a kind of organic whipping cream for my coffee and I saw they were putting curaginan in it and when they can say that curaginan is an organic food just because you get it out of the ocean, the ocean isn't such a great clean food source anymore and curaginan is highly allergenic and people have died by contact with it and many people have very serious allergic reactions to it when they eat it and when it breaks down it becomes carcinogenic but it's still allowed not only in the food supply but this can be called organic. Some of the nuclear industry factions were applying to the government to be able to call nuclear waste fertilized food organic.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the current definition and labeling of "organic" foods, particularly concerning ingredients like carrageenan and potential inclusion of irradiated or nuclear waste-fertilized products?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, carotene is the main problem with some of the foods called organic. But naturally, it's best if you can get really clean, organic foods. Well, today you'd probably have to grow it yourself.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned carrageenan as a problem with some organic foods. What are the primary issues with carrageenan, and what is the ideal way to obtain clean, organic foods today?

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone is well-made and pure and in recent years everything on the market does seem to be pure if the retailer isn't adding a lot of crazy excipients but pure Pregnenolone has since the 1940s with experiments in ramps. It's been known to have essentially no side effects at any dose. They gave rats a 10 gram single dose by stomach tube, which would be like a person eating a pound of it. And the only effect was that the rats weren't hungry until their stomachs had emptied the stuff out. And if any of the rats were under stress at the time of the experiment... their stress hormones went down to normal. That was the only side effect that it stopped abnormal stress reactions.
**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the safety and efficacy of pregnenolone, particularly regarding potential side effects and its impact on stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, just after I read the rat experiment and saw that it had made people more efficient. In studies of workers using it, I decided to take 3,000 milligrams to 4,000 milligrams every day for a year. And I felt like I had great resistance, felt no stress no matter what was happening.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that pregnenolone can normalize stress hormones. Did you personally experience this effect, and what dosage did you use?

**RAY PEAT:** I pretty much stopped lecturing about 20 years ago when the word got out, what I was saying about unsaturated fat. The doctors stopped wanting to hear me when they knew what I would say about estrogen, and then the health food industry stopped wanting to hear me when they knew what I would say about corn oil and soy oil and the polyunsaturated oil, fish oil and so on. Because those are so important to their business that they didn't want bad information put out about them.
**CONTEXT:** Why did you largely stop lecturing, and what specific information about unsaturated fats and oils led to a decline in interest from the medical and health food industries?

**RAY PEAT:** I see the polyunsaturated N-3 and N-6 oils as being behind all the inflammatory degenerative diseases. Thank you for watching. And basically all of the degenerative diseases involve an inflammatory component which is amplified by the N-3 and N-6 breakdown products.
**CONTEXT:** What is your view on the role of polyunsaturated fats (N-3 and N-6 oils) in degenerative diseases, and how do they contribute to inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** The prostaglandins and various isoprostanes and free radical breakdown products and so on. And those fats happen to inhibit the enzymes which make our natural N-9 polyunsaturated fats such as the mead acid. And it's called an essential fatty acid deficiency when you can find the mead acid at minus nine in the blood, but it happens that that's a protective anti-inflammatory fat that gives great resistance to the animals that are so-called deficient in the essential fatty acids.
**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the specific mechanisms by which polyunsaturated fats contribute to inflammation and disease, and how they interfere with the production of protective fats like mead acid?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I try to avoid those as far as possible, even avoiding pork and chicken that have been fed those foods.
**CONTEXT:** Given the detrimental effects of polyunsaturated oils, what practical advice do you have for avoiding them, including in animal products?

**RAY PEAT:** The nuclear industry, like the estrogen industry and the oil industry, has been very busy with propaganda ever since the 1940s, convincing the public that nuclear power will be good for the public in many ways. They've been selling radioactive potions since the 1920s. People are still selling radioactive rocks as cures. They used to sell it in bottles to cure impotence and arthritis and so on. You can get some quick relief from x-raying your knee, for example, for arthritis. It kills the cells that produce inflammation but it creates a long-term systemic inflammation that is much worse. For the short-term relief and that's the sort of thing that happens with the breakdown of fish oils. You get short-term suppression of inflammation but long-term promotion of inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** You've drawn parallels between the propaganda of the nuclear, estrogen, and oil industries. Can you explain how the nuclear industry has used propaganda, and what are the parallels between the short-term relief and long-term harm seen with radiation therapy and the breakdown of fish oils?

**RAY PEAT:** The fallout in your food is equivalent to flying across the country on an airplane, for example. There are several kinds of lies built into that. Every person who repeats that is repeating layered lying propaganda. For example, it's true that you can say there's a certain amount of radiation. from cosmic rays coming through the airplane when you're at 35,000 feet. But it happens that the biological effect of radiation, cosmic rays, at say 10,000 feet altitude on the mountain or in an airplane, that has less biological effect by a great amount. per unit of radiation that the same cosmic rays do at sea level. And the cosmic rays at high altitude pass right through you doing very little. But on the way through the atmosphere they run into air atoms causing secondary and tertiary breakdown nuclear fusion. And it's so interesting. Fission products produced on the way down close to sea level that increase the environmental radiation and that's why a big part of the reason why cancer rates are much lower, heart disease is much lower when you live at from five to ten thousand feet elevation above sea level. Closer to sea level. The cosmic rays are more intense. So the nuclear industry is turning things upside down to say that eating a banana or a Fukushima oyster or whatever can be compared to cosmic rays. They've got it exactly backwards.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that the nuclear industry uses propaganda to downplay radiation risks. Can you explain why the comparison of food contamination to airplane travel radiation is misleading, and what is the actual relationship between altitude, cosmic rays, and radiation exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** The ultraviolet produces effects in your skin that are very similar to what x-rays and cosmic rays and gamma rays produce throughout your tissues. It's just that the the toxic effect of ultraviolet is limited to two or three millimeters. Near the top of your skin and it happens that the red light of sunlight, the yellow, green, orange, red frequencies happen to be neutralizers of the damage done by radiation of the toxic kind. For example, experiments with frogs would give them a certain dose of gamma rays that would kill them. Very quickly. But if they gave the dose and within the hour gave them some very bright red light following the gamma ray exposure, they recovered, they weren't sick.
**CONTEXT:** You've stated that ultraviolet radiation has effects similar to x-rays and gamma rays. How does sunlight, specifically the red and orange frequencies, act as a neutralizer of radiation damage, and what evidence supports this?

**RAY PEAT:** Natural sunlight contains enough of that, if you filter out that protective red and orange light. Sunlight will even kill plants that normally grow all day in the sun. The blue light and ultraviolet is toxic, even the plants, but it's the red light that allows plants to stand the ultraviolet all day.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that red and orange light in sunlight are protective. How does natural sunlight provide these protective frequencies, and what happens when these frequencies are filtered out?

**RAY PEAT:** You don't want too much of the ultraviolet because your blood does circulate up through the surface of your skin and your white blood cells will get killed every time you get sunburned. So you don't want to get sunburned and having a tan the melanin pigment catches the biggest part of the ultraviolet and protects your skin from that immune suppressing.
**CONTEXT:** What are the risks associated with excessive ultraviolet exposure, particularly concerning white blood cells, and how does tanning and melanin pigment offer protection?

**RAY PEAT:** Sometimes a vitamin D deficiency is involved. Your body knows that it needs more vitamin D and so it doesn't make the pigment allowing more ultraviolet to be absorbed and I've seen people who couldn't tan suddenly tanning normally when they took some vitamin D.
**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between vitamin D deficiency and the inability to tan, and how can vitamin D supplementation improve tanning ability?
