It would be nice, I think. that the traditional remedy was to be at least for a week or, I don't know, I guess, for several weeks. And, you know, they did, they took care of it.

So, we're going to start with that for the first time as a start. But for the rest of the time, it's very, very important.

**CONTEXT:** The speaker discusses personal well-being, health benefits, and family history of diabetes, mentioning sugar intake and traditional remedies.

**RAY PEAT:** But could that be an opportunity for you to sort out your additional statements that these people are Telemannias et cetera? Well, I think the nutritional factors that are going to do this or the Ci sci or re-L mac trains You start with theadımoxy Maybe to the STUDY proteins and fluorescent you have to think in your head. If you just hear it, something like that, I think we can talk about in the future. So this is a simple answer to the question, but I think it's better to just say new trends, current, current, current trends, and more of that, and more of that in the future.
