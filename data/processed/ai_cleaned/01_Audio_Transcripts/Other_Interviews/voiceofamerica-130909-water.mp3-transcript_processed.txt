**RAY PEAT:** "Albert St. Georgie and the lectures. He went around the country doing demonstrations of living tissue and the state of water inside muscles, for example. And he could show that the... condition of the water as it affected molecules changed instantaneously when a muscle was stimulated or when a nerve was activated."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his early interest in the state of water within living tissues, inspired by Albert St. Georgie's work.

**RAY PEAT:** "Linus Pauling did some research that lined up with Albert St. George's, and he proposed that anesthetics work by altering the state of water in cells."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat connects Linus Pauling's research on anesthetics to the concept of altered water states in cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "I decided that despite... the established academic science culture lacking any interest in what I wanted to study, I would... I had enough experience with universities to go through, use their instruments to do the research I wanted, without getting indoctrinated by their belief that everything is governed by... genes and molecules and membranes and so on."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat articulates his decision to pursue research on water's role in biology independently, bypassing the prevailing reductionist scientific dogma.

**RAY PEAT:** "It was a philosophical doctrine that took over. Related to the mainline medicine, allopathic medicine had its idea of what an organism is. And the gene people were representing almost a religious line of thinking that hated to admit that organisms were as complicated as they are. They were imposing this system of beliefs all through science. There's a book by someone that I knew in the 1960s called Cold War in Biology that explains how there was a doctrinaire, a political campaign going on all through the universities of America to... change the thinking and direct thoughts to genetic engineering to make it an industrial, medical, manageable concept of how organisms work. Where the other people were going directly to the organisms, seeing what happens, the main line thinking wanted to go from factories to... to doctors, to what they could sell. So, what they were doing was putting the marketing department first."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the philosophical and political reasons behind the neglect of water's role in biology, attributing it to a focus on industrial and marketable concepts like genetic engineering over holistic organismal understanding.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I was taking my first course in muscle physiology, water was absolutely neglected. The membrane was there to keep the water inside, and the enzymes caused reactions, but the way the water handled, it controlled the chemical reactions. Absolutely neglected and the professors didn't want to talk about it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reiterates the historical neglect of water's functional role in cellular physiology within academic settings.

**RAY PEAT:** "But... A professor at the University of Washington now, Gerald Pollock, is demonstrating that he has videos available on the internet that are just amazing. He shows that the effect of a surface organizes water and causes water to be in control of things dissolved in it at a tremendous distance out from the surface, which is... vastly greater than the areas involved inside the cell."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights Gerald Pollock's research on the organizing effect of surfaces on water, demonstrating its significant influence beyond immediate molecular proximity.

**RAY PEAT:** "The aging process is essentially a loss of water. A baby has an extremely high water content in its tissues. 80 something percent, I think. And a very old person, it gets down approaching maybe 55 percent. And the function decreases along with the water so that a baby has an extremely high metabolic rate and ability to heal tissues."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat defines aging as a process of cellular dehydration, correlating water content with metabolic rate and healing capacity.

**RAY PEAT:** "The hormone that is most responsible for keeping the cells hydrated and functional, demonstrating the processes that Albert St. Georgie went around the country, demonstrating in lectures with fluorescent lights showing......that the muscle would become luminous when it contracted and dark when it was relaxed. These changes in the state of water are constantly being regulated, mainly by the thyroid hormone, letting us use oxygen to produce energy, and the thyroid maintains the protective hormones. is such as progesterone, pregnenolone, testosterone, DHEA, and under stress or injury, some of the testosterone or DHEA changes in the estrogen, which changes the ability to regulate water. It tends to create the edema state, but the edema reverses the functional state of the organism momentarily to put it back into a growth condition so that it can renew the cells."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the hormonal regulation of cellular hydration, emphasizing the roles of thyroid hormone, progesterone, and other protective hormones in maintaining water balance and cellular function, and how estrogen imbalances can lead to edema.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid and progesterone are the most powerful hormones in preserving the proper retention of water in cells. Not too much, not too little."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies thyroid and progesterone as the key hormones for optimal cellular water retention.

**RAY PEAT:** "There were some studies about 20 or 30 years ago in which if you feed the animal or even the tissue in a dish, if you feed it... saturated fats such as coconut oil, the cells of the skin grow in an orderly way, retaining their moisture, keeping the skin plump, firm, and resilient. If you feed them polyunsaturated fats, they mature very quickly as if under the influence of a vitamin A deficiency or... estrogen excess and they're more susceptible to sun damage, the cells grow slowly and in irregular columns and the skin overall is thinner, so the sun damage and too much polyunsaturated fat in the diet makes the skin age and become disorganized prematurely."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the differential effects of saturated fats (like coconut oil) versus polyunsaturated fats on cellular health and aging, highlighting the benefits of saturated fats for skin hydration and resilience.

**RAY PEAT:** "What about coconut water? I've studied it a little bit too. Well, it's a great source of minerals and if it's fresh it has very good sugar and the sugar oxidizes... produces carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide is the main power in regulating the alkalinity of cells. It's what moves minerals in and out of cells and in through your kidneys and so on. So the fruits, orange juice is an ideal source of carbohydrate because it has its own minerals with it, the same as coconut water. And milk is a good food. Cheese, because of the high minerals. So you're not anti-dairy. Your research hasn't proven anything about being anti-dairy. No, because of the high value of the high calcium content and the low ratio of phosphate to calcium, because it's a good source of fiber, so it's a good source of fiber, so it's a good source of fiber. Phosphate is an age-accelerating thing, so a diet high in meat and nuts, for example, has a serious excess of phosphate and a deficiency of calcium. And calcium is one of the best things for stimulating the rate of metabolism and preventing obesity. People who drink milk regularly. are a very slim population in proportion to the amount of calories they consume. And there have been a couple of studies in which dementia is much higher in populations that don't drink any milk."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the metabolic benefits of coconut water, orange juice, milk, and cheese, emphasizing their mineral content and the role of carbon dioxide in cellular alkalinity. He also highlights the importance of calcium and the detrimental effects of excess phosphate found in meat and nuts.

**RAY PEAT:** "The molecules are lined up such that the quantum energy is organized as it moves through. There's another very important website, Mei Wan Ho, her last name is just H-O, called, I think it's ISIS, I-S-I-S Institute for Science, and she writes about the coherence of organisms involving this quantum level organization of water molecules. And she has illustrations of the color continuity right through a whole organism showing that the light has to be organized by the organism as a whole, not by individual random atoms."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat references Mei Wan Ho's work on the quantum coherence of water molecules within organisms, suggesting an organized energy flow throughout the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "The water accumulates in a loose form. That's what causes the opacity of a cataract. It's actually too much water because it's out of control and disorganized. It's dehydrating too quickly. Well, the proteins are dehydrating. They are losing the control of the water. So the living substance is... There we go. Yeah, it's lost its water and the water is accumulating basically in random places."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that cataracts are caused by disorganized water accumulation within the lens, indicating a loss of protein control over water.

**RAY PEAT:** "The age pigment is involved, it's what you see accumulating in spots on old people's skin, but it starts anytime the tissue isn't getting enough oxygen to retain. It's watered the way it should. The polyunsaturated fats become oxidized and form clumps of this dark orange or brown or black pigment, and this wastes oxygen and creates a vicious circle. So it's definitely junk accumulating in cells. But with enough energy, progesterone and thyroid, for example, can energize the cell enough to reverse that age pigment. But it helps greatly if you use things like milk, orange juice, coconut water and coconut oil are good. Definitely not the thing."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat links age pigment formation to cellular hypoxia and the oxidation of polyunsaturated fats, and suggests that progesterone and thyroid hormone, along with supportive foods like milk, orange juice, coconut water, and coconut oil, can help reverse this process.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, there's so much on the internet, if you look at websites like Vandana Shiva and Gerald Pollock and Martin Chaplin has a great water website, many pages of very detailed information, you can get information that your doctor won't know for a hundred years."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends online resources for in-depth information on water and biology, suggesting that this knowledge often surpasses conventional medical understanding.
