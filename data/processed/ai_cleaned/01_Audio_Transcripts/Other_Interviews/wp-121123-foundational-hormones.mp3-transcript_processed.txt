**RAY PEAT:** I had been studying interesting stuff, just trying to understand how the world works. So I had specialized in linguistics, literature, painting, and the things that I was interested in. But I decided I should make knowledge useful. And I was around the age of 30, I think, when I decided that... useful knowledge was really the purpose of the brain.
**CONTEXT:** What motivated you to pursue a PhD and dedicate yourself to scientific discovery?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, that's why I do a newsletter every two months, because I'm still trying to get the big picture.
**CONTEXT:** You are still pursuing knowledge at 73. What keeps you engaged?

**RAY PEAT:** I had been working in Mexico for several years and when I moved back to the U.S. I started noticing the effects of the weather on my health and especially on young women's health. In the winter at the university lots of students would spend most of their time indoors and sometimes......get no sun at all for several months at a time and I started seeing symptoms like premenstrual syndrome and depression that came on in the winter and people who had never experienced those symptoms until they came to Eugene, which is a very cloudy place in the winter, I started realizing that... The sunlight is a major factor in allowing us to produce and use certain hormones and progesterone is the main hormone that's needed for both brain development and fertility. And sunlight is the reason animals are fertile in the spring. It's because the sunlight, as the days get longer, the anti-stress hormones increase and that's mainly progesterone that increases in the spring, causing the brain to function more with greater variety and energy and it allows fertility to be carried.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the connection between sunlight, hormones, and health, particularly regarding progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that is one of the factors in sunlight. The vitamin D allows us to absorb and use calcium and calcium holds down some of the basic stress hormones that tend to put us into a... a torpid hibernation state when it's too dark. The hormones that make people depressed and sick in the winter are the same hormones that allow animals in nature to go into torpor or hibernation when the days are very short. And progesterone is... the main anti-stress hormone that is inhibited if we're deficient in either calcium or vitamin D. When vitamin D and calcium are not adequate in either the diet or the exposure to the environment, cells go into an excited, inefficient state and... they have to be quieted and put into a torpor by various other hormones. Progesterone keeps us out of that state, but to do it you need to have your calcium under control. And it isn't just the vitamin D that regulates calcium, it's the energy produced in the mitochondria to keep us out of that state. Under the influence of good hormones and good nutrition, the mitochondria produce energy that keeps calcium out of cells and in the bones where it should be. And if you're deficient in vitamin D and calcium, the hormones allow it to get into the mitochondria and poison them. But if the days are very long, even if you don't have vitamin D, the light that penetrates into your tissues is mostly red and yellow light, and that light happens to quench the free radicals that damage the mitochondria. And so it's basically all... a low energy state that is caused by a deficiency of sunlight and or vitamin D and or calcium.
**CONTEXT:** How does vitamin D and calcium relate to stress hormones and cellular energy?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, and we actually require the ultraviolet light from the sun to synthesize vitamin D, is that correct? Yes, and also the red light to quench free radicals that are produced by stress.
**CONTEXT:** Is it correct that we need ultraviolet light for vitamin D synthesis and red light to quench free radicals?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, we're getting the anti-stress effect. If you get enough calcium and other nutrients, you can really... get along with an extremely low vitamin D intake or synthesis. They've done experiments with animals in which they gave them a diet lacking vitamin D and low in calcium, but when they gave them sugar rather than starch, simply the energy efficiency of the sugar allowed them to build strong bones. and avoid rickets. It's much more complex than just taking vitamin D. It's the whole balance of nutrients.
**CONTEXT:** Can one compensate for low vitamin D or calcium with other nutrients, and is sugar more efficient than starch for bone health?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, in one of the basic lab experiments that physiology professors have traditionally given their students, you would feed a rat with a stomach tube a huge gob of corn starch rather. A pasty starch mixed with a little water, the equivalent of about a quart for a person. And then you would wait five minutes and you were instructed to find how far the starch had moved in the digestive system. And in just ten minutes the students would find no trace of starch. It had been totally dissolved, turned into sugar and absorbed. In ten minutes, even though it was the equivalent of a quart for a human being. And starch is a chain of glucose molecules. And so if you eat a given amount of energy or calories in the form of starch, what you get is an instantaneous blast of glucose. If you eat the same amount of energy in the form of......glucose, just plain granulated sugar, the absorption of the sugar is slower, the glucose stimulates insulin and tends to fern on fat production, fructose slightly inhibits the production of insulin and slightly inhibits the blood sugar disturbing effect of the glucose.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the difference between starch and sugar in terms of digestion and blood sugar response?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if the starches are instantly absorbed as in the rat experiment, they cause obesity and if they're mixed with other ingredients so that they are more slowly absorbed, then they are fermented in the intestine and......that type of slowly digested starch was found to cause animals to become fearful and aggressive because of the toxic effect produced by fermentation in the intestine.
**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of instantly absorbed starches versus slowly absorbed starches?

**RAY PEAT:** Sugar is needed for the liver to activate the thyroid hormone, which is what produces the energy that prevents stress and regulates minerals and growth and so on. And if... If someone tries to eat a low carbohydrate diet, or if they eat only starches so that their blood sugar is going up and down very quickly, their thyroid doesn't function properly. It's the essential ingredient for about 70% of our thyroid function, which involves the liver's activation of thyroxine. into the active thyroid hormone. And then without the active thyroid hormone, none of the other, none of the steroid hormones can be made. So the adrenals, the oparies, and even the brain, which is a major source of steroids, can't adequately produce the protective steroids.
**CONTEXT:** How is sugar essential for thyroid hormone activation and the production of steroid hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the steroids. are a feature of all life. It's not really sufficiently studied exactly what their role is, but cholesterol, for example, is known to be involved in the process of cell division, of the expression of genetic information. Every function of life involves either cholesterol or one of the steroids made from cholesterol. So it's some function that if the cell is living and abiding, it's going to need steroids.
**CONTEXT:** Why are protective steroids necessary for life?

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone is the first hormone produced from cholesterol when our thyroid function is adequate.
**CONTEXT:** What is pregnenolone and when is it produced?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. Cholesterol has been injected into animals and when they're being trained, they become more intelligent and learn more quickly when their cholesterol is higher. And in the Framingham study, it was found that people at the age of 50 or more who don't have cholesterol above average, above 200, milligrams per cent, which the ideal is supposed to be 160 or so, so it's slightly above what is considered optimal. If they don't have at least that much cholesterol, they have a much higher risk of becoming demented. Cholesterol is a very important brain chemical. But... One of its main functions is that the brain can turn it into Pregnenolone and DHEA and Progesterone in very large quantities. And if you're limited in your ability to turn it into those hormones, taking Pregnenolone bypasses one of the steps. And so you can sometimes see a tremendous improvement of a person's ability to cope when they take... just a little bit of Pregnenolone.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cholesterol in brain function and hormone production, and how does pregnenolone relate to it?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you can make cholesterol if you have enough of all of the other nutrients.
**CONTEXT:** If one is avoiding cholesterol-rich foods, can the body still produce sufficient cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, vitamin A is the main co-factor for thyroid to be able to turn cholesterol into those hormones. And that's vitamin A from animal sources. Yes. In the 1930s, one of the signs for diagnosing hypothyroidism was the progesterone deficiency. When some of these women who had had severe symptoms of high estrogen and low progesterone, when some of them had their ovaries removed... The corpus luteum, which means the yellow body for progesterone is synthesized, these parts of the ovary were found to be bright red. They had accumulated keratin in place of vitamin A, and keratin at that high concentration competes for the enzymes that use vitamin A, so it has an anti-vitamin A function. And unless people eat things like chicken livers and once again egg yolks, or take cod liver oil, which is not very pleasant, they're probably not getting enough vitamin A from that retinal source? Yes. If your metabolic rate is high, your vitamin A requirement is very high because you will be producing large amounts of pregnenolone and progesterone. And that uses up vitamin A very quickly. Sometimes people notice that in bright sunny weather, they'll get acne or dandruff or some of the annoying little symptoms. And if they just take a big supplement of vitamin A and watch their thyroid because vitamin A can inhibit the thyroid function. If those are in balance, then......you're able to make the amount of progesterone and pregnenolone that you need to respond to the long summer days.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of vitamin A in converting cholesterol to hormones, and what are the implications of vitamin A deficiency or excess?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I had grown up in Oregon and the winters in all parts of Oregon are pretty dark and stressful. And I didn't know that I was hypothyroid or lacking in hormones because for example when I would work in the woods. I would eat sometimes over 10,000 calories per day. I ate tremendous amounts and didn't get fat so it took me a long time to realize that I could be hypothyroid and still have such an extremely high metabolic rate. But when I did try taking thyroid I found that my rate of metabolism decreased sharply. It did something to increase my efficiency, which was probably increasing my production of progesterone and pregnenolones. And so that led to a series of other experiments in which I tried taking each of the hormones individually. And some doctor friends had noticed what they thought was a melanoma growing. It was growing very fast. It looked like an arrowhead, irregular and rapidly enlarging. And I didn't intend to have it removed, but I was watching it. And it happened just a few days after I began taking the DHEA. That thing flared up and within about three days was gone. Around the same time I noticed that my wisdom teeth which had started to erupt when I was around the age of 18 or 20 had just stayed, never finished erupting for 25 years roughly. And within a couple of weeks of taking a small amount of DHEA, they began rotating and in just, I guess, a total of about a month they were... perfectly oriented, vertical rather than submerged and sideways.
**CONTEXT:** Can you share your personal experiences with DHEA, including its effects on a melanoma and wisdom teeth?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, teenage boys only make about 12 milligrams per day at the maximum. So if you take 10 milligrams when you're only 30 or 40, some of it is likely to be turned into estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** What is a safe and effective dosage of DHEA, considering teenage production levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think they should just cut the tablets in fractions and just go by what the label says, but cut them down so that they're only taking about 2 to 5 milligrams. For me personally, if I look at other fillers and things that shouldn't be there in some other formulas, I probably tend not to go with that company. At the same time, there are very, very few that really do use pharmaceutical grade that you can rely on.
**CONTEXT:** What is your recommendation for DHEA dosage and quality?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I did sell some of the DHEA dissolved in vitamin E, which makes it a very quick-acting and controllable form that will circulate and distribute itself without. If you take it in the crystalline powdered form, your liver will get the first opportunity to metabolize it, and that's when it most easily turns into estrogen. But if it's dissolved completely in oil, if you don't mind eating extra olive oil or coconut oil or butter, for example, you can melt a few milligrams. But if you're taking just a plain DHEA capsule or tablet as one would have from an everyday supplier, if you're not taking it with some sort of oil such as olive oil or vitamin E, then your liver will have to work really hard. If you take it with the oil, that helps to keep it from going into the liver. It helps to absorb it into the general circulation.
**CONTEXT:** How does dissolving DHEA in oil, like vitamin E, affect its absorption and metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** That's best, I think. Several years ago I stopped giving people any DHEA because they tended to feel so good they would keep taking more and more until one person enlarged his liver and had the estrogen level of the... of a teenage girl. And that effect can cause a lot of long-range problems. Speaking of, speaking of, yes. I shifted to recommending that almost everyone use Pregnenolone instead of DHEA because you can... in animal experiments, rats were given a 10 gram dose of... pure Pregnenolone, and then their hormones were examined, and it did nothing to the hormones of happy, healthy rats, but if the rat was under stress, it lowered the stress hormones. So no matter how much you take, that would be like about 2 cups of powdered Pregnenolone for a human. Even that much doesn't disturb your hormones. And if you're under stress, it will remove the stress hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Why do you recommend Pregnenolone over DHEA, and what are the safety profiles of each?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, for an experiment, I ate a kilogram of Pregnenolone spread over a year. That averaged out to about 3,000 milligrams a day. And I felt great. All that year I could eat anything I wanted to and my metabolism just was ideally regulated. But the only reason I didn't keep it up was it's very expensive.
**CONTEXT:** What is the maximum safe dosage of Pregnenolone, based on your personal experience?

**RAY PEAT:** I use a small amount of a thyroid supplement. That's a cytomel or phenomel T3 supplement. And then I emphasize sodium, calcium, and the sugary fruits in my diet. And try to get a lot of gelatin, and by keeping the ratio of calcium to phosphorus very high and having a slight excess of sodium, either in the form of table salt or baking soda, that helps to regulate all the other minerals so that you don't have to worry so much about getting enough magnesium Many foods are very low in magnesium, but if you eat extra sodium, your body retains almost all of the magnesium that you give it.
**CONTEXT:** What are your current strategies for increasing your own pregnenolone production through diet and supplements?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. It doesn't hurt to drink 50, if that is what balances your... your metabolism, but I think it's... everyone should try to get from three to five cups a day. There have been studies in which people who drank more than five cups had lower incidences of various kinds of cancer, and and lower incidence of dementia too. So brain protection and avoidance of cancer are probably the two most important things that coffee does, but it's... anti-inflammatory and anti-stress and has a very broad range of protective effects.
**CONTEXT:** What is your recommended daily intake of coffee, and what are its benefits?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and by adjusting all of your nutrients, getting lots of calcium from milk and cheese for example, and plenty of sugar from fruits in particular, those things all help to hold down your cortisol. And eating small amounts at a time will......reduce your stress hormones too.
**CONTEXT:** How can diet and eating habits help regulate cortisol levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, vitamin A is the main problem for a vegetarian because carotene can so easily get in the way of vitamin A functions. I learned that by a young man who was extremely sick and his doctors had found that he had practically no vitamin A in his blood but extremely high carotene which was blocking all of his hormones. And sometimes people get very orange hands if they actually have too much carotene. And the carotene turns off your thyroid function very powerfully. In his case. All it took was one dose of vitamin B12 which is needed to convert carotene to vitamin A. And within a week his symptoms had gone and his vitamin A level was normal. And he was able to convert the carotene to vitamin A easily.
**CONTEXT:** What are the challenges for vegetarians regarding vitamin A and carotene, and how can vitamin B12 help?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, any little source of vitamin B12 can keep a vegetarian in good health as long as they avoid... too many of the toxins. Many plants put out defensive substances, some of which are specifically designed to block our digestive enzymes. The proteolytic enzymes, for example, are blocked by polyunsaturated fats. And it happens that it's a proteolytic enzyme in the thyroid gland that allows it to secrete hormone. And so the same thing that plants......put in their seeds to prevent the seeds being digested by animals. If that fat is absorbed and circulates in the bloodstream, it inhibits the secretion of thyroid hormones.
**CONTEXT:** How do polyunsaturated fats in plants affect digestive enzymes and thyroid hormone secretion?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, about 30 years ago I ran into a young woman who was wasting away and she... tried to eat eggs and liver and all kinds of protein, but she couldn't digest any protein and she was down to 65 pounds and was a fairly tall person. I had been reading about research with some of the amino acid equivalents that are found in potatoes. Potato protein turns out to have a higher quality rank than egg yolk protein. And it's because of these equivalent substances that aren't quite amino acids, all they need is ammonia. And when this woman ate meat or eggs, she would burp ammonia. And something was causing the protein to be short-circuited into an instant conversion to ammonia. And knowing about the research on potatoes... protein equivalents, I juiced some potatoes for her, made about a cup of the raw potato juice with all the starch removed, and then cooked it like a scrambled egg. And she could eat it without the ammonia burps because it's very low in ammonia. But from that meal, that single meal on, she went straight up to 130 pounds and right back to work. And since then I've seen people who had just extreme problems like inability to sleep for months at a time causing them to become demented. And with one meal of the cooked potato juice, one of these people went to sleep while eating the bowl of potato juice soup. It works. So fast to energize the brain and start protein synthesis and repair.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the benefits of potato protein and its role in protein synthesis and energy production, particularly for those with digestive issues?

**RAY PEAT:** For quick intense energy production, the shorter fats as in coconut oil are most effective. But even the very long chain saturated fats have specific protective biological functions. Liver researchers are finding that alcoholics with hepatitis and cirrhosis can be cured if they completely eliminate the polyunsaturated fats such as fish oil and replace them with absolutely saturated fat such as stearic acid and coconut oil.
**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of coconut oil for energy production and liver health, especially compared to polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the mitochondria can use it directly as if it were sugar for ease of producing energy and it's really so nice coconut oil and coconut cream is just what I think the yummiest foods I think they're out there and it's such a shame that they're given a bad name because they grouped into a saturated fat and then saturated fat is actually quite a healthy thing I mean 50% of your heart is made of saturated fat so why would we need it why would we need 50% of it around the heart.
**CONTEXT:** Why is coconut oil considered a good fat, and what is its role in mitochondrial energy production and heart health?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, there were studies about 30 years ago in which pregnant mice were fed either corn oil or coconut oil and the babies that were exposed prenatally to corn oil had smaller brains and weren't very smart and the babies that were exposed prenatally to coconut oil had actually bigger brains and were more intelligent. And similar experiments have been done on dogs and other animals. It actually increases the brain size relative to the body size to have plenty of saturated fats. They really are the essential fatty acids.
**CONTEXT:** What is the impact of saturated fats, specifically coconut oil, on brain development and intelligence in animal studies?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, there are many studies that people aren't... being told about in which fish oil increases metastatic cancer, has very serious immune suppressive effects that possibly relate to the fact that the cancer becomes more metastatic.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential negative effects of fish oil, including its impact on cancer and the immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** Some experimenters found that the beneficial so-called effects of fish oil, which the anti-inflammatory effect is what most people are recommending it for, but they found that that anti-inflammatory action only exists after the oil has been oxidized. And it oxidizes very spontaneously so that by the time you swallow it and it gets into your bloodstream, it's almost always oxidized. It used to be used for varnishes because it oxidizes and hardens so spontaneously and thoroughly. So the so-called beneficial effects really are associated with the breakdown products of it.
**CONTEXT:** Are the purported benefits of fish oil, like its anti-inflammatory effects, actually due to its oxidized breakdown products?

**RAY PEAT:** Just in the last two or three years, the effects of certain breakdown products in the brain, they're highly associated with... Alzheimer's-type dementia, and these, they're called neuroprostains and isoprostains, and their origin can be traced directly to the essential fatty acids and the DHA and EPA of fish oils, and those have some very special involvement in producing Alzheimer's dementia. So if you look at the prenatal effect and the Alzheimer's effect, both ends are now incriminating with fish oil as a toxin. And in between, what's most clearly established is that it's immunosuppressive.
**CONTEXT:** What is the link between fish oil breakdown products and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, when you reach the threshold at which lactic acid rises, that's when you start feeling out of breath. The lactic acid has a pro-inflammatory effect. That goes with a falling blood sugar. The blood sugar is being suddenly consumed at a higher rate because lactic acid production is much less efficient than aerobic oxidation. So when the lactic acid appears, the sugar is low and you can't make your active thyroid hormone. And if you're in very good health, your liver will be able to... When you rest, your liver will get rid of the lactic acid, your blood sugar will hopefully come back, and your thyroid will be okay, but if your nutritional level isn't ideal, sometimes just one episode of lactic acid-producing exercise is enough to knock you down into a lower metabolic state.
**CONTEXT:** How does intense aerobic exercise, leading to lactic acid buildup, negatively impact thyroid function and metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** So the difference between exercise that people define... in high intensity, endurance or even six minute exercise where you just basically run uphill for 45 seconds, you rest for two minutes and you repeat that and that seems to build an enormous amount of lean muscle tissue and kind of keep the lungs and the heart expanded. And there's a whole lot of debate and in my personal experience I've seen as a nutritionist and kinesiologist I've seen people that are fatigued. They're exhausted and they're actually putting on weight and they can't lose weight because they're exercising too much and they're convinced that they need to do something with their diet as opposed to cut down on exercise and change their form of exercise to suit the stress level because after all exercise is stress, too much is stress.
**CONTEXT:** How can excessive or improper exercise lead to fatigue, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances?

**RAY PEAT:** So the muscle becomes a steroidogenic gland when it's properly stimulated and not forced to the point where it starts making lactic acid.
**CONTEXT:** How does muscle stimulation relate to steroid production and avoiding lactic acid?

**RAY PEAT:** So the bottom line is to do less. When it comes to intense exercise, less is more.
**CONTEXT:** What is the optimal approach to intense exercise for maximizing benefits and minimizing harm?

**RAY PEAT:** The decisive thing that made me shift to first brain biology and reproductive biology was... I submitted a paper to a journal and the editor said they accepted it, but they wanted a clarification of a little remark I made about Noam Chomsky's linguistics. And when I expanded the paragraph, it was clear that I was criticizing Chomsky's view of language, which was that it's genetic and sort of absolute, that there's no... ーalternative except to think in language. ー And the editor said, ーOh, but you've criticized Chomsky. We can't publish that. ー And I saw that the linguistics culture was really just a cult, ーin which at that time Chomsky's linguistics happened to be... ーlike he was the pope of linguistic theory. ー And then when I began studying brain biology, I found that... the brain biologists had a similar authoritarian hierarchy, ーwhich you had to think in terms of tape recording, ーcircuitry and membrane, all or nothing, cell function and so on, ーcertain stereotype dogmas. ー If you didn't do that, you couldn't be a brain biologist. ー And at that point I looked around and... ー ーdecided to become a reproductive physiologist because ーthey were the least dogmatic of the ーbiology community.
**CONTEXT:** What led you to shift from linguistics to brain biology and then reproductive physiology?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the people mean different things when they say fact, but I think that there is such a thing as a fact, which is the experience, the actual substance that is perceived. But then we live in a world of meaning, and those perceptions, it's sort of like the Gestalt psychology. Illustrations, they have pictures of ambiguous figures, profiles and a vase, or a young girl and an old hag, in which some people will see one figure and others will see the other. That process of imposing meaning on those experiential facts, you can have an absolutely clear......experience, an event that happens, and then different people will interpret it and impose their meaning on it differently. And that's where the science becomes very much the same situation I was studying in linguistics. We live in a universe of meaning, which for most people is nothing but the culture and the language......that they grew up knowing. And so an ant and I can experience a situation and I'll tend to agree with the ant more than I'll agree with a biologist or a physicist. So the more languages we speak, or the more concepts we understand, the more ways we see the world, the more meaning we have.
**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the nature of scientific fact and the role of interpretation and meaning?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, there have been studies comparing... the intelligent behavior of polylingual kids and bilingual kids really are more intelligent than monolingual kids because they somewhat get out of the rigid way of perceiving the world that one language gives. And by the age of three, people are already getting... into that authoritarian, habituated frame of mind so that monkeys at the age of... the same age as a three-year-old kid will behave more intelligently at solving some kinds of problems than the child because the child is already using linguistic preconceived ideas. Or the monkey. Or the ant, or whatever animal that doesn't have language will look at the situation freshly.
**CONTEXT:** How does multilingualism contribute to intelligence and a more flexible way of perceiving the world?
