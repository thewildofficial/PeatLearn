**RAY PEAT:** "The key idea that underlies Dr. Pete's work is that energy and structure are interdependent."

**CONTEXT:** The host introduces Dr. Peat and his foundational concept.

**RAY PEAT:** "I went over to the other end, reproduction and saw that stress and aging and radiation injury, which had been an interest of mine in the 1950s because of the bomb tests. I saw that all of these kinds of stress and injury created the same situation, which essentially was a brain shrinking process. The follow-up of the 1960s studies at Berkeley, in which freedom and enrichment enlarged the brain, they tested different hormones during pregnancy. They found that stress shrank the brain and that overlapped with some of the torture experiments that had begun in the 50s. By the 1970s, when I had finished my dissertation and research on the aging effects of progesterone and estrogen, the culture had shifted away from that and basically... medicine and biology couldn't see the connection between enriched growth of the brain and suffering causing shrinkage of the brain and inability to help oneself. Learned helplessness goes with shrinking of the brain."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his early research interests and how stress, particularly in relation to radiation and aging, impacts brain structure, linking it to the concept of learned helplessness.

**RAY PEAT:** "when you give up, going into shock and giving up is, biologically, involves things such as too much nitric oxide, too much serotonin, and too much acetylcholine, so it's too much of the... relax and be serene. It goes over the edge into quick death."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the biological mechanisms of "giving up" or shock, identifying specific neurochemicals involved.

**RAY PEAT:** "progesterone happens to... activate the cholinesterase enzyme the same way that enriched environment activates it. So it protects the brain against this excitotoxic, so the brain can become excited and active without killing itself. But if you're deficient in progesterone, you run the risk of overexciting the brain and any injury. It doesn't have to be a behavioral stress, but just a physical knock on the head excites the nerves. And if you get enough progesterone soon enough, the brain recovers with great ability. Just being low in progesterone, any little stress becomes a dangerous injury."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how progesterone supports brain health by activating cholinesterase, protecting against excitotoxicity and enhancing recovery from injury.

**RAY PEAT:** "William Diamond, for example, wrote a book showing that stress changes the shape of the face and thins the cortex. Making rats look mean and stupid, and actually being stupid, prenatal stress. But giving them extra sugar and progesterone to nourish the brain prenatally gave them sort of a baby face look, like a puppy with a big head, and a good disposition and higher intelligence."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat cites research by William Diamond, illustrating the impact of stress and progesterone on brain development and disposition.

**RAY PEAT:** "John Lee is now long dead, Dr. John Lee. For people who have been listening to my show for the length of time it's been on, which is getting close to 20 years, they will have heard many shows with John Lee when he was alive. John Lee learned about progesterone from you. And I knew about progesterone from you because I started using it after hearing you speak and getting to know you. So I started using progesterone in my 30s and it was very helpful to me. John Lee, who was a physician in Mill Valley for 30 years, used it in his practice and never had any case of breast cancer or any kind of cancer in his practice. And he also was able to cure infertility problems in women by giving them progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** The host highlights the influence of Dr. John Lee and his positive clinical experience with progesterone, learned from Dr. Peat.

**RAY PEAT:** "progesterone is also remarkable in very, very small doses for men, right? Right. It works for arthritis and epilepsy in men, just as well as in women, and it hasn't been used as much for treating cancer. Alexander Lipschutz in the 1940s showed that progesterone would stop the cancerization of basically every tissue, starting with the uterus, breast, then lungs, kidney. And prostate."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the broad applicability of progesterone, including its benefits for men and its historical use in preventing cancer across various tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** "The one thing to be mindful of with progesterone in my own experience, in my experience with at least my clients, and in men, is that hormones like to be in a milieu that's balanced and the balance should always favor progesterone, but an overdose of progesterone... It's sedative, so it'll basically put you out. It'll make you sleepy and you'll feel kind of loggy and blue. So one problem, I think, is that sometimes people, women, hear that it's good and they slather this stuff on and then they feel awful. So it's good to remember that."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises caution regarding progesterone dosage, noting its sedative effects and the importance of balance to avoid feeling unwell.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think a good dose for men is 5 to 8 milligrams, which is a really small dose. And in women, what do you like to see? It's going to vary, obviously. It's variable. Some women can take 400 milligrams. Some women couldn't feel it at all because their estrogen was so high. It has to reach a ratio of five or ten times at least higher than estrogen and if your bloodstream is full of estrogen you just can't get there. You've got to get the estrogen under control then thirty to a hundred milligrams."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides specific dosage recommendations for progesterone in men and women, emphasizing the influence of estrogen levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "Albert St. George was what got me interested in the effect of estrogen and progesterone on the heart. He showed in rabbit hearts that progesterone basically strengthens the heartbeat as the heart has more demand put on it. Progesterone lets it respond to the demand where too much estrogen keeps it in the basically small stroke but having to speed up faster and faster because it can't make a bigger stroke. And in some ways that's analogous to what happens in other tissues. Progesterone facilitates the ability to gather resources by relaxing. Its basic effect is to prevent excess stimulation and response until it has the resources to respond fully and correctly. So in the heart... It quiets the heart while increasing the amount of blood it can pump in each stroke. And in the brain it does the same thing where too much stimulation fatigues cells and can kill them. Progesterone activates a whole system that will tend to calm the brain."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the cardioprotective effects of progesterone, citing Albert St. George's work and detailing how it improves heart function by strengthening stroke volume and calming the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** "The brain uterus is... another dimension, like the heart. It has to function according to whether it can relax or contract. To give birth, it has to contract strongly, but during pregnancy, it definitely doesn't want to contract, so progesterone has to be dominant all through, right up until the time of birth. And one of the ways that progesterone is doing that is to... the same way it does in the brain to keep the brain able to be stimulated but grow uh... it allows the uterus to uh... destroy acetylcholine uh... even when it's receiving irritation and stimulation it activates enzymes that prevent uh... inappropriate stimulation and so it lets loose. uterus keep growing and resisting that unnecessary stimulation."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the role of progesterone in uterine health, particularly during pregnancy, and its mechanism of preventing inappropriate stimulation by destroying acetylcholine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I think all hormones to some extent protect the cells from losing in other words You if you look at a cancer cell from the breast that you can't tell where it came from It's just a cancer cell doesn't look like a breast cell anymore Yeah, cells react to stress either by Growing too fast or by dying the same way as the whole organism either goes into a fight-or-flight state or gives up and the Cancer is basically the fight-or-flight state that cells try to get out of the bad situation multiplying faster and moving getting away from whatever is causing the stress and And keeps cells from experiencing that kind of stress in the first place. But it's one of the factors that can, if a cell has started down a stem cell pathway, basically, progesterone helps to guide it in the right direction."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how cells, like organisms, react to stress, and how progesterone can guide stem cells away from a cancerous pathway.

**RAY PEAT:** "The one pathway that When a stem cell invades the heart, for example, if it finds a slightly injured heart, it can mature into a functioning muscle cell. But once the heart is under great stress, not enough progesterone to keep it quiet periodically, the stem cells moving into the heart are either killed... or, in the case of the heart, they become a fiber-producing cell, produce collagen, and make the heart progressively harder. And that's one of the things that happens in just about every cancer. The cells which don't die, a few of them become multiplying cancer cells, and others become fiber-producing....cells in an attempt to wall off whatever the irritant is."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat details how stem cells in the heart can differentiate into functional cells or, under stress and progesterone deficiency, become fibrotic or cancerous.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the defensive process of a hardening heart or a thickening, stiffening tumor, it's the same defense reaction, just in a different context."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat draws a parallel between the fibrotic hardening of the heart and the stiffening of tumors as defense mechanisms against irritants.

**RAY PEAT:** "And every stressed or irritated tissue is constantly open to receiving cells coming in from the bone marrow or nearby tissues. These are... fairly undifferentiated stem-like cells are constantly available. Anytime a tissue needs help, these cells tend to come in and fill in whatever is needed. But as a person, usually it starts over the age of 50, as the whole system starts getting congested with all kinds of stresses and poisons. And failure to eliminate toxins. Many of these areas accumulate half walled off, half controlled. And a person who has had cancer removed, for example, there have been studies following up on populations of these people who had no signs of cancer. But a large proportion of them had constantly circulating......cells identifiable as cancer cells going around in their blood but not causing any harm because their body was just able to use them as repair cells maybe or just close them up in little collagen package and forget about them."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the role of stem cells in tissue repair and how, with age and toxin accumulation, the body may contain circulating cancer cells that are managed through encapsulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's just one more stress, it calls on the body to mobilize the healing process and if the body has a lot of it, if it's young and healthy, it can stand being cut up and recover perfectly. But the sicker the individual is, the more likely the stress is to either... reactivate the cancer in the same place, or activate a completely new cancer somewhere else. And it doesn't have to be just surgery, but chemical poisoning and radiation all activate the carcinogenic process, either in the place that's being treated or elsewhere. So it's just a matter of the total stress and the body's ability to... respond to it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat cautions against invasive medical procedures for cancer, explaining that any stress, including surgery, radiation, or chemical treatments, can exacerbate the carcinogenic process in a compromised individual.

**RAY PEAT:** "The people like... I think her name is Carmen Mothersill... They've demonstrated that cells send out SOS signals including serotonin to... recruit their neighbors to come and help repair the damage. And at a certain point, instead of repairing the damage, the local situation is so bad that they pervert the recruits and let them cause more damage."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat references research by Carmen Mothersill, explaining how cells signal for repair, but under severe damage, these signals can lead to further harm.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 40 years ago, three different doctors diagnosed, told me that I should have a biopsy on three different things and since I had already been studying what doctors do and know about cancer, I ignored them and increased my thyroid and used a little nutritional addition like extra vitamin A and folic acid. Methylation. Put some progesterone and DHEA on the area. Vitamin D. And so far that's 40 years ago and none of them have persisted."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares a personal anecdote of successfully managing potential health issues by prioritizing thyroid support and specific nutritional supplements over invasive procedures.

**RAY PEAT:** "The things that produce learned helplessness, I think, are sometimes after a certain age at least, there are signals. From inside the body, telling your nervous system to do something, and if your resources don't tell you what to do, then you can get pushed by symptoms into a more helpless state, in which the medical signals to control you and make you more helpless, they just add to the internal stresses. So it's important to try to do something, but to figure out what the best thing to do is."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that learned helplessness can stem from internal bodily signals that are not adequately addressed, leading to a cycle of increasing helplessness exacerbated by medical interventions.

**RAY PEAT:** "any kind of stress or shock reduces circulation to your intestine, and that makes it more permeable or leaky. And aspirin, incidentally, is now being studied as possibly the best defense against a leaky intestine, even though there's a tremendous amount of Tylenol-type propaganda saying, don't use aspirin, it makes your intestine leak, but in fact it prevents. Endotoxin and bacterial movement from your intestine into your bloodstream better than..."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how stress compromises intestinal circulation, leading to a "leaky gut," and highlights aspirin's potential protective role against this.

**RAY PEAT:** "what he's saying is that the cycle gets... it just goes crazy and it starts overproducing. Yeah, the nitric oxide in some organs like the brain makes iron more toxic. The endotoxin makes you absorb too much iron if it's present in your food, and the series endotoxin iron nitric oxide has one further step. The nitric oxide activates heme oxygenase, which produces carbon monoxide and releases free iron from the heme complex, which is... kept as under control. So, iron participates, once it gets loose, participates in a series of activation that increases the local production of free iron. And that has been traced to dementia, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, diabetes, organ failure of a great variety."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the detrimental cycle involving nitric oxide, endotoxin, and iron, linking it to various degenerative diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ratio of copper to iron is one of the characteristics. It decreases in relation to the iron content of the brain in Alzheimer's, and copper is used in the superoxide dismutase that is an antioxidant, and in the respiratory enzyme that produces the energy which is lacking in all of the stress conditions."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the critical role of the copper-to-iron ratio in brain health, particularly in relation to Alzheimer's disease and energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** "when women were really high or men in estrogen, estradiol, they tended to bioaccumulate copper and be low in zinc. So I found myself suggesting people avoid copper. Now I understand that most people are bioaccumulating iron as well because of the diets unless they're strict vegetarians. It's been a comparison of female animals to male animals. Especially the pregnant female, nine times as much iron from a given dose was absorbed by the female under the influence of high estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses how high estrogen levels can lead to copper accumulation and zinc deficiency, and how this relates to iron absorption, particularly in women.

**RAY PEAT:** "working at a sewing machine in the factory for years had enough electromagnetic field just from the sewing machine in order to increase the risk of dementia. So just imagine if you're using a wireless router in your house and a cell phone and all the rest of it how Because that's radio frequency versus but they're all in it. They're all part of the spectrum."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat draws a parallel between occupational electromagnetic field exposure and the potential risks associated with modern wireless technology, linking it to dementia.
