**RAY PEAT:** The real meaning of any of these natural supplements or substances is that they participate in everything. Their physiology and ecology are tied together in a system, and these things are important because they're sort of central links in this ecological physiological system. But even insight, the perception of power or helplessness, can make a tremendous difference in how these hormones work and when people think of them as products or drugs they are almost certain to misuse them in some way.

**CONTEXT:** The host introduces the concept of helplessness and its impact on chronic illness, linking it to Dr. Peat's work on hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of the inhibitory state comes largely from the Pavlovian tradition. And Pavlov saw three basic biological states, one in which you're so well rested and prepared that you could respond to challenges without being stressed, and the other in that was high inhibition, readiness, and the low state of being inhibited is sort of protection against overstimulation. And in between is the range of stress and energy is needed to put us up into the readiness state where we're relaxed and able to cope without experiencing the stress reaction. And we think of cortisol and the glucocorticoids as the central stress handling hormones, but the brain is set up such that ACTH which turns on the adrenal hormones such as cortisol, ACTH is produced in response to a substance which is only produced when we're deficient in pregnenolone and thyroid, the precursor materials. And so that when you're in that replenished state with enough pregnenolone, you don't even resort to the stress reaction. That's the latest biological meaning of the high state of inhibition or readiness.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an explanation of the "inhibitory state" and its connection to stress hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** Adequate protein and sodium are very crucial for the average American. Adequate high quality protein is needed before your liver can regulate your blood sugar and all of the hormones. And without that you tend to waste your minerals and sodium is a key mineral and so people who are on low protein and low sodium diets are doing exactly what puts them into the stress situation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what the "first stick" is to stop the cycle of running on adrenaline.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, these low sodium and low thyroid are sort of basic things to think about, but there's a whole layer of American foods and they're worldwide poisons. You can see belts of thyroid disease and tuberculosis, for example, wherever people eat too much cabbage or too many beans and lentils. These foods are the classical, traditional......thyroid inhibitors, but chemically, it's the essential fatty acids, so-called the unsaturated fats, that are becoming very important to Americans and thyroid and progesterone function.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about foods that suppress thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for example the degree of unsaturation Linoleic with three double bonds or linoleic acid with two double bonds In proportion to the number of double bonds they poison the thyroid function at Every known level of the synthesis the transport and the response in two or three different ways inside the cells are strongly poisoned by the three unsaturated groups and significantly inhibited by the two double bonds of linoleic acid. Coconut oil and olive oil are very similar to what the baby produces when it's not... when it's relatively insulated, and if you take cells and grow them in cultures, they grow wonderfully in a completely... unsaturated oil free culture medium showing that human cells whether in the developing fetus or in the laboratory dish do a fine job of producing unsaturated fat and in fact have more cellular vitality than when they are exposed to these environmental oils.

**CONTEXT:** The host expresses confusion about the role of essential fatty acids, contrasting it with common nutritional advice.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the oldest study was that I know of was 1927 in Germany in which they showed that fat, a fat-free diet in rats caused them to be essentially free of spontaneous cancer. And just in the last several years researchers have demonstrated that as you increase the amount of unsaturated oil. In the diet there's almost a straight line associated increase of the development of cancer.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the research linking polyunsaturated oils to potential carcinogenic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** No, and saturated fat is for many years it's known to be pro-immunity. Yeah, there's all this stuff about heart disease that everybody's getting excited about though and people do, well, go ahead. It's the broader barns. Books on heart disease are probably the best introduction to this even though the Chute family started in the 1930s showing how estrogen promotes blood clots, but Broderbarns' work shows that low thyroid, which of course is caused by too much unsaturated fats, is the main cause for degenerative circulatory disease and the research of just the last few years is showing that in fact unsaturated fats are highly atherogenic. The free radical reaction which is developed in thyroid deficient animals causes the blood vessels to be the first site of attack as these unsaturated fats are either eaten or drawn out of the fat storage tissues. They are exposed to oxygen in the bloodstream, produce free radicals and attack the lining of the blood vessels.

**CONTEXT:** The host brings up the common concern about heart disease and saturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** The reason cholesterol is high in low thyroid people, and this was neatly established in the 1930s that... They took high cholesterol to be diagnostic of low thyroid because you can demonstrate such a neat up-and-down relationship. For example, a month ago, I saw two people who wanted to pass a health test in a few days, lower their cholesterol 200 points in about three or four days just by adjusting their thyroid. So, thyroid is what makes you......regulate your cholesterol, but it does it largely by turning cholesterol into steroids, starting with pregnenolone and progesterone being one of the major products. So that if you have adequate thyroid and cholesterol and vitamin A, your cholesterol is going to be turned efficiently into progesterone. And... these are the hormones that prevent the stress reaction that involves cortisone and adrenaline.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the link between cholesterol, thyroid, and progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** And the unsaturated fats also poison the, for example, ovaries and brain cells directly. There are other things such as iron overload or unsaturated fat excess or vitamin E deficiencies that poison the progesterone producing cells, but the basic thing is having enough. Cholesterol, vitamin A, and thyroid to produce these protective hormones.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mechanism of damage from unsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone facilitates function of the thyroid gland, and that is a potential side effect. of taking progesterone because everyone who's low in progesterone is going to have some kind of thyroid malfunction because the thyroid is blocked in its function by estrogen and activated by progesterone so if it has been blocked and has a store of hormone when you take progesterone sometimes it starts the thyroid working too fast as it unloads this bulk.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the interaction between progesterone and thyroid supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** The one hormonal effect that has been seen consistently and It's the only thing that shows up when you study animals or people who are given Pregnenolone. The only hormonal consequence is that if their cortisone is elevated, Pregnenolone brings it down to normal. That's because the elevation of cortisol is connected through mechanisms in the brain circuitry. High cortisol is a symptom of a pregnenolone deficiency and once you get your cortisone down by having enough pregnenolone then any amount of pregnenolone you take has no hormonal action whatsoever but you need to be saturated otherwise you are going to resort to cortisone and cortisone is the basic thing that ages. The skin, the brain cells, the bones, every cell is aged faster under the influence of cortisone.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the effect of pregnenolone on cortisol, referencing a common misconception.

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone turns into either progesterone or DHEA, and DHEA happens to be......close to testosterone and estrogen. It's in the sex hormone pathway. And progesterone happens to be in the adrenal pathway. It's the main protection. It's a very powerful protection against all of the adrenal hormones. So that you don't even need your adrenal glands. Hans Selye demonstrated that the adrenals can be removed and the animal is... happy and lives its full lifespan if given progesterone. So, progesterone is necessary to make the adrenal hormones, but it's the basic protection against an excess of them. So, these two pathways are both kept supplied by pregnenolone. And, you know, I'm not... I'm telling especially women to sort of stay clear of DHEA because I think that that's the wrong step in the pathway. In rat studies... DHEA is highly carcinogenic to the liver. It stimulates first enlargement of the liver and sometimes shrinkage of the thymus because of its overflow into the thymolytic sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone. But it is chronically a great risk of liver cancer.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of DHEA and its comparison to pregnenolone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's um, Hans Selye discovered all of the basic properties of progesterone I think. His technicians reported that they had killed all of his rats in one experiment with progesterone and he said he couldn't believe that and he fished the... dead rats out of the garbage and found that they were just profoundly anesthetized and it turns out that when healthy animals are in their last day or two of pregnancy people have put them on electrified floors and they don't even notice that they're being shocked because the progesterone that's naturally present for childbirth is putting them in a literally anesthetized state even though they're... apparently happy and moving around. Most of the progesterone that has been researched in humans, the maximum doses they give injecting 6,000 milligrams, for example, made people drowsy but never put them into an actual anesthetic unconsciousness. But that's because the solvents... drop crystals of progesterone when you inject it or if you take the powder it doesn't dissolve in ordinary oils but if you take a dissolved in vitamin E so it actually gets into the bloodstream the progesterone has this rising series of effects which at the peak is is highly protected but anesthetized. condition. Short of that state, it protects against harmful stimuli. For example, some of the amino acids are called excitotoxic amino acids and the basic protection against these which are normal brain transmitters but they happen to excite brain cells to death. The brain's normal protection against... Cell death produced by these ordinary transmitters is progesterone and to some extent Pregnenolone does the same thing. They are the only two hormones that work with the other transmitter called GABA which puts the brain in a protected resting state and prevents the stress damage.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the use of progesterone for men and its anesthetic properties, referencing migraine relief.

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone protects your thymus and immune system against destruction by the stress hormones or the sex hormones. So it's extremely important in the sense of being protective, but it also neutralizes the male hormones. So this is at a very low level in men. It begins to neutralize the testosterone. So a man wants to be conscious. That there is this deadly rising protective function and if they don't want to be protected against having whiskers and other typically male traits, they don't want to take more than just a very few milligrams a day, two or three milligrams a day is about enough to offer general protection without neutralizing them sexually.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the possibility of becoming "progesterone dominant" and its effects on men.

**RAY PEAT:** It has been used largely in Europe to shrink enlarged prostate and I've seen it happen at a very moderate dose that doesn't even affect their sexuality. It'll shrink an enlarged prostate.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the use of progesterone for prostate issues in men.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it stops the vascular problems that are involved in the blind spots of migraine. In two of my worst migraines ever, I found that in a minute and a half, the headache is totally resolved. And in women, it is less likely to have such a quick... massive effect because women are likely to have a much higher estrogen level. Estrogen causes nerve sensitivities, which can culminate in epilepsy, but migraine is the lower grade of this estrogen poisoning. And the effect on the vascular system of progesterone is in the direction of digitalis. It's considered to be the body's own heart and circulation. Regulatory substance which is affected by digitalis and this means that it tones up for example varicose veins or bulging veins on the backs of your hands are an easy way to see a progesterone deficiency but that's what happens in a migraine, the bulging veins impair circulation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on how progesterone helps with migraines.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because of the side effects. There must be a lot of other hormones that people could research without going right to the most dangerous shock hormone, estrogen. Researchers have found that vitamin A in progesterone and even DHEA, very often it seems to be the missing factor.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if estrogen supplementation is ever appropriate for women experiencing vaginal atrophy.

**RAY PEAT:** What about testosterone? People have been researching all of those and all of them seem to affect at least some of the women. And so I think it's better to check them out in the order of safety like with Pregnenolone. Thyroid progesterone first and then try as your last resort, try the one that tends to kill you sooner.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the order of hormonal supplementation for women after menopause, following up on the mention of DHEA.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, there's published stuff using what I consider mild doses of Pregnenolone, all of their people, the eyes receded. In my few experiences, the eyes just sort of were sucked back into the head, it's such a dramatic process that you have to see what it can do to deformed arthritic joints or emphysema in which there's almost no oxygen getting through the lungs or in this state of Graves' disease in which there's a gelatinous material behind the eyeball. The valves of the heart can get the same gelatinous deposit which is, historically it's thought of as a low thyroid product, a glycoprotein, but Pregnenolone has the most dramatic, almost instantaneous effect, like in an hour you can see results.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about success treating Graves' disease with Pregnenolone.

**RAY PEAT:** People should read the book and become their own expert because like I said at the beginning, it's always individual and progesterone is just one of the central factors in a whole physiological ecological problem. And usually you can fix the problem with diet and if not just diet, then thyroid. And I think of progesterone just as one of the first aids in repairing the problem, but not the answer.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the dosage of progesterone in Dr. Peat's oil and the importance of individualization.

**RAY PEAT:** Fifty milligrams, but you can't think in terms of... what doctors often talk about, because that's enough to make some people a little bit drunk. That's three times the normal day's dose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the amount of progesterone in a specific dose of Dr. Peat's oil.

**RAY PEAT:** The solvent is vitamin E, it's ninety percent of the quantity, and so if you have twenty-five milligrams of substance... It's going to be about two hundred units of vitamin E.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the amount of vitamin E in the progesterone oil.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's hard to tell how much estrogen a woman has to balance, so a dose that would not touch a headache in one person might make the other one so drunk they couldn't walk for several hours. I would say not to try more than 50 milligrams at a dose, but then repeat it every 15 minutes until the headache is gone. Efficient way to prevent them is to take thyroid or optimize your own thyroid production so that your estrogen is controlled to a reasonable degree and then it takes little or no progesterone because the estrogen is able to be controlled.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the dosage of progesterone for migraine headaches.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, there's a lot of history involved here, but in the practical point that I've seen is that, for example, any tissue which is injured... like they have experimentally twisted a piece of cartilage and found that just that small amount of disruption causes it to raise antibodies from its own body. So don't worry about the diagnosis or the antibodies because everyone who corrects their thyroid function... that I've seen has corrected their antibody level after about a year of good functioning. But the real problem is that in the 1940s it was known that almost half of Americans were hypothyroid and got over their symptoms whether it was diabetes or heart disease or infections when they were given adequate thyroid. But a drug company came out with the test for protein-bound iodine in the blood. And they found that 95% of the population had enough of that and so were not hypothyroid. But in the 60s, it turned out that that test was complete nonsense. It didn't measure anything of significance. But what stuck was the doctrine that 95% of the people... are not hypothyroid and the synthroid type thyroxin was tested in the 1940s on young male medical students who were healthy and they said oh it works just like thyroid. But the fact is that it was not tested on women and women because of the high estrogen that is exaggerated by low thyroid. Women who are low thyroid have almost a complete inability to respond to thyroxin because it has to be activated by the liver. And over and over I see women who get more and more hypothyroid as they take more and more thyroxin. And sometimes this happens in men, sometimes men can respond because their livers are not as poisoned by estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** A caller with Hashimoto's disease asks about their thyroid antibodies and lack of symptoms despite being on Synthroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Fish oils are the ones that are more effective anti-inflammatory agents. There's a generalized anti-immune function such that they used to sell emulsions for intravenous use of vegetable oils as feeding for cancer patients, but since it made the patients die faster, then they discovered that it was destroying their immune systems. Now they use the very same emulsions for organ transplant patients just because it does suppress immunity.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about supplementing with essential fatty acids like primrose oil and flaxseed oil, and why they might make people feel better.

**RAY PEAT:** Very often it starts with either thyroid or beans in the diet. Beans are very common. A dietary factor. They contain antigens that make them a more complex toxin that cause the liver and the intestine and the thyroid to malfunction. And you can break the cycle sometimes just with diet, but usually thyroid is an important thing to consider.

**CONTEXT:** A caller with chronic fatigue syndrome asks for information.

**RAY PEAT:** Depends on where you're starting from. Sometimes four ounces of orange juice every hour through... The day for several days is all it takes to activate the thyroid. Sometimes it takes adding eggs or milk to the diet. If you're not allergic? Yeah, depending on what the limiting factor is in your thyroid problem. Sometimes one dose of progesterone can break a person out of the cycle. Sometimes dropping out vegetable oils or beans or nuts or seeds. Is all it takes. Yeah, switching to a higher protein diet without those items in it. And low grain too, the grain is irritating as well. Ordinary potatoes, especially if they're fried in coconut oil, are often fantastically therapeutic for people with a dietary problem. That's a long story, but potatoes have an extremely high quality protein.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks how to treat low thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** They're generally produced under oxidative conditions that damage the protein seriously. You can get much better protein much cheaper from natural milk and eggs or potatoes.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about protein supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid is the basic thing. I've had people get into a slightly hyperthyroid state, taking a good balanced thyroid supplement, and month by month they have documented that the thyroid alone is able to shrink the uterine fibroid. The progesterone was tested and it does work, but partly it works through the thyroid and the essential thing is to take enough thyroid to get your estrogen way down even below normal for a while.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about high estrogen levels and fibroid tumors.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what we've been talking about. Thyroid symptoms, my thyroid has been kind of... I've been noticing it, which is unusual. Well, a few weeks ago there was an article in the newspaper about China......having 25 million cretins and 100 million hypothyroid people at least, and just a couple days after that article someone said, but you say soy is poisonous because it's estrogenic and anti-thyroid, what about all the Asians? And I said, yeah, it's proven that it causes hypothyroidism. It's not that I have some kind of of moral thing about vegetarian diets I've just found that they're not entirely healthy for everyone. Well, you can experiment with dropping the beans And pulling back on the vegetable oils and certainly not cooking with vegetable oils and eating more potatoes.

**CONTEXT:** A caller describes a diet high in beans and grains and experiencing fatigue, asking about the relation to thyroid.
