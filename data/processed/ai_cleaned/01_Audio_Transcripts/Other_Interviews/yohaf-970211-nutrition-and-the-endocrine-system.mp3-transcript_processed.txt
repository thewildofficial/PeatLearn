**RAY PEAT:** In the 50s I saw people getting estrogen therapy and dying or going crazy or getting rheumatoid arthritis and it was so obvious that like one woman went into a mental breakdown an hour after she had an injection of estrogen. And her daughter......died at the age of 27 after taking early birth control pills that were high in estrogen. And I began just keeping my ears open to the nature of the research that was supporting it and realized that it really was all advertising and the research went completely in the other direction and so I decided to go. Back to graduate school I'd been in linguistics and literature and I intended to study nerve biology and I thought that that was dominated by some very foolish dogmas and the least dogmatic work was being done in reproductive physiology and there I thought that estrogen explained infertility. And reproductive aging, it accelerated or imitated all of the known age-related changes. And this is true for men as well. Yeah, and these changes are so fundamental and general that you can't really distinguish between the free radical damage done by unopposed estrogen or by heavy metals or by x-rays. Or by anything that interferes with oxidative metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** How did you come to the conclusion that women need supplementation with natural progesterone and not with estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** A lot of people don't realize that when men age, it isn't that they are losing testosterone in particular. Mostly what's happening is that they're gaining estrogen. For example, prostate enlargement and then cancer occurs in aging men. Precisely, the men who are deficient in testosterone and have an excess of estrogen who get the enlarged and cancerous prostate. And so what we're saying is that aging and estrogen dominance share symptoms which include diminished cellular respiratory capacity, which causes energy loss, and it increases your risk of cancer. And it's a vicious circle too because estrogen not only causes the respiratory defect, but once you get......stressed and sick, even an acute stress drastically raises your body's estrogen, so that hospitalized people, men or women, typically have very high estrogen levels. A heart attack, for example, is associated with very high estrogen levels in men.

**CONTEXT:** You've stated that aging and estrogen dominance share symptoms. Can you elaborate on this?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 60s, when I was starting my research, I saw that for decades people had known that soot is full of a vast number of estrogenic compounds, the same things which are carcinogenic in smoke. Have a very neat estrogenic function. That's why estrogen was such an easy thing to commercialize by the drug companies because you could find it everywhere.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned environmental estrogenic compounds. Can you discuss how widespread this knowledge was?

**RAY PEAT:** The liver, this was work done by the Biscons. The early 1940s, the liver is the main thing that regulates and holds your estrogen in check. And the liver, to do its work, requires adequate protein, nutrition, essentially, and a basic amount of B vitamins. But these don't work unless you have adequate thyroid to make the liver able to metabolize the protein.

**CONTEXT:** What role does the thyroid play in restoring balance when estrogen is dominant?

**RAY PEAT:** It wouldn't necessarily be so hard, but the scientific work that was being done in the 30s and early 40s showed that respiration goes down as your thyroid goes down. But the basic technique simply involved measuring how much oxygen you would breathe in a period of a few minutes and the drug companies didn't have any way to market air to be breathed in the lab and they came up with a blood test called the protein-bound iodine measurement and sold everyone on the idea that this was scientific. It turned out that instead of 40% of the population being low respirers, only 5% were low in the protein-bound iodine test and when I was in school, everyone who was overweight had been told by their doctors that they had behavioral or personality defects, not a hormone problem because the drug companies convinced everyone that really needed thyroid that since the test didn't show low thyroid, that 95% of the people have some other problem. But in the 60s, the protein-bound iodine was found to have essentially nothing to do with thyroid function. And what remained in everyone's mind was that the 95% of the population do not need thyroid. And now... No matter how perfect the test might measure your thyroid response, the fixed idea is that you are not likely to need thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** Why is it hard to evaluate the adequacy of thyroid function with a blood test?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in fact, actually, when a lot of people who present with some of the symptoms that you describe in the book that would indicate a possible problem with thyroid, like having an extremely low resting pulse, and in many cases, this is not someone who's athletic. Their temperature is below normal, very much below normal. Pulse is, as I mentioned, slow, reflexes are not quite right, they're cold all the time, you know, all of these things that we normally associate with low thyroid function. And then when the doctor does a panel, they're not seeing a low thyroid in the blood.

**CONTEXT:** Can you describe the common symptoms of low thyroid function that doctors might miss?

**RAY PEAT:** And either over or underweight can be caused by low thyroid, so it isn't just a matter of... of fat people needing thyroid. Very often people who can't gain a normal amount of weight need thyroid. And dry skin and falling hair are two of the very important indicators, and those tend to increase with aging, and to some extent they can be reversed by restoring the hormones. Just a few months ago someone found that an anti-estrogen chemical......restores hair growth in animals and this is one of the things that thyroid researchers have suspected that low thyroid people have high estrogen and estrogen interferes with the development of the cell follicle, the hair follicle. And estrogen also makes it difficult for the body to utilize thyroid....produce it, but even if you're taking a supplemental thyroid, if your estrogen levels are high, it will also interfere.

**CONTEXT:** What are some key indicators of low thyroid that are often overlooked, and how does estrogen play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** I'll throw in a couple more. People who are low in...the body converts thyroid into T3. It's kind of complicated. I don't want to get into the specifics of it, but if you're too low in T3, if you don't have enough, you also become very depressive. And also, because I work with people in a variety of ways, including exercise, if people begin to do exercise, they begin to gain weight if the thyroid is not functioning well.

**CONTEXT:** What are some other important indicators of low thyroid, and how does exercise relate to thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, someone put volunteers on a treadmill and had them walk for 40 minutes, keeping their pulse rate under 120 beats per minute. So, gentle exercise just for 40 minutes, and then they measured the amount of the active thyroid hormone, T3, in their blood, and it had gone to zero in that shirt.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the impact of exercise on thyroid hormone levels?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 30s, one of the indicators of... It was a very reliable sign that the thyroid was low when the blood cholesterol level was very high. And people demonstrated that if you removed the thyroid gland, you could get a higher blood pressure and you could be more healthy. So, that's what I think about that. In the 30s, one of the indicators of.. Immediately their blood cholesterol started up and if you gave them a thyroid supplement, immediately the blood cholesterol would return to normal. And it happens that if you poison the liver, it can't make cholesterol. And someone discovered that if you feed the animals a very large amount of unsaturated feed oils, it will suppress the cholesterol. While also suppressing their metabolism and the pig farmers, for example, found it useful to add large amounts of corn or soybeans to the animals' diets to make them hypo-metabolic so they got fat on very little food, but this same procedure is so toxic to the liver that it doesn't. Normally, in itself, causes direct elevation of cholesterol the way simple hypothyroidism does. And even though it was established that low thyroid individuals were susceptible to heart disease because of the thyroid deficiency, the fact that low thyroid people have high cholesterol became attached with the thought that... cholesterol could be blamed instead of low thyroid and the promotion of the seed oils was largely based on the idea that it would lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease but in fact it lowers cholesterol while causing hypothyroidism and just in the last few years the research is accumulating showing that it is not really... connected directly at all with cholesterol, but heart disease is the result of plaque that develops in blood vessels and that this plaque is like age pigment, the product of free radical breakdown of unsaturated fats and that the blood vessels are most intimately exposed to both oxygen, abundant iron from the hemoglobin and the unsaturated fats that are either being digested or drawn out of storage. And so you have the perfect conditions for creating free radicals during stress when the unsaturated fats are circulating in the bloodstream.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between cholesterol, thyroid function, and heart disease, particularly concerning unsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** The soy monopoly is really extremely powerful in the United States. It subsidizes research and propaganda, medical society meetings and books, and it's doing just a very powerful job of... diverting people's attention from this research, which is coming out, showing that unsaturated fats are intimately involved in heart disease and strokes. And what they're doing is over and over repeating certain associations that breast cancer is lower in Japan, for example, than in the United States and when Japanese live in... this country they have the same rate of breast cancer as Americans but they neglect everything else that was traditional in Japan. Women didn't smoke, for example, they tended to stay at home and they ate lots of strange shellfish and all kinds of foods that are simply not available. in the united states

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the soy industry's influence and the claims made about Asian diets?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogenic substances can be just as toxic whether or not they bind to the so-called estrogen receptor because there are so many ways that estrogen has its effects not just the classical so-called receptor for 40 years or so people recognized that estrogen had a wide spectrum of instantaneous effects it imitates the shock reaction and causes cells to take up water and such in a time that it couldn't possibly be acting through the classical receptor so there is sort of either a signal action or a chemical action of any estrogenic substance which has nothing to do with the estrogen receptors and when you compare estriol and des and the phytoestrogens what they have in common is that they are toxic to the reproductive system, will cause miscarriages and abortions. There are strains of sheep which are known to be resistant to phytoestrogens and they happen to be the ones that are adapted to live elevations because the phytoestrogens cause abortions by interfering with the oxidative metabolism. That's the answer. Special resistant hemoglobin and physiology, they can stand the phytoestrogens, but when you test them on a range of lab animals, these bioflavonoids or isoflavones and so on, have the same drastic toxic effects that DES, for example, has. They cause deformities in the genitals of... of the baby animals when the mothers are exposed to them.

**CONTEXT:** What is your view on the concept of "weak" estrogens like estriol and phytoestrogens in soy, and their potential toxicity?

**RAY PEAT:** At the time some of these claims were coming out several months ago, I noticed a report from China that there were 100 million hypothyroid people there and goitrism, cretinism and so on are extremely common in bean eating. Soybean or any kind of bean. The Andes and all the way from the mountains of central Mexico to the tip of South America, the bean eating cultures have an extremely high incidence of goitr and cretinism.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between bean consumption, particularly soy, and thyroid issues like goiter and cretinism?

**RAY PEAT:** The liver seems to think we're starving to death if we don't get adequate high quality protein. It has the function of making albumin and other proteins to maintain blood physiology and if it's deficient in the right amino acids that you get from high quality proteins such as milk and eggs, it acts as if it's starving and it sends out signals to draw on the body's own protein-eating tissues, but to prevent the rapid breakdown of the body's own tissues when you're not eating enough protein. The body senses the, um... changed chemistry and very quickly suppresses the thyroid. So it's, there is this known connection between a protein deficiency or imbalance and an adaptive suppression of the thyroid. So that's one of the important outcomes is that people on a low protein diet, their thyroid turns down so that they don't eat up their own tissues. It's the same as going on a fast. You lose weight for the first day, but then your thyroid is suppressed and after day one you lose only about an ounce a day or something.

**CONTEXT:** How does protein intake, particularly from high-quality sources like milk and eggs, support thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** The plant defense system puts its worst toxins in the seed to prevent its next generation and these toxins turn out. To apparently have been evolved to make the seed undesirable to animals by blocking their digestion, poisoning their metabolism. And so it takes pretty fancy treatment to make them even digestible and useful. That's where the traditional leavening process comes in. It helps to detoxify the grains. And so the worst... Grain material is one which is not traditionally processed. The American native cultures found that by boiling their grains with alkali, they would detoxify them enough that they weren't terribly poisonous, but still they weren't adequate nutrition in themselves. The particular......type of calorie in grains, their protein value should be discounted because the protein is of such low quality, not just the quantity, but the quality is the lowest protein known. And so if you count them as calories, what you see is either unsaturated fats or starches and the white refined... flour, for example, is essentially pure glucose starches made up of a chain of glucose molecules where fruit sugar is half fructose and half glucose and glucose is a powerful stimulant to insulin and the synthesis of fat and so the the grains are well designed to cause obesity of these complex carbohydrates which are chemically pure glucose. Stimulate fat production and increase the appetite so that they start the chain of putting on fat. The fruit, the fructose component of fruit sugar does not have that powerful effect on insulin. It's very slow and indirect. The fruit comes with many of the minerals which work in place of insulin. And have a slightly suppressive effect on the insulin. And the fruit has a strange side effect. It happens to promote cholesterol production. And that's one of the reasons I emphasize having plenty of fruit sugar. Because the fructose, while it doesn't cause obesity. It does help your liver to produce more cholesterol which is then available if your thyroid is functioning to turn into the protective hormones, pregnenolone and progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** Why do you advise against the use of grains and favor fruits and white potatoes?

**RAY PEAT:** I think what we're talking about is that if your thyroid is not functioning well, if it's suppressed, either through diet or stress or environmental things, your body needs the cholesterol from these sources in order to create these hormones. If your thyroid is suppressed, you then will have problems with cholesterol. When I see someone with above average cholesterol, I think they're in pretty good shape because I've seen people drop their cholesterol levels 80 points a day, 60 to 80 points, by using quick acting thyroid when they had to pass a health exam, for example. So it's no problem at all to get your high cholesterol down to normal. To get low cholesterol up to normal so that you have the defensive anti-cancer, anti-aging, anti-stress hormones, fruit is really the only practical thing I know of that will help the liver recover from the toxic unsaturated fats and estrogens and other things that block cholesterol production.

**CONTEXT:** How does coconut oil fit into the picture of metabolic stimulation and saturated fat, and what is the role of cholesterol in hormone production?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, there are three kinds of Graves' disease, hyperthyroid, euthyroid and hypothyroid. So Graves' disease is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. And very often people are diagnosed as being hyperthyroid on the basis of having elevated thyroxine in their blood in spite of......very often having many signs of low thyroid, and so you can't go by the standard idea of what hyperthyroidism is. Occasionally I see someone who is really hyperthyroid, and that is generally a corrective process. If they just, for example, eat some......exaggeratedly nutritious foods, lots of eggs, maybe some liver, plenty of very concentrated food, usually the thyroid is unloading its excess and will correct itself in anywhere from three months to a year. That's a very short answer for a complicated question, so I apologize if we're short. If we're giving a short answer to something that's complicated. There have been publications on different ways to treat it, and the outcome of the good studies was that radiation and surgery are almost never right. The conservative treatment, either using diet or a drug just to control the symptoms, always leads. Practically always leads to resolution without the damage of surgery or radiation.

**CONTEXT:** What is your understanding of Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone is essentially always safe, it stops the stress reaction and will... Whether you have, for example, Cushing's syndrome with too much cortisone or Addison's disease with too little, Pregnenolone, like progesterone, will put you right down the middle and correct whatever is wrong. It's protective, even if it isn't correcting a disease process, and it will very often correct the DHEA level, but I interpret the blood tests or saliva tests of DHEA really as indicating more about liver function than about your need or actual tissue levels of the DHEA without doing a tissue biopsy. I don't think there's any. A clear way to evaluate your DHEA status, and it's better just to correct everything else.

**CONTEXT:** Should someone try Pregnenolone first if their DHEA levels are low, or is there a better way to evaluate DHEA status?

**RAY PEAT:** Anyone who's over 48 or 50 and feeling like they've suddenly run into an energy wall. If things are just like their skin is deteriorating and looking old and they have no energy and they're depressed and so on. Very often it's just because their glands have sort of hit the barrier of accumulated iron and unsaturated fatty acids that make stress poison your adaptive system rather than stimulating it.

**CONTEXT:** Who should consider taking Pregnenolone, and what are the signs that it might be beneficial?

**RAY PEAT:** That book will be called female hormones in context. And we're looking for someone to print it properly so I'll be in touch with you and we'll reschedule as soon as that book is out.

**CONTEXT:** What is the title of your upcoming book, and when can listeners expect it?

**RAY PEAT:** Question Authority. He says... Look, if you go back and you look in the research files all the way back there is evidence of many of the things that mainstream nutrition and mainstream medicine, if there is such a thing, are toting as being healthy. Maybe not. Maybe it's not healthy. You know, one of the things that's important about him is that, and he challenges me constantly because there are things that we disagree about. You know, we've had arguments about whether to supplement the diet with essential fats and he says, but, you know, radiation decreases. You know, inflammation too. I mean, he's very thought-provoking in terms of what is the balance here and what is the bill at the end of using these various things and he goes back and he's got the research to support his work. It's not that he's some kind of guy who's making this up. He's researched a lot of this stuff, but it's also his passion and his sense of love for people. I mean, he can be... You know, in a personal conversation, he can be sort of a little annoyed with people, but as soon as you start talking about this stuff, I can feel how desperately he wants people to protect themselves and be healthy. How much of a passion it is for him. He works very hard.

**CONTEXT:** What is the most important thing listeners should know about your work?

**RAY PEAT:** A truly intelligent mind will be able to contain conflicting ideas at the same time. So, whatever you read or hear from Ray Pete, even if it kind of flips a switch or you go, huh, that process is creative. It will help you to dig deeper into yourself and to experiment and use your body as a laboratory, not in an irresponsible way, but in a way that's guided by knowledge. So that's that's the only way to find health is to find that equilibrium and homeless basis in each one of you and only with knowledge, it's the only way you can do it.

**CONTEXT:** What is the key takeaway from your work that listeners should consider?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, it sounds like you're estrogen dominant, so the first thing to do is to eat more soy and get more exercise, and then there are surgical techniques where they don't have to remove the uterus, and I'm sitting there going, what happened to natural progesterone? Hello? Hello? You know, I mean, it's like Andrew Weil talks about this stuff as if he invented it, and that's not all the information. It's not all the information.

**CONTEXT:** What is your critique of common advice given for conditions like bleeding fibroids, particularly regarding the omission of natural progesterone?
