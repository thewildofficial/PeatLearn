**RAY PEAT:** The Russian tradition, starting with Mendeleev, who referred to himself as a cosmic realist, and later V. I. Vernadsky, who called himself a biogeochemist and also thought of himself as a cosmic realist. What they meant by this was that you have to think back, think of the context of the problem that you're dealing with and try to think of as many levels of the problem at the same time as you can.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the philosophical underpinnings of this "cosmic realist" perspective and how it contrasts with certain trends in American and German science regarding the origin of life?

**RAY PEAT:** In a way, Pasteur is selected by American educators and science people as a way to obscure thinking about the origin of life because his famous experiment in which he demonstrated that life didn't arise from decaying organic matter, that his principle was that life comes from life. People seized this who didn't want to accept that life came from non-living matter. They wanted to dispose of the idea of the origin of life in the world and say that life came only from life. So there's kind of a deliberate obscuring principle going on when people try to place Pasteur's thinking at the top.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Pavlov. How was his work misrepresented, and what was the implication for understanding consciousness?

**RAY PEAT:** And the same thing happened to Pavlov, this man named Watson who I doubt even studied with Pavlov because he totally misrepresented what he claimed to have learned from Pavlov. J.P. Watson was the founder of behaviorism in America and he denied the existence of consciousness. Even my professors in the university psychology department, some of them were still denying consciousness or at least denying it to children. They said that consciousness was only present in speech and this picture of Pavlov as studying conditioned reflexes, it goes back to Watson's misrepresentation of Pavlov. The translation of Pavlov's phrase even was deliberately misleading. If you translate it back into Russian, it says something like health resort reflection rather than what Pavlov actually said, which was conditional reflex, meaning that you reflect all the conditions around you. In other words, consciousness was the meaning of Pavlov's term and consciousness was explicitly defined out of his system.

**CONTEXT:** How has genetics, particularly in its emphasis on randomness, also evaded the fundamental question of life's origin?

**RAY PEAT:** And the same sort of attempting to hide the problem has been going on in genetics and everything else. Genetics has attempted to evade the problem of where life came from in the first place simply by emphasizing that units are passed on which are identical to the units that preceded them. So when they were forced to recognize change, very strange devices have developed and the idealization of randomness, random change, random mutation for about 80 years or so just totally took over biological genetic thinking that if we're going to have to admit that life changes and maybe even that life originated from non-life, we're going to have to say that it's random because we don't really want to admit that it happens.

**CONTEXT:** Could you explain the core difference between Lamarckian and Darwinian evolution, and how Darwin's ideas were later altered?

**RAY PEAT:** And so the big controversy between the neo-Darwinists and the Lamarckians was this same thing. The neo-Lamarckians even rewrote Darwin. They took out the Lamarckian inclinations of Darwin and that's why they call it neo-Darwinism because Darwin would be too Lamarckian for their preferences. Lamarck basically said that life is purposeful and that the intention to do something is part of the process of physiological adaptation and that this attempt to adapt to an environment is part of what is passed on to the offspring. And Darwin accepted that there were many sources of variation including the Lamarckian type of variation. Darwin didn't say that variation was just by chance. In fact he enumerated a whole bunch of mechanisms that could cause variation. But then after the Mendel's silly work with peas which people have pointed out wasn't even truthful he fudged his results to make it look more mathematically perfect. After he was resurrected or invented people reinvented Darwin to support their position that change and evolution are random.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between the idea of chaos in modern science and the genetic emphasis on randomness?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the recent manifestations of this strange religion of random changes evading the thought of purpose in the universe there has been a craze about the idea of chaos. There are close parallels between the genetics of random change and this idea of chaos. What they're doing is using purely numerical processes to argue that you can't predict the future. The whole argument of these chaos people is based on numerical sequences and computer events and then they say, well, particles, atoms and things in the real world are just like numbers and that's what the genetics people did. They said the particles we're dealing with are just like numbers and individual particles don't know where they're going and so they can only change randomly. What they're doing is reducing everything to the most meaningless unit, in one case totally abstract immaterial numbers, in the other case almost abstract and immaterial entities called genes. Meanwhile these other people were thinking about the actual physics and chemistry and history and geology and cosmology that are operating in everyday life and that would tend to produce the various phenomena of organisms and organic chemicals and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Can you discuss the work of Oparin and the concept of co-asservation in the context of the origin of life?

**RAY PEAT:** Oparin is one of the people that is well known in the theory of the origin of life. In the 20s and 30s and 40s he was talking about the types of physical processes that can create things equivalent to cells and the idea of co-asservation or clumping in complex colloid-like systems that find... organization in a complex way that is stable, allowing complex structures to appear out of what seem to be simple, random solutions. The appearance of order... probably these people talking about co-asservation were the first to introduce the idea of self-organization and self-structuring, in which entropy actually decreases just according to ordinary physical processes. Once you add a few complexifying ingredients to a solution of, say, starch or oil or protein molecules, order starts appearing. And the strange ideas about entropy only increasing, you have to see that whole history of denying that entropy can decrease in the universe. You have to see that as part of this philosophy of idealizing randomness and chaos and the unpredictability of things.

**CONTEXT:** How did Vernadsky's concept of the noosphere relate to the physical principles of consciousness and the material world?

**RAY PEAT:** Vernadsky was working along his synthesizing route and in 1922 or 1926 he was lecturing on his picture of the place of consciousness in the cosmos and showing that according to well recognized principles consciousness basically is generated by physical forces and he used the ideas of the biosphere and the noosphere. Teilhard de Chardin happened to be in Paris, I think it was, where Vernadsky was lecturing and he popularized the idea of the noosphere but actually it was this cosmic realist philosophy of the biogeochemist that really generated the central idea of what the noosphere is in relation to the biosphere and material world.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Sidney Fox's work as a fruition of these experiments. What did he demonstrate regarding the formation of protein-like molecules and cell-like structures?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the outcomes of Oparin's work and the people who worked on co-asservation, the American Sidney Fox was kind of the fruition of some of these particular experiments with how physical conditions affect the appearance of order out of disorder. I should mention that one of the people that Vernadsky knew in Paris was Henri Le Chatelier and the famous in chemistry, everyone hears about Le Chatelier's principle of the restoration of the disturbed equilibrium. Anything you do to disturb an equilibrium causes the system to adjust in a way that restores equilibrium. He invented that concept. Le Chatelier did, yes. He first phrased it in very complex ways and over the years he got it simpler and simpler and now they state it in very simple but sort of misleading ways in chemistry textbooks. It's a principle that really can be applied anywhere to organic physiology, brain processes, social processes and so on. It's simply an inescapable way of seeing things once you apply it in a few cases. If you have a system and you disturb it by adding energy to it or pressure or changing the conditions in any way, the system adjusts and restores a new equilibrium. Vernadsky, thinking cosmologically, seeing the earth as something in the universe, realized that heat is coming out of the inside of the earth and that the sun is constantly adding energy to the system. If you're constantly pushing on the system, both from volcanic energy and solar energy, you don't have a closed system. In other words, energy is driving the system, disturbing the equilibrium in very powerful ways and the system is being driven and directed and steered by this constant pressure of energy flowing into it. Vernadsky said that the system will adjust in ways that restore equilibrium. He showed why organisms would adjust their complexity to use the energy that's available and that this would make bigger and smarter and more intensely metabolizing organisms to basically equilibrate the energy that's being added to the system. I've never heard that Sidney Fox was a student of Vernadsky's but he in effect was because he used Vernadsky's principles and was able to perceive what happened. Everyone at this time about 40 years ago, everyone then and most of them still are talking about life originating in like a tepid pond or a warm ocean or an atmosphere sparked by lightning and various things, atmospheric sparks causing organic molecules to fall into an ocean in which they accumulate and then by random events etc. Sidney Fox happened or intended to rethink the question of how proteins come into existence when the equilibrium, if you have a protein floating in water, is to degrade to various products such as the individual amino acids that it came from or other small molecules and so the equilibrium is obviously not favorable for the occurrence of large molecules if they are floating in water and he put dry amino acids or almost dry amino acids deficient in water, put them on hot lava in a model of volcanic energy being added to organic molecules and then added a little water and showed that the heat in the absence of water creates protein like long polymerized molecules so the equilibrium is absolutely the opposite in the deficiency of water than in an excess of water.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned your professor, Sidney Bernhard, and his work on glycolytic enzymes. How did his findings challenge conventional biochemical understanding and relate to equilibrium principles?

**RAY PEAT:** One of my professors, Sidney Bernhard, revolutionized cell physiology but no one seems to have noticed. He demonstrated that the glycolytic enzymes are at a higher concentration in cells than the substrate sugars that they work on and everyone had been diluting these enzymes in water and then describing the rules of interaction with substrate when there was an excess of substrate and water and a deficiency of enzymes but he showed that actually there are more enzymes per cubic unit than sugar molecules and the concentration totally changes the equilibrium situation and Sidney Fox demonstrated not only does the relatively dry heat create order and protein like molecules out of free amino acids but when he added water the proteins spontaneously formed tiny bacteria like particles almost all the same size, about the size of a bacterium and a very orderly appearance of cell like structures and then over I guess about 20 years he and his students demonstrated that these protein like molecules have enzyme like properties, catalyzed reactions, the amino acids polymerize in a non-random fashion. It depends on what's present in the growing molecule and in its environment. The growing molecule in effect selects certain amino acids to be the next one to add so it isn't growing in a random fashion and once it has grown then it has the same selective pressure over other reactions and there's enzyme like catalytic action in these artificially made spontaneous protein like molecules and so he added the precursors of genetic material and showed that these would be catalyzed into chains and so you have the reverse situation in which genes come last after you've already created nice neat little cells that can metabolize and they can even reproduce themselves without the genes in them. He basically originated life. Yeah and you put the proteinoid microspheres he called them in a solution with amino acids and there the proteins keep going in the growth process because they've concentrated a relatively water free environment in which they do grow and so they assimilate nutrients from the water environment, grow and then when they reach a size at which they are no longer stable they bud or divide and produce new cells as long as there's food available I guess. He did this in the 60s and it was mentioned in my, Lenincher's biochemistry textbook, 1968 edition I think it was and now the new so-called Lenincher biochemistry book with the same title deleted that most interesting stuff that Lenincher had included as an important biochemical principle. Because it doesn't fit their concept? Yeah apparently. Well I would think that what Sidney Fox did would be headline news. Yeah it was for me. I didn't quite understand your professor Sidney Greenheart. He showed that the concentration of glycolytic enzymes was higher in cells than the amount of sugar would warrant? No, in the absolute amount of sugar there would be more than one enzyme per molecule of sugar and a very deficient relative amount of water so that the enzymes can bind a molecule of sugar as it appears and then directly hand the product over to another enzyme. The molecules are so close together that the reactants can go from one enzyme directly to the other without going back in the watery solution and that drastically alters the equilibrium. And if you think of Le Chatelier, the concentration governs the equilibrium and the system adjusts accordingly. So he showed that there was an order? Yeah, the glycolysis was essentially an ordered process where all of the test tube biochemists dissolve themselves. Before Bernhard had been working on that, I had gone around to all of the chemistry professors trying to feel out ways for studying those processes without dissolving the cells. Basically their reaction was just to laugh and get rid of me because they said, you don't have biochemistry if you don't squash and dilute cells.

**CONTEXT:** This seems to highlight a fundamental divide in scientific philosophy. How would you characterize this divide?

**RAY PEAT:** So it seems to me this whole divide between the two philosophies is like the reductionist versus the, I don't know what you call them, you have a word for it, I'm sure, the holists. Somebody who looks at the whole organism rather than just dividing it into a mechanistic little parts. It also seems like science is afraid of sounding religious or something.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Fred Hoyle's perspective on the universe. How did his ideas align with the cosmic realist view?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, did you happen to read my Generative Energy book? Yeah, I read some of the stuff on Vernadsky. Yeah, Fred Hoyle, I quote both Blake and Fred Hoyle at the top of one of the chapters. Fred Hoyle says that it would be hard to avoid thinking of the cosmos as essentially a biological thing, except that people can't stand the thought. The universe itself is purposeful and alive. And I really wonder why, it almost seems like science is reacting against religion in that sense.

**CONTEXT:** You've touched on the idea of purpose in the universe and its connection to religion. How did Teilhard de Chardin's work on the noosphere contribute to this discussion, and how has it been misinterpreted?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because as far as, a lot of people are drawn to religion and that's because it does give a purpose to life. Yeah, that was where Teilhard de Chardin made a big contribution to French and American civilization by being both a scientist and a religion thinker. His Noosphere got people thinking about the meaning of consciousness in the material world and how that relates to spiritual growth. Unfortunately, some of the ecologically minded people have replaced even the Noosphere of Teilhard but even worse, they've completely reversed the Noosphere of Gernadsky with the idea of the Gaia or Gaia hypothesis. Right. Which basically is like the idea of homeostasis versus creation. And the Gaia hypothesis says that the earth is sort of like a conscious being except it's not going anywhere. It's trying to maintain itself. And one of the implications of the randomness thinking is that random events have wiped out many species in the past and that that just has to be accepted. A species might take four billion years to evolve but it's okay if they're wiped out by industry or whatever because that's a normal event in history. But when you look at it from the Gernadsky point of view, the earth and the sun are driving evolution as a system in which the microorganisms, soil organisms, vegetation and animals and culture are all being driven forward as a system. If you delete parts of the system, the whole four billion years might go to waste. Right. Whereas the people inclined towards the Gaia hypothesis and the random evolution tend to say whatever happens is okay. So, I always thought the Gaia hypothesis was more of a, the earth is a being, is an organism, but I felt like the people, the proponents of that idea were not accepting of man's basically hurting the organism on which we live and are a part of. Well, they say that the organism is a self-repairing system and that you just, you don't want to kill it, that it will repair itself and restore what was, but they don't see it as a growing and evolving purposeful organism being driven in a specific direction by specific energy. With a specific purpose. Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** How did Vernadsky's principles extend Le Chatelier's principle, and what did this reveal about the evolution of complex organisms?

**RAY PEAT:** The principles that Vernadsky developed were really extensions of Le Chatelier's principle. He showed that the migration of atoms and the use of energy, the intensity of metabolism, all of these he made as subdivisions of Le Chatelier's principle, but it basically showed why large-brained, warm-blooded animals had to evolve as the world system evolved.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain Nikolai Kozyrev's astronomical theories regarding stellar energy and the role of time?

**RAY PEAT:** At sort of another level but really parallel and probably for similar cosmic realist philosophical positions, an astronomer Nikolai Kozyrev did his doctoral dissertation around 1950 on the energy of stars and he, like these other people who pointed out that order tends to appear anytime you have a system which is receiving energy from the outside. In just the more abstract concept, Kozyrev said, what if we assume that the universe is not necessarily running down and that the......within a system entropy....does tend only to increase, but there's no such system that we know of, so why should we say that that is the ruling effect of entropy? What if we assume that the universe is not just running down, that it wasn't created at one moment, like someone winding up a clock, only to run down......and he said, time seems to us to move in one direction, but these people who were working out why the universe seems to be running down incorporated the assumption that time is not real. And that time abstractly on the physical level is reversible, because you have said what if we assume that time physically is a real asymmetric factor in all systems, then the mere passage of time distinguishes one state of a system from another state of a system in a real physical way. And he said what if we apply this using standard Einsteinian arguments, what if we apply this to the energy of stars and say that the passage of time introduces something, every moment of time that passes something is being added to the system rather than time being as much downhill as uphill, and just by that simple assumption that what if time is real, he showed that that assumption leads to increasing energy being produced through time by a mass in proportion to how big the mass is, and so he said okay, now we can suppose that time itself is the source of stellar energy, what if we scale that down to Jupiter for example, and back in the early 1950s before people were measuring the energy and temperature of the planets, he had predicted that Jupiter and Neptune would be emitting more heat than they receive, and that each planet would have internal heat in proportion to its mass, and scaling it down to the size of the moon, he said that the internal energy of the moon is likely to produce an occasional volcanic eruption or emission of very hot gases, and so he trained his spectrometer through a telescope on the dark phases of the moon and recorded various hot emissions, and other people had recorded these but he found them according to the prediction of how much heat should be generated inside the mass simply by his reasoning because of the passage of time, so his physics I think should be taken into account in thinking about volcanic energy.

**CONTEXT:** The caller raises the issue of consciousness, its relationship to the brain, and the scientific paradigm that views it as an epiphenomenon. They also mention the difficulty in locating memory and the idea of interactionism. How do these concepts relate to the broader discussion of bioelectric fields and formative causation?

**RAY PEAT:** The scientific paradigm about consciousness is that it's a sort of epiphenomena of physiochemical processes in the brain and that it's more or less self-referential. In other words, what I think or feel doesn't interface with anything outside myself or anyone outside myself. It's entirely self-referential. There seem to be a lot of problems with this idea, if I've understood it correctly. The first of which is... My understanding is somewhat limited about this, though I may be making a fool out of myself, but that no one's been able to locate memory in the brain. The person who did the initial research that showed a relationship between different areas of the brain and the existence of specific memories of either olfactory or auditory or whatever operated on epileptic patients who remained conscious during brain surgery. Yet he came to espouse the idea of interactionism, that mind and brain are two different but interactive structures or forces. That thoughts or rather memories weren't stored in the brain per se, but existed in some type of field. My personal history is part of where my ideas on this have come from. Before I discovered that thyroid was very important in my metabolism, I was a hypermetabolic individual. I would burn 10,000 calories in a day and I had an electrical field around my body that would affect physical things like millivolt meters about two feet away from my body. For years I was very conscious of this sometimes really annoying electrical field. I couldn't operate the apparatus. I had to have my lab partner do it because it would go off scale when I got near it. All of this stopped when I took the right amount of thyroid. My metabolism became more normal and regulated. I saw that oxidative metabolism generated this potentially very immense and disturbing field around cells and the whole body. This has inclined me more than people who haven't had those actual personal experiences with bioelectric fields. It has inclined me to see the importance of bioelectric fields in development and physiology. I still use this kind of field thinking. For example, there is a field concept of cancer. Traditionally the definition of the field has been left open, but a lot of research shows that it is an electro-magnetic field or a bioelectric field, at least in part, that creates the precancerous and cancerous conditions in a tissue or that governs the development of an embryo and so on. Yes, and that idea has been taken up by people like Dr. Rupert Sheldrake who came up with a theory which he calls formative causation. From Vernadsky's perspective, I think the supplementary context for that is that things are ready to be discovered and that when you change components in the system, many things are contributing, not just the individual's consciousness, but the preconditions are tending to make that certain behavior probable so that Vernadsky would emphasize multi-causal factors rather than just conscious factors.

**CONTEXT:** You've alluded to a scientific taboo regarding the inheritance of acquired characteristics. What is your stance on this, and what historical figures have been marginalized for their views?

**RAY PEAT:** I also wondered, you seem to have been skirting around something which is sort of a scientific taboo and I wondered what you thought of the evidence for the so-called inheritance of acquired characteristics. Definitely, they are a fact. Darwin knew it. His work was real and a lot of people have met similar faiths. People slandered Lamarck and took him down because of the implications of his really empirical physiological approach to life. People couldn't stand that in 1820 or 1830 and so they had to disassemble his reputation. The same thing happened to Camerer and everyone who violates the taboos. Carl Lindegren wrote a book, Cold War in Biology, that is the best American book on the subject that I know.

**CONTEXT:** The popular media often presents a deterministic view of genetics, emphasizing the "selfish gene." What is your critique of this perspective, and what is the actual proven function of genes?

**RAY PEAT:** What I have been seeing, at least on the level of the popular media and the way the idea of genetics is presented, is a kind of genetic determinism in which the public at large is being led to believe that a gene is sort of an individual, almost like an organism itself, the selfish gene and all that sort of thing, which then is responsible for a specific quality or characteristic appearing. As far as I know, no one has ever proved that genes do anything except organize the synthesis of proteins.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the historical motivations behind certain genetic theories, particularly their use for exclusionary purposes. Can you elaborate on this and the connection to figures like Conrad Lorenz?

**RAY PEAT:** I guess I have been interested in the subject for more than 50 years so I have noticed the things going on and tried to find out where they came from. In some of my newsletters I will be talking about related issues, but the motivation for a lot of these ideas around 1910 to 1920 was to stop immigration of Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans to the United States. So they created IQ tests and showed that Russians and Jews and the various people that they didn't want to immigrate, 85% of them were feeble-minded. Naturally they gave the tests in English. These tests were very explicitly designed for racist, exclusionary purposes. Many of these people have persisted in the universities. The bell curve, for example, is a real idiot at Harvard. It was one of the last hangers on and these people had great success in getting published in Science, the leading American science magazine. When I sent a tiny letter criticizing one of these genetic determinations of intelligence, I think it was an eight or ten page article, I sent about a two-sentence letter. They sent me pages of anonymous referees, one of them the only evidence that was cited for not publishing my little letter critical of the conclusions. I just said the conclusions have nothing whatsoever to do with the text of the article. These pages of anonymous referees were rejecting my comment. The only data cited was from Hitler's Racial Hygiene Institute and that got me interested in studying what was going on there. I saw that by studying that period I saw that Conrad Lorenz was the architect of the racial hygiene. He created the rationale based on American IQ and racism. He created the rationale for exterminating inferior people. Conrad Lorenz was a Nazi. I think it was his last book he repeated exactly the arguments of his 1942 and the founding papers of genocide. He repeated the exact arguments except he replaced exterminate with some slightly mild translation. He never repented from this idea of eliminating genetic inferiority. I think the ideology has survived apparently but it has been shorn of certain terms. One for instance never heard the word eugenics anymore. I went to a lecture in the 70s and all the professors from my biology department were there nodding happily as Gunder Stent who was a Jewish refugee from Hitler as Gunder Stent presented Conrad Lorenz's argument for genocide as the ultimate in understanding the brain genetically. All of my professors were there happily agreeing that this was wonderful stuff. When my friend and I pointed out some of the logical irrationalities such as he was saying that a person's life and work are a genetically determined unit suddenly they said are you saying that the fact that he was a Nazi had anything to do with the validity of these ideas? The whole point of the lecture was that every cultural feature is genetically determined.

**CONTEXT:** How did the Indian caste system evolve, and what were its underlying principles and potential motivations?

**RAY PEAT:** One interesting sidelight on this is that in the Indian tradition there were the so-called laws of Manu which basically governed the questions of occupation, heredity, and the creation of a caste system based on certain ideas about that. My understanding was originally the caste system was not hereditary but it was rather simply the recognition that certain people had certain proclivities or natural abilities or interests or capacities and that they could be best sorted out according to those in various occupational groups and so forth but that it was possible to move from one to the other. Then gradually it became ossified into a hereditary system in which if your father was a leather worker or something you would be one or if he was a farmer you would be one and there was no mobility and no possibility of actually assimilating anything new so to speak. I think one of the driving forces of the caste system was 3500 years ago the Nordics, the Indo-Europeans invaded and enslaved the dark native people and I think that was the racial caste difference that became the power that stayed in force and tended to rigidify the occupational system.

**CONTEXT:** What is your interpretation of "survival of the fittest" and its implications for societal structures?

**RAY PEAT:** Do you think this whole caste system and emphasis on genetics as being the set and stone basis for your status in life, do you think people are justifying survival of the fittest? No, the whole idea of survival of the fittest is basically saying that whoever is in power is the fittest and whoever is able to say it with most force is the fittest and if you object and they can kill you, they are the fittest and it basically is tending to create a ruling class of inferiors if they keep their status quo.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned the misinterpretations of figures like Garland and Adam Smith in modern ideology. Can you elaborate on how their ideas have been distorted, and how this relates to the broader intellectual landscape?

**RAY PEAT:** What do you think of the misappropriation, I mean it seems like the modern, the official ideology you might call it of the ruling classes in this country is compounded of misinterpretations of Garland and Adam Smith basically and that you know I personally don't find the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution intellectually convincing at all myself but whenever I bring this up it's roughly, people look at me as if science suggested that the earth is flat because it constitutes so to speak the very pillar of their thought about how the world is organized and operates. Yeah, if you point out, if you start pointing out any of the thousand hidden assumptions or thousand facts that they are trying to cover up, you get to about two or three of them and then they remove you in some way from the discussion. Right, and interestingly Adam Smith's ideas intersate with Darwinism very much I think and they are always misrepresented in economics textbooks. For instance, we all know that Adam Smith believes that self-interest was the appropriate form of being so to speak and acting and that if everyone pursued their own self-interest to the maximal degree that would result in the maximal degree of happiness for all. But what they leave out is that Smith believed also in benevolence as a counterpoint to self-interest, to naked self-interest and that you could say his idea of benevolence was a kind of social capital you might say and you know his comment for instance on businessmen is quote, they neither are nor ought to be the rulers of mankind unquote and yet his ideas are promoted, one half of his ideas are promoted, the other half is ignored. Similarly, Darwin. It isn't just neo-Darwinism and the Smith disorders but it's basically everything in our intellectual history. I've had a habit of reading textbooks in many different fields over the years and really 99 plus percent of them are ideological distortions, rewriting of history, leaving out everything interesting or threatening to the established system. Every field of knowledge has been distorted, art, literature, everything, part of culture that you can think of has its threatening aspects and in education it happens that the potential meaningfulness that some of these ideas give to life are very exciting to students and so education has been very powerfully trimmed down to become nothing but an indoctrination in these distortions of Adam Smith, Darwin, Pavlov, everyone that's treated if they were too good they have to be distorted, if they were too good they have to be left out entirely.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Darwin and Wallace. What was the fundamental difference in their views on evolution, and how did Wallace's ideas about consciousness and guiding intelligences get dismissed?

**RAY PEAT:** Right, for instance I remember my biology textbook talked a little bit about Darwin and Wallace and contrasted their basically coincident discovery of so-called natural selection but a radical difference between Darwin and Wallace is that Wallace simply could not accept the idea of an entirely mechanical evolutionary process driven by randomness or chance. Yeah, Darwin didn't either though. Yeah, right. And Wallace actually went to the extent of writing a book which I had never been able to locate in which he tried to work on the idea that there was consciousness and will and even perhaps, this is really going over the edge, angelic intelligences as he calls them who were guiding the evolutionary unfoldment of people or humans. You know, of course they wrote him off. Can't have that. Yeah, can't have that.

**CONTEXT:** You've observed that science, initially a reaction against religious provincialism, has itself become an ideology, or "scientism." How has this shift occurred, and what are its core tenets?

**RAY PEAT:** But I'm turning the discussion a little bit back, there seems to be, you know, science developed as a reaction against what I guess you could call religious provincialism or metaphysical speculation, you know, by giving people a concrete method by which they could prove or disprove certain phenomena and repeat them and, you know, like that. But then it seems to have turned into an ideology, I mean science as a method is one thing, science as an ideology, scientism is something else altogether. My view is that they got one little success but then they decided to give in to the forces which were also driving the backward cultural forces which at one time were very closely identified with religion. But these same forces took over and most scientists have accepted the fundamental assumptions of the people who used those assumptions for what they called religious purposes. Right. It's a kind of surrogate religion for the materialist, you might say. How it works is by eliminating all of the troubling, complexifying other things and reducing everything to a few principles of random variation, for example, and chance and survival of the so-called fittest.

**CONTEXT:** The neo-Darwinian theory of evolution posits random mutation and natural selection. How does Vernadsky's perspective on energy and evolution challenge the idea of randomness and infinite time as drivers of evolutionary change?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you know what's interesting about that is that, I mean, I'm not a mathematician, but my understanding is that the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution basically posits random mutation and natural selection as the driving factors in the creation and the dominance of certain species and the death of others. But randomness is based on the idea of infinite time, in other words, given enough time, if you throw bricks at random they will organize themselves into a building or if you put a bunch of monkeys in a room with typewriters they will eventually write the sun also rises or war and peace or something. That's where Vernadsky shows that very quickly species will arise to the limits of the resources available, that evolution is driven in a relatively practically instantaneous way. There is such a powerful, guiding influence coming from this energy disturbing the old equilibrium that variation, whatever the stimulus might be, there might be some random events, but the driving environmental force is so powerful that evolution is relatively fast and directional. And one of the puzzling things is if you posit mutation as one of the principal driving forces, most mutations are regressive and Sheldrake points out you might be able to get, say, an insect precursor of a fly that couldn't fly and it might somehow through genetic mutation produce one wing, but what are the probabilities that it could produce two wings and then what are the probabilities that those two wings would be functional and actually allow it to fly, etc., etc., etc. In other words it seems like a series of probabilities linked together to explain how we get flies. If you look at it in the context of energy added to the system and look for rules of stability, there are many different physical principles that are well accepted, like hysteresis, the system memory, every system that is undergoing change has a certain memory of the changes it has gone through. And long range order, a surface projects a sort of field or ordering influence into, for example, the surrounding water or air or vacuum and orders its environment. Michael Polanyi's absorption isotherm came prematurely for western physics and so it was ignored, but he showed that surfaces project their influence into the environment. One of my professors posted electron microscope pictures, but as far as I know never published about them, he showed that you can lay a plastic membrane, a sheet of plastic, over a crystal and in a vacuum evaporate a different chemical on top of the crystal and the first accumulation of atoms appears ordered, it takes on the ordering characteristics of the crystal under the plastic layer showing that the crystal isn't working just atom to atom but is projecting a field through space that orders the way atoms of another substance fall and stick to the membrane. So in other words there paradoxically is some type of consciousness inherent in so called matter and in life forms.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Alexander Rothen and his work on measuring ordering influences. How does this relate to the idea of long-range ordering principles and the potential for consciousness in matter?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the principle that explains Polanyi's and several other people, a man devised a way of measuring this optically, the ordering influence that could be projected through membranes and devised a lot of interesting techniques that no one is using. Alexander Rothen, I think he died about 1980, he was applying a lot of these long range ordering principles. The mechanism seems to be partly that the electrons on an atom are resonating such that one atom will induce a field in whatever the next atom is which then induces a field off into space and if these can be ordered rather than going simply away from the surface out in space, if the surface reinforces this in the other dimension horizontally then you can project for amazing distances this ordering field.

**CONTEXT:** You also brought up the discovery of magnetite in human brain tissue and its potential connection to navigation. How does this relate to the broader theme of non-conventional communication and ordering influences?

**RAY PEAT:** On a similar note I understand that they recently discovered the presence of magnetite in human brain tissue which is of course a form of iron. I think some people have it and some don't according to the experiments. You can put some people out in the woods and I think about fifteen percent of them know always where north is and the rest of them have no clue.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the work of the Gervaches and your professor's findings on cell communication through quartz windows and plastic membranes. How do these experiments challenge the prevailing scientific understanding of communication mechanisms?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, a related thing is the discovery several years ago that heart cells, human heart cells which were put in close proximity but not actually touching or what not appeared to influence the physiological processes in other cells even though they weren't physically touching or chemically linked. In the 1930s the Gervaches were demonstrating this process but again they were ridiculed. They would demonstrate that you could put a quartz window between cells and they could communicate through that quartz window which was very similar to what my professor demonstrated with a crystal influencing gas molecules through a plastic membrane. In this case a thin quartz window would transmit the influence. I think we are probably circling around the phobia if you, I don't know what else to call it about how research is directed and how people understand these processes and linkages to happen because we don't have as far as I know a mechanism that can explain communication between cells or communication between organisms that are not linked in some kind of concrete material chemical electrical fashion that you can measure and show. There is a missing piece. Usually the missing piece is just that the researcher is too dull minded to think of measuring what might be relevant. They have in mind that only atom to atom forces, only mechanical processes are relevant and so they simply don't measure other conditions such as the phase of the moon or the outside the room conditions. Things that are actually physically affecting the process that they are measuring.

**CONTEXT:** You wanted to mention two more aspects of the origin of life. Can you discuss the implications of submarine vent biology and the work of Sidney Fox in relation to volcanic processes?

**RAY PEAT:** There are two more aspects of this origin of life that I wanted to mention before we finish. The submarine vent biologists are if you link them with Vernadsky and Sidney Fox's work it is very suggestive that the volcanic processes are creating organisms rather than your organisms simply have chosen to live in this incredibly hot environment.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain Mendeleev's observation about petroleum and its connection to volcanic processes and the work of Thomas Gold?

**RAY PEAT:** One of Mendeleev's early perceptions was he happened to be melting, dissolving iron in acid and he noticed the smell of crude petroleum. This happened to be the year that petroleum was discovered or started to be mined in Pennsylvania and he sent samples of this oily material to various petroleum chemists. I think it was 1959 or 1960 and they identified it definitely as petroleum from a certain region and it was simply the carbon molecule atoms that had been dissolved in the hot iron were catalyzed into what everyone agreed smelled exactly like natural petroleum. Thomas Gold is an American, basically a geologist. He has argued that petroleum is being constantly created by a mechanism such as Mendeleev's iron acid reaction. Since volcanoes have plenty of acid and the earth is rich in iron, this Mendeleev reaction would essentially have to produce petroleum in the depths of the earth. Thomas Gold has pointed out that you can find petroleum miles down in granite where it absolutely shouldn't be unless it is being synthesized from the depths of the earth rather than being a fossil material. The traditional idea is that petroleum is a marine biological fossil residue, but Thomas Gold's Mendeleev-Vernadsky interpretation is that the earth is generating new petroleum.

**CONTEXT:** How does this volcanic synthesis of petroleum and organisms relate to Wilhelm Reich's bion experiments?

**RAY PEAT:** These processes, if you think of Sidney Fox's work in which cells are generated by volcanic heat, you have organic sources of energy, fats and oils and carbon dioxide being released. And organisms that... are able to eat carbon dioxide as a raw material. These submarine bacteria live on carbon dioxide. You have many factual things that have to be considered in relation to the origin of life. It basically looks increasingly as if not only petroleum but simple organisms are being generated volcanically and emitted into the depths of the earth. That interfaces, interestingly, with the bion experiments of Dr. Wilhelm Reich in the 1930s where he claimed to have found an intermediate type of life form that was intermediate between matter and biological life forms called bion.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that Sidney Fox's organisms could be produced by high school students. What does this imply about spontaneous generation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, Sydney Fox's organisms. Any high school student can produce little cells that will eat and reproduce. It just takes a few hours in the lab to make organisms. So the spontaneous generation idea is not completely mad altogether? Not at all. I think volcanoes are turning out life all the time. It's amazing.

**CONTEXT:** You also wanted to mention Lancelot Law White. What was his contribution to the philosophy of physics and biology?

**RAY PEAT:** I might mention the work of Lancelot Law White who wrote books on sort of the philosophy of physics and biology. He was I think an important thinker along those lines talking about the formative principle as something that has been overlooked by the conventional science community.
