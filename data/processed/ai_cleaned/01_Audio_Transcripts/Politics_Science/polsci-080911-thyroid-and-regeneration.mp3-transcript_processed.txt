**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are different ways to look at it. It might even be more than that if you think about taking a phospholipid apart into its components and then rebuilding more phospholipids so that a chain will exist as a unit but be rebuilt into a bigger structure. That kind of turnover probably is more than 20 or 30% during the night. You can see 25% of that kind of turnover in I think it was less than an hour in some animal studies, but if you look at the actual oxidation and renewal of particular fats so that a fat is broken down into carbon dioxide, for example, and then new fats come in from the bloodstream. Okay. That's more like 5% per day. If you look at just arachidonic acid, for example, which makes up a considerable amount of the fat in the brain, that changes and is renewed by the bloodstream about 5% per day.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned last week that we regenerate 25-30% of the fats in our brains every night.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, the brain is metabolically... very active. And when you stress a rat, the turnover in the brain is even faster than at rest. But the brain is adapting for the whole organism and thinking up new ways to handle the environment. And whether you put a rat in a tumbling drum to stress it or just......have to go through the eight or ten hours of darkness during the night, they're both stressful and the brain is trying to deal with the stress and make innovations or adjustments that help the body to cope with the next day's tasks.
**CONTEXT:** Why are we regenerating fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, a small amount like... 5% or so, maybe more, are actually being oxidized and a larger amount, maybe 30 or 60%, something like that, is being reshuffled from one molecule to another so that there are many types of phospholipids and other fats in the brain and the subunits can change around so that the... the functions of the nerve cells are adjusted as the type of phospholipid changes.
**CONTEXT:** So the original fats are being burned or are they just getting oxidized?

**RAY PEAT:** The brain synthesizes and stores glycogen similar to muscles and liver. And with aging or stress, the glycogen is depleted and it takes deep sleep to regenerate the glycogen. And the glycogen seems to be essential even if you have circulating glucose. The glycogen is used for those stress-adaptive processes, and having all of your biochemical machinery available, thyroid and the vitamins and minerals and so on, is necessary, but then theâ€¦ deep sleep is needed to restore the glycogen, so that you can meet the next stresses.
**CONTEXT:** What happens to the brain's energy stores?

**RAY PEAT:** You want to avoid the specific anti-thyroid compounds, the goitrogens that you find in a lot of vegetables, grains and nuts. And the polyunsaturated fats. are antithyroid and tryptophan and cysteine that you find in muscle meats at a very high concentration are antithyroid. And the polyunsaturated fats.
**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned before that some foods are particularly unhealthy to your thyroid, which sounds like probably the key mechanism for keeping your metabolism up so that you have the energy available to use.

**RAY PEAT:** People think of the thyroid as being regulated by the pituitary hormone TSH which does its major activator but it's responsive to practically everything. The internal environment, if your estrogen is high, the enzymes in the gland become less responsive and the gland accumulates rather than secreting hormone and progesterone facilitates the enzymes that are needed to secrete the hormone. Polyunsaturated fats inhibit those same enzymes. And so if your body is experiencing a deficiency, your pituitary will increase the TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone, to try to get the gland to compensate, and if you have a lot of estrogen and polyunsaturated fats circulating, the gland will enlarge under the stimulation of the pituitary, and will increase the TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone. but without secreting very efficiently, and during puberty and pregnancy, it's very common for women to have an enlarged thyroid because of the estrogen inhibiting the release of the hormone, and then with a change of circumstances or diet or having the baby when the estrogen......goes down, sometimes there will be an episode of hyperthyroid function as that stored hormone can be released, and that will often scare the patient's doctor if they see their pulse running at 125 beats per minute at rest, and their hands being pink and warm and sweaty. That's classical hyperthyroidism, but a lot of doctors will kill your thyroid with radioactive iodine or cut it out when they see symptoms like that, but it's really usually just a natural adaptive process in which the enlarged gland is returning to normal size, and it takes a few weeks usually to safely unload them. That amount of stored colloid or thyroglobulin, some people have told me that they never felt better in their lives than when they were in their month or two of hyperthyroidism. But unfortunately that's the opportunity for surgeons and radiologists to destroy the thyroid.
**CONTEXT:** Could you explain the function of the thyroid and how it's measured today?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s it was discovered that one molecule called T3 triiodothyronine is the active promoter of respiration, but it took decades for that information to circulate through the American medical community. The Japanese, Israelis, and Russians were the first ones to really assimilate that information. Since estrogen inhibits the activity of the thyroid, women are about five or ten times as likely to have thyroid problems as men. But when one form of synthetic thyroid... T4, which isn't the active respiration promoter, when that was created chemically and became a product, it was tested on 25 year old male medical students, good health young males, and it was found to act just like the desiccated thyroid glands that had been used at that time for 50 years as a... medical supplement and so the marketers began selling it to females without really testing it on females because it worked on young men but in fact it very often interferes because the pituitary and brain will respond to it and shut off the thyroid stimulating hormone. And so it's good at turning off a woman's thyroid gland without necessarily being converted in the liver into the active form.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that T3 is the active hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** An experimenter in the 1960s who hadn't assimilated the knowledge of the two hormones normally existing in a ratio of 3 or 4 to 1. This experimenter sliced up pieces of muscle, kidney, liver, heart, brain, and so on, and then added what he called the thyroid hormone, thyroxin, or T4, to the solution. And he found that it suppressed oxidative metabolism in the heart and muscle and brain. And the liver was the only gland that was strongly responsive to increasing its respiration rate in proportion to the amount of added thyroxine. And so he said he had demonstrated that respiration isn't the important thing done by the thyroid hormone because how could it? It would be important if the thyroid hormone suppresses the metabolism of the brain and the heart. But in fact, the liver is the source of about 70% of the active thyroid hormone that circulates in the bloodstream. The thyroid gland secretes a little bit, 25 or 30%....of the active hormone, but the liver, as it senses the need for energy in the body, converts T4 to T3, and the brain doesn't have much of that capacity for activating the hormone, and so when the T4 increases beyond a certain small amount... it displaces the active hormone and suppresses brain metabolism and I've seen that happen in numerous women. First time I heard about it was at the University of Oregon Medical School Hospital in Portland. A woman who had been on one grain of thyroxin. for some time was getting worse so they raised her dose to two grains and every six months or so she would be worse and so they would increase it. They finally reached the level of the equivalent of five grains which was 500 micrograms of I think it was synthrite and at that point she went into a coma called a myxedema coma and whittled. The skin and other tissues puff up with a gelatinous edema material and she was deeply comatose and luckily some doctor knew about T3 being the active hormone and gave her intravenous T3 and immediately she came out of the coma and was okay. That happened to lower degrees in women who would lose their memory or concentration or get strange sensations, neurological symptoms when they were taking pure T4, but if they would take a balanced product like natural, desiccated thyroid. their symptoms would disappear.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned an experiment where T4 was added to various tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if a person is low in thyroid going into the pregnancy, or if they don't eat enough protein and certain vitamins so that the liver can function, the liver in experiments if you put......a source of estrogen where it goes directly to the liver and measure the amount coming out of the liver. In a healthy person it's 100% going in and 0% coming out, meaning that the liver totally inactivated the estrogen. But if it doesn't have enough protein or certain vitamins, the liver can't inactivate estrogen and so 100% goes in. And maybe 99% of it still comes out and so the estrogen is allowed to reach very high levels and the thyroid would activate the liver metabolism and restore its ability to destroy estrogen. But it becomes a vicious cycle in which if your thyroid is a little low... The liver lets estrogen accumulate to a very high level, and that makes your thyroid go lower by blocking the gland itself. And so it's a vicious circle. And since thyroid is needed to synthesize progesterone, converting cholesterol into progesterone, what happens in that situation is that your cholesterol rises. And your progesterone becomes very low.
**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen become a problem in pregnancy?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1936, papers were published showing that if you measure the cholesterol at the time of persons......thyroid gland is removed surgically, there is a steady, sharp increase over the next few weeks in the blood cholesterol. And then when you put them on a thyroid supplement, the cholesterol returns to normal. And if you are charting the metabolic rate, oxygen consumption of the whole organism. It's a mirror image of the cholesterol. The metabolic rate and oxygen consumption fall as the cholesterol rises under the hypothyroid circumstance. And if you supplement thyroid just as the metabolic rate increases, the cholesterol decreases. And I've seen a couple people who were in a hurry to get their cholesterol down hundreds of points. One had 400 milligrams per cent, the other one 500 and something. And they wanted to have a good physical exam. And they took the active T3 hormone in physiological amounts, roughly 5 micrograms per hour. And in a week, they had restored their cholesterol to the normal range of around 200 milligrams per cent.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that high cholesterol is often associated with low thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some cholesterol is converted to form bile acids. Steroids that help to emulsify fats in the intestine, but the formation of DHEA, pregnenolone and progesterone uses a massive amount of the circulating cholesterol. For example, an experimenter put the bloodstream into an isolated ovary and measured the... hormones or substances in the blood coming out of the ovary and the amount of progesterone coming out the other side of the ovary corresponded directly to the amount of cholesterol going into the ovary and so if your cholesterol level was lowered the progesterone produced by the ovary was lowered and that experiment didn't adjust the other components such as thyroid and vitamin A that are involved with those who are kept at a functional level so that progesterone varies directly with cholesterol.
**CONTEXT:** So is it just a lower metabolism, or are you not converting the cholesterol into other steroids?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and if you artificially lower the cholesterol, you tend to lower the adaptive hormones, especially progesterone. The early studies, I think the first big one was done in Hungary, they saw that lowering cholesterol tremendously increased cancer mortality, and total mortality, and increased... death rate from accidents, and homicide, and even heart disease, strokes.
**CONTEXT:** So when they're worried about the cholesterol, it sounds like really the cholesterol is just a sign that your metabolism isn't functioning well.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, since about 1920, they showed that just injecting pure cholesterol is protective against all the types of toxins that they test at bacterial toxins. Um, mercury, and... plant toxins and so on, and it protects red blood cells from being broken down by mercury and enzyme toxins, spider and snake poisons and so on. And yet there is evidence that a high cholesterol rate, you know, when you get into the, I don't know. That's really just because you don't get a high excess....cholesterol in the blood without being hypothyroid. And you can correlate high cholesterol with lots of things such as poor learning ability and so on, but in experiments, if you inject cholesterol right into the brain, it improves learning ability and nerve function. The low cholesterol, the low thyroid which is responsible for the high cholesterol that accounts for the disease that they associate with the high cholesterol.
**CONTEXT:** You've said before that cholesterol itself is protective.

**RAY PEAT:** When you can't make the protective adaptive steroids such as progesterone and DHEA out of the cholesterol your body does its next best adaptive procedure which is to increase the cortisol or cortisone and the chronic elevation of cortisol. Which is associated with high cholesterol and low thyroid, that's one of the toxic effects that you see in people with high cholesterol. The chronic exposure to excess cortisol weakens blood vessels for example and promotes bleeding but it also can promote clotting. Osteoporosis and various tissue degenerative processes.
**CONTEXT:** So when they say strokes are caused by high cholesterol, it's actually that you're just hypothyroid and your metabolism isn't functioning.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh it protects you if you don't have enough pregnenolone, DHEA and progesterone you need cortisol to handle stress but the way it handles stress is to depress inflammation. But it does it at the expense of tissues such as your thymus, gland, muscle, skin, and liver converting protein to fuel to use for energy to combat the stress. So it's spending your organism rapidly to get you through a crisis situation.
**CONTEXT:** But cortisol also has a positive purpose, doesn't it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably the cortisol directly signals the liver. They've done in-vitro experiments that indicate that the cortisol is blocking. The enzymes that convert thyroxin into the active T3 hormone, so it's doing many related things, increasing the circulating cysteine and tryptophan to suppress the gland itself and changing several levels.
**CONTEXT:** So it sounds like it's an emergency adaptation, and then that makes you even more hypothyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** They were measuring the ability to extract oxygen and burn calories. And they saw that the lower a person's oxidative metabolism was, the more symptoms they had and they found that giving desiccated thyroid to increase their oxygen consumption, the symptoms would be alleviated. And so they had a large list of diagnostic symptoms, everything from having yellow palms of the hands, soles of the feet from accumulated carotene infertility, which they found was associated very often with red spots in the ovaries the corpus luteum, it means the yellow body, but in hypothyroid people it was found to be a red body because it contained so much carotene and the carotene was blocking the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone because vitamin A is needed and low thyroid people accumulate the carotene because they aren't using the vitamin A fast enough and then they can't convert cholesterol to progesterone and become infertile same process happens in the adrenals and the testicles and in the brain any place that vitamin A is is used to vitamin A is needed to antagonize estrogen in probably all cells including the skin and carotene accumulates and interferes with the use of vitamin A and You could just look at a person's palms and very often diagnose hypothyroidism, but falling hair, thinning hair, thinning skin or thickening skin, either one depending on their cortisone response, sweating excessively or not at all. If a person had been chronically hypothyroid, their growth was usually either deficient or excessive. Very often people who hadn't reached an average height were found to grow to a normal height when they took thyroid. And the people with an excessive growth hormone were found to......lower their symptoms of acromegaly if they took a thyroid supplement.
**CONTEXT:** In the 1930s, about 40% of people were considered hypothyroid. How did they determine that?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I would...when they did that experiment on medical students and showed that the synthetic hormone... supposedly worked just like the real stuff, that went with an advertising campaign. When I was in junior high and high school, all the fat kids were reciting what they had heard from their doctor that they were just gluttonous and blazy and didn't have a hormone problem. Because a test, a blood test, was circulated at that same time that measured protein-bound iodine. And that test showed that 95% of the population were normal. Only 5% had a low protein-bound iodine content. And so, even though... At least 40% of the people would have benefited according to the pre-war diagnostic methods. If they got anything, it was likely to be the inactive thyroxine rather than the real active hormone. And that contributed to the belief that, since people didn't benefit, that they would have a low protein-bound iodine content. That confirmed the idea that 95% of the people, at least, were not hypothyroid. But about 20 years later, the protein-bound iodine test was found to have essentially nothing to do with thyroid function. And what it had accomplished, though, was to teach doctors that whole picture of things that... Only 5% at most would need a thyroid supplement and when they got it, it probably wouldn't help very much because it was likely to be the inactive thyroxine. And so over the years, new blood tests came out that actually measured the various thyroid substances in the blood. But they kept the doctrine that 95% of the people were not hypothyroid, and so their normal definition made the new tests irrelevant.
**CONTEXT:** How did we go from 40% hypothyroid to the current understanding?

**RAY PEAT:** It was developing nicely up through the 30s. The idea of a developmental field was taken from embryology. It was being applied to cancer physiology, even though the first person to theorize about cancer having a field was, I think, in 1830. It had developed a good scientific context by 1930 and was being integrated with embryology. The aging process was being seen as nothing but an extension of embryological development and that was seen in terms of holes or fields rather than each cell being an individual running on a clock. You know Leibniz and this monad theory in which there's no interaction between the monads. Every individual cell or person has its internal model of the universe running like a clock. And it doesn't matter where it is, it'll do the same thing. That really was the model that took over medicine after the Second World War.
**CONTEXT:** It sounds like the idea of regeneration and cellular renewal was suppressed.

**RAY PEAT:** The whole cell is the receptor. Okay. It's it's like a perceptual process because the state of the cell governs what the receptor is going to do. The cell is in charge. The receptor can do one thing or another depending on what the cell needs and what the cell needs. How the cell is using its perceptive capacity.
**CONTEXT:** Do you think there's such a thing as a receptor as a place where things plug in?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. And it has extended into the virus theory and it works against environmental causation of cancer and creates myths about them. cancer causation and so on. So it's hard to separate ignorant results from deliberate propaganda results.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that national security might be the reason this information hasn't benefited the public.

**RAY PEAT:** Well the cell will start the process. When a cell is injured, that accelerates renewal and healing. And one of the signals for starting accelerated renewal and healing is the fact that the damaged cell doesn't respire properly and doesn't use its thyroid environment to good effect. And so it shifts over to the injury metabolism....of glycolysis producing lactic acid. And lactic acid stimulates the growth and invasion of blood vessels and the acceleration of cell division and secretion of connective tissue collagen. And so injury damages the thyroid-governed metabolism and starts up the process of accelerated... renewal of the tissue. But if you don't have the proper thyroid available when the tissue has recovered, the tissue might still stay in that stress or injury-adapted condition and go on producing lactic acid and stimulating cells. Multiplication, collagen secretion and all of the wound adaptive processes increased formation of blood vessels and clotting very often is accelerated. So if the whole body doesn't have enough thyroid and other supportive hormones. The injury can develop into a tumor, but normally if your thyroid is functioning properly, instead of having those locally accelerated regenerative processes, every place there's an injury or stress, the whole body is normally slowly and at different rates according to the local needs. The whole body is renewing itself in a process of tissue streaming or organ streaming, thinking of the cells as like a fountain of cells coming out of one part of the organ or tissue and growing and functioning and then disappearing in another part of the tissue. In the cornea of the eye, for example, they've applied a dye and found that the cells literally stream over a period of days from the edge of the cornea up onto the cornea, a constant movement of cell renewal creeping over the surface of the cornea. And in the liver and the adrenal glands, skin and the intestine. People have demonstrated this constant renewal of streaming or flowing of new cells into the tissue and the disappearance of old cells. Supply is an example of that. New cells are born, live for about three months and then disappear and the material is recycled. Every tissue is undergoing that kind of a renewal from stem cells, but that, for various reasons, even though the research was done, Alexis Carroll, for example, at Rockefeller Institute in the early years of the century and then Polychayev. A Russian researcher in the 40s and 50s demonstrated regeneration and renewal even in the brain and Polychayev was regenerating whole dog muscles in the 1940s but that violated one of the main medical biological doctrines of the time. The establishment was creating a particular business model of medicine and biology that took over very completely in the late 1940s and the idea of organ regeneration as a normal biological process was just stamped out very thoroughly. So that people thought of aging as a simple natural process in which each cell had its finite lifespan and when that was used up the organism would die. You can see it in the, still many doctors believe in the ovary having a certain number of. Eggs, when the woman is born and menopause occurs because they have depleted their lifetime supply of eggs. The same thing applied to the lifetime supply of brain cells or heart cells or whatever. The idea was that they had a finite lifespan but in fact for a hundred years. The evidence has been showing otherwise but it just wasn't admitted into mainline science and medicine.
**CONTEXT:** What happens to your cells when you don't have the energy to regenerate?
