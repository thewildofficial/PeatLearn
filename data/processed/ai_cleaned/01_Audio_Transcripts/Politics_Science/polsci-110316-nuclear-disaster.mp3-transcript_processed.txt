**RAY PEAT:** The main factors are the amount of magnesium in the cells and the metabolic rate. And it happens that the thyroid hormone is what's needed for the cells to retain magnesium at a high level. And this old that I reviewed 30 years ago... The central idea was the high metabolic rate activating. repair processes, so that once the damage was done, it was almost immediately repaired. The thyroid function was very high, allowing cells to retain magnesium.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat begins by discussing the fundamental factors influencing radiation damage mitigation.

**RAY PEAT:** And just in the last couple of years, a group studying the radio-resistant bacteria, they've been found in several situations. They were discovered at Oregon State University when they were sterilizing food with super intense radiation in a can. And the irradiated food, after a few weeks, rotted. And they found there were bacteria that survived millions of rads. And this type of bacteria, just recently, was found not to have any special resistance of its DNA, but the protein system that repairs the DNA is what is uniquely resistant to radiation damage. The DNA can be torn into tiny fragments, but if you have the enzyme left for repairing, the bacteria reinstall their DNA from tiny little scraps if the proteins are good. And this group recently discovered that manganese is an essential factor for... the survival of these bacteria. What the manganese is doing is catalyzing very fast metabolism of glucose.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on recent findings regarding radio-resistant bacteria and the role of manganese in their survival.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it resembles, it's parallel to the thyroid function. They do it just by this manganese-containing enzyme system that very powerfully turns glucose into carbon dioxide. But in mammals, it's thyroid hormone that's primarily responsible for turning glucose and fats into carbon dioxide. So one of the problems with radiation is that it does damage the thyroid, and I know that, I guess my last guess just said that the... American Surgeon General, who's traveling abroad, just recommended that people get a supply of potassium iodine to take, which I hadn't heard this. Yeah, the CDC, a few days ago, recommended a single dose of 160 milligrams of potassium iodide for an adult to be repeated if the iodine cloud stays around for more than one day. Kelp or adult, or other iodine-rich seaweed, a few grams per day will do that if you don't have the pure potassium iodide. And even the antiseptic picture of iodine, if you paint some on your skin, people have used that to disinfect water, so if you're not allergic to that, that's an alternative way of getting your iodine up. But I think that the basic thing is to keep your thyroid hormone active, if necessary, by using a supplement of thyroid hormone to keep your thyroid-stimulating hormone, the TSH, down as close to zero as you can get it, because that's good for many reasons, including that your thyroid isn't going to be metabolizing, and so it won't take up the toxic concentration of radioactive iodine if your TSH is kept at zero. And meanwhile the high thyroid activity is going to accelerate the repair processes. If you rely on potassium iodide, that's going to dilute the radioactive contaminant so that it doesn't destroy your thyroid gland. But the potassium iodide tends to suppress your thyroid function, lowering the whole body's metabolic rate and that makes it increasingly susceptible to radiation damage. If you think of the inverse relationship between thyroid and estrogen, a low thyroid person usually has very high estrogen. A very high thyroid person has low estrogen and estrogen synergizes with radiation damage. So a low thyroid person is doing many things to make all of their tissues more susceptible to injury by all of the radiation sources, which include carbon isotopes, stesium, strontium isotopes are important ones in nuclear fallout. And the iodide suppressing your thyroid gland as the CDC recommends. It isn't going to do anything at all to protect you against strontium, caesium, carbon and other radiation sources and in fact will tend to make you more susceptible to injury by them by suppressing your thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the parallel between manganese-catalyzed glucose metabolism in bacteria and thyroid hormone's role in mammals, highlighting the importance of thyroid function for radiation protection and critiquing the reliance on potassium iodide alone.

**RAY PEAT:** Because if your thyroid is functioning you'll be able to remove those quicker? Yeah, the cells are producing carbon dioxide which forms a defensive barrier on the proteins keeping them from suffering destructive oxidation. And the magnesium retained by the thyroid is used in the repair enzymes for DNA repair. And at the same time you're lowering the estrogen throughout your body, which you want to avoid that synergistic effect of radiation and estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat further details how a functioning thyroid, through carbon dioxide production and magnesium retention, aids in cellular repair and mitigates the synergistic damage of radiation and estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you don't have thyroid builds, or kelp, or dulse, or seaweed, then potassium iodide is fine if you're not allergic to it. Some people have a very intense inflammatory reaction when they take iodide or iodine. And in terms of raising your thyroid function, most people probably won't be able to get their hands on any thyroid supplements. How can they do that? Well, the quickest way is to make sure that you're getting enough. Food and fuel, sugar, moment by moment, is used by your liver to activate the thyroid hormones. So if you go hungry for several hours, your thyroid is going to decrease its function. And on even a shorter scale than just keeping your body well nourished, use coconut oil with its pure cane saturated fatty acids. It competes with the inhibiting unsaturated fats that are always tending to circulate in the body and those are acting as a brake on the thyroids of the coconut oil. These are short cane fats that are able to compete against the inhibitors of the thyroid, momentarily liberating a higher thyroid function. That only lasts a couple hours for a tablespoon of coconut oil, so if you add nothing else you could eat a tablespoon of coconut oil every couple of hours.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides practical advice on supporting thyroid function through diet, specifically mentioning sugar, coconut oil, and the temporary benefits of saturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** Only in the sense that it activates your thyroid function more powerfully. Not very, in some situations they are protective against radiation, but when I was reviewing the literature thirty years ago, they were somewhat ambiguous and nothing very interesting has turned up since then. Progesterone as an anti-estrogen is probably one of the other short-range protective things.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat briefly touches upon the potential protective role of progesterone against radiation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. A lot of this research was done in the late 1930s and the estrogen functions were identified as similar to suffocation and stress and radiation. And about 15 years later, when the concept of estrogen receptor was introduced, there was a great push to distract people from the biochemical effects of estrogen and blame all of estrogen's effects on the actions of a receptor protein, which was supposed to activate... the genes which create the female traits. But it turned out that that was really... the research was supported by the Atomic Energy Commission, and it claimed that estrogen is not metabolized in the cells where it's acting. And 20 years later, that was proven to be absolutely false. The fact that it was supported by the Atomic Energy Commission and done by a man who had been working in chemical warfare I think makes that the whole foundation of the receptor theory suspect because the 1930s research was very clear that any stress activates. Including the protein that is now called the estrogen receptor, any injury to the organism increases the appearance of the estrogen receptor, as well as the estrogen function, which include inflammation, water uptake, suppression of the respiratory function, and eventually atrophy and fibrosis and calcification.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the historical research linking estrogen's effects to radiation and stress, and critiques the subsequent focus on estrogen receptors, suggesting a potential military influence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And radiation has those similar effects, I understand. You know, biochemically they seem, my dissertation was, part of it was trying to find anything different between radiation, stress, and estrogen's effect. I couldn't find any basic physiological or biochemical difference between them. They both interfere with oxidative metabolism and activate the stress metabolism. So I think that means that we have evolved estrogen simply as a way to activate certain biological processes of cell division in preparation. For implantation of the embryo and uterus, cell division to develop the breasts to give milk, and cell division in the pituitary to activate prolactin secretion, and it takes only about 12 hours of exposure to estrogen to get those processes going. So I think the biological meaning of estrogen is just... like a quick jump start function for a certain process. And the chronic use of it is completely contrary to the real biological research and really has no foundation other than the marketing departments of the drug companies and whatever the military has in mind.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reiterates the biochemical similarity between radiation, stress, and estrogen, proposing that estrogen's natural role is a temporary biological trigger rather than a chronic state.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, at different times they have been interested in its birth control effect, population control. That's one of the things they were studying. I think you've written about this. Releases of large amounts of radiation and then studied the effect it had on population and sterility and such.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the military's historical interest in estrogen for population control and its potential connection to studies on radiation's effects.

**RAY PEAT:** As long as it stays very high in the atmosphere and doesn't brighten out it isn't going to do too much harm. But if it doesn't rain out in the Pacific... And if it happens to get through a dry spell for a few days across the Pacific and then rains out wherever it comes down, it will do a lot of damage. A few of the bombs that exploded in Nevada happened to stay in the air until one of the fallout clouds rained down. In New York, in Pennsylvania, I guess, was the one that Sternglass happened to be on the site and saw that his radiation measurements were showing extreme contamination while the government was saying nothing had happened and that started Sternglass on his research on what was really happening and he showed how the U.S. Public Health Service was collaborating with the Atomic Energy Commission and even state government agencies to put out false information and destroy the actual data. So whatever we're going to hear from the governments of Japan and the United States, I don't think we're going to hear anything from them.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the potential impact of atmospheric radiation fallout and highlights historical instances of suppressed data regarding nuclear events.

**RAY PEAT:** You can't have a nuclear industry or a popular nuclear deterrent idea. You're wrong. People understand the dangers that are very likely to happen from things that are fairly uncontrollable. Mining the material and disposing of the material are sources of radiation exposure. They are now talking about avoiding the carbon increase in the atmosphere to prevent global warming, but they neglect the amount of carbon used in mining and manufacturing. There is a great petroleum expense in producing the fuel. factories for making the atomic energy, so it's very polluting in the carbon sense, as well as the much worse pollution from the mining debris and the waste disposal problems, besides the leaks from the installations themselves.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat critiques the nuclear industry, emphasizing the inherent dangers of mining, disposal, and the environmental costs associated with nuclear energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, one of the things that bothers me is that the background radiation is always going up, and they're allowed to adjust the standard by which they set their emissions to that background radiation, and it's going up because of their own emissions. So there's a little bit of a... escalating loop that's going on whereby all everybody around nuclear plants and all of us are getting more radiation as time goes on.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses concern about the escalating background radiation levels and the industry's practice of adjusting emission standards accordingly.

**RAY PEAT:** The type of radiation is crucial in its biological effects. The industry has the tricks of comparing living in Denver or flying in an airplane with breathing....fall out from the nuclear industry and it's completely ignoring the well-established fact that the gamma rays that they're counting in Denver or an airplane have a low energy transfer to the tissues. They go through so fast they don't react. And at lower altitudes, they... talk about less radiation exposure, but actually at sea level, you're getting tertiary and secondary cosmic rays, which have more energy delivery in a toxic way to your tissues. So actually Denver has less biologically effective radiation than sea level. And another trick they use to......make it seem like radiation isn't necessarily harmful is to show an alpha emitter and a detector and then put a sheet of typing paper in the path and showing that it stops the alpha particles from passing through. But if you inhale an alpha emitter... When that particle goes, it's going to hit a cell, not a sheet of typing paper. And the fact that it will stop in a sheet of paper means that it has 100% delivery of its energy to the tissue. And it's the delivery of energy that causes the tissue damage, not exclusively. When gamma rays pass through you, they give up a little of their energy in a scattering manner. So they have a very low linear transfer of energy, but they still do damage by a partial giving up of their energy. The low velocity is what really harms you and so if you have a inhale a particulate that's radioactive even though it might not be that much radiation, it's the fact that you're just getting all of it in one place that makes it so serious.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat deconstructs industry tactics for downplaying radiation risks, explaining the difference in biological impact between various radiation types and the significance of localized energy delivery.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the beta radiation from iodine and strontium and cesium basically all of it is going to be absorbed on a particle. decomposes in your tissues. It's not as locally intense as alpha particles, but it's much more effective at tissue delivery than x-rays or gamma rays just passing through your body.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat further clarifies the tissue-damaging potential of beta radiation compared to alpha, x-rays, and gamma rays.

**RAY PEAT:** Alpha particles are actually an atomic nucleus, and so it's a big fat particle that stops easily when it runs into cell material. A beta particle is an electron which is much more able to pass through cells without being absorbed. But it still is a particle of matter or of electricity. X-rays and gamma rays are photons, so they're analogous to light. And the certain frequencies will resonate more with the living substance so that x-rays have......a fairly intense interaction with living material compared to gamma rays. But still, they can be equated, the amount of energy delivered to the tissue. So linear energy transfer, LAT, is how you compare the different types of radiation.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides a concise explanation of alpha particles, beta particles, x-rays, and gamma rays, defining linear energy transfer (LET) as a comparative measure.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, um, yeah, the, um, the thyroid. It's damaged by all of them, but if the cloud is very fresh, close to the factory, iodine has a half-life of eight days, so it takes three months to disappear, so if it's your thyroid you're worried about, and if the cloud taken a long time to get to you... then it could be that the x-ray to your head and neck would be the worst, but usually the fact that you breathe in or eat the particles is going to mean that the fallout is worse, considerably worse than just having a dental x-ray.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat compares the potential damage from fallout to medical x-rays, emphasizing the greater risk posed by inhaled or ingested radioactive particles.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the dental x-rays tend to cause cancer of the eyeball, the brain, and the thyroid. But the estrogenic effect will cause a series of dental x-rays. To make a pregnant woman deliver a premature, underdeveloped, underweight baby just by the systemic estrogen effect. But it does cancerize the things that are closest to the exposure.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the specific cancers linked to dental x-rays and the systemic estrogenic effects that can impact fetal development.

**RAY PEAT:** The government's tendency has been to use whatever measure sounds the least threatening. Such as failing to make the distinction between the local dose and the total body dose. And they've done the same thing with interpreting the danger of the fallout from the atomic bombs in Japan, where the bomb smoke went in a sort of a triangular pathway downwind from the explosion. They drew a circle around the center of the explosion and averaged out the people at a certain distance in any direction and tended to make the people who were actually exposed to the fallout disappear by averaging them 360 degrees around the circle.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat criticizes governmental practices of obscuring radiation risks by averaging localized doses and downplaying the impact of fallout.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, eating seaweed, kelp, and if you have a bottle of iodine you can paint them on your fingers and toes and soak up some of it through your skin. And all of this shouldn't be done until the cloud is actually here because excess iodine is toxic to your thyroid in itself. But if there's an intense cloud passing over then these external sources of iodine will protect your thyroid but they won't protect the other tissues. So, keeping your thyroid function. Up is the ideal way to do it.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat summarizes practical mitigation strategies, emphasizing the timely use of iodine sources and the primary importance of maintaining optimal thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, sugar, coconut oil and, when possible, a thyroid supplement.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reiterates the key elements for supporting thyroid function: sugar, coconut oil, and thyroid supplements.
