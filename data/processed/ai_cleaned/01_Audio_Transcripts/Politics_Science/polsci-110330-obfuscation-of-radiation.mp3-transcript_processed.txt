**RAY PEAT:** The TSA instruments that irradiate people had got my interest up again in radiation and then I saw that there were people selling radioactive rocks as therapeutic things for example to wear around your neck to cure breast cancer and so on and I saw that since his history for 50 years has been serving the nuclear industry to tell people that radiation is good for you rather than harmful I realized that the with Obama and his nuclear industry support that T.D. Lucky and the Radioactive Rocks were just part of a new wave of promotion of radiation security ideas.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his renewed interest in radiation and the context of his recent newsletter.

**RAY PEAT:** He was a spokesman for the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories? Oh, I heard about his talks when I was talking about Ernest Sternglass and his low-level radiation book, for example. I talked to people who worked in the nuclear industry and they said, oh, that's rubbish. No one should read that stuff. It's all phony. And I found out that they had been given weekly seminars at the nuclear factory to debunk people like Goffman, Pauling and Sternglass. And T.D. Lucky was one of the regulars at those industry seminars to implicate the workers. That those people were such lunatics and phonies that no respectable person should even look at their publications. And I looked up some of the references that T.D. Lucky cites, and one of them was published in a right-wing crazy medical journal. I don't know. Others are published in nuclear-supported radiation protection journals basically giving the nuclear industry position and nothing from the real biologists.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses T.D. Lucky's role in promoting the nuclear industry's narrative and how industry professionals were trained to discredit scientists like Goffman, Pauling, and Sternglass.

**RAY PEAT:** If you just read the references cited by T.D. Lucky or any of these people who are propagandizing against Pauling and Goffman and Sternglass, and then if you read Sternglass's books, for example, you can judge for yourself. Sternglass...pride some information out of the agencies, although much of it was just completely destroyed and not made available. But the information that he got was very public, very simple factual population information, mortality figures and so on. Everything public and... very sound and absolutely in a different world from the political fantasies that the lucky people cite.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises on how to discern accurate data by comparing the references cited by industry proponents with the work of scientists like Sternglass.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 50s, Linus Pauling was talking about the genetic effects of... Even one alpha-emitting atom ingested into the body, he was saying that alpha particle delivers all of its energy to a very small area. So if it hits the nucleus, it'll either kill the nucleus or mutate it. And he said that every mutation......ultimately can be considered as a fatality even if it comes a hundred generations later. Because it's not introducing anything of value but simply destroying some information. But he was emphasizing the mutation damage done by any radioactive isotope, natural or artificial. And so the... He said that any addition made to the background radiation by the isotopes is going to cause cancer. But the terrible thing is that the fallout from nuclear reactors and atomic bombs gets into the atmosphere as particles, which when ingested will eventually, if they stay in the body, they'll eventually emit. A particle which will either kill a cell or probably cause a mutation and so he was already making that point between the absolute difference between radiation that you get while walking past a granite table or a granite bank or something. That passes through. Delivers very little energy but any single alpha emitting isotope that you swallow is going to deliver all of its energy as that alpha particle is absorbed by the cells. So it's like an absolute difference not just that the idea of the sievert or the rama was... They spoke of the renton or the energy of the radiation coming out of a source, the rad as the absorbed dose of radiation, and the ram or the equivalent in a person. And the sievert is the new unit referring to that. Effective dose but that effective dose unfortunately is part of the obscuring the actual dangers because they define effectiveness as a killing or a mutation. Again that's exactly what Linus Pauling was talking about in which any single isotope particle would be enough to cause cancer. But the people who are defending the industry are using this Sievert unit or the radiation effectiveness biologically against the Pauling-Gothman. Sternglass people, because effectiveness they are defining only in terms of mutation or killing. And so their journals are full of showing how harmless particular types of radiation are. If you don't kill the cell instantly and don't mutate it so that you can find a broken......chromosome or a piece of a changed DNA right after the exposure, then you have done no harm. And that's where the situation is totally being falsified by the industry people.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains Linus Pauling's early concerns about the genetic effects of radiation, emphasizing the localized damage from alpha-emitting isotopes and the industry's manipulation of radiation units like the Sievert to downplay harm.

**RAY PEAT:** Sternglass showed that some mechanism must be causing this much higher sensitivity than simply mutating or killing cells. In the industry people pretty much. Have to accept that the women who were exposed while pregnant to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, their children had smaller brains and were mentally retarded in proportion to the amount of radiation they got. But just recently, a study in Seattle of women getting dental x-rays, they would shield their whole body, but if they got a whole set of dental x-rays, the pregnant women delivered underweight babies from the... The general physiological effect, something happened when their head was irradiated by the dentist that was transmitted to their whole body that made the pregnancy less successful. So the stern class effects are supported by this kind of study that shows that... Irradiation of any part of the body will affect the success of the pregnancy and when the baby is born underweight the brain is also underweight, sometimes worse than the general underweight of the body.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights how Sternglass's findings on radiation's broader effects beyond mutation and cell death are supported by studies showing that even localized irradiation, like dental X-rays, can negatively impact pregnancy outcomes.

**RAY PEAT:** The exposed people had worse health and a higher rate of death from all causes. Infectious diseases, heart disease, cancer, everything reduced the population faster. But the healthiest of them, who survived a long time, still were radically injured. And this, the fact that it can linger through a person's long life span, studies have been done many times in animals and a few times in humans, showing that, for example, radiation to a man's head will be associated with birth defects. In his offspring, something is transmitted through his body the same way it is through a woman's body, affects his sperm, destabilizes them genetically, so that the resulting offspring is genetically disrupted. And animal studies show that that sort of effect can go on generation after generation. Often getting worse each generation. Once the disorganization of the genome begins, it can ultimately lead to the complete ending of the line. But sometimes it doesn't happen for several generations.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that even survivors of radiation exposure experience long-term health detriments and that radiation can cause transgenerational genetic damage, affecting sperm and leading to birth defects in offspring.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the tricks the government used was to draw a circle around the bomb and then take people who were within a given radius of the bomb explosion and analyze their health. The bomb explosion produced a cloud. that went off in a triangular path according to the movement of the wind and the air and so the inclusion of everyone within a radius 360 degrees around was just a very obvious trick to dilute the actual effect of the people who got the fallout in a concentrated form.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat criticizes the methodology of early government studies on atomic bomb effects, specifically how drawing circular radii around the blast diluted the impact of concentrated fallout exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** John Goffman was saying Linus Pauling was a neurotic and a quack. And I was saying that John Goffman is either insane or a liar, or a bit stupid, and 20 years later he suddenly had an insight and said that was the stupidest thing he could have ever done, but he was doing it regularly as his profession for the government to campaign against Linus Pauling and the government. anti-bomb people. Yeah, he was one of the main spokesmen for the Atomic Energy Agency, wasn't he? Yeah, and his old stupid arguments are still, you can still find them anywhere on the internet and in the professional journals of radiation protection. The industry is never going to give up as long as......as they're subsidized and supported by the government.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recounts his past disagreements with John Goffman, who initially worked for the government to discredit Linus Pauling, and notes that Goffman's arguments, though later regretted, are still prevalent in industry propaganda.

**RAY PEAT:** He said... he was in the middle of a talk and said, this is a crazy thing to be saying, until we know that we're destroying... all future generations of humanity, we should go on testing until we're sure. And he later said that he and hundreds of other people in similar positions should be or could be tried for war crimes. It was in that letter by Chris Busby, Professor Chris Busby, who just wrote a reply. If you search his name, you'll probably find his article on the internet. Just wrote a reply to the atomic industry experts who are denying that there's any danger from the Fukushima plant. And he's quoted Goffman as saying that the nuclear industry is waging war on humanity. That's quite a turnaround.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares John Goffman's later admission that nuclear testing was dangerous and his statement that the nuclear industry wages war on humanity, as cited by Professor Chris Busby.

**RAY PEAT:** It's true that there's a certain kind of radiation. It's more intense, but the cosmic rays that they're talking about are relatively harmless compared to if you are at sea level where you get fewer of the primary cosmic rays, you get secondary and tertiary cosmic rays that deliver their energy into your body at a much higher rate. So, the... One of the most popular arguments of the industry is that anyone who flies or lives in the mountains has nothing to complain about getting some isotopes from the industry. But it's a total, total deception and it's sort of sad that Goffman and Pauling never......never investigated the issue enough to be able to knock that one down too.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat debunks the industry's claim that high-altitude radiation exposure is worse than fallout, explaining that while primary cosmic rays are more intense at altitude, secondary and tertiary rays at sea level deliver energy at a higher rate.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the idea of linear energy transfer is the essential thing. And the higher the velocity of a particle, the less likely it is to stop. In your tissue, and if you look at a track of a particle going through a target or a piece of tissue, when you find one that is losing enough energy that it's coming to rest, the track where it enters the tissue is only a pale gray, showing not much....interaction with the substance, and as it slows down, it's like the point of a pencil. The chemical reactions become saturating and black, exposing the film or whatever it's stopping in. The ionization becomes extremely intense at the very last... micron or two of movement of the particle through the tissue it delivers all of its remaining energy right in that cell but if it passes through you at a high velocity very little radiation is lost and the type of radiation that we're exposed to when the cosmic ray primary goes through us it's the decelerating type of radiation where the particle is weakly deflected by passing through near the atoms in our body but the energy delivered is very small per unit of tissue and experiments have been done showing that they're... Secondary and tertiary particles mostly are ending right near the surface of the Earth and so those are the ones which are doing most of the biological damage from cosmic rays so it's, as far as the cosmic rays are concerned, it's worse to live at sea level but the industry argues the reverse that... High altitude is where you're getting the worst radiation, so they're turning the evidence exactly upside down to support their interests.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the concept of linear energy transfer (LET) to differentiate between high-velocity particles that pass through tissue with minimal energy loss and slow-moving particles that deposit all their energy in a small area, causing significant damage. He clarifies that while cosmic rays are more intense at higher altitudes, the secondary and tertiary particles at sea level are more damaging due to their lower velocity and higher LET.

**RAY PEAT:** They do the same thing with the idea of radon gas. They say people who are exposed to radon in their homes have less lung cancer than people who aren't exposed, therefore... Radiation is good for you, but the lung is the place that's least exposed to radon. It dissolves in fat tissue, and the brain being mostly fat is where your subcutaneous fat and brain get most of the radon exposure. And, in fact, the figures show that dementia... corresponds very closely to radon exposure. So you're saying the radon actually ends up in your brain if you're exposed to it, and over time that might cause Alzheimer's or dementia? Yeah, but the industry says since you breathe it, you would expect lung cancer, but no, you wouldn't expect it because it goes through your lung in a fraction of a second.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat critiques the industry's use of radon gas statistics, pointing out that while they claim radon exposure reduces lung cancer, radon actually accumulates in fat tissue, including the brain, and is linked to dementia.

**RAY PEAT:** Putting about a half an inch of lead as a roof over animals will cause them to miscarry or become sterile or develop cancer and other diseases at a very high rate. And that's because of the slowing effect......of the lead on cosmic rays increasing the probability of them coming to rest in your cells. So a slow cosmic ray is somewhat equivalent possibly to inhaling one of the lower, less harmful emitters, but once you inhale it and it lodges in a certain part of your tissue, all that energy is delivered right to one part of your tissue. Yeah, yeah, it's the coming to rest in your tissue that delivers the deadly energy, and besides that killing, mutating energy, the decelerating energy that's less harmful immediately, it still can have a long range....effects by giving misleading signals to the developing cell interactive systems.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat uses the example of lead shielding to illustrate how slowing down cosmic rays increases their biological damage by increasing the probability of them coming to rest within cells, similar to inhaled radioactive isotopes.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the basic tricks behind this idea that radiation is only dangerous if it kills or mutates is the research done with bacteria. And they extrapolate from bacteria to human beings and to do that successfully they just have to leave out the later lifetime effects of the radiation on that individual and then the subsequent generations effects.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that studies on bacteria are used to downplay radiation's dangers by ignoring long-term and transgenerational effects in humans.

**RAY PEAT:** Carmel Mothersill and her collaborators have demonstrated the bystander effect, what it is that's transmitted through the body fluids. When a man's head is irradiated or a woman's head and the baby is affected, she and her group have shown that you can irradiate cells enough to cause death and mutations and so on in a culture dish and then you can take the fluid from those cells and add it to fresh cells and you get those cells behave just as if they had been irradiated too, analogous to the effect of the serum from the Chernobyl workers causing chromosome breaks in cells from healthy people. So there's some sort of instability that's set up.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the bystander effect, where irradiated cells can transmit genomic instability to healthy cells through body fluids, citing research by Carmel Mothersill and the findings from Chernobyl workers' serum.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the transmitters that they have identified, there are probably a lot of things that cells emit when they're... stressed, one that they've tested is simply serotonin, and they found that serotonin level of 25 nanograms per milliliter produced by the radiation damaged cells was enough to transmit genomic instability to new cells. And that's without any extra radiation added. That's just the cell. Yeah, that's just the indirect effect transmitted through the fluids. And if they irradiated fish in water and then put new fish in the water, they suffered similar effects transmitted from the secretions into the water of the injured fish, causing similar injury in the... unexposed fish.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies serotonin as one of the substances transmitted through body fluids that can cause genomic instability in cells, and notes similar effects observed in fish exposed to irradiated water.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1960s already, they found that, in fact, I incorporated some of those ideas into my thesis work. They showed that, first, they would irradiate an animal's head and showed that it affected the pregnancy later. But then they found that irradiating any part of the animal had the same estrogenic effect. And they used the term stressin as a name for the unidentified substance secreted by the insert tissue that would then transmit a genetic instability to the rest of the organism and the offspring. But the so-called stressins are now gradually being identified as the... cytokines and serotonin and other things that inter-cells produce.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares his early exposure to research on radiation's effects, including the concept of "stressins" (now identified as cytokines and serotonin) secreted by stressed tissues that transmit genetic instability.

**RAY PEAT:** The Western journals reviewing, I think it was 300 basically Western articles published in languages that Americans could read, have concluded that. 28 people died as a result of Chernobyl or maybe as many as 60 or 70 died from cleaning up Chernobyl. This group that wrote the book looked at, I think it was 5,000 studies and concluded that a million people were killed. Yeah, and it's not over yet because that pollution is on the ground. That's the sort of difference that I've always seen that has led me to read foreign science by preference to American.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat contrasts the low death tolls reported in Western scientific literature for Chernobyl with the much higher estimates from a comprehensive Russian study, highlighting a discrepancy that leads him to prefer foreign scientific research.

**RAY PEAT:** I started running into it. I think I mentioned previously the book by Carl Lindegren called Cold War in Biology. He documented the firings of college professors and even high school teachers who questioned the neo-Darwin approach to biology and uh... uh... so I was aware that you couldn't trust American genetics and biology professors uh... since that uh... academic cleansing process had been done in the late nineteen forties.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat references Carl Lindegren's "Cold War in Biology" to illustrate how dissenting voices in American biology, particularly regarding genetics, were suppressed after the 1940s.

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of having a a consensus of of scientists and of peer-reviewed journals and so on I see it as exactly the same as people who form their political views by taking a consensus of what the network newscasters are saying uh... that's really how it works it does form the political opinions of most americans to watch the news and listen to the network radios today.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat equates the reliance on scientific consensus and peer-reviewed journals to forming political opinions based on mainstream media, suggesting both can be forms of groupthink.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the UN is uh... really primarily uh... the uh... instrument of the imperialist countries and uh... the nuclear industry wouldn't exist without the uh... political support of the of the states which represent corporate interests and uh... the uh... the whole system works together the uh... public is is taxed to uh... finance the nuclear industry and uh... the state and the corporations support the universities and the broadcast media and uh... so science has to uh... the same way as the uh... who gets invaded it isn't a matter of who is uh... doing something objectively it's who is hurting whose interest and uh... the helen caldicott is uh... threatening to hurt the interests of the nuclear industry and so the the whole system has to exclude people like that.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat asserts that the UN serves the interests of imperialist countries and that the nuclear industry relies on state and corporate support, influencing universities and media, and leading to the exclusion of dissenting voices like Helen Caldicott.

**RAY PEAT:** Linus Pauling had his uh... passport revoked for taking stands against uh... the development of nuclear weapons and above above-ground testing. And professors uh... even when i was in uh... graduate school in biology uh... when he uh... had his passport report uh... the uh... faculty even at caltech basically shunning him that i think motivated him to to leave there under pressure and uh... as recently as nineteen seventy in the academic world he was considered a quack and sort of an outcast just because of his radiation peace position.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recounts how Linus Pauling faced professional ostracism and had his passport revoked for his anti-nuclear activism, even being labeled a "quack" in academic circles.

**RAY PEAT:** Chris Busby's article mentioned his research. Showing that just a small increase above background radiation was enough to cause something like a 20 to 90 percent increase in leukemia if it was prenatal exposure. And when people say it's, oh, it's only 50 percent added to background radiation as if... that's nothing. An alternative point of view would be, well, let's see your evidence that background radiation is so safe, can you prove that it isn't killing 100 million people every year? Sure. Because everyone is exposed to it and it's known that that kind of radiation......causes all kinds of disease including infectious disease susceptibility, heart disease, brain disease and so on.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat emphasizes Chris Busby's research showing that even small increases in background radiation can significantly increase leukemia rates in prenatal exposure, questioning the safety of background radiation and its potential to cause widespread disease.

**RAY PEAT:** The people selling mammograms and other x-ray treatments or tests use that sort of comparison to background. When you take your focus away from what they're... specifically talking about, some Swedes did a big study about ten years ago on the population who had been given mammograms. They had noticed that the cancer mortality didn't decrease in Sweden, although most of the women were getting mammograms. And so they compared... the ones who had had them and the ones who hadn't, and they saw that maybe there was one fewer cases of death from breast cancer, but for every six increased deaths from something else, heart disease, for example, and Goffman showed that all kinds of medical x-rays to the chest increase heart disease as well as breast cancer, but when you limit the thing that you're focusing on and forget total mortality, then you can, with a little jiggling of the figures, you can get a slight decrease in a certain kind of mortality, but basically... Any exposure to ionizing radiation is going to increase your chances of having a bad outcome, even if it's years and years later.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat critiques the use of background radiation as a benchmark for safety, citing a Swedish study on mammograms that showed increased deaths from other causes (like heart disease) for every decrease in breast cancer deaths, and reiterates that any ionizing radiation exposure increases the risk of adverse outcomes.

**RAY PEAT:** A very intense cloud comes by with a lot of radioactive iodine. The thyroid is the first thing that's able to be protected by eating iodine-rich foods or taking enough thyroid to suppress your thyroid-stimulating hormones so the gland becomes inactive. A spoonful of powdered kelp or other seaweed will......pretty well saturate your body so you don't take up the radioactive iodine and some of the things being recommended neglect the fact that the iodine is only going to protect your thyroid, but if you take too much iodine and suppress the function of your thyroid gland, you're going to slow all of your metabolic processes including the DNA....repair enzymes. So keeping your metabolic rate high by avoiding the toxic foods is very important for your general long-range resistance to radiation. The iodine danger is passed in about six weeks after the accident, so the long-range things such as cesium and strontium you want to Help to wash those out of your body after they've been taken in, and eating a calcium-rich diet and a potassium-rich diet will increase the turnover of these in your tissues, while a thyroid-supporting diet, low in the polyunsaturated fats, will increase the repair processes and prevent... to some extent those long-range bystander effects that can increase for years after the exposure.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises on protecting the thyroid from radioactive iodine by consuming iodine-rich foods like kelp, but cautions against excessive iodine intake which can suppress thyroid function and slow metabolism. He also recommends a thyroid-supporting diet low in polyunsaturated fats to enhance DNA repair and mitigate long-term radiation effects, and suggests calcium and potassium-rich diets to help eliminate cesium and strontium from the body.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, during...for example, if you're near a flash of radiation, if you have a CAT scan or some kind of very intense radiation, those effects will linger as excited. molecules in your tissue for hours so if in the first hour after you get a flash exposure of intense radiation you get lots of sunlight or in the absence of sunlight you want bright incandescent light that's rich in the red spectrum it's the red frequency that deactivates those excited electrons in molecules following intense radiation.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that exposure to bright sunlight or incandescent light rich in the red spectrum can help deactivate excited molecules in tissues that linger after intense radiation exposure, such as from a CAT scan.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, but I, 40, 50 years ago, looked at the figures for the amount of radiation in milk and in vegetables. And the government was telling people to avoid milk that the cows had just absorbed the strontium into. And I saw that if you ate... vegetables for your nutrients, you would be getting several times more strontium than you would from the milk, because the cow has concentrated calcium, where the plants tend to receive a high proportion of strontium from the fresh fallout. So the cow is a good filter even during the fallout storm.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares his past observations that vegetables can contain more strontium than milk during fallout events, suggesting cows act as a filter by concentrating calcium and excreting strontium.
