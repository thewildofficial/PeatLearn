**RAY PEAT:** I think what I would do first is stop breathing. But up to a certain point it stimulates breathing so it's probably somewhat of an antidote to things like morphine because progesterone, as long as it's within something like several hundred milligrams at a time or per day, it's like an imitation of pregnancy work. It stimulates breathing, but up in the pharmacological range of something like three or four thousand milligrams all at once, then instead of being a stimulant to respiration, it just puts everything to sleep. And I think that would include the respiratory system at some very high level.
**CONTEXT:** What is the danger of being over-anesthetized by progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** In Mexico, some students were experimenting with the idea that maybe progesterone works like morphine because of those sedative effects. And so they combined naloxone, the anti-morphine drug, with progesterone and their experimental rat died. It was okay on a given amount of either of them, but that pretty much said that progesterone isn't acting like morphine because the anti-morphine chemical seemed to exaggerate the anesthetic effect of progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the potential danger of progesterone, what was the outcome of an experiment combining progesterone with naloxone, an anti-morphine drug?

**RAY PEAT:** No one really has done that. My student's rat was the only death that I know of, even experimentally. In the 1940s, Hans Elje had told his technicians to experiment with very big doses of progesterone, and after doing some experiments, they said those high doses had killed the rats, and he didn't believe it. But he said, what did you do? And they went to the garbage and fished them out. He published photographs holding them by the skin on their back. They looked sort of like a wet dish, right? Just the most relaxed rat you ever saw. But they weren't dead. They were just deeply sleepy. But his technicians had thought they had died. So I'm not even sure that my students were not mistaken about the naloxone and progesterone combination that they thought the rat had died.
**CONTEXT:** What is the range of dosage for potentially fatal overdoses of progesterone, referencing historical experiments?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it wasn't consistent, but when the men had very distinct symptoms following the vasectomies, they studied what was going on and found that the ones who had the symptoms had very low to almost zero progesterone. And they recovered when they gave them progesterone. It's a biological analog to what's reasonable in the female. If the female has an infection in the uterus or tubes, for example, it's biologically reasonable to turn off progesterone production so that pregnancy can't happen. And so irritation in the uterus or tube in the female causes sterility by turning off progesterone and increasing estrogen. And I think the event in the man who had the bad reaction to vasectomy, I think it was a biological equivalent of a signal traveling up the ducts to the probably to the testicle, maybe to the pituitary, turning off the steroid production.
**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism behind vasectomies potentially lowering progesterone in men?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I've seen several men, I don't remember whether they had vasectomies or not, but they were suffering from impotency. It just immediately was resolved by taking just very small doses a couple of times of progesterone. It's sort of like priming the pump. Progesterone has a positive feedback, apparently in men as well as in women. People have experimented with slices of either ovary tissue or adrenal tissue, which makes some progesterone. They found in both cases that if you add a little bit of progesterone, it increases the organs production of progesterone, positive feedback, which is unusual in hormone regulation. And that indicates to me that the body doesn't see it as something you can get too much of.
**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of small doses of progesterone on impotency in men, and what does this suggest about progesterone's feedback mechanisms?

**RAY PEAT:** If a person is having some biological problem where their progesterone drops off and they start bleeding during the pregnancy, there have been studies for women who habitually either miscarried or had monthly bleeding every month of the pregnancy and then delivered at five or six months, maybe seven months. They would give early in the pregnancy one shot of progesterone and I think it was two thirds of the women maintained full increasing production every week higher than the preceding week. Until they had a normal nine month delivery. Another, I think it was about 30%, required the second injection several weeks later after the first one and they too went back to the full production. I forget the percentages exactly. There was a small group which didn't recover so completely.
**CONTEXT:** What is the success rate of progesterone injections in preventing miscarriage and maintaining pregnancy in women with a history of bleeding or miscarriage?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but very few of the clinics that specialize in that really understand if they would read more animal research. They would understand people better, but there's really a medical bias against endocrine science based on animals.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of progesterone in modern fertility therapies, and why is there a medical bias against endocrine science based on animals?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think the marketing thing has done it. For 40 or 50 years, the estrogen industry said don't pay any attention to the fact that estrogen causes clotting, heart attacks, cancer, brain damage, and so on. That's just in animals, but it has just the opposite effect in humans.
**CONTEXT:** Why is there a medical bias against endocrine science based on animals, particularly concerning estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** They found that there was no evidence that they could demonstrate bone improvement with estrogen in people. So they looked around at different animals, tried it on beagle dogs, found that it caused more osteoporosis in dogs, and so they forgot about that, looked around, found that in rodents it could seem to be causing increased bone strength, but it happens that in rodents even cortisol can increase bone strength. There are some situations like a prolactin in rats will increase progesterone, where in humans it generally decreases it. And if you look at the interactions, it's really all the same principles that apply in people, but for example rodents are generally nocturnal animals and we aren't. And so you have to take into account what time of day you give the injections because you're either intensifying or weakening their normal rhythms. And by using animals with an upside down rhythm compared to humans, you can sometimes get very nice upside down results.
**CONTEXT:** How do pharmaceutical companies manipulate animal experiments to support their products, using the example of estrogen and bone health?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they like rat experiments when they can be arranged to sell a product. You don't want to forget completely about the dog experiments which cause only bad effects.
**CONTEXT:** Why do pharmaceutical companies favor rat experiments when they can be arranged to sell a product, and what about dog experiments?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but... Right at the same time that the impotency experiment saw that in men, some other group within just a month or two of that publication saw exactly that effect in the result of the tubal ligation. And that really helped to explain how IUDs work. And animal experiments had been demonstrating that for years. That if you want to have the animal become infertile, you just put a little suture in the uterus. That's usually all it takes. And the signal travels up from the slightly injured uterus to turn off the ovary progesterone production. And so injuring the tubes does the same thing. Not always, but often.
**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of tubal ligation on estrogen or progesterone production, and how does this relate to the mechanism of IUDs?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I guess I was teaching endocrinology at the Naturopath School, but I was doing mostly nutritional counseling at home, and I found that it was more and more involved hormone interactions with the foods, and so I just when I saw these two or three women with such absolute recoveries from just small amounts of progesterone I realized that I would be basically injuring people that I talked to if I didn't give them the true information that I knew about in animals and was starting to see in humans. And so I just mentioned what I thought was the case. And over a period of I guess two or three years in Eugene I had spoken to enough women about the effects of thyroid and progesterone and their symptoms that the local gynecologists turned 180 degrees in their practice just because there were so many dozens of their patients saying that they wouldn't take estrogen and insisted on getting a prescription for progesterone or thyroid. It just took a couple of years and doctors saw that their business was being affected and so they totally reversed their practices and that went on until those doctors retired and then I think the pressure from the industry and profession probably reverted the situation.
**CONTEXT:** What led you to start recommending progesterone use to your nutritional patients, and what was the impact on local gynecologists' practices?

**RAY PEAT:** No, very, very closed minded. I had a terrible experience with the first dozen or so women who went to them. Just awful personal attacks. The doctors at first would tell the patients not to come back because they had personality defects that they wouldn't accept there. Like I said, very open-minded.
**CONTEXT:** What was the initial reaction of local gynecologists to patients requesting progesterone and thyroid, and how did they treat these patients?

**RAY PEAT:** Barbara Seaman was my contemporary in studying estrogen and progesterone and she wrote a lot of good stuff, women and the crisis in sex hormones I think was one of the titles. She was very good just by knowing a thousand times more when she got the opportunity to debate someone from Yale Medical School, for example. They ended up looking like complete ignoramuses, which they were. She was very influential against estrogen for progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** Who was Barbara Seaman, and what was her contribution to the understanding of estrogen and progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Well Barbara Seaman went over advertising and the public relations very thoroughly and I guess Karla Rothenberg did more on the public relations side of things. The actual conspiracy aspect but on the public misinformation, Barbara Seaman was very good. And at one point she mentioned that Hitler had tested estrogen on people in the prison camps as a way to make them meek and submissive. And she thought that that was probably, if you put it in context with an advertisement, like the one you read, makes a more obedient, servile wife. He's less irritating to the Lord and Master.
**CONTEXT:** What was Barbara Seaman's contribution to exposing public misinformation regarding hormone replacement therapy, and what historical example did she cite?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the woman I mentioned who I talked to and who lectured in my class who had had MS and optic neuritis, she was using exclusively injectable progesterone, and so she was getting really big amounts of benzyl alcohol, which is nerve toxic, and it happens, Hans Selye called it the catatoxic effect of progesterone and pregnenolone, that it helps the body destroy toxins and eliminate them, and even injecting vegetable oil and a toxic solvent, progesterone's anti-toxic effect is so great that people were just tremendously benefiting from these injections of progesterone. But sometimes, if a doctor didn't like those toxins in the injectable form, there was also a micronized solution in water. But if they would inject that, where in the hip, for example, where there was supposed to be a good fat pad, sometimes the particle would cause irritation that would cause destruction of the fat cells, and they would have a dent wherever they got an injection. And because of the known toxic effects of the oily version and the irritating effect of the so-called water-wettable solutions and those weren't really just progesterone. There was a molecule, a carbohydrate-like molecule attached to the progesterone particle making it wettable. And those particles are toxic. So that was probably what was making the particle destroy the fat cells.
**CONTEXT:** What were the issues with injectable progesterone formulations, including the toxicity of benzyl alcohol and the irritating effects of water-wettable solutions?

**RAY PEAT:** But anyway, knowing about the problems with injection, and the medical indoctrination that stomach acid destroys progesterone even though the manufacturer involves boiling the steroid in acid so your stomach couldn't make it bend in the activity of progesterone. Anyway, as an alternative, I decided since I had noticed that I could taste progesterone just sticking my hand in the powder, I decided that if I could get doctors to use it on the skin, that would let them have the opportunity to see what it really does. Easy to give to the patient and a patient wouldn't have to go in and pay for an injection every week and so on at the end. The first experiments for several months, I would heat it in olive oil and get a good high concentration and then the olive oil would, in less than an hour, it would bring their blood levels up to a perfectly normal amount. And I was thinking about the old research, for example in Italy, in explaining why vitamin E would protect against the sterility producing effects and other toxic effects of estrogen, they explained vitamin E's action as being the progesterone sparer, somehow activating progesterone in the system. And so I was thinking about those old studies to explain vitamin E's anti-estrogen effects and made me think about what vitamin E is doing in the mitochondrion where progesterone is produced and has its effects and I realized that for them to both act in and be produced in the mitochondrion they have to be compatible in solubility and so I dropped some progesterone powder in vitamin E and saw that I could get a 50-50 solution with a very pure form of vitamin E. They were just absolutely inter-soluble. It was a compact, stable way to get doctors to start using the transdermal progesterone. I had told them about the effect in olive oil, but no one wanted to have to heat the solution up every time they applied it. You could get a stable 5%, 10%, or 20% solution that would help. It would be convenient to rub into the skin but you only absorb maybe 10% or 20% at best when you rub it into the skin and so after doctors were willing to prescribe it for their patients using it on the skin then I pointed out to them that they could take it orally and save about 80% of the cost at least.
**CONTEXT:** What was the rationale behind developing a transdermal progesterone formulation, and how did vitamin E play a role in its development?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you don't have to get it hot, just warming it so that it's thin enough to stir it. Just stirring it at room temperature will do it.
**CONTEXT:** How is progesterone dissolved in vitamin E for topical application?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, crystals or micro crystals. A lot of it is still sold with the carbohydrate wetting agent attached, and they don't even list that as an ingredient, but it's a potential toxin.
**CONTEXT:** In what form is progesterone typically sold, and what is a potential concern with some formulations?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it binds to the skin. The cells collapse as they mature and prepare to shed. And keratin fibers, a protein that makes up part of the structure of the cell, these are cross-linked and become sort of a semi-tanned. hardened barrier to water, but they bind oil so that the oils in your skin link to these cross-linked keratin proteins and make like a raincoat effect closing off the surface to the water, but those also bind progesterone very strongly and so the progesterone will saturate those. And some of it passes on and gets into your deeper tissues from which it can be gradually absorbed into the bloodstream. But a good part of it sticks on these superficial barrier cells and then those are shed.
**CONTEXT:** Why is only about 10% to 20% of progesterone absorbed through the skin when applied topically?

**RAY PEAT:** It's more economical just to take it orally because when it's dissolved in oil, when you eat a lot of fat in your diet, your bile emulsifies it so it breaks down into very small particles about the size of a bacterium, the chylomicrons that will pass through intestinal cells into the lymphatic ducts that are called lacteals because the absorbed fat particles give it a milky look. And from there it goes right into the bloodstream as little fat globules that circulate. They're much smaller than red blood cells and they circulate and reach all the tissues directly. As fat particles, but also the liver will eventually metabolize them and help to distribute whatever was in the fat. Since the progesterone and vitamin E are fat soluble, they get divided up as you're digesting your other fats. If you eat powdered progesterone, the cells of your intestine have the same enzymes that the liver has for adding sugar to hormone molecules and making them water soluble. Crystalline progesterone hits your intestine cells directly. A lot of it is processed just as it would be in the liver and the rest of it is sent from the intestine as a particle into the liver for further processing. So you lose a big part of your progesterone if you take it still in the crystalline form. But when it's in the fat globule. It bypasses the liver because it's taken up as these nutritional fat particles, chylomicrons.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference in absorption and distribution between orally ingested progesterone in oil versus crystalline progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, everywhere red blood cells go, these chytal microns will circulate a few times.
**CONTEXT:** When progesterone is taken orally in oil, how is it distributed throughout the body?

**RAY PEAT:** I was constantly submitting articles to medical and science journals and medical journals didn't want to have anything to do with it because they were doing business with the estrogen industry basically. Didn't want anything good about progesterone and since I couldn't get anything published about it I was just having to give talks up and down on the west coast to alternative medical groups and such. So I wanted to get the information out and figured that publishing it as a patent would be the only way I could get it on the record and openly distribute it.
**CONTEXT:** Why did you decide to patent your progesterone formulation, and what was the difficulty in getting information published in medical journals?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I wrote up the whole story and sent it in and I think it was the patent examiner talking to me. To me, through a lawyer, said you can't say anything about cancer if you want to get the patent issued and said that that's a standard rule that the only thing they really are concerned about the accuracy of is a cancer claim. I just deleted the things that I'd said about the things I had seen it do to cancer and so it went right through.
**CONTEXT:** What was the requirement from the patent examiner regarding claims about cancer when applying for the patent?

**RAY PEAT:** Um... I was mixing up some myself and selling it. John Lee, for example, was one of the first people who started buying my mixture. And I tried to get various people to manufacture it over the years. As long as I had the patent, I thought that I could make an arrangement for a drug company to use the patent. themselves as a basis for marketing it and that I could keep some control by whatever arrangement I made in licensing it so that they couldn't take it off the market by buying the patent. So I talked to all the big drug companies and they said, no thanks. And those drug companies then about a year or two later came on the market with crystalline progesterone mixed with oil. As they saw that there was increasing interest in progesterone, so they had to get on the market, but probably my having the patent on vitamin E as the solvent prevented them from messing with that even though it was economically effective. way to Have progesterone. They just they would mix it with things like peanut oil.
**CONTEXT:** After patenting the formulation, how did you attempt to make it available, and what was the response from drug companies?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah That's what I was going to ask. What oils did they use? So that sounds rather toxic And yeah, and it's not a very good solvent. It does dissolve some of it. So it's It's effective, but Not not extremely effective.
**CONTEXT:** What oils were used by drug companies to mix with progesterone, and what are the implications of these choices?

**RAY PEAT:** Um... I was mixing up some myself and selling it. John Lee, for example, was one of the first people who started buying my mixture.

**CONTEXT:** What were the issues with injectable progesterone formulations, including the toxicity of benzyl alcohol and the irritating effects of water-wettable solutions?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the woman I mentioned who I talked to and who lectured in my class who had had MS and optic neuritis, she was using exclusively injectable progesterone, and so she was getting really big amounts of benzyl alcohol, which is nerve toxic, and it happens, Hans Selye called it the catatoxic effect of progesterone and pregnenolone, that it helps the body destroy toxins and eliminate them, and even injecting vegetable oil and a toxic solvent, progesterone's anti-toxic effect is so great that people were just tremendously benefiting from these injections of progesterone. But sometimes, if a doctor didn't like those toxins in the injectable form, there was also a micronized solution in water. But if they would inject that, where in the hip, for example, where there was supposed to be a good fat pad, sometimes the particle would cause irritation that would cause destruction of the fat cells, and they would have a dent wherever they got an injection.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the woman I mentioned who I talked to and who lectured in my class who had had MS and optic neuritis, she was using exclusively injectable progesterone, and so she was getting really big amounts of benzyl alcohol, which is nerve toxic, and it happens, Hans Selye called it the catatoxic effect of progesterone and pregnenolone, that it helps the body destroy toxins and eliminate them, and even injecting vegetable oil and a toxic solvent, progesterone's anti-toxic effect is so great that people were just tremendously benefiting from these injections of progesterone. But sometimes, if a doctor didn't like those toxins in the injectable form, there was also a micronized solution in water. But if they would inject that, where in the hip, for example, where there was supposed to be a good fat pad, sometimes the particle would cause irritation that would cause destruction of the fat cells, and they would have a dent wherever they got an injection. And because of the known toxic effects of the oily version and the irritating effect of the so-called water-wettable solutions and those weren't really just progesterone. There was a molecule, a carbohydrate-like molecule attached to the progesterone particle making it wettable. And those particles are toxic. So that was probably what was making the particle destroy the fat cells.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the woman I mentioned who I talked to and who lectured in my class who had had MS and optic neuritis, she was using exclusively injectable progesterone, and so she was getting really big amounts of benzyl alcohol, which is nerve toxic, and it happens, Hans Selye called it the catatoxic effect of progesterone and pregnenolone, that it helps the body destroy toxins and eliminate them, and even injecting vegetable oil and a toxic solvent, progesterone's anti-toxic effect is so great that people were just tremendously benefiting from these injections of progesterone. But sometimes, if a doctor didn't like those toxins in the injectable form, there was also a micronized solution in water. But if they would inject that, where in the hip, for example, where there was supposed to be a good fat pad, sometimes the particle would cause irritation that would cause destruction of the fat cells, and they would have a dent wherever they got an injection. And because of the known toxic effects of the oily version and the irritating effect of the so-called water-wettable solutions and those weren't really just progesterone. There was a molecule, a carbohydrate-like molecule attached to the progesterone particle making it wettable. And those particles are toxic. So that was probably what was making the particle destroy the fat cells.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the woman I mentioned who I talked to and who lectured in my class who had had MS and optic neuritis, she was using exclusively injectable progesterone, and so she was getting really big amounts of benzyl alcohol, which is nerve toxic, and it happens, Hans Selye called it the catatoxic effect of progesterone and pregnenolone, that it helps the body destroy toxins and eliminate them, and even injecting vegetable oil and a toxic solvent, progesterone's anti-toxic effect is so great that people were just tremendously benefiting from these injections of progesterone. But sometimes, if a doctor didn't like those toxins in the injectable form, there was also a micronized solution in water. But if they would inject that, where in the hip, for example, where there was supposed to be a good fat pad, sometimes the particle would cause irritation that would cause destruction of the fat cells, and they would have a dent wherever they got an injection. And because of the known toxic effects of the oily version and the irritating effect of the so-called water-wettable solutions and those weren't really just progesterone. There was a molecule, a carbohydrate-like molecule attached to the progesterone particle making it wettable. And those particles are toxic. So that was probably what was making the particle destroy the fat cells.
