**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the proposition says that you can sell carcinogens. Any form that you want, but you just have to quote the law that says this is known by the state of California to cause cancer and or birth defects and such. But it isn't a law against selling carcinogens, just that you have to warn against them. And the partially driven by lawyers who were given the opportunity to enforce the law instead of the state. Lawyers could make collectivations themselves. They chose to interpret the law to mean that the presence of anything which could be carcinogenic in any other situation makes a product require the warning. So this ended up that parking lots had to be warned. They were carcinogenic. The public had to see a sign if they went into the parking lot.
**CONTEXT:** How did progesterone become deemed a carcinogenic substance under California's Proposition 65?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it was either the paving material or the fact that there were cars there emitting exhaust fumes. Oh my god. Chocolate producers were sued. Manufacturers had drinking glasses that had paint on the outside. Bread manufacturers, potato vendors, vegetables, anything. There was a whole wave of these insane prosecutions and lawyers made a lot of money. The real function of that law, besides enriching lawyers, it was... to put the warnings everywhere in the produce department of grocery stores and on apartment buildings and on fishing tackle and hardware and so on, so that it became a joke. Everything was labeled a carcinogen, so the carcinogens became invisible. The real carcinogens were submerged in this phony warning business. It was still legal to sell carcinogens, but since everything had the warning, the public basically wasn't warned against the real carcinogens. Physicians could prescribe the carcinogens as long as they were under doctor's orders.
**CONTEXT:** What was the rationale for the parking lots being labeled carcinogenic?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and very bad for the public. It has been brought to the attention of the Attorney General and so on. The lawyers basically are in control of the government so that anything that would impair their ability to shake down the public doesn't interest the law enforcement people.
**CONTEXT:** What was the role of lawyers and government in this situation?

**RAY PEAT:** I couldn't prove it because I couldn't subpoena the documents, but on its surface it looks very much like the competing industries are using those organizations to get rid of progesterone among other products.
**CONTEXT:** What was the connection between non-profit corporations and the targeting of progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the state prescribes the type of penalty that they can get. I forget, it was like $50 for each drinking glass that was sold without warning. I agree, and it was a huge amount of money, millions of dollars that the lawyers have collected.
**CONTEXT:** What were the penalties for not complying with the Proposition 65 warnings?

**RAY PEAT:** 10 employees or more, the law doesn't apply to you, so you legally should be able to sell anything without a warning. Except the lawyers ignore that. They go ahead and extort money from people who, just on the face of the law, it can't be applied to.
**CONTEXT:** What is the exception to the Proposition 65 law regarding the number of employees?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, they do. First they threaten you, then they pursue you. And they keep it going for years.
**CONTEXT:** Do the lawyers actually pursue legal action if the warnings are not paid?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the California lawyers were getting big money from foreign corporations even outside the U.S. because they do business with California and California has such a big economy that they control the world.
**CONTEXT:** What was the influence of foreign corporations on the California Proposition 65 enforcement?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it was 1987 when the California review happened. I'm not sure of the date when the... Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment is what California's board is called. They call it WEHA, O-E-H-H-A. And they weren't willing to give me the names of the people who were their qualified experts by their definition who made those decisions, but the law requires them to either... just automatically list it because world health organizations or national toxicology program list it. They could just defer to them. But in this case, they decided to have their board of qualified experts look at the relevant evidence out of thousands of publications on the issue of cancer and progesterone. They picked out about a dozen articles that they said was the relevant, decisive evidence. And of those, several of them weren't even progesterone. There were birth control pills and things that contained no progesterone at all. They listed them as the relevant evidence, but when I got them... to send me copies, they weren't even about progesterone in several cases. And then the ones that did involve progesterone in the research, every one of them was totally incompetent as toxicology or science or cancer research. They were clearly manipulated to... to get a case against progesterone, but they failed in every case.
**CONTEXT:** When did you become aware that progesterone was going to be targeted, and what was the process of the California review?

**RAY PEAT:** They had only one outside person testified during the meeting, Richard Edgren, and they asked him why he had chosen to testify, and he said, because progesterone isn't a carcinogen. Then he went over... some of the studies and mentioned that one of the studies using non-progesterone chemicals had produced some tumors that weren't metastatic. But he wasn't in that moment talking about progesterone, but the chairman of the committee heard him say metastatic, even though he had said... they weren't. And since the topic of the meeting was progesterone, even though Ed Brin wasn't talking about progesterone in that case, that was the basis for making the decision.
**CONTEXT:** What was the testimony of Richard Edgren during the review, and how was it misinterpreted?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because he pointed out that if you call non-carcinogens carcinogens then what's the public going to think about real carcinogens? You're going to ruin the whole issue of public safety if you blur anti-carcinogens with carcinogens.
**CONTEXT:** Why did Richard Edgren testify against the classification of progesterone as a carcinogen?

**RAY PEAT:** And one of the studies that they listed as evidence proving that progesterone is a carcinogen, the article introduced itself by reference to some studies by Alexander Lipschutz, who had published many papers and a book describing the anti-tumor properties of progesterone. And this article... referenced that and said that they were checking up on Lipschut's work. But Lipschut, in his paper that they were referring to, had specified that progesterone, given continuously, prevents or even sometimes reverses cancer. And in this paper that California considered evidence of carcinogenicity... They gave intermittent progesterone treatments exactly what Lipschutz had said wouldn't prevent cancer and they concluded it doesn't prevent cancer. That was all the paper consisted of, a bad reputation of Lipschutz evidence that progesterone prevents cancer. And California presented this... this strange non-refutation of progesterone as a cancer preventant adds evidence that it causes cancer.
**CONTEXT:** How did the California review misrepresent the work of Alexander Lipschutz regarding progesterone and cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the California lawyers were getting big money from foreign corporations even outside the U.S. because they do business with California and California has such a big economy that they control the world.
**CONTEXT:** What was the influence of foreign corporations on the California Proposition 65 enforcement?

**RAY PEAT:** And around the time that someone petitioned to take progesterone off the list... And that petition was rejected because the person in charge of responding to the petition mentioned a study that was done at the World Health Organization Cancer Research Agency as having shown that progesterone was a carcinogen. So I looked that up, and the people at the World Health Organization... said they didn't know of any such thing, but they looked carefully and finally found one with the same date that California had cited, and it wasn't about progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** How was a petition to remove progesterone from the carcinogen list rejected based on a World Health Organization study?

**RAY PEAT:** Synthetic progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** What was the World Health Organization study actually about?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I see. And California had cited that one obscure article not about progesterone to refute the petition. That had presented evidence that progesterone protects against cancer. But that was just a way of saying, no, don't bother us. At the point that I asked them who made the decisions that were decisive, even though the decisions violated their own regulations, the head of the agency. said we don't have the resources to answer your questions anymore. Like, go away.
**CONTEXT:** How did California use the WHO study to reject the petition, and what was the agency's response to further inquiry?

**RAY PEAT:** And around the same time, someone petitioned to remove saccharin from the list of carcinogens. And there's a lot of evidence that saccharin is a carcinogen. And the California decided. To remove it from their list on the basis that the reason it causes cancer of the bladder in rats is peculiar to rat bladders and it's sort of a crystallization and the concussion caused by falling crystals on the wall of the bladder. Basically, that's what the argument consisted of. They had no evidence that it was the contact of crystals with the bladder but they found the paper that said it does cause crystallization in the bladder. But there are also articles that showed that human urine crystallizes in exactly the same way the rats did so there was nothing special about the rat crystals. It was just again... the reaching as far as they could not to see the evidence and so they took it off the list. Again, just as false in the other direction to take saccharin off the list because it's a big industry moneymaker.
**CONTEXT:** How did California handle the petition to remove saccharin from the carcinogen list, and what was the reasoning?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so it sounds like they're there to represent certain interests and basically be a filter for what......becomes available to the public or not, based on those interests, not the public's interests.
**CONTEXT:** What is the primary function of these regulatory bodies, according to this discussion?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can see it in some of the traditional centers of estrogen promoting research. They, around that time, turned against progesterone instead of concentrating on on how good estrogen is. They're stretching to find something bad linked to progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** Why did research centers shift their focus from estrogen to progesterone, and what was the motivation?

**RAY PEAT:** Some of them were linked to the university that was doing the anti-progesterone research, and the leading anti-progesterone guy was Malcolm Pike, and he and one or two others formed a company to promote a birth control pill based on... his idea of protecting against progesterone. And the state of California was using federal grants and other funding to support corporations, his included. So government money was flowing into his anti-progesterone business while he was sitting......influential in saying that progesterone is a carcinogen and everyone I looked up on the board was either directly or indirectly concerned with something competing. For example, one of the people who was on the board of a company promoting transdermal... medical treatments, things that will administer drugs through the skin while most of the progesterone products were being delivered through the skin. This person was representing a company that would probably be in line to market.
**CONTEXT:** Who were the individuals on the board that decided progesterone was a carcinogen, and what were their affiliations?

**RAY PEAT:** There was only one biologist on the committee and several toxicologists and the University of Southern California has, I think, the biggest... concentration of anti-progesterone work. I looked at the USC website about five, six years ago, and I found easily, I think it was 140 references to the glorious properties of estrogen, and I found, I forget, numerous, but not competitive. There were numerous references to progesterone, but every one of them was about its harmful properties. And if you look at them objectively, you have to look hard to find an objectively beneficial effect of estrogen, and you have to stretch very hard to find a harmful effect of progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** What were the academic affiliations and fields of expertise of the board members, and what was the focus of research at the University of Southern California?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the things on the website were research projects in progress, I think they were all in progress.
**CONTEXT:** Were the research projects at USC ongoing or completed?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. So that's basically, that university has come down on the side of the pharmaceutical companies that are funding them, in short. Yeah, there are several labs around the country. Berkeley has more recently moved in that direction. And Michigan was a big center of estrogen research, and some of those people moved to... UC Berkeley. And interestingly, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is involved in antiprogestorone research, which seems to have grown out of the chemical warfare line of thinking.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between universities, pharmaceutical companies, and research focus?

**RAY PEAT:** Well... It obviously would be for benign and harmless purposes. I'm sure I'd like to talk about that.
**CONTEXT:** Why would a weapons lab like Lawrence Livermore Laboratory be interested in anti-progesterone research?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there were, the idea of receptors in general was being discussed in various fields, but for estrogen, the enzymologists were progressing very quickly. in understanding the effects of estrogen and molecules like estrogen through the 1940s into the 1950s. And one of the lines of very productive research was showing that you can change estrogen back and forth between estrone and estradiol. Estradiol is very active. And that was classified as enzymology. And Jensen's argument was that estrogen acts by activating a genetic program. And so it's only a female acting substance because females are genetically determined to be female. And so what estrogen does is act on a receptor that activates the genetic program. And if something is acted on by enzymes, men have enzymes that are going to do the same reactions. And it's an anti-malargy. They tended to generalize the estrogen issue and make it a masculine problem as well as female. But Jensen got the only support from the Atomic Energy Commission, which controlled the isotopes, needed to do enzyme studies. He used an isotope-labeled form of estrogen and in his experiments with uterus tissue claimed to show that there was no oxidation or reduction of estrogen by the uterus and said that's the end of the enzyme tradition, it's all receptor and genes now. And that spread through the research world. And by the mid-1960s was the dogma. But then the enzymologists started getting the same isotopes that he had had. And showed that, in fact, the old 1940s research was exactly what's happening. And now everyone knows that estrogen, estradiol, and estrone are perfectly interchangeable. And that's exactly where progesterone... and thyroid and stress hormones interact with estrogen. Progesterone turns off some of the enzymes that activate estrogen and activate enzymes that inactivate estrogen. So the enzyme approach opens up the whole issue of environmental physiology, nutritional, metabolic. effects on the estrogen system and the estrogen's deranging effects on all of those systems. So that's all now coming back, but 50 years of belief in a genetic explanation of why estrogen is so good for females and harmless to everyone else.
**CONTEXT:** Elwood Jensen is credited with inventing the concept of the hormone receptor. Can you explain his work and how it related to estrogen and the shift in scientific understanding?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I was saying that Elwood Jensen, the reason I brought him up is because you mentioned Livermore Labs and he worked in the chemical weapons industry, isn't that right? Yeah, University of Chicago I think is where he was working and that was a big weapons laboratory. The government doesn't. They don't say much about their chemical biological warfare research, but if you look at the careers of some of the famous biologists, you see that you can't explain their achievements other than that they were being pushed by the Pentagon to get the information that they needed for germ or chemical warfare.
**CONTEXT:** Was Elwood Jensen involved in chemical weapons research, and how does this relate to his scientific work?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, until just I guess about 25 years ago, biologists thought about estrogen, working on the estrogen receptor as simply activating femaleness in genetic females and that therefore would act only on uterus or a female breast or the female pituitary. As if a man didn't share practically all enzymes and genes with women. It was just an extreme case of genetic cleaning up of the dangerous possibilities. And the actual reality of how things work. Yes, estrogen has been known for... about 30 or 40 years to act on every kind of tissue. You can find the estrogen receptor everywhere, but even without the estrogen receptor, you can demonstrate that it works on any kind of tissue. And some of the estrogenic compounds attach to the so-called estrogen receptor, but some have estrogenic effects without touching the estrogen receptor. So, I really think... It should have a new name. It's the Sometime Estrogen Receptor Activator System, but it isn't really the crucial thing because you can get estrogenic effects from radiation or cyanide or suffocation or various stresses and infections and so on. They'll all bring on estrus and swelling of cells. And activation of the uterus and so on. Inflammation. Yeah. And the overlap of stress and radiation and industrial smoke and so on with estrogen, that's one of the things that has been carefully avoided. And the receptor idea is crucial in covering that up.
**CONTEXT:** How did Elwood Jensen's receptor concept shift the understanding of estrogen's effects, and what is the broader reality of estrogen's action?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, estrogen in the physiological situation activates the production of progesterone and then progesterone knocks down the production of estrogen so it's a matter of an occasional stimulus from stress or estrogen which turns on a system that then definitively gets rid of estrogen and leaves things operating for the rest of the month. And it's only the exaggerated prolonged effect of estrogen that becomes a danger and progesterone is the basic thing for getting rid of estrogen and if you look at the enzymes involved progesterone inactivates the aromatase enzyme that produces estrogen from the androgens and it activates the two types of detoxifying enzymes, the glucuronate transferase and the sulfur transferase that attach sulfuric acid to make it water soluble. Estrogen opposes those and progesterone inactivates the estrogen activated enzymes that remove the detoxified. So it's just an amazingly comprehensive system that progesterone does and only real progesterone does that so systematically. It knocks out the production and maintenance and activation of of estrogen and it even destroys ________________ the so-called estrogen receptor protein and so at the action end, the production end and all of the intermediate steps progesterone systematically destroys the estrogen system and that's one of the reasons that progesterone is so universally important. But it's the opposite side of why estrogen is so universally dangerous. Progesterone even protects against radiation as part of that same system because radiation imitates estrogen and the cancer is produced by either radiation or estrogen. So these are equally... protected against by progesterone. So it's a comprehensive, protective substance against the full range of biological threats.
**CONTEXT:** Why is estrogen research relevant to a discussion about progesterone, and how does progesterone counteract estrogen's effects?

**RAY PEAT:** The reason I brought him up is because you mentioned Livermore Labs and he worked in the chemical weapons industry, isn't that right? Yeah, University of Chicago I think is where he was working and that was a big weapons laboratory. The government doesn't. They don't say much about their chemical biological warfare research, but if you look at the careers of some of the famous biologists, you see that you can't explain their achievements other than that they were being pushed by the Pentagon to get the information that they needed for germ or chemical warfare.
**CONTEXT:** Elwood Jensen, the inventor of the estrogen receptor concept, was involved in work related to chemical weapons. Can you elaborate on this connection?

**RAY PEAT:** And he went on to try to discover other chemicals that opposed to estrogen and he came up with tamoxifen, I think everybody knows that has a lot of bad side effects. A man named Dan Lednesser gives a more insider view of where tamoxifen came from. The people who were working on the fact that......estrogen is like the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in causing not only cancer but inflammation and fibrosis. They were looking for anti-inflammatory things because the polycyclic hydrocarbons and estrogen create inflammation. And looking for anti-inflammatory things, they accidentally found that tamoxifen was anti-estrogen as well. And out of that line of research, according to Dan Ledneser, even Celebrex, the COX-2 inhibiting NSAIDs, even these derived from... that line of research that was thinking about a more basic view of what estrogen does. The receptor wasn't involved at all in that kind of thinking.
**CONTEXT:** Elwood Jensen's work on estrogen and cancer led him to explore other chemicals that opposed estrogen, such as tamoxifen. Can you explain the origin and rationale behind tamoxifen research?

**RAY PEAT:** I think you have to imagine the mentality of... like the person he suggested looking for how the estrogen affects the tissues was Charles Huggins. Huggins, I think he founded the lab that Jensen was working in, and according to Jensen he gave him the idea, but I think you have to see what flakes they were, even though it was the University of Chicago. They were just... is totally unaware of the world of biochemistry as related to cancer. I don't really know how it was possible. You'd have to have a detailed biography of what courses they were teaching and so on, but Huggins is the guy that theorized that since he wrote a textbook in which they made the rooster grow its comb by giving it testosterone and the classical things and so they said since testosterone makes a man develop a prostate gland and estrogen makes women develop breasts, if you want to stop the growth of cancer in the breast, you will either remove estrogen or give testosterone, that was his first suggestion I think and for the prostate you would either castrate the man or give the man estrogen or both because his simple idea was that the female and male were opposite and so if you give the opposite hormone you will antagonize. the growth-promoting effect of their hormones. Basically, a completely idiotic idea at the time he proposed it, but no one was there to tell him so. That immediately started doctors all over the country castrating men by the millions. And for, I guess, 45, 50 years, they were giving men estrogen with or without castration to treat prostate cancer. All on that. very ignorant early 20th century idea of opposition of the hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Why were researchers like Charles Huggins looking for alternatives to progesterone to oppose estrogen, and what was the flawed reasoning behind their approach?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah and Huggins was the one who besides proposing castrating men to cure prostate cancer and giving them estrogen he first proposed removing the ovaries. to stop the estrogenic stimulation and then since some of them didn't recover from that, they took out their adrenal glands as another source of estrogen. That was practiced up right through the 60s, I think, until about 1970. And at one point Huggins even proposed... treating breast cancer with estrogen just didn't make any sense, but he had sort of a Frankenstein mentality. Let's tinker with things and maybe we'll come up with something. And he saw everything in just black and white.
**CONTEXT:** What other radical treatments for cancer were proposed by Charles Huggins based on his hormonal theories?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, Alexander Lipschutz was the person who did the most comprehensive work showing that where estrogen causes fibrosis, fibroids first and eventually cancer, it acts first on the uterus, then on the breasts, then on the lungs. Kidneys, brain, and it's just a matter of where estrogen concentrates that it tends to cause fibromas and cancers. And in every one of those situations, progesterone is protective. And now it's known that it has this about, I think, nine different mechanisms by which it eliminates the estrogen problem. So, the... The cause and the effect outcome was defined by 1950 by Alexander Lipschutz, and then the more detailed stuff is still being developed. An Italian has done some very good work looking at the range of things progesterone does defensively. Someone named Mendelsohn has done a lot of work on the protective effects of... progesterone against estrogen. But the full reason of why progesterone is protective against cancer, you have to look at the whole spectrum of what estrogen is doing.
**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone combat cancer, and what research supports its protective role?

**RAY PEAT:** The first thing estrogen does is cause the cell to take up water, and taking up water stimulates cell division and fat production. A lot of other enzyme activities. These effects happen within minutes of the time of estrogen exposure, and so anyone looking at simple tissue biological experiments way back 80 years, as soon as they had a concentrated estrogen-like material, they could see that it instantaneously was causing the tissue to take up water and begin producing water. and other substances and to divide. So it takes at least several hours for genes to get activated and cause cellular changes. So obviously the receptor wasn't involved in those instantaneous effects of estrogen. And those are exactly what the essence of the cancer problem is. It's the start and inflammation that causes cells to keep taking up water. In that stressed condition of activating cell chemistry, they're using energy faster, and the stimulation of cell division is tending to use up the supply of oxygen and sugar.
**CONTEXT:** What are the immediate effects of estrogen on cells, and how do these relate to the development of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** In my thesis research, one of the things I did was show that adding estrogen to a system such as uterus lowers the oxygen tension. It just sucks the oxygen out of the system, and so it kills the embryo that's trying to implant if there's a little too much estrogen or not enough progesterone. So that stimulation creates an oxygen deficiency. And as far as sugar is available, the sugar will be glycolized to produce emergency energy in the absence of enough oxygen to meet the stimulation. The glycolysis produces lactic acid. The production of lactic acid leaving the cell raises the pH inside the cell at the end. That increased pH keeps the swelling going on, activates cell division, and expands the energy. It needs something from the outside to stop the production of lactic acid and deliver oxygen and so on. Progesterone is one of the essential things for stopping that process, but once it starts under the influence of estrogen, you get the lactic acid production which creates a vicious cycle of cell activation. And the lactic acid acts as a, it increases the supply of blood and spreads growth of blood vessels into the environment so it activates everything that you need to produce a tumor and all that's needed is the absence of an anti-inflammatory energy restoring substance such as aspirin or progesterone to stop this process. If you don't have those available, the lactic acid stimulates surrounding cells to change their physiology in ways that you have a progressive increase of the malignancy behavior of the cells. In the simplest situation, an injury causes the lactic acid to be produced, which activates the energy changes and growth to heal the wound. But at a certain point, the system should come in with the anti-inflammatory substances, such as progesterones, to finish off the healing. And in the absence of the healing, the attempt at healing simply goes on and creates this swelling. And the oxygen deficient situation, and if you grow cells in a culture dish and deprive them of oxygens by having them in a dish without good circulation, they will eventually mutate and form other types of cell that cause a derangement and alteration of the tissue type. All of the steps of... cancer ization can be seen structurally and metabolically in terms of wound healing that can't be brought to completion.
**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's effect on oxygen tension and lactic acid production contribute to tumor formation, and what role does progesterone play in preventing this?

**RAY PEAT:** He has just honestly summarized the real cancer research showing that the deranged metabolism and structure is what causes the chromosomal damage. So instead of genes causing the tumor, the tumor causes the genetic defects. Which is the opposite of what we... hear basically every day in our popular culture when people talk about cancers.
**CONTEXT:** Harry Rubin's research suggests that cancer is caused by deranged metabolism and structure, not genetic defects. Can you elaborate on this?

**RAY PEAT:** And when an oncologist or pathologist says your tissue shows abnormal cell division and the wrong number of chromosomes and such, they say that means we have to cut it out and irradiate you and so on. But if you look at the fate of those deranged cells, they're going to live maybe. To the next attempt to divide, then they don't have the right number of chromosomes and the halves will die. So they're very short-lived once they get to that deranged state. But the death of the cell contributes to the inflammation of the area. And so stopping the inflammation and energy deficit is always the solution to the problem. When it's now... recognized by some oncologists that the reason a malignant cancer reforms after they've irradiated the area or cut out the cancer or both, the reason it reforms is that stem cells are called into the inflamed area that has been treated. And even if you irradiate a healthy area, it will call stem cells in to try to repair the wound And if the radiation deranged the fibrous material in that area, you'll produce a cancer from the irradiation. So whenever you injure a tissue by removing a tumor, you're just guaranteeing that the body will try to repair the wound by sending in new cells, which then turn into cancer cells if the area is still sick.
**CONTEXT:** How does the conventional medical approach to cancer treatment, such as surgery and radiation, paradoxically contribute to cancer recurrence?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so the way to actually... heal or to stay healthy is to make sure that your cellular environment is a healthy one.
**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental principle for healing and maintaining health?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and some of the antihistamines are definitely protective. All right, well if people want to read more about this, they can find out. Lots of Ray Peat's ideas at raypeat.com, that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T dot com, where, I think, Ray, you said you had 70 articles up there, or so, and... Yeah, I'll be putting about a dozen more up in a couple of weeks, I think. That's great. It's a beautiful website, by the way. I love the sombrero and the ice cream. Oh, thanks. And we have been talking to Dr. Raymond Peat, who's... has a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Oregon, and with speciality in physiology, and also has done extensive research in endocrinology and science history. And as always, it's been a real pleasure to talk to you, Ray. Thanks so much for coming on. Okay. Okay, thank you. That wraps it up for Politics and Science this week. Please tune in again next week for another edition of Politics and Science. Podcasts can be found at Radio4All.net.
**CONTEXT:** What are some anti-inflammatory substances that can be used for cancer treatment, and where can people find more information about your work?
