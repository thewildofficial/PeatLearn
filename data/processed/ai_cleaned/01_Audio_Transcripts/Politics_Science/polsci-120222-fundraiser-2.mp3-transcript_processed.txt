**RAY PEAT:** The field idea in biology, embryology as a model, developing according to its interactions with the environment. That idea continued. Some of the people who were developing experiments on trying to understand the rules by which an organism takes form, some of these people were vitalists who believed there was something extra besides the matter. But at least they were interested. In the actual events as the organism took form and they were knocked out of biology by the gene people who I would say are on the side of an inert cosmos. They want to explain things in terms of essentially immaterial information and they're the ones who... I talk about the vitalists wanting to introduce a vital principle as being somehow against the materialism of science, but the genetics people really want to depreciate the material world in favor of an information world, and the idea of the central dogma was that the information... that we have in our genes is immortal and can't be added to, and it can only be written out into mortal, temporary, imperfect organisms, but it's the timeless stuff. So, really, the calling people like Driesch, a vitalist, and saying that they weren't really biologists, it's kind of self-referential, because the genetics people have thrown out most of the interesting stuff in biology until the last ten years or so. When they're starting to get back to the field theory again.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about the notion that the universe was dead and inert, and most of biology was just kind of of that nature. Ray Peat clarifies the historical debate between vitalists and genetics proponents regarding the nature of biological organization.

**RAY PEAT:** The problem with the commercialization of synthetic T4 that started in the late 40s was that they tested it on male medical students who are about 25 years old and selected for good health and they found that it worked in them just like the real thyroid substance that had been in use for about 40-50 years at that time. And the trouble is that it then became commercialized and women have at least five times the incidence of thyroid problems because of the antagonism between estrogen and thyroid. And the thyroid sluggishness that's so common in women shows up as a slow metabolism of the liver. Typically... A woman premenstrually will get drunk on a fraction of the alcohol that it takes to make a man drunk because the liver is slowed down by the antagonism between estrogen and thyroid and oxidative metabolism and it happens that thyroxin has to be activated in the liver by taking off one of the iodines in the right position. To make it the active hormone called T3 and so if women are having already low blood sugar symptoms or high estrogen symptoms things that are the result of hypothyroidism then T4 can very often not help or even make the problem worse. Some experimenters took, they were trying to argue that thyroid does something other than rev up the oxidative metabolism, so they took slices of muscle and kidney and liver and brain and heart and added thyroxin T4 to these cultured slices and saw that the liver had a tremendous burst of oxidative activity. But the kidneys didn't do much and the livers, the muscles didn't do anything and added to the brain, it actually suppressed oxidative metabolism in the brain and so they said, you see, oxidation isn't what thyroid really does, it just happens that the liver responds that way. They were looking at the pre-hormone, the liver has to turn it into the active hormone before it can work in the muscles, kidneys, heart and brain. And it turns out that the brain concentrates, the blood can have 40 times as much T4 as T3 if your liver is a little sluggish and your brain will still concentrate. The T3 to the point that it has a one-to-one ratio and so if you put the brain slice in the dish where it can't get a new supply of T3 constantly, the added T4 can't do anything except displace some of the active hormone that the brain had been concentrating at the one-to-one ratio. So adding T4 to the brain in the culture dish had caused... suppression of metabolic activity and in people you very often see it causing neurological symptoms, strange electrical sensations or ringing ears or worse memory, various things that are really signs of worse thyroid function. So it sounds like T4 probably is not... You shouldn't be taking very much of it, if any at all, especially if you're a woman.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about self-treating hypothyroidism with T4, specifically how much is too much and if T4 is necessary. Ray Peat explains the historical context of T4 use, its differential metabolism in men and women, and its potential negative effects, particularly on the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's very good if you don't need it very much. So a lot of people take a mixture of T4 and T3, supposedly close to the physiological dose of 1 to 5, I think it is?
**RAY PEAT:** Well, the gland diffuse. Take a human gland or a cow gland, it's close to a 4 to 1 ratio.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even a 5 to 1 mixture is okay. But the people who were insisting on still using the armor with its 4 to 1 ratio in the 1960s, else. The pharmaceutical companies developed tests for diagnosing thyroid. They started noticing that the people who were taking thyroxine had maybe a 40 to 1 ratio of T4 to T3 in the blood. But the people who were taking armor had maybe a 10 to 1 or a 5 to 1 ratio. And so they defined the people who were taking T4 as the normal. And the ones who were taking armors having too much T3. But most doctors at that time weren't aware at all that T3 was the thyroid hormone. Oh, I see. So they jumped to conclusions and werelarÄ±yla stuck with some of those conclusions.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about the optimal ratio of T4 to T3 in thyroid supplementation. Ray Peat discusses the natural ratio in desiccated thyroid and contrasts it with the ratios seen in people taking synthetic T4, highlighting how pharmaceutical companies influenced diagnostic standards.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, one of the ideas that spread quickly in the late 1940s was when the... The first blood tests for thyroid came on the market around the same time as Synthroid, the T4 product. It was the protein-bound iodine test, and where people like Broder Barnes had seen close to half of the population benefiting from some thyroid, which used to be part of the... meat supply until the agriculture department said the meat companies could no longer sell it, but in Broder Barnstein he saw that somewhere between 20 and 45 percent of the people benefited from taking some thyroid, but these new blood tests in the late 40s found that 95 percent of the people had a thyroid attack so they decided to go back to use the lymphatic system instead. More than 50 percent of people in the A fairly high level of iodine-bound protein in the blood and that created the only 5 percent need a thyroid supplement idea. But then by the 1960s new tests came about and they realized that the protein-bound iodine test had almost nothing to do with thyroid function, really nothing to do with thyroid function. So the standard that still persists widely that only 5% of the population is potentially a candidate for supplement, the basis for establishing that had nothing to do with the thyroid function.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is discussing the historical development of thyroid testing and the perceived prevalence of thyroid deficiency. Ray Peat explains how early blood tests, like the protein-bound iodine test, were flawed and led to an underestimation of the need for thyroid supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** Basically, no. A lot of different things can cause that. Some people can actually have reverse peristalsis. When you analyze burps, most of the time it's air that you've swallowed coming back. Displaying perfect air. But sometimes you find other gases such as methane. Coming out in burps and the Walter Alvarez, one of the interesting things he demonstrated was that it's pretty common for people to experience very intense reverse peristalsis. He put some lycopodium powder in his medical students' rectums....when they went home for the evening. I'm beginning to get the idea that I wonder who wanted to be in his medical class. He had them fill out a questionnaire saying whether they typically experienced morning breath. And then when they came in in the morning after getting the lycopodium powder, he took a swab in their mouth. And found lycopodium powder in the mouths of the ones who typically had bad breath in the morning. Wow. That's a little grim. I hope they didn't have girlfriends. Or boyfriends. But do you think most of the time the air is just from swallowing, I mean the burping is just from swallowing air most likely?
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the daytime. Most of the reverse peristalsis happens in the night. If you're low thyroid, your autonomic nervous system tends to rev up compensating for the low oxidative metabolism. It pushes it harder to increase your adrenaline in particular. Some of the other things are... histamine and serotonin go up too, but the adrenaline tends to stop the forward propulsion of the peristalsis and then random signals, irritation from something in your intestine can probably send waves going both directions and that probably is more common when you're... digestive system is slightly paralyzed by a very high adrenaline level.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about excessive air, chest pressure, and the need to burp, wondering if it's due to low or high stomach acid. Ray Peat explains that burping is often due to swallowed air and discusses how low thyroid can lead to increased adrenaline and reverse peristalsis, particularly at night.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 70s, I saw a series of five people over a period of just maybe a... I don't know, a year or two, I think. And as they told me their symptoms, I said, that sounds like classical hypothyroidism. And a couple of these people that went to their old-fashioned doctors with a list of what they'd just told me that their symptoms were. I said, here are my symptoms, what do I have? And the doctor said, hypothyroidism, and gave them thyroid and that series of five people in a row, every one of them discovered they didn't have multiple sclerosis but rather just needed a thyroid supplement.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about multiple sclerosis, its causes, and treatment. Ray Peat shares his experience observing that many individuals diagnosed with MS actually had symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and improved with thyroid supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, um... Well, people probably worry too much about it. The T4 has a half-life of two weeks and T3 in different people can have a half-life as short as as one day. And so if you were getting a sudden overdose and your pulse went up maybe a hundred and fifty beats per minute at rest. In 48 hours probably you would have lost at least half of your T3 which is the active stuff and your liver would then be putting out just sort of a disposal amount converting the T4 to T3. So usually if you took so much that you had a very fast hundred and fifty beat. Heart rate in two days. You would probably be down to a fairly safe comfortable 120 beats per minute I see and if you wanted to intervene and make that even a quicker transition.
**RAY PEAT:** Oh Yeah, I've seen Some people who just suddenly spontaneously became hyperthyroid or who had overdosed Juicing cabbage raw It just takes a glass or two of that to a very powerfully suppress your your thyroid functions if it worked at several levels, but usually a Glass or two a day for a couple of days and the person is back down to normal. Hmm And once you suppress go ahead Well liver isn't is another Suppressive food if you eat two big meals of labor you can see a big decrease in thyroid function. And how long does that suppression last from liver or cabbage? If you eat something and say you're not hyperthyroid you're just normal whatever that is and you eat some liver how long does it take for your thyroid to bounce back? Is that also just a matter of a couple days?
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah and the fear of suppressing your thyroid gland itself by taking too much thyroid. That has been tested by using isotopes that they could tell where the thyroid was coming from so they would dose them until they could tell there was no thyroid being produced by their own gland and then they stopped dosing them to see if there was any concern about prolonged suppression and everyone's gland came right back in a couple of days.
**RAY PEAT:** Well that's encouraging so you can supplement your thyroid without fear of......permanently taking it out of the system which I think is what a lot of people are told if they talk to their doctor about it. Yeah and the people, farmers who had their own animals often they would eat the thyroid gland in the chicken neck for example. And one guy I knew said that on... Friday they always had fried chicken in the field for lunch and he said Friday afternoons he was always too hot to work. But he would eat five necks and get probably, oh, 20 grains of thyroid or something. A very suppressive dose and he would be very hot but by the next day it would have passed. That'll get you moving.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about feeling unwell after taking too much desiccated thyroid, how long it takes to recover, and if there's anything to speed up the process. Ray Peat explains the half-life of thyroid hormones and suggests that the body recovers relatively quickly. He also mentions that certain foods like raw cabbage and liver can suppress thyroid function, but this effect is temporary. He reassures that supplementing thyroid does not permanently damage the gland.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's mostly caused by high cortisol and stress hormones. And... So just eating a good, supportive diet, plenty of fruit, orange juice and milk, will help keep the stress down. And I think it works just as effectively as taking just small amounts of T3.
**RAY PEAT:** It's basically where your whole thyroid system shuts down, is that right? Yeah, if your body thinks you're having an overexposure to thyroid, it gets rid of the excess by turning thyroxine into an inactive kind of T3. It takes off the wrong iodine. And so if you're fasting, for example, part of the... Thyroid is being excreted the way estrogen or toxins are being excreted all the time but part of it is being inactivated in a way that has an anti-thyroid effect. It interferes with the active T3 so it's an extra fast way to turn off your thyroid function, not just getting rid of the active stuff but making a neutralizing. Blocking the form of the thyroid.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about reverse T3, its causes, and whether T3 treatment is necessary to clear it or if proper nutrition suffices. Ray Peat attributes reverse T3 to high cortisol and stress, suggesting that a supportive diet can be effective. He explains that reverse T3 is an inactive form of thyroid hormone produced when the body tries to reduce thyroid activity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, naloxone or naltrexone, when you're under stress, you produce the endorphins and the endorphins, they compensate for injury or stress and they should go away, but prolonged stress can leave you out of it. sort of inhibited in various ways with the wrong pattern of endorphins and if a person has been exposed to prolonged stress sometimes you can break out of the pattern and recover functions with an anti-morphine treatment. These naloxone and naltrexone are the injected and oral forms of an anti-opioid that simply keeps the morphine or the endorphin from having its effect and sometimes that can restore functions that have been suppressed.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it usually has its effect in just a few days though. I see. And I think if it hasn't really made a big difference in just a few days then it's probably some other problem.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about the use of naloxone or naltrexone for stress-related issues, drawing a parallel to reverse T3. Ray Peat explains that these are anti-opioid medications that can help restore suppressed functions by blocking the effects of endorphins, which are produced during stress. He notes that their effect is usually seen within a few days.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah. All kinds of stabilizing anti-inflammatory things. Thyroid and progesterone and the short chain fatty acids and sugars are all things that help restore. Injured, de-myelinated nerves.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking if other anti-inflammatories can be used to keep inflammation low, in the context of discussing stress and suppressed functions. Ray Peat lists thyroid, progesterone, short-chain fatty acids, and sugars as beneficial for restoring injured, de-myelinated nerves.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. My father had it done. I think they used vegetable oil in the 1950s. A combination of novocaine and vegetable oil, I think, was the popular thing then. And it causes an inflammatory reaction and toughening up of the ligaments. And it can cure some back problems without anything very invasive, just a shot into the ligament. And so it's proven to work, but I think there are better things. It's usually a low DHEA production from low thyroid, high estrogen, and stress hormones that cause the ligaments and tendons to get weak. And correcting the thyroid. function and maybe taking a DHEA or a pregnant woman supplement would be the natural way to strengthen the ligaments and tendons and it helps the bones at the same time.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about the efficacy of prolotherapy, which involves injecting sugar (dextrose) into tendons or ligaments to strengthen them. Ray Peat confirms his familiarity with the procedure, noting its historical use with vegetable oil and novocaine. He suggests that weak ligaments and tendons are often due to low DHEA, high estrogen, and stress hormones, and that correcting thyroid function and supplementing with DHEA or pregnenolone are more natural approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it doesn't apply just to people, it applies to all complex organisms practically. The difference between us and a fungus is that we've had a lot of thyroid and oxidative metabolism that the fungus hasn't benefited from. All of our functions are characterized by high energy oxidative metabolism, the brain more than any other part. And as you look at... the animal kingdom, the outstanding thing is that their oxidative metabolism increases as they go up the so-called evolutionary scale. And it's that oxygen is driving our existence, and our existence is culminating in a bigger, more expensive brain. that other animals couldn't afford because their thyroid function wasn't adequate. It's really the essential thing given oxygen and sugar and a few other materials. Thyroid is the catalyst for making things run right. And it's, I mean, when people complain that I, and I don't think it's actually true, but when they say that all you talk about is the thyroid, they make it sound like you're not interested in any of the other systems of the body, but the thyroid does seem like the master system in terms of energy production for everything.
**CONTEXT:** The host is addressing a common criticism that Ray Peat focuses too much on thyroid. Ray Peat explains that thyroid and oxidative metabolism are fundamental to all complex organisms, driving energy production and enabling higher functions, particularly in the brain. He argues that thyroid is the master system for energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and if your thyroid, for example, is working efficiently. Then your pituitary doesn't have much to do, and you aren't likely to get a pituitary tumor. Your adrenals don't have much to do. Your ovaries don't get overstimulated. The other glands have an easy job when your thyroid is working, right? If your thyroid gets... interfered with, then you've got to rev up your adrenals and then your pituitary becomes a commander-in-chief and tells everyone what to do. With the stress hormones? Yeah, and then you're at risk of getting tumors of the ovaries or testicles or adrenal glands or thyroid glands because your pituitary is working them too hard.
**CONTEXT:** The host is asking Ray Peat to elaborate on the idea that thyroid is the master system. Ray Peat explains how efficient thyroid function allows other endocrine glands, like the pituitary and adrenals, to function optimally. Conversely, when thyroid is compromised, the pituitary and adrenals become overactive, leading to potential hormonal imbalances and increased risk of tumors.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when your thyroid is down, you compensate with all kinds of other stress hormones. Your autonomic system goes up, but so does your adrenal, cortical, and albastrone. Hormones, estrogen increases, even melatonin gets involved, everything runs to compensate when the thyroid is low and some of these compensatory things don't quite compensate fully and then they get involved in increasing the inflammation. And that's where the DHEA and progesterone are either taken orally or can be applied topically. Those are the things that are deficient. As a consequence, the other more delicate and dangerous hormones such as estrogen and cortisol, those increase because you're low in... progesterone, DHEA, and pregnant alone. And so supplementing any of those three or all three of them will usually alleviate or cure arthritis. I've known people with dogs or horses. They thought that the horse was so old that it would never work again. Just giving it progesterone, they made the horse healthy and happy for several more years. And people with dogs that couldn't, basically couldn't walk around, couldn't get up on the furniture, they gave them Pregnenolone or progesterone and they were their normal test selves.
**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about arthritis, specifically if progesterone is helpful for men as well as women. Ray Peat explains that low thyroid leads to compensatory increases in other hormones, including estrogen and cortisol, which can contribute to inflammation and arthritis. He states that deficiencies in DHEA and progesterone are common, and supplementing these hormones, either orally or topically, can alleviate or cure arthritis in both humans and animals.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, they were driven out of their minds partly by the CIAs. A project called the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which worked with Nelson Rockefeller to glorify some of the, what Siqueiros called them, the ghost artists. They were creating a culture of anti-culture. And the CIA knew exactly what they were doing, and presumably Nelson Rockefeller did too, when he and his two or three other philanthropists concentrated on these people because of their anti-social consciousness. And they ridiculed the idea that art should have a social consciousness. And the CIA pumped Marshall plant money into creating this alternative culture of abstract expressionism and such.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking Ray Peat to elaborate on his statement that 20th-century artists are considered "out of their minds." Ray Peat explains that this was partly due to CIA-funded projects aimed at promoting an "anti-culture" and abstract expressionism, which he characterizes as glorifying "ghost artists" with anti-social consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, to improve the power of the Rockefeller class by keeping anyone who said art should be socially conscious, show them to be some kind of degenerate or subversive.
**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the government's motive for promoting this "anti-culture." Ray Peat suggests the motive was to consolidate the power of the Rockefeller class by discrediting and marginalizing artists who advocated for social consciousness in art.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure what you would say causes them, but in myself and in the several friends, I found that they were very hormonally related. In about 1980, one summer, I had been watching a mole grow on my belly, and it was obviously, to me, becoming a dangerous melanoma. It had grown from a little bound spot to a large one. Can you just keep it down while Ray answers this question? Turn off your mic for a second. It was becoming an obvious melanoma to me, and a couple of doctors who happened to be visiting that summer saw it and told me that they thought it was a melanoma. But around that time I was experimenting with different steroids. And I just happened to be tasting some DHA around that time and without thinking of any connection, one night I noticed a shiny red dome on my belly where the mole had been. And over the next three or four days the mole disappeared. And thinking about it, I realized that I had been... sampling the DHEA around that time, so the next time I started getting a mole that looked like it was turning into a melanoma, for example, turning blue and white, and the blue and white spots swimming around or changing positions rapidly, a typical behavior of a melanoma, I would just apply a little either progesterone or DHEA. to that area and immediately the color instead of swimming around in colored spots would level out and become just a little tan colored thing and then it would go away. And I had a series of experiments. One was a mole as big as a jumbo olive that when I finally put some progesterone near it within two weeks. It had turned to a crisp and fallen off without leaving a trace of a scar where this huge, huge black thing had been. And I found that I could sort of steer them. They're extremely mobile, the pigment cells. A huge black thing appeared suddenly on my lower arm and having the other experiences I put a dot of. Progesterone and oil on the upside about an inch from the spot. Is that coconut oil? And the next day there was, well I think it was vitamin E and progesterone. Okay, thanks. And the following day there was a shadow of it about an inch downstream towards my hand and I put another dot on and each time I put a dot on. The next day there would be a shadow an inch farther down so I had a series of three or four progressively fainter shadows and each time a shadow moved out from it, the spot itself got fainter and pretty soon all of the cells had walked away from the big black spot and in another case, putting a dot on the front of one on my forehead, the pigment cells moved out in a circumference away from it so it looked, on the third day, it looked like a bull's eye and after about a week the original spot had shrunk up and pinched off at the base and left no scar. Various other people who didn't experiment in such detail would just take an overdose of thyroid for a week or two and day by day you could see their mole shrinking until, in one case, a mole an inch long disappeared from a guy's back in two weeks.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about the causes of moles on the skin. Ray Peat shares his personal experiences and experiments with DHEA and progesterone, demonstrating their ability to cause moles, including those that appeared to be melanomas, to shrink and disappear. He also describes how applying progesterone could influence the migration of pigment cells.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, like they found some cell that was emitting DHEA possibly and so everyone moves in to take advantage. I see, and that's maybe what caused the mole to form in the first place. Yeah, that's, some people just last couple of months have been thinking about the factors that guide cell migration and it's probably going to be a very interesting field in the next few years. Trying for example to lure cancer cells back from their metastatic positions.
**CONTEXT:** The host is asking why moles form in the first place, following Ray Peat's explanation of how pigment cells migrate. Ray Peat suggests that moles may form when pigment cells are attracted to a cell emitting DHEA, and that understanding cell migration is a promising area for future research, potentially for luring cancer cells back to their original positions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the fat cells are sending out signals. that create inflammation. Leptin is one of the pro-inflammatory signals that you want to signal your fat to stop sending leptin if possible.
**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if weight loss correlates with blood sugar regulation, as fat cells are involved. Ray Peat explains that fat cells send out pro-inflammatory signals like leptin, and reducing these signals is beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on what they are. Like peppers, for example, are really fruits. Tomatoes and peppers are good raw. Carrots and carrots are good raw vegetables. Some of the radishes, for example, are, if you ate a lot of them, they would be anti-thyroid. But there are some things called vegetables that are really fairly rich in sugar as well as the minerals. And so those sweeties. Root vegetables are pretty healthy. And the fruits, tomatoes and bell peppers in particular. As long as you're not nightshade intolerant.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the raw stuff, it's likely to feed bacteria and cause problems and if there is a seed developing in it, that has other... specific toxins, like peas and beans are not so great.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking if eating raw vegetables from the garden is a "no-no," as they believed raw veggies were more nutritious. Ray Peat clarifies that it depends on the specific vegetable. He notes that peppers and tomatoes are good raw, as are carrots. However, he warns that some radishes can be anti-thyroid in large quantities, and raw peas and beans can be problematic due to bacteria and potential toxins.

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your intestine in good condition is one of the things. Both eczema and psoriasis are... tend to flare up in a lot of people when they eat bread or other grains and beans are very hard on the intestine in general but seeds, grains and beans irritating the intestine tend to create sympathetic reactions. The particular enzyme that reacts to gluten is involved in... the maturing of the skin cells, and so this particular enzyme is now being studied as a link between the intestine and the skin, the transglutaminase enzymes.
**RAY PEAT:** Fibroids very often help. With progesterone also, do you think? Yeah, very often, sometimes, pregnenolone, by balancing all of the others, it's a precursor to all of the steroid hormones, and in itself it stops the stress reaction, and to the extent that your stress system, from pituitary to adrenals. It associates with a flare-up of skin problems, just by turning off the stress with Pregnenolone. You can see a big change in a lot of problems.
**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking for tips on handling eczema. Ray Peat suggests that maintaining good intestinal health is important, as eczema and psoriasis often flare up with the consumption of grains and beans. He mentions the enzyme transglutaminase, involved in gluten reactions, as a link between the gut and skin. He also notes that fibroids, progesterone, and pregnenolone can be helpful, with pregnenolone potentially reducing stress reactions that exacerbate skin issues.
