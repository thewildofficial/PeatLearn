**RAY PEAT:** "Biologists think they have a philosophy of science, but it's pretty rudimentary mechanistic, mechanical materialism, usually."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to define "mechanical materialism."

**RAY PEAT:** "Mechanistic materialism makes a clear distinction between mind and matter and for them matter is necessarily unconscious and stupid because intelligence exists only in their realm of mind or idealist philosophy."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to elaborate on the distinction between mind and matter in mechanistic materialism.

**RAY PEAT:** "As a little kid, I was a migrainer periodically. Combination of digestive and visually affected headaches and when I was ten, one of the naturopathic doctors prescribed a bag of an herb to make a tea out of that was supposed to affect the migraine syndrome and years later I discovered that from the taste of it, it had been marijuana, but it didn't help at all."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about his childhood health challenges and how they shaped his viewpoint.

**RAY PEAT:** "They were the original doctors and the modern type of allopathic doctor who was just one strand, one ideology of medicine and there were all kinds of ideologies up until the American Medical Association defined one strand of medicine."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the historical context of naturopaths.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of the homeopathic tradition still has some of that thinking in terms of personality types that are very similar to the old humor medicine."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between osteopathy and other medical traditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Greek medical tradition was pretty empirical with two main branches of it, but it was just a rational attempt to be understanding the organism biologically."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the Greek medical tradition.

**RAY PEAT:** "Different strands of biological information were being integrated into the different theories so that people started thinking about the cells making up the organs. Some of the interactions of the organs, late in the 19th century, they were realizing that the sugar was secreted by the liver to maintain a steady internal environment."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how doctors assessed health before modern blood tests.

**RAY PEAT:** "For example, they used to taste the urine to see if a person was diabetic. There were many ideas about what you could diagnose by smell, including diabetes and cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about diagnostic methods used by doctors in the past.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most of his time talking to people, and that, he considered his primary job. He did treat them if they needed it, but he was definitely an old-school doctor."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the importance of patient interaction in diagnosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "The attitude towards matter that exists still throughout the medical profession and biology in general is basically a religious belief about matter. It is something very separate from science. It's a religious exclusion of spirit, mind and intelligence from whatever they consider matter and so an organ or an organism or a material object can't have in itself mentality, spirit, intelligence and so on."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on attributing intelligence to non-material beings versus matter.

**RAY PEAT:** "He showed that plants showed a reactive physical response to practically any stimulation, especially harmful stimulation. And... He then, after designing instruments that would record in a very clear way the reactions of plant tissue to stimulation, he applied the same thing to objects such as metal and minerals, and showed the same... properties of sensitivity, reaction, learning, or adaptation applied to all of the levels of existence, mineral, plant, animal, as well as human."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about J.C. Bose's biological experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** "And that didn't work. It didn't fit into the way western nerve biology was developing, but scientifically it was actually more soundly based than the way the English and French and German biologists were thinking about how nerves work."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the reception of Bose's work in Western biology.

**RAY PEAT:** "A five-year-old, I think. Was there any purpose given? Entertaining the doctor and impressing the patients. That was a very popular toy around 1940 or so. And it was in a doctor's office."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's experience with a fluoroscope at age five.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I was reading, I think because of the atomic bomb, I started reading about radiation and it was already in the underground culture. The biological effects of medical x-rays was already coming out as a very unwise thing to do, but the medical profession was hardly getting started."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks when Dr. Peat realized the danger of x-rays.

**RAY PEAT:** "People that I knew in college about 10 years after they had had the treatment for acne, for example, some of their skulls had begun collapsing, their sinuses collapsed, so that their faces were deformed. That was still being done in the 1950s."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the continued use of x-rays for acne treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you say that they were killing people in Utah by the fallout from the bombs, you were probably a communist and a pervert. People who worked for the government immediately would lose their jobs and be smeared by some morals charge or political affiliation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the political climate surrounding criticism of radiation and atomic bomb tests.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you want to turn off stress hormones, should you err on the possibility of overeating until you're stable with temps and pulses. Sugar is the single most immediately effective food for stopping stress. Sometimes salt, so a food with mixed components but including enough sodium and glucose or fructose will stop some of the worst stress hormones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about managing stress hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you lose too fast, that is going to cause damage by oxidative decomposition of the unsaturated fats as they are being oxidized at a higher rate. So I think a slow... weight loss is the best thing, and having enough protein and minerals in your diet during weight loss can make a tremendous difference in the amount of stress."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if losing excess weight helps with stability.

**RAY PEAT:** "The definition of hormone has changed a lot but in the last 30 or 40 years so that the classical definitions hardly apply anymore. Things have become a lot subtler and more complicated but it's good to look at one of the classical textbooks of endocrinology just to......to see the framework of even how complex it was 50 or 100 years ago."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a source of information about hormone function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hans Selye did something called the Encyclopedia of Endocrinology in the 1940s. His work was very influential for my thinking on endocrinology. He very early showed the dangers of estrogen and the protective effects of progesterone and pregnenolone."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a source of information about hormone function.

**RAY PEAT:** "I was near sighted and I noticed that the only other kids in my school who were near sighted were girls and a couple of them also were migrainers and that got me thinking why are more girls near sighted and subject to migraine headaches so that started me. is looking in general at people in terms of their hormones and their health symptoms and such. So I was already thinking along the lines of the suppressive effects of estrogen on metabolism, blood sugar regulation and thyroid function in my early teens."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how his observations about nearsightedness and migraines led him to consider hormonal influences.

**RAY PEAT:** "It happened that I had a couple of quarts of ice cream in the fridge and realizing that I hadn't been eating enough, I ate a quart of ice cream as fast as I could when the blind spots were already starting to flash and found that they turned right off as I absorbed the ice cream."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes his personal intervention for migraines.

**RAY PEAT:** "He found that the intestine was... involved in a very high percentage of headaches. He wanted to disprove the idea that headaches are caused by toxins. He believed they were caused by pressure in the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses Walter Alvarez's theories on headaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "Russian researchers, for example, would put an inflatable balloon in the intestine. And when they would blow up the balloon, if the rabbit was in normal health, nothing would happen. But if the rabbit had low blood sugar, blowing up the balloon would cause... all kinds of symptoms, including epileptic seizures."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains research on intestinal pressure and blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "The carrot would apparently do multiple things. Absorb toxins or speed along the elimination of toxins and prevent pressure and chemical irritation. So you could work on either side of it, keeping the blood sugar up. or eliminating or reducing the irritation to the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the potential mechanisms of raw carrots in alleviating headaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "My awareness of it started around the late 1940s when some of my fat friends in school told me that they had previously been told that they had a glandular problem and had been given thyroid. But with the new......medical science in the late 40s, they discovered that they were just gluttons and ate too much."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the shift in medical understanding regarding weight and thyroid issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "So this the chemical pharmaceutical industry displaced the meat industry based on an Armour product because it was more scientific and exact. It was a single hormone rather than a dehydrated gland and combined with the protein-bound iodine blood test that really ruined the health of the country by failing to give thyroid to nearly everyone who needed it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how the pharmaceutical industry influenced thyroid treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** "And in women, it neglected to test the comparison between armor thyroid and synthetic thyroxin but it happens that when the liver is very sluggish, the thyroxin isn't turned to the active hormone but it does suppress the pituitary, the pituitary senses the presence of thyroid hormone and stops stimulating the gland so if the liver isn't converting it to the active hormone, gland is going to decrease its production because the T4 thyroxin is accumulating."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the specific issues with synthetic thyroxine in women.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the frequent. Event throughout the 1950s and 60s was that women would actually be made worse by turning off their remaining thyroid function by dosing them with this synthetic inappropriate drug which had been tested on young healthy men whose livers were able to turn into the active hormone."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the negative consequences of synthetic thyroxine for women.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the concept had been built into the profession that... only 5% of people are really biologically lacking thyroid function. So they devised new tests and standardized the new test on the same population framework that the meaningless test had created. So now they said, we know that... 5% of the people are going to be hypothyroid, so let's adjust our new sensitive tests to fit that old concept."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how flawed testing methodologies perpetuated incorrect assumptions about thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yeah, the drug industry controls the world. It was obvious in the way both the... the protein-bound iodine test and the synthetic thyroxine, how they took over the mind of medicine."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat attributes the medical establishment's errors to the influence of the drug industry.

**RAY PEAT:** "They decided with a conspiracy of, I think it was 12 or 13 big corporations with an estrogen product, they decided to get the FDA in line and get the population in line with mass media. Public relations and journal articles and pressure on the FDA to sell the idea that estrogen was a fertility-promoting medicine rather than a sterility-promoter."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the pharmaceutical industry's manipulation of information regarding estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "Meditation in the sense of watching your own consciousness, being mindful of your body and of the world in general and how they interact. I think everyone should always be doing that. practicing awareness and yeah and especially the interactions so you you can see what your needs are and not confuse them with what's really happening in reality by being aware of yourself and the world you can avoid confusing the two."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the benefits of mindfulness and self-awareness.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Russian physiologist... Pavlov's... students devised a way of explaining how reflexes work in terms of what he called the acceptor of action... which is essentially a model of the world that is built in our consciousness and we adjust that according to the results of our senses and interaction with the world."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the concept of the "acceptor of action" in reflexology.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I haven't heard anything from any government official that makes sense. And I think there are quite a few possible explanations that any of several of them are more plausible than the government story."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the plausibility of the US government's explanation for the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on 9/11.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's one of the adaptive hormones but it has some stress related responses so I don't see it as the happiness. And euphoria hormone, it can go up under stress too and its effects aren't all good. It's sort of like the parasympathetic system is a good relief to the sympathetic and anxiety related system but you don't want to go too far in that direction."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the functions of oxytocin and its relationship with metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "All of the pituitary hormones are... pretty expendable as long as you keep your thyroid working. Several researchers removed pituitaries and gave thyroid, sometimes cortisol, and found that the animals were healthier without their pituitaries and so they were losing their oxytocin and... all of the pituitary hormones went when they removed the gland. But the animals, if they were given thyroid, could live even longer than normal."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the role of the pituitary gland and the importance of thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you keep working on it, it tends to be gradual. When you are lucky and hit the missing thing on the first try, you can see things in an hour or less go from miserable to perfect. But if you don't happen to hit on the one missing factor, then it can involve... a very slow repair of many systems."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat offers advice to those struggling with slow healing.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've seen people with crippling arthritis immediately and overnight or within an hour sometimes their joint becomes painless and works where it had been crunching and popping."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides an example of rapid healing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Currently, I've been thinking about the importance of carbon monoxide in our endogenous regulatory processes. For about 20 years, I've been talking about the importance of keeping your carbon dioxide up, but one of the things that everything I've been talking about, getting enough bright light, thyroid, drinking coffee, eating fruit, and keeping your carbon dioxide up, one thing that is acted on in the same direction by all of those is carbon monoxide, and when we're under stress, we produce that, and these helpful factors help to get rid of it or to decrease its production under stress."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses his current research interests, focusing on carbon monoxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "And when the stress is simply enough, for example, the monthly cycles or the daily cycles that cause our pituitary, to become active cyclically, more or less, the ups and downs of ACTH and thyroid-stimulating hormone and oxytocin and so on. All of the pituitary hormones are acting, at least partly, by way of increasing carbon monoxide production where they're acting on the gland. end tissue."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the connection between pituitary hormones and carbon monoxide production.

**RAY PEAT:** "And that seems to be one of the reasons why removing the pituitary gland in these experimental animals had such beneficial effects because of the harmful age-advancing effects of the endogenous carbon monoxide."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the potential benefits of pituitary removal in relation to carbon monoxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "The health of your other organs influences the shape of the deterioration of your nervous system The amount of clotting material, for example, is probably higher or at least more unstable in multiple sclerosis. They find clots tend to associate with the plaques or the inflamed areas in multiple sclerosis, and the clotting of fibrin deposits aren't the......factor in Alzheimer's plaques, but it does relate to the clotting system."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why certain diseases present as they do, specifically Alzheimer's versus Multiple Sclerosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's sort of the opposite process in multiple sclerosis where the clot seems to start the process, the fibrin deposits, breaks down, releases inflammatory material and starts an inflammation in that clotted area, where with Alzheimer's the capillaries get leaky, produce a micro hemorrhage... some heme or hemoglobin leaks out and an enzyme that clears away the heme or hemoglobin is the enzyme that forms carbon monoxide and this enzyme is known to be associated with amyloid plaques so it's basically a blood vessel leaky problem being being handled in opposite from the opposite sides and each type of degeneration has its own ways of working trying to correct a problem and failing to do it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the differing mechanisms in Alzheimer's and Multiple Sclerosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "A cancer develops possibly starting with the same leakage of blood vessels and hemoglobin possibly leading to increased deposition of connective tissue and collagen producing an atrophied area and within that area of atrophy cells can convert themselves to live without the ordinary support of the environment because of the deranged connective tissue. The chronic stress and irritation has produced."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the potential origins of cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "But basically it's the organism problem starting first, then mutations occur because of the stress on the tissue because of the failure of the organism's support system."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat emphasizes the organism's overall health as a precursor to mutations.

**RAY PEAT:** "And there is a sort of momentum in the whole physiological pattern that can pass on from generation to generation in a way of expressing the genes, so even the definition of what a genetic defect is is. The influence of the environment on the parent can affect the methylation of the genes, and that can affect their tendency to be expressed or not."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses how environmental influences can affect gene expression across generations.

**RAY PEAT:** "So I think a teacher's function should be essentially criticism of the cultural stereotypes that the students are confronted with. And showing the student how to go about criticizing the things that they are going to be constantly confronted with."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat defines the role of a teacher.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well, the more alive you are, the more energy is running through you. When an egg is fertilized, it, as soon as it gets itself going, it... starts a tremendous increase in oxygen consumption. And from then until, if you measure the oxygen per gram of weight, the oxygen consumption decreases for the rest of your life."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why comparing basal metabolic rate to caloric intake is useful.

**RAY PEAT:** "The more alive you are, the more energy is running through you. When an egg is fertilized, it, as soon as it gets itself going, it... starts a tremendous increase in oxygen consumption. And from then until, if you measure the oxygen per gram of weight, the oxygen consumption decreases for the rest of your life. From puberty to old age. Oxygen consumption decreases by about 70% unless you intervene with controlling the inflammatory hormones and supporting thyroid function."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why comparing basal metabolic rate to caloric intake is useful.

**RAY PEAT:** "The famous G.W. Crile and his wife. They went around the world with basal metabolic apparatus and they found that everyone in very different cultures, from the Eskimos to tropical people in Africa and Central America, their basal metabolic rates were about 30% higher than the average Americans and their diets were tremendously different, mostly meat in the Eskimos in the cold environment and mostly starchy foods in the tropics in a very hot environment, but still they were metabolizing, burning about 30% more. oxygen than the average American and that he took to be an indication of a very generalized hypothyroidism."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses G.W. Crile's research on metabolic rates in different cultures.

**RAY PEAT:** "He showed that a crocodile at rest consumed, it could weigh several hundred pounds but it would consume only as much oxygen as a cat at rest and he showed that their brains were the same size and so he believed that the brain represented the basal metabolic rate. and basically how alive you were."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains G.W. Crile's findings on the relationship between brain size and metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "One that I suppose is satisfying and fits into the rest of your life."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what constitutes a healthy libido.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it does reflect a low blood pressure. It doesn't always mean that there's any problem other than you could be more productive if you were producing more energy and needed more blood circulation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if chronically low blood pressure indicates an underlying physiological problem.

**RAY PEAT:** "Because then I would feel like I was being boiled. Oh, you get too hot, I see. Yeah, just sitting at rest I would be sweating furiously."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why he couldn't take his usual amount of thyroid in humid heat.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think when I was about six months old."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks when Dr. Peat's digestive problems started.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think probably my mother's hypothyroidism contributed."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat attributes his digestive issues to his mother's hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The whole history and the balance of your different organs, some people have stronger... body parts, different shapes, different lengths of intestine and so on. The whole balance influences each part."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why some people can eat anything without ill effects while others are sensitive.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think they believe that it indicates that you still have some parts of the prostate, some prostate cells lodged in other parts of your body. When you measure that antigen in women, it doesn't mean that they have prostate cancer. That antigen is found in women and it varies. It rises when their estrogen is high and maybe it would have some correspondence to risk of breast cancer or something. It doesn't really mean as much as the medical people think."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why PSA is tested even after prostate removal.

**RAY PEAT:** "Prostate Specific Androgen. Okay. But they find the same androgen in women who don't have a prostate, so it's not accurately named."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what PSA stands for.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've seen topical progesterone work almost instantly. A pimple would be forming a red lump and would regress as soon as they put progesterone on it. But it usually involves a bacterial infection and the immune system is reacting badly. I'm not simply getting rid of the bacteria but producing an inflammation and so there are several things involved but vitamin A and thyroid function are two that are essential for the differentiation of the cells in the skin and the follicle structure and oil glands and such and the thyroid. It regulates the hormones but the skin is a major source of steroid hormone synthesis and the thyroid and vitamin A are partly acting to maintain a healthy steroid hormone turnover."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the causes and cures for acne, including topical progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "And it's always good to keep in mind the bacteria that like to live on oily, moist skin."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat mentions the role of bacteria in acne.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know if it happens. Partly Alzheimer's I think is not consistently diagnosed. Sometimes just people who get to be 90 or 95 aren't very attentive to current events and get diagnosed with Alzheimer's when they might not have all of the diagnostic features that a person who is 35 would have."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why people with Alzheimer's tend not to get cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the starch, slightly more than sucrose, triggers insulin and... the insulin tends to lead to increased cortisol production, and cortisol can raise your body temperature, but that isn't the kind of increased metabolism that is generally helpful, but it can warm you up by a kind of stress reaction."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why calorie-dense meals like pancakes warm them up more than liquids like orange juice.

**RAY PEAT:** "That means that their nighttime stress hormones, especially cortisol, were responsible for... keeping the metabolic rate and heat production up, but that tends to lead to long range problems where if you cycled your heat production down during the night and up during the day, that would lead to longer range benefit."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the difference between stress-induced warmth and beneficial metabolic heat production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Testosterone and DHEA... Thyroid and so on are all part of the good sexual energy, and there's no reason why those should drop off at any particular age."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about maintaining a healthy sex life without aids like Viagra.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's not harmful because it acts......largely by increasing nitric oxide and carbon monoxide and those have lots of harmful effects."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat comments on the effects of drugs like Viagra.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, that's the result of some medical people who had a mechanical way of thinking about input and output. But for at least 50 years, it's been known that parathyroid hormone......increases when you're deficient in calcium and vitamin D and possibly other factors, but especially parathyroid hormone increases as your need for calcium increases. And if you aren't eating enough calcium and vitamin D, your parathyroid hormone will take calcium out of your bones. And when it does that, it's putting it into your soft tissues contributing to hardened arteries and kidneys and even the brain can calcify."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the misconception about excessive calcium intake and its link to calcification.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the prevention is to get enough of the nutrients such as vitamin D and vitamin K that regulate calcium, not get too much phosphate. But to get plenty of calcium and keep your parathyroid hormone and prolactin and cortisol down by a good intake of these protective anti-stress nutrients and in fact the surest way to calcify your arteries and kidneys is to be a... a calcium avoider."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how to prevent calcification and the role of calcium avoidance.

**RAY PEAT:** "And for kidney stones in particular a good balanced diet will make the urine not release the calcium crystals. Keeping the right pH of the urine and not not having a proteins leak out into the urine will prevent the crystallization so you can pour out lots of calcium through your urine if you're eating a lot of calcium but it doesn't calcify, it passes out in solution and when your vitamin D and vitamin K are adequate and your parathyroid hormone is low your arteries aren't going to take up. Calcium."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how a balanced diet and adequate nutrients prevent kidney stones and arterial calcification.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think with x-rays that's often the case. They have to keep their... equipment busy if it isn't paid for. They want to keep an income so they can get a new machine when this one's paid off. A lot of the testing is done to prevent lawsuits."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the economic and legal motivations behind unnecessary medical testing.

**RAY PEAT:** "The best safest long-range things are the indigestible but antiseptic fibers of raw carrot or bamboo shoots, cooked bamboo shoots happen to be not in themselves digestible but to contain antibiotic substances that help to suppress bacteria and the whole small intestine in a very healthy person is sterile, the more active you're digestive fluids and enzymes are, the more sterile your small intestine will be, the more sluggish your metabolism, low thyroid function, the more likely you are to have bacteria living far up towards your stomach in the small intestine and so stimulating the intestine with something like raw carrot or bamboo shoots. It helps, but keeping your metabolic rate up is the basic thing so that your digestive fluids are killing off or preventing the growth of the bacteria."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the dangers of antibiotics and how to maintain gut health.
