**RAY PEAT:** I still am not convinced that anything special is happening. Did we talk about the German virologist Wolfgang Wodarg? No, we didn't. We didn't yet. Well, he is one well-known expert in pulmonology and viruses and as of the last time I checked on his website he still wasn't convinced that anything different from previous years is happening. He showed that in previous years from 5 to 15 percent. The lung infectious disease was caused by some type of coronavirus, and so far this one hasn't really been proven to either be much more virulent or much more infectious, but that is yet to be determined. But they've jumped to the conclusion that it is both more harmful and spreads faster. But you can't find that in the evidence according to Vodark. And another German well-known pulmonologist and virologist named Bhakti, sounds like a Hindu name, B.A. Khti, I think it is, says similar things. He says that the country is causing very considerable damage economically and harming especially older people by the measures they're introducing without any real evidence that anything special is happening. And another well-known, mostly epidemiologist, John Ioannidis, has various positions at Stanford. He says this might be one of history's greatest evidence fiascos because there are... talking about just fragments of evidence and drawing huge conclusions and then taking unprecedented political economic actions against no clear scientific evidence.
**CONTEXT:** What is your take on the current situation regarding the coronavirus pandemic and the measures being taken?

**RAY PEAT:** Wolfgang Wodarg, last name W-O-D-A-R-G. And I think the second guy's last name is spelled B-A-K-H-P-I. And then you said the guy at Stanford, John, you... You want to do I-O-A-M-M-I-D-I-S.
**CONTEXT:** Could you spell the names of the German epidemiologists and pulmonologists you mentioned?

**RAY PEAT:** I've always been considered crazy for pointing out that Trump, in many ways, has been less harmful than the so-called progressives like Obama. Withdrawing from wars, for example, I think I'm inclined to see his reluctance to go ahead with the war on the virus as another virtue, even though everyone considers that crazy. The Pentagon wanted to go back into Iraq heavily in retaliation. against a couple of soldiers getting killed and to use the virus as an excuse, an argument against renewing the war in Iraq. So even though he's been being criticized again for everything he does against the grain, so far I think he's justified by the evidence.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the Trump administration's approach to the pandemic, particularly in contrast to previous administrations?

**RAY PEAT:** I saw a little video from a hospital in Bergamo. It looked like they were stuffing people in the oxygen tents and putting oxygen masks on them. And if people come in with a minor respiratory ailment and they're 70 or 80 or 90 years old, they get put into a pure oxygen atmosphere. That's exactly the wrong thing to do, but it's what almost all the hospitals in the world are doing, thinking they need oxygen, they're having trouble breathing, so give them pure oxygen. But carbon dioxide is anti-inflammatory, and when you give them pure oxygen five times more than normal, you're tremendously displacing the natural......balance of carbon dioxide, which is the anti-inflammatory stuff in our breasts. Several good research projects have found that if you hypoventilate people who are having some problem in the hospital, like surgery, a slight hypoventilation to let the CO2 build up. It reduces inflammation and produces much better outcomes overall because inflammation is such a pathogen in any kind of sickness. And especially in this particular virus infection or any lung infection, the symptoms are basically inflammatory. The angiotensin system, the interferon system, which turns on other inflammatory agents, histamine, all of the defensive reactions triggered by these respiratory infections amplify inflammation and that causes the congestion, constriction, swelling, swelling, swelling, swelling, swelling. exudation of serum into the lungs instead of a balanced moisture economy in the lungs. The serum and proteins in the blood ooze out into the lung space and interfere with breathing. But anything you do to increase inflammation is going to increase that. Pneumonia tendency and general sickness. So oxygen and many of the virus cycle chemicals they're giving greatly intensify inflammation. That's one of the reasons old people are so susceptible. Where different studies say about 85 percent. Of the infected proven infected people have almost no symptoms of infection. The main ones who react badly and get very sick or die are mostly the very old people who already have some kind of degenerative circulatory or inflammatory. Kind of disease, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and so on. The changes of aging that cause the circulatory problems are essentially overactivity of the immune system. Sort of a variation on the autoimmune theme. But it's a general tissue degenerative process. It exaggerates the inflammatory processes. And in one study where they gave a given type of coronavirus, they were intending to produce common cold symptoms. And they put this stuff into volunteers' noses. And they found that... the people with pre-existing inflammatory problems were the ones that reacted more seriously to the virus. And mice, studies in mice, they find that the given virus does very little damage to the young animals. The older the animal is, the more mature the immune system, the more harmful. So in this situation, the so-called immune defenses are really the instrument by which the virus is damaging the organism. So it's the reaction of the organism to the virus. To the virus. Yeah. Yeah, the successful virus which these are. Succeeds by, if possible, becoming, causing something like chronic diarrhea and a chronic cough. If the person stays well enough to go around living normally, but coughing, that's good for the virus to spread. So a successful virus doesn't kill. Many of its infected hosts, it causes them to spread the virus.
**CONTEXT:** What is your take on the triage situation in Italy, where older individuals are not being given ventilators, and the use of pure oxygen in hospitals?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I think you said the cost now is $50 billion, $4.5 billion a year just for vaccines for children. Yeah. Yeah, that's stupendous. And maybe not that effective. How do you rate their efficacy? Since they're stupidly used, trying to vaccinate the whole world rather than closing in on the virus, when you have an outbreak at Disney World, for example, you can... track those people and vaccinate everyone around them and a thousand people for everyone vaccinated will have avoided the vaccine. And the vaccines have a consistent and predictable rate of damage and harm. Mortality, paralysis, brain damage, autism is... one of the outcomes, but no one really denies... the government pays at least a proportion of the people they harm. They acknowledge that they're doing harm. But instead of intelligently reducing the number of people given the vaccine, they prefer to... pay for a stupid use of vaccines that otherwise could be effective.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the efficacy and safety of vaccines, particularly in the context of the current pandemic and past experiences like the swine flu?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when it's an organism that doesn't change faster than the vaccine can be produced. Smallpox was probably the best example of a vaccine being able to totally... abolish a disease when it's used intelligently. They would identify where the outbreaks were and then form a ring of vaccinated people around those outbreaks and let the disease run its course inside that ring and repeatedly doing that, they closed in. Eradicated the vaccine from nature. Because that particular disease, was that a virus, smallpox? Yeah, yeah. So it just didn't mutate quickly so they could get a handle on it. Yeah, and I think other diseases are probably slow enough to change that they could be treated similarly if... the effort were made, they could close in on them and eliminate them for a relatively small price. The cost for the eliminating smallpox on the world scale was microscopic compared to the annual expense on measles and the standard array of vaccines that kids are getting. In the United States and most other countries, the cost alone is enough to lead to a more intelligent policy.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that some vaccines can be useful. Can you elaborate on historical examples of successful vaccine use?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, after using aluminum hydroxide to produce that general inflammatory reaction that revs up your ability to produce antibodies, after using that for generations, it's gradually becoming recognized by the people suing the government for brain damage and death and so on. It is. developing a bad reputation, so they're looking for new adjuvants, things that will do just as much inflammatory damage, but that doesn't, things that don't yet have the bad reputation that aluminum hydroxide does, but the same thing will occur with these lipid-based nanoparticles of lipids. used as antigens after another 50 years, those will develop a bad reputation.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the adjuvants used in vaccines and their potential for harm?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's probably a major, if not the only, motor of the aging process is the accumulated... damage done by interacting with irritating, stressful parts of the environment. Your body changes with every encounter. And the more of an adjuvant function that the environment imposes on your body, the bigger the reaction it forces you to make, the greater the change in your life course is. We're in a constantly revising process as we develop and age. And these systemic reactions for every encounter, foods we eat and digest and assimilate properly, even those are adding to. is to deliberately accelerate the process of aging and degenerating.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the relationship between adjuvants and the aging process?

**RAY PEAT:** These smallpox vaccine all by itself is irritating enough It doesn't doesn't need an adjunct and he he weakened his just by reasoning He weak reasoned that If he could weaken the deadly something, they didn't know any idea of what viruses were at that time, but if he could weaken this nasty material, he'd put it in smoke, he would take pus or scab from a person with smallpox, and smoke it for a while, and then pack it under... I forget what kind of leaves he covered it with, and a layer of camphor, and then buried it for years, letting chemical processes happen. This was in the 1700s, so almost nothing was known about how chemistry works, but he intuited that he was doing something to weaken and change the agent. And then he would introduce it into the skin not into the muscle or under the skin but he had a very fine tool he made that would split the skin so it went into the living material but didn't reach the blood. And all of his people... were made immune. He vaccinated thousands. None of them died from the vaccine as they would have from a modern vaccine.
**CONTEXT:** Can you describe Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccination method and how it differed from modern approaches?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the last 10 years or so, a few......alternative doctors were practicing it 30 or 40 years ago, rubbing it into the skin gently, rather than injecting it, but experiments now in the last 10 years show that when you take a particular antigen and either take it by inhalation or ingestion or rubbing it into the skin or injecting it carefully......intradermally, that the systemic results are absolutely different from when you inject it into the blood or into the muscle or even under the skin. The immune system is designed to react in a maximally appropriate way when things get rubbed into the skin or inhaled or eaten. When you bypass those normal routes of infection, we don't have an evolved immune system for proper reactions to needle injections in the muscles. The whole thing about using needles seems to have been a matter of professionalism. In the 1800s, doctors were the only ones who could. have access to needles and syringes. They were technologically beyond the public. And so they created or claimed to have a monopoly on what they said was the most effective way for giving medication instead of the crude, old-fashioned way of having people either inhale the medicine, they would give it by needle into your muscle or directly into your bloodstream. There never was any valid scientific basis for giving medications by injection.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between dermal application of antigens and injection, and why is injection considered less natural?

**RAY PEAT:** The reaction is more organized. What they get from the injected reaction is largely a reaction to the tissue damage leading to autoimmune type reactions. More reactions against your tissues than against the antigen, but in the process, the antigen can be taken down by these specific antibodies. That whole antibody theory of immunity is essentially a superstructure built on ignorance of how the immune system works. That's the antibody theory. Came about more than 100 years ago with the lock and key idea of Paul Ehrlich, which was a way to sell chemical drugs by arguing that he would have a specific chemical for the specific lock, the chemical key was so specific that... a particular drug would cure it and the antibody became the model for the equivalent of a specific drug cure and the antibody based immune theory has been given a series of Nobel Prizes at the end of the last century. But since then, most of the knowledge of the real immune system, the innate immune system is intricable. They used to say that only the antibody system was a real adaptive process but they simply weren't looking at the other tissue levels.
**CONTEXT:** How does the immune system's reaction to injected antigens differ from its reaction to antigens encountered through natural routes, and what is the significance of the antibody theory of immunity?

**RAY PEAT:** Making people healthy, exposing them to fewer vaccines as they grow up is, I think, a very important part of it. Allergic people are known to be the ones who react the worst to the coronaviruses. The degenerative or autoimmune changes that happen with aging make a person more susceptible to harm from the... otherwise mild coronaviruses but just being allergic or already having an activated interferon system makes you more susceptible. So the person who can have an abundant energetic metabolism but without......a lot of inflammatory experiences can produce the most organized and almost unnoticed rejection of the infection. 80% of the people who don't know that they're infected with this particular coronavirus. They are the ones with a good immune system. They don't react noticeably.
**CONTEXT:** How can we strengthen our innate immune system to better combat viruses like the coronavirus?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the main things that the interferon system does is to activate the production of nitric oxide, which in vitro is a very good virus killer. It's a pre-radical that will destroy just about anything. But in vivo, there have been comparisons with the coronavirus. The nerve infection is a major target of some coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses as an alternate target causing encephalitis. And in experimental infections... with nerve-targeted coronaviruses, they find that blocking interferon's production of nitric oxide prevents death of the animal. And it's specifically the interferon production of nitric oxide that's killing them. I think analogous things are probably happening. It does kill the virus but it also helps kill the host and same with serotonin. Serotonin is produced by any inflammation and blocking the effects of serotonin. For example, the Chinese are using Sinanserin, a serotonin blocker, as one of their... tools against the coronavirus.
**CONTEXT:** How do the interferon and histamine systems interact with the coronavirus, and what is the role of nitric oxide and serotonin in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Serotonin is talking about the veins tightening up and so does the angiotensin is the same thing.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned serotonin and angiotensin. What is their purpose in a healthy creature?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, the tightening of some of the circulatory system helps to raise the pressure and get more blood to an area of where the problem is. So it's just one of many emergency functions. And in general I think it's appropriate to think of these inflammatory things as wound healing agents. If you have a hole punched in you, these are very appropriate for making the organism direct its healing efforts to the place where the wound is and accelerating the cell growth. And attracting cells to the area to repair it. But when you have them spreading out from your lungs, for example, into the whole organism, the whole organism is suffering because that particular type of repair system can be so damaging when it... takes place in the lungs.
**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the emergency functions of circulatory system tightening and inflammatory responses?

**RAY PEAT:** It tends to be...any injury causes it to be released and the experiments with coronavirus....show that it sensitizes the tissues to histamine, so any injury that's releasing histamine becomes more harmful in the presence of the virus. Estrogen is something in the background of all of these, and endotensin... breathing... increases, activates aromatase to make estrogen, so estrogen is coming up in the background of any of these injuries and stress, and estrogen increases production, attracts mast cells that make histamine, and activates its release, and that intensifies the exudation of fluid into the lungs, for example.
**CONTEXT:** How does histamine contribute to the inflammatory response in coronavirus infections?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, first, the renin enzyme is one of the starting things. And angiotensinogen, stress, and things like estrogen make the liver produce more angiotensinogen, which is a protein cleaved by renin, the enzyme largely from the kidney. And the product of this is called angiotensin 1, and then an enzyme ACE, angiotensin converting angiotensin into angiotensin. Enzyme number one produces angiotensin 2, acting on the product of the renin. And angiotensin 2 is the one we commonly think of as angiotensin. It leads to all of these inflammatory things, and the enzyme ACE2 is it. I think its main function is to destroy ndrotensin or ndrotensin 2.
**CONTEXT:** Can you briefly describe the renin-angiotensin cycle and how it relates to inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and so the coronavirus attaches to and inactivates ACE2 leaving ACE1 producing ndrotensin and its inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** How does the coronavirus interact with the ACE2 enzyme in the renin-angiotensin cycle?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, they now know in detail how it attaches and changes that protein. In my mind that begs the question of how come young people are not affected by the coronavirus since they have more ACE2? Yes, if you have enough of it. It outweighs whatever the virus does. A healthy young person can sacrifice some of their ACE2 to the virus without succumbing to the symptoms. I see. So they can show the infection, but they still have the anti-inflammatory ACE2 in reserve because things, all of the... components of good health, it seems, vitamin B1, progesterone, aspirin, a lot of good things help to keep your ACE2 up.
**CONTEXT:** If ACE2 is the entry point for the coronavirus, why are young people with more ACE2 not more severely affected?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the healthy young person without too many vaccinations has an immune system that reacts correctly and doesn't bother with getting to the antibody stage. But there has been a kind of underground gradually gaining recognition in the immunity field. Jamie Cunliffe in England and Polly Matzinger, I think she has worked her whole career at NIH in this country and they have the danger theory of immunity or the damage theory is Cunliffe's terminology. Thank you for joining us. In which the immune system, in their view, isn't on the outlook for so-called pathogens. The antibody theory is based on the idea that we form a picture of the evil germs and then create antibodies specific to that image of evil. Sounds familiar. That's familiar. In this other picture of immunity, the organism has a picture of itself that it wants to preserve. It knows what it is and where its parts should be. And when it experiences damage, I think that's a better terminology than Matzinger's danger, the damage. It is recognized because the organism knows itself and knows when part of it is out of place. When an organism does damage, what is recognized is the damage. And in the process of correcting the damage, the pathogenic cause of the damage tends to be......recognized and eliminated. But the emphasis is put on maintaining or restoring the image of the body rather than learning images of potential invaders.
**CONTEXT:** What is your interpretation of findings that some COVID-19 patients recover without neutralizing antibodies, and what is the role of neutralizing antibodies in immunity?

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that's a more realistic approach. About 20 years ago, someone was studying... an encephalitis virus and they were aware that a specific brain antibody was formed and people were thinking of that antibody as an autoimmune perpetuator of the encephalitis condition. But in this experiment... They suppressed the production of that specific antibody and found that the animal proceeded to die, got much worse when the antibody was removed. And they found that the antibody was serving the purpose of repairing the brain, not causing the damage. And... That is the view of Cunliffe and Matsinger, that the immune system is there to repair the damage. And if you have autoimmunity, it's because something is prolonging the repair process. You want to give it more energy to complete the repair, rather than trying to poison the... the system that makes the autoimmune antibodies.
**CONTEXT:** How does the "damage theory" of immunity, as proposed by Cunliffe and Matzinger, explain the role of antibodies in conditions like encephalitis?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, maybe indirectly, but some people say that as much as 50 percent of our genome might be retro elements. So when you stir up damage like poisoning the liver, for example. You release thousands of things that can be identified as like a retrovirus. So if you look for a particular virus-like particle in a stressed organism, it looks like you found the agent. But really it's probably one of the repair processes. Barbara McClintock showed that we can move genes around under stress. Stress causes the mobility of genetic elements to increase. And these retro components seem to be emergency spare parts that you don't see unless you're under severe stress.
**CONTEXT:** How might retroviruses relate to the concept of the immune system as a repair mechanism?

**RAY PEAT:** I would have to read the article, but my first guess would be that the interferon... and TNF were... Did the question say that they were increased or decreased? They were lower in the severe group than in the mild group. I'm not sure how to interpret that. Apparently something has killed a part of the T cell repertoire and I would have to look at it closely to figure it out.
**CONTEXT:** Can you offer an interpretation of findings that show lower levels of interferon and T cells in severe COVID-19 cases, and comment on the effects of aspirin in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** It'll be a good excuse for suppressing them more actively. Yeah, and I think it'll raise the peer pressure from the scared public to actually introduce vaccines for this sort of thing. And the Internet is being biased against... them communicating with each other and the public.
**CONTEXT:** Do you believe the coronavirus outbreak is a reaction to the anti-vaxx movement, and how might it impact public perception of vaccines?

**RAY PEAT:** The kind of damage done by chronic exposure to that kind of radiation does weaken the basic quiet immune system and so it would predispose you to the inflammatory kind of reaction. Anything that is a chronic weakening influence.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the health risks associated with 5G and RF radiation, and how might they be triggering or suppressing the immune system in relation to the coronavirus?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that was an argument published in... Lancet Magazine against aspirin or anti-inflammatories, but I think those people just hadn't read the relevant things that, in fact, increasing ACE2 goes beyond what the virus infects and has a protective effect rather than a target effect.
**CONTEXT:** Can you clarify the confusion surrounding suggestions to decrease ACE2 expression versus increasing it, particularly in relation to treatments like losartan for coronavirus?

**RAY PEAT:** I think those that I already mentioned, progesterone, aspirin, vitamin B1, I think the antiserotonin. agents probably do that. I'm not sure.
**CONTEXT:** Besides losartan, what other substances can increase the expression of ACE2?

**RAY PEAT:** It does limit the spread of viruses, but that would be helpful in any flu season. But I think the harm done by the pressure to enforce isolation is greater than keeping the incidence of respiratory infections lower. I see. Since it doesn't seem like the contagion is that serious. So far, that's my impression.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on social isolation as a remedy for containing the virus?

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Thank you. Aspirin, as your friend said most people will not die, but as it spreads undetected without symptoms in some and only after many days in others, tens of millions of people will be exposed as it's happening. 1% of 50 million globally could mean 500,000 deaths. Add to that everyone who for other reasons needs hospitalization but could not access it as the system overloaded to keep alive the 5% who need critical care and you have additional deaths. Both diet and general health are not optimal across this planet, so look to the poorest to die in large numbers. In occurrence, the Bilderberg group types would not be concerned with. Your friend is right, this virus is similar but the novel aspects that allow it to spread and contrary to his assessment trigger an immune response that itself becomes life-threatening. It is also now killing people age 40 plus and younger if your immune systems are compromised. Lack of sleep, stress, bad diet, drugs, air pollution, which we are free to experience because of their freedoms.
**CONTEXT:** A British nurse's website presents information about the pandemic and the use of NSAIDs. What are your thoughts on this perspective?

**RAY PEAT:** The approach to killing the virus is almost, almost always worse than the result of the effect of the virus. Three of the most often mentioned antiviral remedies, chloroquine, acyclovir, and......another of the nucleoside analog types, can't think of the name right now, but these three most frequently mentioned are aimed at killing the virus by damaging its DNA or RNA, or ability to replicate RNA or DNA, and these also happen to damage human... DNA, and at the expense of mutating millions of people, there are recommendations to try to slow the virus replication, but I think that's another thing besides crashing the economy to increase the amount of poverty in the world. The damaging nutrition and increasing stress, these most frequently offered protections are really very serious harms. They actually poison you.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on common antiviral remedies and their potential harms?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they damage the gonads and the retina, for example, anywhere that... cells have to replicate and reproduce themselves, you're interfering with their DNA replication. And so you create some sickness in the individual, but also the risk of mutated descendants.
**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the specific ways antiviral drugs can damage human DNA and affect future generations?

**RAY PEAT:** That has been my personal experience. In 1956, when... Vitamin C became cheap. The tablets were 500 milligrams instead of 50. I had had good experience with the 50 milligram tablets in 1953, but I took one of the 500 milligram tablets and immediately got cold symptoms. And over the years, I had that experience until I would get bad symptoms if I would just have... two or three milligrams of the synthetic form, which at that time could be added to bacon or bread or pretzels, almost anything you wouldn't expect vitamin C to be added to. But because of my own experience, I ran into numerous other people who had similar allergy-like reactions to commercial vitamin C. I found that I could consume 4,000 milligrams a day of natural vitamin C by eating, simply eliminating grains from my diet. My intake averaged 4,000 milligrams of natural vitamin C. No problem at all, but 2 milligrams of the commercial stuff produced the reactions. And a chemist... a free radical specialist, dissolved 500 milligrams of reagent grade, the purest available ascorbic acid in a liter of repeatedly distilled water, and then put it in an ESR apparatus to measure the free radicals. And he said that that amount of vitamin C contained enough heavy metals to be able to measure the free radicals. to oxidize the vitamin C into its free radical state so that the free radical concentration was equivalent to a killing dose of X-ray. I forget, I think he said it was 60 grays of super intense dose of X-ray to produce that free radical activity in water. Wow. So. That's what you'd inadvertently get trying to be healthy and eating vitamin C.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on claims that vitamin C can increase interferon and cause a cytokine storm, and what is your personal experience with vitamin C supplementation?

**RAY PEAT:** He repeated, he analyzed the traces of heavy metals and picked out just one of numerous heavy metals present as contaminants. And just the iron alone would replicate that reaction. But the contaminants included. A variety of toxic heavy metals.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the findings regarding heavy metal contamination in vitamin C supplements and their potential effects?

**RAY PEAT:** You can also get it from meats too, right? Meats and fruit and even milk. All animals except people and guinea pigs and primates make their own. And so all of the animal foods are generously supplied with vitamin C because the animal makes it.
**CONTEXT:** Where can we obtain natural vitamin C?

**RAY PEAT:** Linus Pauling said we need 4,000 milligrams a day because that's the amount a goat or a chimpanzee would make on a body weight basis. But chimpanzees can't. They synthesize it, so they depend on getting it from their foods. And the only food they don't eat, that we eat, is grains. They eat leaves and fruits and animals, and they get this diet. The idea that we need a supplement is assuming that we live on bread and cereal and pasta.
**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended daily intake of vitamin C, and how does it relate to the diets of other animals?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin D is one of the most important. It works with thyroid progesterone and the ACE2, for example, to quiet the reactions. And calcium, keeping a high ratio of calcium to phosphate in your diet works with vitamin D and calming. The immune system, holding down the inflammatory reactions. And vitamin A, is that important? Yeah, the membranes in particular, all of our surfaces, eyes, nose, lungs, are dependent on a good vitamin A content for making proteins, largely. So, keeping those for you. The protein turnover at an ideal level.
**CONTEXT:** Besides vitamin C, what other vitamins and minerals are important for supporting the immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** No, looking at those videos that I mentioned, or websites, I think will help to... reduce the panic.
**CONTEXT:** Do you have any final messages or recommendations for people during this time?

**RAY PEAT:** You know, I just heard him recently. There's a recent video of his on the coronavirus, and I had never thought of him as someone saying anything sensible. But the only thing, I disagreed with him. In this particular interview was his saying that sugar is immunosuppressive, but everything else that he says in that interview seems okay, although normally I would consider him a borderline maniac. Oh, would you? Okay. Well, that might be an interesting listen, and I also would like to talk to you sometime about......the importance of keeping your blood sugar at an optimal level in terms of supporting one's immunity. Because I think a lot of people are talking about fasting as a way to boost their immune system.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on David Icke's recent video about the coronavirus, and do you agree with his views on sugar and immunity?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just 24 hours of fasting is enough to damage all of your functions, energy production especially. And energy is the basic thing. for maintaining your non-inflammatory immune system, your maintenance, health maintenance system.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on fasting as a way to boost the immune system?
