**RAY PEAT:** "No, no, I haven't seen any numbers that convince me that anything unusual is happening according to the virus mortality."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about the predicted mortality numbers for the coronavirus crisis.

**RAY PEAT:** "A little over a year ago, the CDC announced that the 2017 to 18 flu year would bring a Had killed at least 80,000 people but then Several months later. They revised it down to a little over 60,000 which It's interesting because it shows how wildly Approximate their estimates of the deaths are but they say that the average has been a little over 40,000 for the last 10 years or so."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat to compare current figures to a normal flu year.

**RAY PEAT:** "So they started including a broader category of illnesses and put it under the heading of flu. Yeah, that way they could get approximately 10 percent of everyone dying. Well, 6 percent on the average year was closer to everyone dying during the four months of the flu season. They could classify it as flu, but the old people, that's probably just about the normal proportion of very old people dying. They'll get respiratory problems. Their breathing and circulation are failing, and so the lungs fail to work, and so they accumulate water, and so they can put down. Pneumonia as the cause of death or respiratory problems. And when the lungs are slowing down from old age and circulatory and other diseases, the flow of mucus which normally runs up the tubes and to the area of the mouth and the mucus gets swallowed, that flow of mucus slows down. And so the bacteria that are always falling into the bronchial tubes from the air, they stay in place longer just because the cilia aren't sweeping them out quickly. And so as you're dying from heart failure, liver and lung failure and so on, the mucus allows bacteria to accumulate and so you'll......very likely have an infection, superimposed bacterial infection, on top of whatever is happening. And a viral infection also slows the cilia movement and lets the mucus and the aerial bacteria accumulate. So a typical viral infection also ends up with a bacterial infection, which the bacteria... can cause all kinds of damage and are pretty sure to kill a person off if they aren't getting anti-bacterial antibiotics. But that doesn't mean that the bacteria was the cause of the infection or even that the virus added to a bacteria added to circulatory problems. Then you can choose any one of those to blame it on."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how flu death statistics are inflated by including pneumonia and other respiratory issues, and how this relates to the underlying causes of death in the elderly.

**RAY PEAT:** "So with the new improved statistics where they went from several hundred people dying of, actually dying of the flu to 40 to 60,000, if I have that right, per year. Mm-hmm. Which is. Extraordinary increase considering those numbers how many now or have actually died officially of coronavirus Where we stand today on the 31st of March? I Think was probably yesterday that I looked at it and it was about 2,400 at that time In just a day it had gone just about doubled So it was going up fast, but since about 10% the people Dying of flu you would expect to have the coronavirus because When they were doing the samples of people with respiratory diseases They would see about half the people had no Identifiable cause and then the rhinovirus would be maybe 30% flu virus maybe 15% in the coronavirus Maybe another 15% something like that So just on the basis of Samples from previous years you would expect maybe 10% of the dead people To have an identifiable coronavirus in them And so if 45 people are expected to die Then 10% of those you could Say anywhere from 5 to 15% but 10% would be 4,500 expected dead people containing the coronavirus Not that it killed them but that it was identifiably present as they were sick with respiratory disease"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat to compare the official coronavirus death toll to the inflated flu death statistics.

**RAY PEAT:** "True if you and have a limited number of tests and you use them mostly in hospitals at first people who come in I don't know why they bother testing sick people coming in as if they had something special with which to treat the coronavirus but most of the tests people have said are really for any coronavirus not this particular strain you but since I don't really have anything effective for coronavirus why would why they should be testing sick people coming into the hospital isn't very clear but when you test only sick people then you're going to have a very high percentage of the tests showing positive just because of that known figure from previous years of 10% of the respiratory infections averaged coronavirus. And therefore, of the people who die, there is also going to be a very high percentage because you're testing primarily the sick people. Then as you go out into a broader part of the population and start testing healthy people, the mortality rate per infection shrinks. That happened in China from something like three and a half or four percent shrank down to around one percent. And South Korea had a very big testing program. And so they had only a six tenths percent mortality. And I don't know if that's the situation in New York, Spain and Italy, where they're having a high percentage of mortality. But. You can't know at all what the numbers mean unless you know who they're picking out to test."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains why testing only sick individuals leads to inflated positive test and mortality rates.

**RAY PEAT:** "So basically, they had a dry run for this back in October. And maybe you could explain to me what the Gates Foundation, what is its relationship to the World Health Organization, which I thought was a... multi-country, basically all the countries in the world where they get together and decide mutually on how to approach health issues."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Ray Peat about the World Economic Forum and Gates Foundation's "pretend pandemic" exercise and its connection to the WHO.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the drug companies would be happy if everyone took a flu vaccine. But the trouble is the flu vaccines contain multiple antigens besides influenza or if they get a coronavirus antigen. They contain adjuvants. They contain junk antigens such as what they grew the virus in the cells they were using in their culture process. So it's a very complex and highly inflammatory material that they use just to promote the immune reaction for whatever the vaccine is. And the trouble is that the viruses mutate so quickly. After one or two or three years, they are very likely to have disappeared and might never come back. But it takes a year and a half or two typically to make a vaccine. In 1975 and 76, the CDC's man in charge of overseeing flu vaccines kept telling his bosses...... that it was futile to try to get a vaccine in time to catch these rapidly mutating viruses. And they ignored him and went on with the program and finally he went on television and got fired for it. But he exposed that basically. fraudulent idea that that you could have an effective and not only effective but harmless flu virus. He was emphasizing the uselessness of it but there's also the harm harmfulness of it. Potential damage. Yeah, where only one person died of documented. Swine flu, supposedly, was about 300 deaths were reported to the government and thousands of paralysis cases were reported following the flu vaccine injection."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the potential harms of flu vaccines, including adjuvants, inflammatory materials, and the futility of creating vaccines for rapidly mutating viruses, referencing the 1976 swine flu incident.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I looked at the annual I think was the flu deaths per year. And there were dips, of course, occasionally. 2004, 2012, and I think 2016 there were noticeable decreases from the previous year. And I looked at the vaccine supply and I saw that there was a big shortage of vaccine in 2004. And the biggest surge of vaccine production and distribution was preceding the 20... 17 to 2018 flu season. And that was the season that they first estimated 80,000 deaths from. So it was interesting to see the historic peak in sending vaccines around the country and the number of people dying, even though they revised it down a little bit. Still the correlation between more vaccine and... more deaths."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat highlights a correlation between increased flu vaccine distribution and higher reported flu deaths in certain years.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they're supposed to test it first on animals, which now they're trying to bypass the process. They aim to get an antibody produced in first the animals and then......and the people. They test it and validate that they're producing specific antibodies. And the trouble is that the antibodies are... They have some generality and overlap, but they are fairly specific for a particular strain. So they're not much good for the next strain that comes in......around the time that the flu vaccine becomes available. And the real part of the immune system, which is really prior to the vaccines, and is, I think, a more important part of the immune system, is the so-called innate immune system, but it has been known for at least 20 or 30 years to be trainable or educable, the same way the adaptive antibody system is. So the fundamental whole body processes that catch viruses in many ways and reduce the harm they do, this just isn't attended to because the vaccines. Companies can demonstrate that they're producing antibodies, but they can't really clearly show what's happening in the innate system because it involves changes in the whole body. Starting with, for example, the surfactant protein in the air sacs of the lungs, it's and the nature of the composition of the mucus and the surface of the cells, and that applies to the nose and the intestine as well."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the limitations of antibody-based vaccine efficacy and emphasizes the importance of the trainable innate immune system, including factors like surfactant and mucus.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the coronavirus, when they've looked for where in the body it ends up, it seems to be equally distributed between the small intestine. And the lungs and bronchial. So it really gets pretty dispersed. And those are all surfaces where surfactant is supposed to be present to protect you. Yeah, many factors on the surface. The mucus is, healthy mucus is a very powerful protector, especially if the mucus is being swept constantly. out of your lungs. And then, once in the cell, there are many layers of other innate protectors and since the viruses, the coronavirus in particular, is known to activate all of the inflammatory processes, including tending to stop the flow of mucus out of your tubes and out of your lungs. changing the circulatory pattern, releasing histamine, serotonin, antitensin, everything that is harmful is activated by these infectious things. And that's fairly general for viruses, but coronavirus is very powerful at activating immunity."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses how coronavirus disperses in the body and its interaction with protective mechanisms like surfactant and mucus, and its potent activation of inflammatory processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't think there have been any good situations for accurately judging that. I mean it sounds like a lot of these viruses, these flu viruses, they come and go every year and a lot of people have them and never even know they had it. That's the same with this. When they have tested a broader section of people, not just the sick ones, they find that something like 85% didn't know they had anything or anything serious."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat questions the transmissibility claims for the coronavirus, noting that many infections are asymptomatic, similar to other flu viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's the important thing, because they're deliberately getting people scared so that they will, next season, be ready to get vaccinated. But that panic that they're creating, our whole generation, going back at least 50 years, has been heavily indoctrinated to go to the doctor. Like in 1950, they were putting out instructions, how to identify cancer at an early stage and training people to recognize the signs of cancer. And there are these various programs designed to get people to go to their doctors regularly for checkups. Having a regular checkup for heart disease, for example, that's supposed to be protective. So people are trained to think of the medical profession as protective, but there's really no objective evidence that that protects against anything. And in fact, when you look at the studies that try to be objective, there's no evidence that that protects against anything, there are two publications I know of that looked at the hospital deaths alone, and one group said at least 220,000 deaths are caused by accidents caused by the medical staff. Another group said 440,000 deaths per year caused by medical mistakes. And still there were surveys asking doctors whether they had seen deadly mistakes made in the hospital without reporting them. And that's another reason that the numbers might be bigger than the 220,000 or 440,000 because many doctors said that they saw the accidents. and didn't report them. And then there are the mistaken things that doctors do because they're taught to do them that have no valid scientific basis. And my next newsletter is going to be on some of those points that probably will make the hospital mortality. caused by medical mistakes of various kinds, bigger than those numbers that have been published. But those numbers already put deaths caused by medical mistakes in third place behind heart disease and cancer deaths. And that wasn't including hospital-acquired infections, which amount to around 100,000 deaths per year. And when you look at just those numbers, going to the hospital should be a very last resort, like when you want, you know, some repair that you know there's an appropriate treatment for a broken bone or a cut blood vessel or something. But since there's nothing... safe and effective against the virus, people are going in to hospitals with very little examination or putting them on ventilators and one of the common practices when people come in with respiratory infections, even before they go on a ventilator, they might get aerosolized antiviral such as ribavirin. Even though there's no published evidence showing that that reduces mortality, since they know it works in vitro, it'll reduce the virus in cells in a culture dish. But there's no proven evidence that it protects the person against the virus in the living state. That's still a common practice in hospitals, that or several other viruses. And these viruses or hydroxyquinoline, they're classified as an anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory for rheumatoid arthritis and such. But these, the nucleoside analogs or nucleotide analogs, or... or the hydroxyquinoline, quinoline categories, these are all recognized as hazardous, mutagenic, possibly carcinogenic drugs. They damage the RNA or DNA of the virus, but they also damage the human DNA and RNA, and so they're known to be. They're very toxic, and if they are figuring that the person is beyond reproductive age, then they minimize the effects of mutating their DNA, but especially in people who might still reproduce, it's not good to give them mutagens. And the ventilation itself. If they have to stick a tube down your windpipe, that tends to activate inflammation just by the mechanical damage it does. And they are typically using 40 to 60 percent oxygen supplements. Sometimes it's just air. But if you speed the respiration with... just extraordinary error, and especially if you double or triple the amount of oxygen in the air, you're necessarily going to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in their lungs and bloodstream in general. And carbon dioxide is a major anti-inflammatory defense against the damage that the viruses are doing. So, scientifically... There's a lot of evidence to show that what they're doing, very quickly, when someone gets to the hospital panicked over the coronavirus, what they're doing is very, very dangerous and you would assume that it's increasing the speed of... Yeah, not what they're intending to do, but possibly what's happening."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat argues that the medical system is designed to create fear for vaccine marketing, that medical interventions themselves cause significant harm and death, and that common treatments for respiratory infections like ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine are toxic and potentially mutagenic. He also explains how mechanical ventilation and high oxygen levels can reduce protective carbon dioxide levels, exacerbating inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "The carbon dioxide is anti-inflammatory and has many pro-respiratory effects. It helps to deliver the oxygen into, moving it from the blood into the energy-producing cells and it opens up capillaries that have been constricted by such things as antifotensin produced by infection. So if you wanted to instruct somebody how to do it, you'd say, you know, if you had to do the ventilator, or a breathing tent probably is less invasive than a ventilator. Would it be 35% oxygen and 5% CO2, or what would you suggest? Oh, with 30%, I think even 1% CO2 would be a big help. And then it would not be so dangerous, you think?"

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the benefits of carbon dioxide in respiration and suggests using carbogen (oxygen with added CO2) as a safer and more effective respiratory support than standard ventilation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think infected people, it's good if they wear masks when they go out in public. I don't think masks are helping people who are not infected because if it's floating in sub-microscopic particles, they'll get around the mask."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests masks are beneficial for infected individuals to prevent spread but not for uninfected people due to the sub-microscopic nature of viral particles.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D is profoundly anti-inflammatory but he recommends vitamin D. Vitamin D and aspirin and vitamin B1 and progesterone, their benefit is in this situation largely by lowering the antitensin receptor, a very central basic thing in anti-inflammatory protection. So vitamin D is one of our central anti-inflammatory things and very protective against all kinds of viral infections and other infections as well."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the anti-inflammatory and protective benefits of Vitamin D, aspirin, B1, and progesterone, particularly in relation to lowering the angiotensin receptor.

**RAY PEAT:** "Aspirin can often increase your thyroid function and cell respiration so much that it doesn't affect your fever but it can lower the need for a fever since andradensin overproduction is a basic harm factor of any infection that you have. You're stopping the mechanism of the harm and that is what is lowering the fever. It isn't just mechanically turning off heat production, it actually increases oxidative metabolism. And at least temporarily will increase thyroid function, so when it reduces a fever I think it's most often because it's remedying the thing that is causing the fever. So the fever basically hinges on the inflammation. If aspirin lowers the inflammation then the fever is no longer necessary. It happens to be an anti-viral agent in itself. It's been tested against four or five major viruses, all of which I think ranks up with the toxic chemicals that they sell for the purpose of killing viruses. But it happens that just as a side effect, aspirin itself interferes with the reproduction of viruses."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how aspirin can reduce the need for fever by addressing the underlying inflammation and also acts as an antiviral agent.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of something really strong to kill the pathogen and virus aspirin, even though there's evidence that it is very effective at stopping viruses. They don't think of it as a deadly toxic agent. Same with cancer. The ideology is that you have to kill cancer cells, but in fact cancer cells are weak and defective and don't live very long, but the problem is they're being replaced so fast. If you just work on slowing whatever it is causing their replacement, then you don't have to worry about killing them because they just naturally die because they're defective."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat contrasts the perception of aspirin as a mild antiviral with the aggressive approach to cancer, suggesting that addressing the underlying cause of cell replacement is more effective than directly killing cancer cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "It activates various parts of your immune reaction. So I'm not sure whether there have been studies on this particular kind of virus, but the ability to produce antibodies, for example, has increased with fever and white blood cells. It can eat faster at a higher temperature, so in general, your resistance is increased with the fever. I've always associated that the fever is basically, you know, you're getting hot and miserable and having hallucinations, but it's, you know, it's killing off the bug inside of you. So in a way it is because it's enabling your immune system to rev up. It's revving up your whole system. It might even make some germs more energetic, too, but the thing is it gives your body a greater advantage more than it does for the speed of replication of the germ."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that fever enhances the immune system's ability to fight infection by increasing antibody production and white blood cell activity.

**RAY PEAT:** "When they treat people with cancer, sometimes they keep them at more than 106, up around 107 for a few hours, and people seem to tolerate that. You mean they give them something to raise their body temperature? No, put them in a hot tub or a box with heat lamps, just their heads sticking out, and they... put thermometers, now that they have thermometers that you can swallow, but they used to just give a rectal thermometer and oral thermometers and take care not to go over 107. They found that several major types of cancer would die after multiple treatments of maybe 5 to 10 hours at a time."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat describes hyperthermia treatments used in cancer therapy, where elevated body temperatures are maintained to induce cancer cell death.

**RAY PEAT:** "A lot of places warning about anti-inflammatory drugs, they're extending it to aspirin. And they're generally getting confused thinking that the ACE2 enzyme that is the target of the coronavirus. Thinking that that shouldn't be increased because it would increase the chance of catching the coronavirus and they're even confusing it as a cause of hypertension and so on. It's complicated enough that it's hard to explain it even to doctors because they get fixed ideas. Yeah, it is it is hard to understand. So maybe that's what John Campbell was talking about and that's what the key was quoting those French. Yeah, and there was an article in Lancet that said basically the same thing stop taking anti-inflammatories because they'll increase your ACE2 enzyme and make a bigger target. But there had already been half a dozen very clear papers. Saying that the virus decreases your ACE2 enzyme, increasing the pro-inflammatory antifotensin production. And so what you need to do is get your ACE2 back in production to destroy the inflammatory mediator."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat clarifies the confusion surrounding ACE2 enzymes, anti-inflammatory drugs, and coronavirus, explaining that the virus actually decreases ACE2, and restoring it is crucial for reducing inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's very reasonable. Sweden has basically done nothing resembling. The United States program, the government there so far has told old people and sick people to stay home and everyone to wash their hands and basically just behave sensibly and not shutting down businesses."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat commends Sweden's approach to the pandemic, which focuses on protecting vulnerable populations and promoting sensible behavior rather than widespread lockdowns.

**RAY PEAT:** "At first I would have to see what drugs they were being given and whether they were being respirated but it's possible that the virus actually is more deadly than previous ones but there's just no statistical evidence of that."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat suggests that while it's possible the current virus is more deadly, there's a lack of statistical evidence to support this claim, and the treatments administered could be a confounding factor.

**RAY PEAT:** "No Well the number that they are blaming on on coronavirus is Less than what you would expect if it's normally 10% of the flu deaths, so For example, if it was in the 60 to 80,000 range as in 2017 and 2018, and if the variation was 15 percent instead of the average 10 percent coronavirus, then you could say that just a statistical fluctuation based on the last five years. It could be 15,000 deaths this year from coronavirus."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat reiterates that the number of deaths attributed to coronavirus is lower than expected based on typical flu mortality rates and statistical variations.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, so that's a little puzzling. Yeah, and the figures that Wolfgang Wodarg gave showed a range from 5 to 14 percent of the respiratory diseases being a coronavirus. So if this year the coronavirus happened to be a larger percent, then that could be about one-seventh of 50,000, for example, so 7,000. That would still be not outside the recent history figures."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat references Wolfgang Wodarg's data, suggesting that even if coronavirus constitutes a larger percentage of respiratory illnesses this year, the total number of deaths would still fall within historical ranges.

**RAY PEAT:** "Contexts for Vaccinations, and... I think it was, fear of terrorism and fear of disease are marketing tools, and it does seem like at least the media is certainly hyping the fear factor. Another thing to take note of is that the biggest advertiser in the United States, and maybe around the world, are the pharmaceuticals. They advertise more through the media than any other type of business. Yeah, and the CDC is being their most cooperative spreader of their ideology, advertising ideology. Yeah, they do seem to work hand in hand."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat states that fear of terrorism and disease are marketing tools, and that pharmaceutical companies, as major advertisers, work in tandem with organizations like the CDC to promote their agendas.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and a good diet is necessary for sleep. Vitamin D and the associated calcium work together. Vitamin D is anti-inflammatory but it works by lowering parathyroid hormone and it can't do that if your phosphate intake is very high relative to calcium. So cutting down on your beans, nuts, and meat, and fish. Increasing cooked green leaves, cheese, and milk will improve the function of the anti-inflammatory anti-infective vitamin D, lowering the parathyroid hormone and all of the associated pro-inflammatory things that it does."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat advises on maintaining a healthy immune system through good diet, sleep, and the proper balance of Vitamin D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone, recommending specific food choices to reduce inflammation.
