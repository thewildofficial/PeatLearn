**RAY PEAT:** The seed oil industry was in a crisis point after World War II. Traditional uses in paints and plastics were being displaced by petroleum compounds. The industry needed new markets. Ways to convince the public that seed oils were better than animal fats were introduced, calling them "heart protective." Human studies soon showed the same results as animal studies: they were toxic to the heart and increased cancer incidence. This began in the 1920s and 1930s with experiments on feedlot animals.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion is about the historical shift from saturated fats to polyunsaturated fats in the diet.

**RAY PEAT:** Animals were fed coconut oil, a saturated fat, to increase weight gain. Instead of gaining weight, they lost weight. They then switched to corn oil and soy oil, and the animals started gaining weight. However, the long-term effects of these fats were toxic. The animals developed serious inflammatory disorders and died from gastrointestinal issues after about seven or eight weeks of being fed these products.

**CONTEXT:** The initial use of coconut oil in animal feed and the subsequent switch to corn and soy oil are being explained.

**RAY PEAT:** Coconut oil was discarded, and a campaign was launched to alert the public that these cheap tropical oils were toxic. The alternatives promoted were US-grown corn and soy. With the chemical and pharmaceutical industries behind this, corn and soy were genetically engineered and patented. Soy and corn rapidly became major US crops, and information was disseminated that they were good for health, heart, and cholesterol.

**CONTEXT:** The marketing and industrial forces behind the promotion of corn and soy are being discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** The lipid hypothesis, which claims saturated fats harm health and polyunsaturated fats improve it, has never been proven. David Krichchevsky, a Russian researcher, proposed in 1954 that feeding cholesterol to rabbits showed polyunsaturated oils lowered serum cholesterol in humans, thus linking animal studies to human heart disease and suggesting reducing animal products could prevent it.

**CONTEXT:** The origins and scientific basis of the lipid hypothesis are being questioned.

**RAY PEAT:** In 1956, the American Heart Association promoted the lipid hypothesis, recommending a diet of corn oil, margarine, and chicken over butter, lard, and eggs. However, Dr. Dudley White disagreed, noting the absence of myocardial infarction (MI) in 1900 when egg consumption was high and corn oil was unavailable. He observed that MIs were non-existent before 1928, when butter and lard were the primary fats.

**CONTEXT:** Contrasting views on dietary fat and heart disease from prominent cardiologists are presented.

**RAY PEAT:** Advertisements in the Journal of the American Medical Association promoted Wesson Oil (corn oil) as a "cholesterol depressant," and Mazola claimed corn oil was important to health. Dr. Frederick Stair of Harvard encouraged consuming up to a cup of corn oil daily.

**CONTEXT:** The role of advertising and medical endorsements in promoting corn oil is highlighted.

**RAY PEAT:** Experiments showed that diets lacking essential fatty acids produced animals with remarkable properties: high oxygen and calorie consumption, tough and stable mitochondria, transplantable tissues without immunological rejection, and resistance to trauma and toxins. These animals had low susceptibility to cancer and fibrotic conditions.

**CONTEXT:** The effects of essential fatty acid deficiency on animal physiology are being described.

**RAY PEAT:** Mary Enig points out that animal models used by Krichchevsky, particularly with vegetarian animals, were not valid for human omnivores. Studies in the 1950s showed arterial plaque formation was a natural process unrelated to diet. American soldiers in the Korean War and Japanese natives had similar plaque severity, as did the largely vegetarian Bantu in South Africa compared to meat-eating populations.

**CONTEXT:** The validity of animal models and population studies regarding diet and heart disease are being debated.

**RAY PEAT:** A 1966 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association on an "anti-coronary club" found that those on a "prudent diet" (corn oil, margarine, fish, chicken, cold cereal) had lower serum cholesterol but higher heart disease deaths (eight deaths) compared to a meat-and-potatoes control group (zero deaths). Joe Leaf, a proponent of the prudent diet, died of vascular thrombosis.

**CONTEXT:** The outcomes of a dietary intervention study are presented, showing negative results for the "prudent" diet.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1960s, polyunsaturated fats were found to prolong graft survival in organ transplants by suppressing the immune system. This immunosuppression was also linked to the carcinogenicity of essential fatty acids.

**CONTEXT:** The immunosuppressive effects of polyunsaturated fats are being discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated fats retard brain development and produce obesity. Age-related glycation products, often blamed on sugar, are largely the result of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to lipid peroxidation because their double bonds are unstable, unlike saturated fats which are stable and resist rancidity.

**CONTEXT:** The biochemical instability and metabolic consequences of polyunsaturated fats are explained.

**RAY PEAT:** By 1980, researchers recognized the harmful effects of polyunsaturated fats, including cancer promotion, heart disease, mitochondrial damage, hypothyroidism, and immune suppression. They also questioned the basis for believing these were "essential" fats. However, fat researchers shifted the discourse to safer, more profitable topics, allowing discredited theories about polyunsaturated fats and their inaccurate health claims to persist.

**CONTEXT:** The suppression of scientific findings regarding the harm of polyunsaturated fats is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Recommendations from researchers like Mary Enig and Bruce Fyfe suggest embracing pasture-fed butter, lard, tallow, and coconut oil, while avoiding canola, corn, sunflower, safflower, sesame, and soy oils, as well as soy products. Commercially raised chicken should also be avoided, as animals fed polyunsaturated fats produce meat with similar adverse effects.

**CONTEXT:** Practical dietary recommendations are provided, emphasizing saturated fats and avoiding polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** The beef industry is treating soy oil to prevent its breakdown in the rumen, which is a factor in causing scrapie and mad cow disease. The equivalent disease in chickens, "Crazy Chick Syndrome," is caused by excessive polyunsaturated fat in the diet.

**CONTEXT:** The link between polyunsaturated fats in animal feed and animal diseases is explained.

**RAY PEAT:** The prevalence of hypothyroidism is significant, with studies indicating a substantial portion of the population may have undiagnosed thyroid problems. The TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test is often misleading, as T3 conversion at the pituitary can falsely suppress TSH, masking hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can exist despite normal TSH levels, with subtle imbalances affecting mood, emotion, and well-being.

**CONTEXT:** The limitations of standard thyroid testing and the prevalence of hypothyroidism are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Diet plays a major role in thyroid health. Low iodine intake leads to low thyroid function and goiter. Goitrogens, such as peanuts and soybeans (especially in textured vegetable protein and soybean oil), block iodine. Refined sugars, grains, chemical pollutants, pesticides, mercury, and fluoride are also detrimental to thyroid function. Mercury can displace selenium, which is crucial for T4 to T3 conversion.

**CONTEXT:** Factors affecting thyroid health, including goitrogens, environmental toxins, and nutrient deficiencies, are detailed.

**RAY PEAT:** Coconut oil is beneficial for everyone, supporting the thyroid gland, improving metabolism, and aiding in weight loss. It acts as an emollient for the skin and helps maintain healthy fat levels. A very low-fat diet can be detrimental.

**CONTEXT:** The benefits of coconut oil for metabolism and thyroid function are highlighted.

**RAY PEAT:** To assess thyroid function at home, one can monitor body temperature and pulse. A normal body temperature is 98-98.6Â°F. Taking temperature and pulse before and after meals can provide clues. Low thyroid function may be indicated by a slightly lowered temperature or pulse, but this is not definitive. Consulting a practitioner for diagnosis is recommended.

**CONTEXT:** Home-based methods for assessing potential thyroid issues are described.

**RAY PEAT:** Symptoms that may indicate a need to investigate thyroid health include infertility or miscarriage, frequent infections or slow recovery, regular consumption of uncooked goitrogenic foods (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, turnips, radishes), and changes in menstrual cycles. Females are more prone to hypothyroidism due to higher estrogen levels, which are thyroid suppressants. Progesterone supports thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** Specific symptoms and factors related to hypothyroidism are listed.

**RAY PEAT:** Goitrogenic foods like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and cabbage should be cooked until soft to reduce their goitrogenic effect. Eating them raw can cause gas and indigestion.

**CONTEXT:** Preparation methods for goitrogenic vegetables are advised.

**RAY PEAT:** Dietary polyunsaturated oils, particularly soybean oil, can negatively affect thyroid health. Even a small amount, like one teaspoon a day, can suppress thyroid function. These oils are prevalent in commercially prepared foods and are known to have an anti-thyroid effect.

**CONTEXT:** The widespread presence and thyroid-suppressive nature of polyunsaturated oils are emphasized.

**RAY PEAT:** The fattening effect of polyunsaturated oils like soy and corn is due to "essential fatty acids" (linoleic and linolenic acids), which have an anti-thyroid effect. These long-chain fatty acids cause the animal's fat to become chemically equivalent to the vegetable oil, making it toxic and fattening. In the late 1940s, chemical toxins were used to suppress pig thyroid function for fattening; when found to be carcinogenic, corn and soybeans were discovered to have a similar anti-thyroid effect.

**CONTEXT:** The mechanism by which polyunsaturated oils cause fattening and their anti-thyroid properties are explained.

**RAY PEAT:** The "essential fatty acid" concept is questioned. Prominent oil researchers have failed to provide strong evidence for essential fatty acids, often citing outdated or single-patient studies. Early research by Burr and Burr in 1929 is considered inadequate given the limited understanding of nutrition at the time. German researchers in 1927 found that a fat-free diet prevented most spontaneous cancers in rats, and later work showed polyunsaturated fats promote cancer.

**CONTEXT:** The scientific basis for the "essential fatty acid" claim is critically examined.

**RAY PEAT:** Cholesterol plays a protective role in the body; cells have cholesterol membranes. Recent research suggests that individuals with cholesterol levels around 230 mg/dL over age 50 are less likely to die from heart attacks, cancer, and degenerative diseases than those with levels below 200 mg/dL. High cholesterol can be a protective mechanism.

**CONTEXT:** The role of cholesterol in the body and recent findings regarding its protective effects are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Increased sugars and carbohydrates in the diet can raise cholesterol levels and lead to fat conversion. Instead of high-carbohydrate foods, increasing protein intake is recommended. Potatoes offer good quality protein.

**CONTEXT:** Dietary recommendations for managing cholesterol and overall health are provided.

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated oils, particularly corn oil, can suppress the immune system. High fructose corn syrup is prevalent in processed foods and should be avoided.

**CONTEXT:** The negative impacts of high fructose corn syrup and corn oil on the immune system are noted.

**RAY PEAT:** The distinction between "food" and "food-like products" is important. Education about the prevalence of harmful ingredients like high fructose corn syrup is crucial.

**CONTEXT:** The importance of choosing real food over processed food-like products is emphasized.

**RAY PEAT:** The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats is relevant to health. Canola, flax, and walnut oils are high in omega-6.

**CONTEXT:** The significance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid ratios is raised.

**RAY PEAT:** Soy products, including soy milk and tofu, have a goitrogenic effect due to soy flavonoids, which are thyroid-suppressive. Even 11 ounces of soy milk a day can suppress thyroid function in healthy individuals.

**CONTEXT:** The goitrogenic and thyroid-suppressive properties of soy products are explained.

**RAY PEAT:** For children, the least processed foods are best. Homemade chocolate milk is preferable to commercial soy milk. Soft, ripe fruits are beneficial.

**CONTEXT:** Dietary advice for children is offered, emphasizing whole foods.

**RAY PEAT:** For hypothyroidism, switching from synthetic T4 (like Levoxyl) to natural glandular thyroid extracts (like Armour Thyroid, Nature-Throid, or Westhroid) is recommended, as they contain both T3 and T4. Levoxyl relies on the liver for conversion to the active T3 form.

**CONTEXT:** Recommendations for thyroid hormone replacement therapy are provided.

**RAY PEAT:** While iodine deficiency can cause hypothyroidism, excessive iodine intake can also suppress thyroid function. A delicate balance is necessary.

**CONTEXT:** The complex relationship between iodine intake and thyroid function is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Fermented soy products like tempeh may be less harmful than other soy products, but for individuals with hypothyroidism or symptoms, avoiding anything that could suppress the thyroid is advised.

**CONTEXT:** The potential impact of fermented soy products on thyroid health is considered.

**RAY PEAT:** Coconut oil is thermogenic, increasing metabolism and oxygen consumption, thereby improving thyroid function. The thyroid governs all metabolic processes, including heat production and muscle activity. Coconut oil supports the thyroid, allowing for fat loss while consuming fat.

**CONTEXT:** The thermogenic and metabolic benefits of coconut oil are reiterated.

**RAY PEAT:** The American Soy Association's efforts to promote soy and corn oil over imported oils like coconut oil in the 1940s contributed to the suppression of research on the benefits of saturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** Historical market dynamics and their influence on dietary recommendations are explained.

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated oils interfere with thyroid gland function by blocking hormone secretion, circulation, and tissue response. Thyroid deficiency leads to increased estrogen levels. Environmental toxins like mercury, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides also interfere with estrogen and suppress thyroid function. Thyroid hormone is essential for producing protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone, and for using and eliminating cholesterol.

**CONTEXT:** The multifaceted ways polyunsaturated oils and environmental toxins negatively impact thyroid function and hormone balance are detailed.

**RAY PEAT:** Research indicates that soy formula fed to infants is associated with a higher likelihood of teenage children developing autoimmune thyroid disease. In healthy adults, consuming soy can lead to goiter and elevated TSH levels.

**CONTEXT:** Scientific studies linking soy consumption to thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune thyroid disease are cited.

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated oils, like soybean oil, have been used in livestock feed to promote weight gain due to their long-chain fatty acids, which have an anti-thyroid effect. Substituting saturated animal fat for soy oil can produce leaner meat and reduce weight gain in pigs.

**CONTEXT:** The use of polyunsaturated oils in animal agriculture and their impact on animal physiology are explained.

**RAY PEAT:** The surge of polyunsaturated oils into the food chain post-World War II has caused significant hormonal changes, primarily by interfering with thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** The broad impact of polyunsaturated oils on human health and hormones is summarized.
