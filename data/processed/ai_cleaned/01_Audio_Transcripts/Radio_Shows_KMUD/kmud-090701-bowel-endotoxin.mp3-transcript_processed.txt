**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I think actually it leaks a little bit all the time so I wouldn't say that it's strictly an endotoxin like the textbooks used to say but it's a somewhat of a structural protein but it's a medium to small-ish molecule that can leak out in the process of... growth and cell division and so on and its other name is lipopolysaccharide because it's structure is a chain of sugar molecules with fatty acids attached and that gives it kind of a soap-like behavior that is part of why it's toxic."
**CONTEXT:** What is endotoxin, how is it formed, and how is it harmful to our health?

**RAY PEAT:** "Generally and they are so common in the environment that organisms have their basic defenses against them. One of our basic defenses is the high-density lipoprotein and they talk about it in terms of carrying cholesterol, but I think really it's [HDL's function is] that it's our first defense against endotoxin once the endotoxin gets into the bloodstream. But normally the intestine is a good barrier against absorbing the endotoxins, and if some of it leaks through the wall of the intestine into the blood vessels and gets carried to the liver, the liver enzymes break it down and so it shouldn't normally reach the bloodstream in significant amounts, but it's a matter of tens of milligrams that can circulate into the bloodstream every day."
**CONTEXT:** How does the body defend against endotoxin?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it the ups and downs when you try to be too sterile and then are exposed inevitably to germs the sudden shock is probably a lot more stressful."
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the idea that a more germ-prevalent society might produce children with better immune systems compared to sterile modern environments.

**RAY PEAT:** "it Triggers a whole series of reactions and it seems to be a physical chemical process that sort of stirs up a cell to recognize a threat and set off a chain of reactions and it's the things that it sets in into action that really cause the chronic accumulating. uh... damage degenerative damage uh... it's one of the first things that does uh... on exciting a cell uh... is to cause the cell to take up calcium and to activate the synthesis of nitric oxide and uh... the uh... nitric oxide and the cell excitation. That goes with absorbing calcium, trigger other reactions, and a small amount of endotoxin can stimulate the intestine to contract more. But if the cells are getting overloaded with it, that and possibly other irritants can cause cells to produce so much nitric oxide. That the nitric oxide becomes a major metabolic disrupter and will cause the intestine to lose the ability to contract and it will poison the respiratory apparatus so that cells can't make energy to fight back and at that point with increased nitric oxide and reduced energy to fight back. and taking up calcium, the cells also take up water and then they become basically non-functioning to a degree yeah, they're under stress and if the body can deliver enough energy to them quickly they can excrete the water and the calcium and turn off the nitric oxide and return to normal functioning."
**CONTEXT:** How is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) harmful to health?

**RAY PEAT:** "When they swell up, another place the textbooks give a very simplified, mistaken idea of what is involved in bowel damage from endotoxin. They talk about the leakage between cells as if the cells lose the glue that holds them in contact with each other. So......holds open up between cells. That does happen, but it isn't necessarily the worst way that the endotoxin gets into the cells and passes through the cells. The whole structure of the cell, the cytoplasm, as it takes up water, instead of being fat-like and tending to exclude water and... prefer to absorb fats, the introduction of this sugar connected to a fat acts like a soap and makes the cell tend to admit not only more water but pretty much anything that is in its environment, so the whole substance of the cell becomes... kind of spongy and leaky. And when this starts affecting the whole organism, that kind of change occurs all through the body, once the stuff has passed through the lining of the intestine and crosses across capillaries and gets into the bloodstream, then the endotoxin... starts doing the same thing to any cell it comes to. And so it will leak out of capillaries no matter where it is in the bloodstream, if the liver hasn't filtered it. So, if it happens to reach the brain, it'll cause the brain capillaries to leak whatever is in the bloodstream. And so it can contribute to multiple sclerosis. And the... Endotoxin leaking into the brain does the same thing. It triggers the release of nitric oxide and a whole chain of chemical reactions that... Every organ has its particular way of responding to the endotoxin. But there's a generality no matter what the organ... that there are basic... defense reactions that will occur not only to endotoxin but to any radical threat to the survival of the cell so that x-rays and gamma rays will produce essentially the same kind of change in brain cells or bowel cells that endotoxin does and so if you're overexposed to... x-rays for example you'll get constipated the same way that overexposure to endotoxin will cause constipation."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the mechanism of bowel damage from endotoxin and its systemic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Okay so there's a kind of a saponification going on then yeah and opening up loosening up of the cell structure so it becomes instead of like if you imagine a lump of gelatin dipped soaked in oil it it'll stay stable in the presence of water but if you mix a little bit of lecithin with it it'll quickly start taking up water and then the whole thing is on the on the road to dissolving and breaking up."
**CONTEXT:** Describing the cellular changes caused by endotoxin.

**RAY PEAT:** "endotoxin is always present in the intestine and it's always the first thing to defend against but many other stresses and toxins like radiation or heavy metals or estrogenic substances or too many polyunsaturated fatty acids and so on all of these things tend to loosen up or saponify the cell structure....cause the cell to take up water and let junk enter from the environment into the cell substance itself and getting into the cell substance then it can just as easily go out the other side of the cell into the underlying extracellular material and from there across the capillary cells and into the bloodstream. That is essentially what the leaky gut is, it's leaky cell substance which involves leaky capillaries and ultimately it can cause leakiness of any tissue in the precancerous states, for example you see substance leaking out of the characteristic cell and those indicate a tendency to develop cancer in that organ because that organ is most stressed and is leaking its substance. For example the prostate specific antigen is just a normal prostate protein that leaks out because the cell is under stress and the same protein leaks out of breast cells when they're under stress. you And the characteristic proteins leak out of any cell when it's under stress. So it literally is the cell is falling apart, it's breaking down, it's leaking."
**CONTEXT:** What causes a leaky gut, and how does a leaky bowel wall lead to the translocation of bacteria and/or endotoxin into the bloodstream?

**RAY PEAT:** "And something as simple as vitamin E can tremendously strengthen the cell and help to hold it together so it doesn't leak its protein substance out into the environment."
**CONTEXT:** What can strengthen the cell and prevent it from leaking?

**RAY PEAT:** "The natural hormones, progesterone and testosterone, help to toughen up the cell and keep it from leaking. The factors similar to vitamin E that are associated with energy production are coenzyme Q10 and vitamin K. They are closely associated with vitamin E and energy production and they are extremely powerful at defending the respiratory apparatus from nitric oxide and endotoxin."
**CONTEXT:** What other factors help to strengthen the cell and protect it from nitric oxide and endotoxin?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the thyroid is essential for making the enzyme that essentially allows oxygen to absorb electrons out of the mitochondrial system. The mitochondria takes up electrons from sugars and fats. It drives energy from those electrons as they're passed along to oxygen. Thyroid is the essential factor for making that happen. There are other supporting factors, a system called the uncoupling proteins, that simply make the electrons run more quickly to be taken up by oxygen. And... what that does is produce carbon dioxide more quickly which turns off the formation of lactic acid and that turns off the basically the nitric oxide forming system. So if you can run the system fast enough with plenty of thyroid then you'll make the carbon dioxide and inhibit lactic acid formation and... pretty well defend against producing nitric oxide and that gives you relative immunity to the lipopolysaccharide."
**CONTEXT:** Can thyroid play a role in raising the energy of the cell?

**RAY PEAT:** "The electrons pass from that down to oxygen but they can't do it without thyroid and the temperature is... One of the factors, when you run the electrons through this system, you produce heat as well as carbon dioxide and ATP. And keeping the temperature up is one of the things that helps to turn off the production of nitric oxide and other free radical destructive factors."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the electron transport chain and the role of thyroid and temperature.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and not all free radicals are toxic, but nitric oxide. The one that is so widely produced in response to stress, it increases greatly with aging too, just because aging involves the progressive stress reactions."
**CONTEXT:** Clarifying the nature of free radicals and nitric oxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and that's... and they were very damaging and that's probably why, is to just explain the... Yeah, nitroglycerin has been used as a drug to open the circulation to the heart. Right, around China. And nitric oxide didn't really get much interest scientifically until Viagra came along and that's basically doing the same thing as nitroglycerin, but it... It's extremely toxic. It's just like getting, eating, eating toxins and getting irradiated and getting old ahead of time."
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the toxicity of nitric oxide-based substances like Viagra.

**RAY PEAT:** "The faster you run oxygen... through the mitochondrion under the influence of thyroid, the less free radical damage you have to the structure of the cell and the mitochondrion. If you are low thyroid or somehow lack oxygen acutely, the electrons, instead of being safely passed through this chain of free radicals... The free radicals wander off and attack the fats that make up the mitochondrion and then those fats become peroxides which are sort of a randomly destructive kind of free radical."
**CONTEXT:** How thyroid and oxygen levels affect free radical damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and all of those tend to accumulate in the tissues and when they're given acutely as an emulsion, for example, they used to do it in hospitals to fatten people up. Now they do it to suppress their immune systems if they're transplanting a kidney, but they not only suppress immunity, they create sort of an instantaneous diabetes or inability to respire and use sugar. So it's like if we eat food that's fried in these oils and we're essentially ingesting a free radical."
**CONTEXT:** The effects of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) on the body, including their role in immune suppression and metabolic dysfunction.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, very quickly, yeah. And an experiment I did illustrates how, even at room temperature, they spontaneously oxidize. I put a rubber hose in a bottle of, I think it was safflower oil, and put the other end in a glass of water. And just at room temperature, over a few hours, the bottle was... In effect, respiring, it was sucking oxygen up and drawing water up into the tube. The oxygen was combining with the unsaturated fats, and in the process forming lipid peroxides, which are toxic free radicals. And the situation is even worse in our body when it's at 98 and above degrees. Yeah, much, much faster at that temperature. We have catalytic amounts of iron and heavy metals floating around to accelerate the reaction."
**CONTEXT:** Demonstrating the spontaneous oxidation of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the polyunsaturated fats are the main material that causes sort of an explosion of free radicals once the process starts with endotoxin and nitric oxide. Simply minimizing those in the diet is a basic way to defend yourself. Essentially, a hundred years there have been studies showing that a fat-free diet, if you give the required nutrients, a fat-free diet extends lifespan and reduces cancer and other degenerative diseases. A 1927 study showed that there was no spontaneous cancer in rats on a fat-free diet. And that has been the case. It's been repeated thousands of times in different ways, but there are roughly a hundred studies that show the tremendously beneficial effects of even a short-term deficiency, so-called, of the polyunsaturated fats. Even a rat is made deficient according to the... the way they define the deficiency, they simply don't feed them any polyunsaturated fats, but give them purified nutrients. Those animals can stand tremendous physical trauma that would kill a rat on a normal diet, and they can be given cobra venom and survive where a normal rat doesn't. Toxins that would produce diabetes. in normal rats doesn't hurt the so-called deficient rats. Basically any kind of abuse that they can think of the fatty acid deficient rats are much much more able to tolerate and survive without harm."
**CONTEXT:** The role of polyunsaturated fats in free radical formation and the benefits of a diet low in PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's good for you. The people, the burrs who in 1929 through the 1930s were promoting that idea were working for one of the big fat businesses, lard and then vegetable shortening businesses. And when independent researchers checked their claims in the 1940s, they found that what they had done was simply produce a vitamin deficiency because when an animal is not eating the polyunsaturated fats which poison the thyroid function, their metabolic rate is about 50% higher than the normal animals. For more UN videos visit www.un.org And if they feed them only a normal amount of vitamin and protein, they become nutritionally deficient, so these researchers at the University of Texas lab in the 1940s had been working on vitamin deficiencies and they recognized that the birds had simply produced their vitamin B6 deficiency. And so they gave a fatty acid deficient diet to rats and then gave them extra vitamin B6 and it cured the syndrome. So the whole issue was settled in 1946. But in the 1950s the nutrition textbooks said that it's a controversial topic whether they're essential or not. Because people were were still promoting the idea that we need lard or vegetable shortening. And then the industry went through a big change when they discovered that first they had economized on food consumption by pigs and chickens. By poisoning their thyroid gland with a chemical that turned out to cause cancer in humans. And so they looked for another way to poison the animal's thyroid so it wouldn't eat so much but would get fat. And what they found was that polyunsaturated fats, just as the birds had demonstrated in 1932, suppressed the metabolic rate. And that was when the... feeding pigs a diet of essentially pure corn and soy for the polyunsaturated fats took off. Before that they had fed them vegetable waste and whey, industrial waste, which was very good for the pigs. But they ate a lot of it and didn't get fat. They weren't good for marketing. Yes, the agriculture industry found that. they could tremendously increase return, pounds of pig per pound of food consumed. And since they were at that same time, the paint industry discovered how to turn petroleum into paints and plastics. So they didn't need linseed oil or safflower oil anymore. And so there was this big industry, soy oil and so on. Wanted another market besides feeding pigs and chickens and so they convinced people to eat their production that they couldn't sell as paint. And the story continues into 2009. Yeah, then after 50 years the original data which was that the vegetable oils caused softening of the brain and the infertility. And cancer and so on, that was known in the early 1940s. Finally that became too public that the essential fatty acids, known as linoleic acid mainly, everyone was catching on that those were carcinogenic and caused heart disease. So about 20 or 30 years ago there was this gradual change of marketing as the......fish industry was being pressured by the Environmental Protection Agency to stop throwing their waste skins and heads and so on in the bays or into landfills because they were causing tremendous pollution. That was when fish oil came on the market. They were making fish protein out of the skin and the heads. They would sell to Africa as a food supplement and the oil spoiled so fast they marketed it for human medical use. It's a lesson through history that wherever there's a waste product there's always an agency or an industry to turn it into a profitable product. Shrimp shells are now a medical product and I'm waiting for used tires. I don't laugh it'll probably happen but it'll happen so covertly that we won't know it for another 50 years."
**CONTEXT:** The history and marketing of "essential fatty acids" and polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "The liver has several ways to catch toxins, but when it starts having to work too hard to detoxify things, the brain is our second most active detoxifying organ. It has very intense enzymes analogous to those that break down toxins in the liver. If the liver is spending too much energy detoxifying, it becomes unable to produce albumin. Albumin circulating in the blood is one of the layers of defense. When the stuff gets into the bloodstream, the high density lipoprotein made in the liver increases. When we're being poisoned and so estrogen and alcohol increase the high density lipoprotein. And this is what the doctors are telling us is the good cholesterol. Well it is good because it's a reaction to being poisoned. So it helps protect. When we're having a bowel problem. So if you have a low HDL that may be not such a bad thing because it's indicating you don't have a high toxin load."
**CONTEXT:** The liver's role in detoxification and the significance of albumin and HDL in relation to toxin load.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think so. And the albumin circulating in the blood binds things preferentially fatty molecules and so between the albumin and the lipoproteins our blood can hold a lot of stuff temporarily to give the liver a chance to catch up. As it repasses. The brain. Right, okay, because I mean, I've seen of the... albumin is being one of those factors obviously responsible for that colloidal osmotic pressure. Yeah, and when the liver is starting to be poisoned and estrogen and radiation can do the same thing as endotoxin, the ability to form albumin decreases. And so looking at the albumin in a blood test is one of the first... indicators of a person's basic resistance. If it's high, their prognosis is usually good. And if it's down around three, where the normal is four and a half, you're going to have to clean out the bowel. I've seen people in just a couple of weeks go from below three, like two and a half, up to over four, just by... eating fiber and fruit juice to reduce the absorption of the endotoxins."
**CONTEXT:** The function of albumin and its relation to liver health and prognosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "The average doctor learns his high school courses very well, and then it happens that the medical school courses on the elementary canal... and digestive physiology are really just a repeat of what the junior high and high school text books had in. So doctors get a very superficial picture of nutrition and digestion."
**CONTEXT:** Why medical doctors may not fully understand or communicate these concepts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Because the the brain needs oxygen and sugar and the just to keep all of the systems warm and respiring actively unless you have a very very big heart it usually takes around 80 or 90 beats per minute to pump enough oxygen and sugar around to the tissues to keep them warm and over the last 30 years, the normal temperature that doctors look for has decreased considerably. From the beginning of inventing thermometers, normal temperature was around 37 centigrade, 98.6 or so during the daytime Fahrenheit, and in recent years, the average temperature of Americans. has decreased considerably, and that means that the heart rate can go slower, and the person feels that they're getting enough sugar and oxygen, but they don't really feel as good as they should. I've talked to a few people who had temporary episodes of hyperthyroidism, where their heart rate went 125 for a couple of months. Consistently, they say they never felt so good in their life."
**CONTEXT:** Why a higher heart rate (above 80 bpm) can feel better, relating it to oxygen and sugar delivery to the brain and declining average body temperatures.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've got in my file, I think it's about 80 articles on the toxic effects of getting excess iodine. Thyroid cancer is increasing at a tremendous rate, and I think it's a part of it is the polyunsaturated fats, but another part is a chronic lifelong overdose of iodine. In various studies, taking more than twice the essential required minimum of iodine is enough to increase the rate of......thyroiditis and increase antibody attacks on the thyroid and so on."
**CONTEXT:** The toxic effects of excess iodine, particularly from sea vegetables, and its link to thyroid issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, the saturated fats are very protective, but you can make your own saturated fats if you eat enough sugar, like fruits instead of breads. There are a couple of groups that are curing cirrhosis and hepatitis. With giving more saturated fats and excluding the unsaturated entirely. So they are anti-inflammatory and therapeutic but you don't necessarily have to eat the saturated fats because you can make them if you get enough sugar in the form of fruit."
**CONTEXT:** The benefits of saturated fats and how the body can synthesize them.

**RAY PEAT:** "You've mentioned the CoQ10, the vitamin E, thyroid. Anything that speeds transit through the intestine and aspirin or anything anti-inflammatory, where the fruit juices contain... some of the natural anti-inflammatory chemicals, but in a pinch it can help. Aspirin surprisingly can act as a laxative because it suppresses nitric oxide and defends against endotoxin. And the fibers that are protective and don't support bacterial growth are the basic way to stimulate... quick passage through the intestine and minimizing endotoxin formation. Raw carrots and boiled bamboo shoots are very good fibers because they're germicidal as well as being able to bind the endotoxin and other toxins. So they not only help to kill these bacteria that are producing these harmful endotoxins but they also absorb them so you can excrete them."
**CONTEXT:** Protective measures to reduce bowel endotoxin and free radical load, including specific fibers and substances like aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** "It basically is the inflamed bowel and it can the the same chemicals that can cause the usual paralysis that develops with aging and causes constipation. Those same substances can shift over to causing intensified peristalsis leading to diarrhea. But it's all an inflammatory process that is triggered by irritants, and wheat, and other seeds contain chemicals that the plants, the two major problems with any kind of seed, especially certain grains like wheat, they contain their protein in a storage form of gluten, which happens to resemble a protein that our tissues make under the influence of estrogen or stress. And so if a person has some problem dealing with the control of estrogen, that predisposes them to react violently to the gluten because the same sequence of amino acids... exists in our own estrogen response protein and the gluten protein but besides the the problem with the gluten seeds all are there the next generation of the plant and so the plant puts its most intense toxins and defense substances into the seeds deliberately to interfere with grazing animals and such, so that you can take the enzymes that are needed to digest proteins and the substance in the seed won't affect that type of enzyme in the plant, but it affects all animal enzymes. So they're specifically designed to interfere with animal metabolism. So the vegetarians forget how toxic the plants have to be because they don't have the ability to fight or to run and so what they use is chemical defense. Chemical weapons."
**CONTEXT:** Explaining irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the role of wheat and gluten as irritants.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, all of these responses to inflammation and constipation tend to become progressive and even lead to the death of......some of the nerves in the intestines and so it's better to use any substance such as a plant drug rather than suffer the consequences of inflammation and it happens that cascara has structural analogies to many of our own substances, vitamin K... and coenzyme Q and progesterone have structural similarities to cascara and so what it's doing is reinforcing our defense systems and it's very unusual among drugs because it basically reinforces all of the good processes and doesn't support any of the... inflammatory toxic processes. So it's anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, helps to reduce anxiety, for example, increases energy production the way thyroid and progesterone do. Everything that our own system does, it reinforces."
**CONTEXT:** The action of cascara and its benefits, viewing constipation as a cause of morbidity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Early in the century when pre-radicals were discovered, a doctor in Michigan, W.F. Koch, began working out the implications for how to defend our cellular respiratory system from these... toxins in the environment and one of the substances he worked with was the anthraquinone. He went to Brazil and the famous Brazil wood it's red because of the anthraquinone but he explored all of the quinones that he could and found that they work with vitamin E, vitamin K and coenzyme Q and thyroid. To maintain and protect respiration."
**CONTEXT:** The historical context of anthraquinones and their role in cellular respiration, as explored by Dr. W.F. Koch.
