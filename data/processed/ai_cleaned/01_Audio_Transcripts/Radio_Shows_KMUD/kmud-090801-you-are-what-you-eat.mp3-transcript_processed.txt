**RAY PEAT:** I was a student of literature and linguistics for years before I decided to get a degree in biology and in 1968 I went to the University of Oregon intending to get a PhD concentrating in neurology or brain biology, but very quickly I saw that the nerve and brain people were extremely dogmatic, not really interested in studying the way the organism works, and I found that reproductive physiology in that university had a really scientific orientation, and so I did my dissertation on the endocrine and metabolic changes in aging of the reproductive systems.

**CONTEXT:** Could you briefly outline your academic background?

**RAY PEAT:** The harmful effects of the radiant type of energy, which there's a spectrum ranging from radio waves through infrared and ultraviolet and soft and hard x-rays and gamma rays and so on. The harmful effect is essentially from ionization of molecules in the body and so they classify things from hard or C ultraviolet category through x-rays and gamma rays as ionizing radiation. But actually there are molecules in the body that ionize spontaneously and so anything from the weakest energy can increase the degree of ionization in the body. It's a very misleading idea that only the ionizing radiation so-called is harmful. But it's the amount of ionization that is produced that causes the damage and the radiation has to interact and in effect has to resonate with some atom or molecule in the tissues to cause the harm so that if it passes through without being absorbed, there's not any particular harm done, but if it ends up in your tissue and doesn't come out the other side, then that does the harm. So red light can pass through your body harmlessly, blue and ultraviolet light will give you a sunburn, and with soft, lower energy x-rays. You can get a sunburn on one side while you're barely exposing film on the other side of your body. So they've tended to use higher energy hard x-rays so that you don't fry one side of your body to get a picture of something inside. But still with any, like a chest x-ray, the side that's facing the emitter is going to get a higher dose than the other side. So that's showing that something is getting stuck in the body. It's not going all the way through. It's the same principle that you get sunburned on the side facing the sun. And you can see if you hold your hand up against the sun, you can see red coming through. But the side facing the sun is what gets sunburned. And so if you get sunburned on the side facing the sun, you get sunburned on the side facing the sun. are facing the X-ray emitter with the detector on to your back, your breasts are going to be at greater risk than if you return the other way. But since your heart is right in the middle, your heart gets it either way and your lungs.

**CONTEXT:** How would you describe the principle behind x-radiation and how it can have negative effects in terms of the breakdown of particles?

**RAY PEAT:** The atmosphere filters out the harder, higher energy x-rays and ultraviolet C and so the kind of ultraviolet that burns us is ultraviolet A and B and to some extent the blue light can cause a sunburn and the slight burning effect is very superficial. It goes just a couple of millimeters or three into your skin and it's absorbed. The damage that it causes there, a sunburn can poison you systemically so that even though it's all absorbed at the surface, you can suffer general systemic sickness from getting sunburned and it's the same if you're burned with a hot iron, it'll make you sick all through your body because of material absorbed. And the things in your skin that absorb the radiation from ultraviolet are the first things are the colored vitamins, folic acid, vitamin B2 and carotene or vitamin A and the polyunsaturated fatty acids spread the energy absorbed by these colored substances. And then the excited or oxidized fatty acids in your skin can travel and cause the release of inflammatory mediators all the way from your skin into your bloodstream and throughout your body. So even the superficial burn has systemic effect, but really it's just the superficial injury that you get from sunlight. Cosmic rays are particles moving at extremely high speed, going right. Some of them go deeply into the earth, but they pass through our bodies constantly. A cloud chamber will create a mist. Every time a particle goes through it leaves a trail and so there in a second many particles will be passing through our bodies but these primary particles, the particles coming directly out of the cosmos are traveling at such high speed that our particles, our molecules don't resonate with them. And pretty much the electrons that are released go back to where they were knocked loose from and don't cause much damage. There is a little chronic damage from cosmic rays. But if you put animals under about a half an inch of lead, these cosmic primary rays hit a nucleus in the lead, instead of being shielded, they cause a fission reaction in the lead nucleus and then there's an intense shower of secondary, they're called secondary cosmic rays. And if you're in a building with a very thick roof, especially with metal things over your head, you get some of that same effect to you that would be produced by a lead shielding over your head. So cosmic rays, the higher you go, the less probability there is that a secondary radiation will be produced because the atmosphere is so thin more of them will pass through harmlessly. Because they're traveling faster? Yeah, essentially they're traveling faster and some of the particles that are produced in the secondary or tertiary reactions, those are lower energy particles and many of them, you can follow the tracks they leave in a chemical substance just to see what happens to them. But they increase their ionization of the tissue as they slow down. And so it's like, if you're skiing at high speed and you fall off your skis and hit the snow, you slow down. If it's very fluffy snow, you slow down gradually. If it's very dense snow, you come to a very sudden damaging stop. All the energy is absorbed by your tissue suddenly. That's what happens with these lower energy particles. And if you eat an isotope which emits particles such as the radioactive isotopes they give you to scan your thyroid or to treat thyroid cancer or to do the other PET scans. Those emit isotopes which are largely absorbed right in the tissue in the local area, so those are extremely carcinogenic. So not only are you exposed to the carcinogenic effect of the actual PET scan, but then the substance you take in order to show up on the PET scan is also radioactive. Yeah, and they often do it to find a tumor that concentrates the radioactive substance, but if you look at the whole body, the brightest spots are usually the brain, the kidneys, and the thyroid gland. They don't mention that those are highly metabolic areas that release, metabolize, concentrate the radioactive substance.

**CONTEXT:** How would you compare the damaging effects of the sun's radiation to radiation from x-rays or MRIs?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's very bad for your skin but it only has a little systemic lingering damage but the the body absorption when it's systemic there's a great mass involved and so a fairly low intensity that goes through your body and produces reactions can can leave a sort of inflammatory reaction that can linger for example in Japan they have done blood tests that show that people who were exposed 60 years earlier to the atomic bomb still have a lingering inflammatory reaction in which their blood is still emitting excited photons.

**CONTEXT:** So, when doctors say that one x-ray is equivalent to spending all day in the sun, how untrue is that?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the ordinary sunburn is actually slightly good for you probably by making vitamin D. But there's no good produced by the type of radiation from an x-ray.

**CONTEXT:** What about people who work in buildings above the 25th parallel of latitude?

**RAY PEAT:** If you're above the 25th parallel of latitude. The cosmic rays are intense enough that that probably increases your cancer risk. They used to believe that it was only the direct action of an x-ray or gamma ray or isotope on your genetic material that caused cancer and mutations and so on. But, if you radiate cells in a dish and cause the mutations in those exposed dishes, but then you add fresh cells to the dish. The fresh cells which weren't exposed to radiation will begin to mutate. So, it's like analogous to the starting the rancidity process in oil. It starts an inflammatory process in the exposed cells and it's called the bystander effect. They spread the damage to the innocent unexposed bystander cells.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the bystander effect?

**RAY PEAT:** The damaged cells send the signal to the new cells in their environment that causes the same kind of damage to the new cells exactly as if they had been irradiated.

**CONTEXT:** Is this trait heritable?

**RAY PEAT:** People are trying to identify the nature of the chemical signal. Some people think it's a photoelectric or photochemical reaction. And that's possible because the inflammatory mediating chemicals do stimulate photochemical reactions when they affect a cell. So, it's undoubtedly a mixture of excitation and chemical signaling.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s this was already clearly established that x-rays act like estrogen. It will even cause rodents to go into heat to be x-rayed because it is so similar to estrogen. And for several years people thought that was because it excited the pituitary to turn on the ovaries. But other experiments showed they would just x-ray the animal's foot and the ovaries or the whole physiology would behave as if they had been given estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that x-rays act like estrogen. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** The studies looking at large populations see from animal studies they see that the babies are underdeveloped and their brains in particular grow more slowly and in human studies they can see that just a few rads or rems of radiation like several times the background radiation intensity but that's enough to increase some cancers of the brain and eyeball for example but and and thyroid when they're just getting dental x-rays the radiation bounces off the teeth and exposes the eyes, brain and thyroid more than other parts of the body but now that the bystander effect is known and the estrogenic effect I think there will be more studies looking at the subsequent pregnancies of women who have been irradiated because of the lingering bystander effect the fetuses are going to be basically estrogenized if the woman a significant amount of radiation even before getting pregnant.

**CONTEXT:** Can you quantify the damage that can be done by radiation?

**RAY PEAT:** In the case of x-rays, lead is very protective but the trouble is that they don't protect your mouth and the mouth sends the estrogen-like signals all through the body. So the baby's damage was because of the radiation on the brain, the mother's brain, her thyroid gland and eyeballs or whatever cells that touch there and that then had a systemic effect on her child.

**CONTEXT:** Would it be worse or better to have the lead shield on the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, yeah, I think the studies that are showing brain cancer from use of cell phones, way back 35 years ago or so, there were two or three laboratories or factories working with that frequency of energy and there were clusters of brain cancers on the staff like within a year or two there would be two or three people developing brain cancer working around those very high intensity fields and in that context the studies that suggest that the cell phones are causing brain tumors I think it's very believable.

**CONTEXT:** What about cell phone radiation and brain tumors?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, all kinds of brain tumors astrocytomas were the ones that they saw in the laboratory workers but whatever is close to a field is going to be affected because of the industrial commitments to exposing the population to high energy everything from radar your airports and microwaves around the downtown regions the government and industry have both put pressure on the researchers not to see any harm. But from the 50s on, several researchers were showing that nerves are seriously disturbed even by very low levels of microwave and radio frequency.

**CONTEXT:** What about acoustic neuromas and cell phones?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, almost never. You can probe. If a dentist really believes that there might be a crack in the tooth that he can't see, drilling a small hole to explore is Right, there are other ways. Right. Yeah, and the Japanese in particular, but in other industries, ultrasound imagery has been proven to work beautifully for teeth. Right. You can see everything in a tooth with fine detail with microwaves, but dentists are invested in the x-ray technology. Right.

**CONTEXT:** Is it better to let teeth rot rather than have a dental x-ray?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the kind of radiation they use is less harmful than the x-ray and gamma rays.

**CONTEXT:** Are MRI and ultrasound radiation-free diagnostic techniques?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I haven't seen the exposure doses from being near those machines, but if you look at the history of X-ray technologists in medical fields, the history isn't very encouraging for how careful they are, you know, dentists always assured patients that stuff was very harmless, but there was an epidemic of dentists losing their index finger to cancer and now they make the patient hold the X-ray film.

**CONTEXT:** What about the scattering from x-raying luggage at airports?

**RAY PEAT:** Magnesium is the single most protective substance against radiation damage. Vitamin E, vitamin A, all of the antioxidants are protective. Progesterone and some of the protective stabilizing hormones, pregnenolone, will reduce the inflammation, probably coffee. Coffee and vitamin E would be the simplest things to do.

**CONTEXT:** What tips do you have to counteract or protect against radiation exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, caffeine itself has an anti-inflammatory antioxidant.

**CONTEXT:** Is that because of the antioxidants in coffee?

**RAY PEAT:** It helps to heal genetic breaks of DNA repair. Enzymes are activated by magnesium. And coffee is high in magnesium and other B vitamins.

**CONTEXT:** What is the function of magnesium in protecting against radiation?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, a CAT scan typically gives you about 200 times the radiation dose that a single picture does. 200 times, oh my gosh. Wow. And then people are getting them for their whole body? Yeah, it's a big business but expensive business. John Goffman who died just a few years ago discussed that in his newsletters and books. You can find a lot of his information on the internet. That's Goffman with 1F. Oh, 1F, okay. Okay, and then I also wanted to bring up One more thing and that is I'm a midwife and I was going by several years ago a microwave tower out where I lived on 40 acres in the countryside and I noticed that all around the microwave tower every time I drive there I see three and four-eared rabbits. What do you think of that? Oh, well, they've known for a long time that......telephone or power line workers, the men have mostly female offspring and birds that live near power lines have nearly all female offspring. Wow. So it's increasing estrogen. Apparently, yeah. Reproductive disruption.

**CONTEXT:** What about CAT scans and full-body scans?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, there have been advocates of distributing potassium iodide tablets to people who live around nuclear power reactors in case there's a leak of iodine and seaweed is is even better than potassium iodide tablets but it only protects you against radioactive iodine which is it's the first and worst radiation injury from, for example, at Three Mile Island. A year after the leaks, there was an epidemic of babies born without thyroid glands.

**CONTEXT:** What about seaweed and its protective effects against radiation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it protects you against radioactive iodine, but iodine itself is slightly antioxidant, but it's also risky to use chronically, because if you get this two or three times more than the minimum requirement, it can increase the risk of goiter and thyroiditis and thyroid cancer over a long period of time.

**CONTEXT:** So seaweed only protects against radioactive iodine, not other forms of radiation?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, for mammograms, for example, there is now good evidence that MRI and ultrasound will give you even better information than x-rays. Right. Okay. Good. They just haven't been as developed commercially or industrially, correct? Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** What are safer upcoming techniques for visualization compared to x-rays?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. I've avoided x-rays for, I guess, 15 or 20 years now.

**CONTEXT:** So you suggest avoiding x-rays altogether?

**RAY PEAT:** Except for broken bones, and if you have a splinter of a bone in your brain or lung or something, I guess it's a quick way to locate it, but you can't really see very much about the soft tissue with an x-ray, where ultrasound and MRI, MRI was essentially invented to look at soft tissue and to chemically identify what it is. So with an x-ray, you can't tell. what is tumor and what isn't, but with an MRI, you can detect the type of chemicals, type of physiology in the soft tissue.

**CONTEXT:** In an emergency situation like a road traffic accident, are x-rays ever warranted?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the things that cause Obesity also cause inflammation. Asthma is an inflammatory disease and some people see obesity as, in some ways, an inflammatory condition. The cytokines that regulate metabolism, once you start down the inflammatory pathway, you trigger cortisol production. It directs fat to your face and abdomen and shoulders and the cortisone exposure increases and causes degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis and obesity and heart disease, but the, um... Inflammation or allergic reaction is really prior to the chronic overproduction of cortisone.

**CONTEXT:** What are the long-term effects if we continue to be exposed to these environmental factors?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, I've seen basically all of the lupus people that I've seen over the last 30 years with thyroid progesterone and avoiding the polyunsaturated fats. They all either recover completely or at least don't die of their kidney failure and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Has there been an increase in conditions like SLE (lupus) due to cumulative radiation exposure?
