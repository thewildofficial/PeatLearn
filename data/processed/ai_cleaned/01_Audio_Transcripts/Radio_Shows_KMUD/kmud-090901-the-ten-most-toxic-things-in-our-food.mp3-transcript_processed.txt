**RAY PEAT:** "I got a Ph.D. taking most of my coursework in biochemistry and reproductive physiology. So it's mostly endocrine chemistry that I've been studying ever since."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to mention his academic background.

**RAY PEAT:** "The celiac disease has been pretty much explained as an overlap between a part of the gluten protein molecule and a natural enzyme that we have in all of our cells and systems the transglutaminase which sticks proteins together and this is induced by lots of things to increase its quantity or decrease it. For example the ACE inhibitors for treating blood pressure have been discovered to block it to the extent that people's skin can fall off, the epidermis separates and forms blisters and comes loose because of inhibiting the transglutaminase. But other things can intensify the action. Estrogen, for example, will cause premature hardening of the epidermis. The cells are flattened and keratinized under the influence of estrogen, which is antagonized by vitamin A. The uterus and the skin and the breast are places that especially involve these interactions of the hardening enzyme. And breast cancer and uterine cancer contain very large amounts of overproduction of the transglutaminase of certain kinds and the antibody reactions that are involved in celiac disease can inactivate the natural enzyme when it occurs and for example scleroderma the hardening and calcification of the skin and other membranes can apparently overlap considerably with celiac disease involving over activation of the transglutaminase enzyme."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to talk about transglutaminases, what they do, and their negative impacts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I would. All of the autoimmune diseases are much more frequent, five or ten times for some of them, in women compared to men. And I'm not sure how big a role transglutaminase plays in those, but that is one enzyme that is very susceptible to forming autoantibodies under the influence of estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if females would be at greater risk due to the relation to estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "The worst thing about the use of these products is that they are industrially manufactured in microorganisms genetically modified and for, I guess, about 30 years now. Organisms have been used for modifying foods and when the Japanese pioneered the genetic modification of microorganisms to produce amino acids, people were thinking they were buying a pure chemical substance, but I ran across many people who said that they believed they almost died when they took a pure amino acid preparation and it's extremely difficult if not impossible to thoroughly purify anything made in a microorganism to the extent that it won't be allergenic. So the worst thing is that you're getting junk from microorganisms and industrial processes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the source of transglutaminases and their potential issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, everything that we eat or inhale is processed by our immune system, sampling things that hit the intestinal membranes or that leak through the membrane into the bloodstream, and so the immune system has to decide what to do to these extraneous materials, and it can either accept them and allow them to circulate, or it can organize a defensive attack against them, and it's the defensive inflammatory attack against the extraneous materials, such as microorganism proteins, that can trigger the sometimes deadly allergic reactions. And it isn't strictly the proteins. The immunologist doctrine used to say that it's proteins which are the allergens, but many carbohydrates or starch-like gum materials are extremely allergenic, and that has actually been known for 60 or 70 years, but allergists are just now barely accepting the fact."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how the immune system reacts to ingested materials, including proteins and carbohydrates.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, gelatin constitutes about 50 percent of the protein in an animal and it has the feature of lacking tryptophan, cysteine and methionine which the muscle meats, for example, are extremely rich in tryptophan and cysteine and methionine. And those happen to inhibit the thyroid function, suppress metabolism and promote inflammation and simply eliminating methionine, just one of those from the diet in animal experiments has increased the maximum lifespan about 40 percent. And adults have an extremely low requirement for tryptophan. They're used for growth processes and so they're essential for kids to grow up but once you've achieved your growth you just need a very small amount to make new skin and antibodies and intestinal membranes and hair and nails. You don't need the vast quantities that we get in the ordinary average proteins. So an adult 40 or 50 years ago, nutritionists wondered how little old ladies could be so healthy just eating gelatin and toast because they thought of tryptophan and cysteine as essential amino acids that old people can eat. essentially live on it with just a trace of the others in things like bread and fruit."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to mention the health benefits of gelatin.

**RAY PEAT:** "I started running into people who had mysterious allergies and in Eugene, they tend to start with the pollen season and then continue with the grass seed field burning in the later summer. Allergies were extremely common in Eugene, but I found that some people had year-round allergies and they were consistently taking all of the anti-allergy supplements. Panacinic acid, vitamin A, vitamin C and so on and I suggested that they try stopping those for a while to see what happens and I got essentially 100% results in curing the local allergies and that was when I started doing a lot of nutrition counseling because everyone was so surprised to see that. They had been allergic to the supplements and ascorbic acid that caused me to investigate the history of it. In 1953, when I worked in the woods, the word went around that you could cure poison oak with ascorbic acid. And I tried it myself, and in just two or three days completely recovered from a horrible case of poison oak and never caught it again. At that time, it was very expensive to make, and the pills on sale were only 50 milligrams. Several years later, they developed new ways of manufacturing it. One of the processes Linus Pauling described as the lead room for making sulfuric acid which is then the sulfuric acid is slightly contaminated with lead and other heavy metals then the corn starch is processed oxidized with this industrial sulfuric acid and ends up as ascorbic acid containing quite a bit of heavy metal. With these new methods, I found that when people were taking 500 or 1000 milligrams, they would often develop cold symptoms when they took it rather than when they didn't take it. And it apparently is irritating enough to the intestine that it causes endotoxin absorption and inflammation of the nose and throat....and chest membranes. And citric acid is manufactured by very similar methods to ascorbic acid, and they really shouldn't be considered to have anything to do with the natural ascorbic acid or citric acid. A person who can get very sick on two milligrams of synthetic ascorbic acid. Can eat 4,000 milligrams of natural ascorbic acid with no reaction at all."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about citric acid and ascorbic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. He said it shows what tremendous antioxidant systems we have in our stomachs that we don't all die with the first 500 milligram dose."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions a researcher's findings on the free radical activity of commercial ascorbic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "I was reading the Encyclopedia Britannica yearbooks for the 1947 or so and I saw that the FDA had declared that they were so allergenic they shouldn't be considered fit for use in foods. And now they're in everything."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about gums like guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, and carrageenan, and how they became prevalent in foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and surprisingly even organic foods. Sometimes they don't have to list things like sulfites on the labels, but I think they do have to list carrageenan, but it can be in the food as a gum thickener, for example, and still be called organic, but not long ago there was a publication of a person who died after having an alginate dental impression made with anaphylactic shock. So they're very allergenic because an alginate would be like the agar agar, right? Yeah, and in the dental school at the University of Kansas, students were practicing making alginate impressions on each other, and out of 227, there were close to 50 of them who developed blisters in their mouth. That's about 18% of them. It took about five days to clear up. So just contact can, in 20% of the people, create blisters, and then occasional unlucky people that can kill them."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the prevalence of gums and their allergenic nature, referencing an incident with alginate dental impressions.

**RAY PEAT:** "In natural foods, I think there are two or three. Naturally occurring substances that account for some natural disease and possibly all of the major degenerative diseases, those are polyunsaturated fats, starches and sometimes an excess of iron in some natural foods if you eat that exclusively. For example if you ate liver every day accompanied by orange juice you would absorb a toxic amount of iron but just over the period of several years you can see the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the tissue so that old animals have highly polyunsaturated brain tissue you and all through the tissues it's more unsaturated and the long-lived animals that are remarkable for living longer than you would expect are unusually saturated in their fats."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat categorizes three naturally occurring toxic substances in food: polyunsaturates, starches, and excess iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Arthritis cancer dementia wrinkly skin susceptibility to sunburn an article that just came out two months ago was looking at the pigment epithelium in the retina and they found that the linolenic acid in particular but all of the polyunsaturated fatty acids created an inflammatory process that basically accelerates the degeneration of the retina. One of my newsletters a couple of years ago went over that but this was just a couple of months ago a new article showed that stearic acid or saturated fatty acids don't do that and for many years some researchers on alcoholic liver disease have been showing that it's the polyunsaturated fats which cause cirrhosis and hepatitis when they drink alcohol. In India alcoholics who are in the butter ghee and milk eating regions don't get cirrhosis right okay so that the cirrhosis is not apparent at all in those in those people then it's purely those people that would drink or consume alcohol in the presence of polyunsaturated oils in their diets yeah and a group led by a man named non-g has demonstrated that saturated fats can basically cure alcoholics cirrhosis and hepatitis well even in the presence of them continuing to drink i think you said 32 ounces of vodka a day that wasn't man she's group but it was about 30 or 40 years ago someone did allow them to drink a quart of vodka every day and they still recovered when they had their saturated fats wow"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to mention some of the conditions that PUFAs can lead to.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because all chickens even if they're fed organic feed yeah they used to talk about the high saturated fat and cholesterol content of eggs but about 30 years ago someone decided to reanalyze and found that they're at that time they were already almost purely polyunsaturated So eggs aren't even saturated, don't even have saturated fat anymore because they feed the chickens corn and soy as the main primary food."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the fat content of eggs, given modern chicken feed.

**RAY PEAT:** "A man named Gerhard Fulkheimer, an immunologist in Berlin, had apparently read some of the older studies about a hundred years ago. And he tested on his medical students having them drink a solution about a cup full of cornstarch stirred into water or potato starch, various vegetable starches. And then he would draw a blood sample periodically. And at first it was very clear that within about 10 or 15 minutes of drinking the starch solution, you would find a lot of the unprocessed starch pellets in the bloodstream, the same size that they were when they were ingested. And in some of these starches, the diameter of the starch grain is as much as 100 microns across, 10 times as wide as the cells that line the intestine. So how did it get through? The process is called persorption, but basically it just means they are pressed on one side and they pop out the other side. The cells are much more flexible than people imagine. And the red blood cell is about 7, isn't it? Yeah, it's like potato starch, I think, since the capillaries are just a few microns across and a red cell at 10 or 11 microns has to bend a little bit to get through a capillary. The starch grains can get, if they're just the right size, they could enter a capillary and get stuck. But the bigger ones will plug the arterioles before they get to the capillaries. Okay. And so a full timer fed a high starch diet to mice. And then sliced them up and found that every organ contained areas where cells have been killed by plugging up an artery with ischemia. And that it accelerated the aging process by killing areas in the heart and brain and kidneys and so on."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to discuss starches, referencing the work of Gerhard Fulkheimer.

**RAY PEAT:** "And in his medical students after the first 15 to 30 minutes he tested the urine and found that the same unprocessed starch grains were showing up in the urine right through the kidney organelles. And somewhat later he found it in the bile and even in the about an hour later he could find it. Find us in the cerebrospinal fluid."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the findings of Fulkheimer's experiments regarding starch grains in bodily fluids.

**RAY PEAT:** "Allergies, it's similar to auto-immunity except not so serious. The estrogen begins to rise especially in girls but in boys too around the age of 7 or 8. It's distinctly rising in the average person. And the estrogen changes the immune function. Tends to shrink the sinus gland and increase antibody production without the guidance of the sinus cells and that seems to be why it predisposes to allergies, asthma and auto immunity. Asthma is now very well recognized to be increased by birth control pills, menopausal estrogen. or even the cyclic premenstrual rise in estrogen and partly that's the effect of lowering the blood sugar because if your blood sugar falls the immune cells become much more reactive. An experimenter gave animals, first he ranked the food allergens from nuts down to some fruits and uh the mild allergens. If he lowered the animal's blood sugar with a little insulin to 50 percent of normal, the mildest allergens could kill the animals with an allergic reaction. But if he infused glucose while exposing them to even the worst allergens, the worst allergens might give them the sniffles. Or a red nose but nothing worse so just increasing glucose or decreasing it can make just a total difference in your sensitivity. And since thyroid and progesterone are the main things that allow your liver to store adequate glycogen and estrogen is the main thing that interferes with that. That's why the allergens. sensitivities of various sorts come on around puberty."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's take on her daughter's allergies, which began around puberty.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh the cultural thing is a really complex story, but the white sugar was already being blamed for causing diabetes 150 years ago, and the treatment for diabetics was to absolutely forbid sugar, which was a completely crazy idea. A French and an English doctor said that if they're losing a pound of sugar per day in their urine, they're surely going to die sooner if they don't eat any sugar. So he fed them up to 12 to 14 ounces of sugar. He said the best white granulated sugar he could buy. And he cured his patients just by feeding them as much sugar as they were losing. And the process of washing it eliminates most of the allergens, so the finest white sugar is really one of the safest foods available."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the physiological effects of sugar and why the culture has turned away from it towards artificial sweeteners.

**RAY PEAT:** "The coconut water is a pretty safe material. When the coconut is relatively fresh, the liquid should be almost clear and very sweet. And it's been used medically and it's surprisingly low in allergenicity. But the white material that is sold as milk is an industrial manufactured substance made out of basically emulsifying some of the solids and oil with the liquid from the coconut. Another source of guar gum I think is in coconut milk. And the solids in coconut are very starchy and can be pretty allergenic, so I recommend using the highly filtered deodorized form of coconut oil, which is extremely cheap. Currently it's about $50 for a five gallon pail of it, where the aromatic delicately scented ones that haven't been filtered. Some people, just a teaspoon of that can make some people very sick from an ordered shake. Reaction to the starches that are left in it and if it's for very well filtered high-quality oil It tastes fine for frying chicken I've been frying chicken in coconut oil for many years and It works with eggs, but it isn't as tasty as butter for for some foods like eggs"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the difference between coconut oils and coconut milks and their health effects, as well as recipes for coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you sent us an article Dr. P that was showing an increased risk of breast cancer in women in the Philippines who ate a lot of coconut milk in their food recipes but um just to answer your question caller the Chautauqua cells the tropical traditions expeller press coconut oil and i think you've had some of that too dr pete that seems to be the best one i found that doesn't have the coconut flavor therefore it doesn't have the allergenicity that could be provided by the coconut and it's relatively tasteless and it doesn't taste like anything basically it's the non-organic expeller press tropical traditions and they do sell it at Chautauqua."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions an article about increased breast cancer risk in the Philippines related to coconut milk consumption and recommends a specific type of coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the very pleasant ways to use the deodorized oil is to emulsify it with a little bit of egg yolk. That's all it takes if you warm. The oil and the milk, just a touch of egg yolk will allow it to emulsify about 50% oil to milk or whatever concentration you want. You can make ice cream or cheesecake, all kinds of buttery, creamy, consistency foods using, instead of cream or cream cheese, you can use the coconut oil emulsified."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat offers a suggestion for using deodorized coconut oil in recipes.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's the trace allergens, parts of the fungus or the bacteria. Aspergillosis is a very serious disease and people who work in some of these enzyme factories are exposed to dust from the microorganisms and develop allergies of various sorts, but the regulators assume that the people who eat the stuff aren't going to have the same sort of reactions. Aspergillosis, that's farmer's lung, isn't it? They get it from moldy straw and it's Another respiratory pre-occupational disease for farmers. Yeah, and all of the organisms used in manufacturing amino acids or proteins or enzymes, all of them have their risk of the impurities being left in the product. And the food producers are being pressured in various ways to give up. The natural material and buy their stuff in a can and do it like they were in a chemical lab rather than a kitchen. Many kinds of pressure are affecting the food supply so that people are coming to believe that the industrial way is necessary. You can see. Government and commercial websites that say these things are necessary for high quality food. If you're going to keep the food on the shelf for a month or two, maybe it's necessary."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about GMO microbial enzymes and vegetarian rennet used in cheese production, and why natural rennet is being replaced.

**RAY PEAT:** "For example, Nancy's cottage cheese used to be natural cottage cheese. And the way cottage cheese was always made was to drain the curd and salt it and draining it left the curd free of lactic acid. But a couple of years ago someone convinced the Nancy's yogurt people to start using what they call a dressing consisting of lactic acid and something else to dry milk powder oh yeah to give the cottage cheese a very long shelf life the lactic acid suppresses the growth of organisms but it's also just as toxic to the people who eat it as it is to the organisms that are being suppressed by it it very quickly can stimulate the whole inflammatory chain reaction the same as the polyunsaturated fat and if that inflammation is continued chronically then it increases fibrosis and the same as radiation any of these chronic inflammations eventually increase the risk of cancer and we're told it's good for us lactic acid is great for your intestinal health right that's what we're told"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses changes in cottage cheese production, specifically the addition of lactic acid for shelf life, and its potential toxic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Don't speak in in small quantities like a teaspoon for a full or so of olive oil. It's fine and safe because it's only 10 percent of the toxic polyunsaturated fats. Canola oil is very high in the polyunsaturates and it got its reputation as being a healthful oil about 30 years ago when they learned to lower the erythritic acid content, but Hanfeli demonstrated that it's is not the erythritic acid which was causing it to cause heart damage and other degenerative processes. It was the linoleic acid itself, the so-called essential fatty acid, which was causing death of heart cells. And he showed that just by adding stearic acid from cocoa butter, he could neutralize the toxic effect on the heart. So it's the ratio and the canola oil has a very high content of the dangerous polyunsaturates."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about olive oil and canola oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Natural sources of RINIT that have been used for thousands of years are animal RINIT or non-animal natural sources are fig juice, nettles, thistles, mallow, creeping charling, cardoon thistle, vinegar, lemon juice, or just letting the milks out from a curd. Artificial sources of RINIT are enzymes, vegetarian RINIT, microbial enzymes, and they are either derived from molds, so they're very allergenic, or they're genetically engineered. So vegetarian RINIT, folks, is not a safe RINIT."

**CONTEXT:** The host summarizes the discussion on rennet, contrasting natural and artificial sources.
