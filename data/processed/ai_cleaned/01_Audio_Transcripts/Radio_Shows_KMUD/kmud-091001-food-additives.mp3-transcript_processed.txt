**RAY PEAT:** Well besides any changes that it makes to the proteins and starches which will make them more likely to be allergenic any that gets into the system is going to be an antithyroid agent at least.

**CONTEXT:** What are the likely negative health effects of iodine bromate, a common additive to bread?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think the worst problem is that they are using things to carry the microbial enzymes. There is always some debris from the aspergillus or whatever the microbe is they're using as a source of the enzymes. And the genetic modification is going to make them... somewhat different, but they're already toxic and allergenic in themselves. And so even if they're perfectly normal, naturally evolved organisms, any debris from them that goes along with the enzyme is going to be very risky. But even worse than simply having microbial enzymes, where there used to be animal enzymes, to distribute and... emulsifier makes the enzymes efficiently to make them store and package so they can be canned and then just dumped into the batch. They're using seaweed materials, either carrageenan or other things that, for example, one of the... compounds that's being used to make microspheres to enclose the microbial enzymes. One of these has been used to make dental molds for taking impressions of the mouth and making restorations. One person died shortly after having some of that stuff put in his mouth. Students of dentistry, a very high proportion of them, had serious allergic reactions when they were practicing wisdom. But these things are routinely being added to foods to carry other products, and as a packaging or carrying material, they don't show up on the labels at all.

**CONTEXT:** What are the issues with genetically engineered yeasts and their carriers used in cheese production?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think that's the allergic reaction is really the only serious toxic effect.

**CONTEXT:** What are the toxic side effects of sulfites, beyond those affecting asthma patients?

**RAY PEAT:** In experiments they found that the mildest allergen would kill animals with shock if their blood sugar was lowered to 50% of normal. Oh. So this would be another good reason to defend the consumption of sugar. It's always been such a maligned substance, you know, sugar-free. If they doubled the blood sugar of the animals, even the deadly allergens would only cause a slight reddening of their nose and sniffles.

**CONTEXT:** How does blood sugar relate to allergic reactions and the consumption of sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** The body, when you have even a small tumor, the body senses a danger and increases its production of cortisol. One of the very early events in cancer is a chronic elevation of cortisol and the cortisol turns your tissues to sugar. And so if you don't eat sugar, you're not going to be able to control your blood sugar. Your body wastes away faster, and that, the wasting away of your immune system and other tissues is really what killed most people from the cancer. And so there have been experiments in which very high concentrations of glucose were put in, for example, if there was a tumor in an extremity. Where they could isolate that circulation and put a high concentration like glucose syrup into the artery feeding the leg, the sugar itself would cause the cancer to die. Wow. So it not only spares your immune system and brain and other tissues, but if it can be... delivered long enough at a high enough concentration, it allows something to happen in the cancer that can kill the cancer.

**CONTEXT:** How does the body's response to cancer, including cortisol production, relate to sugar consumption and the common belief that sugar feeds cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, everything is wrong with that belief. Going back to the middle of the 19th century, people were seeing that cancer arises in a field, they called it the cancer field, of visibly abnormal cells and after this basically inflamed area had persisted for a long time, mutant cells might appear somewhere in it. That is something that has been developed progressively over 150 years that there is such a thing as a cancer field and anything irritating or destructive that the body can't overcome will cause a progressive stressing or inflammation of the tissue and you can develop a cancer. Before there is any mutation identifiable, Harry Rubin at Berkeley is really the only official academic biologist who has worked on that topic and he has shown that there definitely is a pre-mutational definitive cancer condition and in the cancer then in that. The tissue as a whole is so unhealthy that mutations among other changes occur in the DNA. But the DNA event really is down the road from what is causing the cancer.

**CONTEXT:** How do cancer cells arise, and what is the role of mutations versus underlying tissue conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** The Hayflick Doctrine was really invented that cells can only divide 50 times. It was really invented to reinforce. This DNA centric view of biology and in fact the stem cell work has definitively shown that all cells seem to be basically stem cells and immortal given the right circumstances. And when the cancer industry is......is now forced to think about the idea of stem cells. But when they talk about a cancer stem cell, basically they are just going back to the old concept of a mutant cell and the clone of a mutant cell. They totally miss the point of the stem cell research, which is that the stem cells are normal cells which are.........able to regenerate any tissue that needs help. And the function of the tumor is some kind of a process of healing and regeneration that can't come to completion. Something is missing that would allow a tumor to let the sick cells die while the healthy cells... return to normal functioning.

**CONTEXT:** How does the concept of cell immortality and stem cells relate to cancer research?

**RAY PEAT:** Basically, the body should be rejecting the cancer transplant. It's constantly rejecting cells that go astray. And if the cell isn't appropriate for that organ or tissue, it can't live in that environment and so dies. But the animals that could accept the cancer transplants were obviously so unhealthy that their bodies didn't reject the tissue.

**CONTEXT:** How does the body's ability to reject transplanted cells relate to metastasis and susceptibility to cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. It'll stop the cells that are irradiated. It stops them right in their tracks, healthy or sick, especially the... the sick cells were going to die anyway but it'll stop the growth of healthy tissue and cause it to produce... first, it releases histamine and serotonin and tryptase enzymes that cause inflammation and degeneration locally. That's within 30 minutes of getting irradiated, there's a burst of these allergens, reactive substances. And then that leads to a chronic overproduction of collagen and the growth of repair cells, fibroblasts. So first it's inflammation, then fibrosis. And the body's trying to heal the inflammation or take care of it. And if the body can't heal this scarred, atrophied tissue, then... The cells can, they recruit cells that try to repair it and so it'll keep becoming a risk of future cancer just as part of the attempt to repair a sick tissue.

**CONTEXT:** Why does radiation therapy, which kills tumor cells, often lead to cancer recurrence?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, they're degenerating and so they can go off in many directions and so they tend to be killed very easily because they're recognized as abnormal material. And the normal function of... what's called the immune system, is to maintain the proper development and form of the body. And the phagocytosis of sick or injured tissue is really at the center of the immune system. And germs don't necessarily......trigger the immune system unless they damage something. As soon as they damage something, then the immune system tries to take care of it, cleaning up what damage has been done, and in the process they'll clear out the bacteria or viruses. But really, in the development of the organism, the immune system is really part of our... developmental, nutritional control systems.

**CONTEXT:** How does the immune system's recognition of abnormal cells relate to its role in maintaining body form and development?

**RAY PEAT:** The higher a cell's energy capacity is, the more it takes to irritate it. Okay. And so keeping your cellular energy at a maximum means that... you're pretty immune to irritation, but if something impairs your energy production, then almost anything becomes irritating. So that's what you see commonly in low-thyroid diseases. The energy production of the cell is very decreased, very much decreased, and then you can have allergic reactions or cancer come start up. And in cigarette smoke, there are not only the... Irritants and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the famous carcinogens, but they are also estrogens and irritants causing pain and inflammation and estrogen-like changes. And behind those irritants there's the carbon monoxide which blocks oxygen use and so makes the cell... spontaneously more susceptible to over stimulation or irritation and when you add up different types of stimulation and impairment of energy production then you have a greater risk of chronic inflammation and cancer.

**CONTEXT:** How does cellular energy capacity influence susceptibility to irritation and the development of cancer, as seen in cigarette smoke?

**RAY PEAT:** The Pullman's in the 1940s and 50s was showing that... It's the electronic behavior of these aromatic hydrocarbons that act as signals to the cells in the same way that estrogen substances signal the cells. And the various drug interests and government interests diverted that line of research by not financing it anymore. Instead they financed it. The molecular biology approach which is explaining away those hormonal actions of the aromatic hydrocarbons as nothing but a type of mutation. They happen to fit into the DNA very compactly and do mutate it, but really their main mechanism for mutating the DNA. is by acting as hormones that deplete the energy of the cell while overexciting it.

**CONTEXT:** How did research into aromatic hydrocarbons and their hormonal effects on cells get diverted from their original findings?

**RAY PEAT:** But sugar is very... essential for keeping your thyroid functioning up without resorting to a cortisone overproduction. And the essential nutrients, if you're getting enough sugar, will allow your thyroid to function unless the thyroid is specifically signaled to turn off by such things as polyunsaturated fatty acids. And estrogen, which are very systematically involved in turning down your metabolism. Once that weakening process starts from such things as smoke and hormone imitating toxins, then the bacteria in your intestines will produce... toxins that you absorb when your intestine is de-energized, it becomes permeable and anything in the intestine then can leak right into the bloodstream. So if you're exhausted, you might get flu-like symptoms. If your thyroid is being poisoned, then flu-like symptoms will often make you ache all over. feel exhausted and so on. So the intestine is always available as a sort of a third level of toxicity and energy poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** How does sugar contribute to thyroid function and protect against toxins, especially when the metabolism is weakened?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1980s the French did a great series of experiments showing that every stage of the thyroid hormone production and response and transport, every stage was blocked in proportion to the number of double bonds. in the unsaturated fat so the mono unsaturateds were slightly inhibiting compared to the saturated fats or sugars the two bonded two double bonds like linoleic acid were much more inhibiting and the triply or quadruply unsaturated fat such as uh the popular fish oils and omega minus three these are the most inhibiting to the the whole energy system so the bottom line there is eat coconut oil and butter and avoid all other oils olive oil in moderation yeah and sugar is really the basic protection against the toxicity of the oils so keep your blood sugar up with frequent meals and lots of fresh fruit lots of fruits yeah lots of fruit is the best sugar perfect

**CONTEXT:** What is the impact of different types of fats on thyroid function and the overall energy system, and what are the best sources of sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Starches and proteins really are very powerful stimulants to insulin. The combination of starch and polyunsaturated fats will cause the greatest disturbance of blood sugar, much more than eating white sugar candy and such. The polyunsaturated fats block the ability to use sugar, and so the cells experience a sugar deficiency and turn on stress reactions. Starches are pure glucose rather than 50-50 fructose and glucose, and so starches are much more powerful stimulants to insulin and stress reactions.

**CONTEXT:** How do starches and proteins compare to white sugar in their impact on blood sugar and insulin response, especially when combined with polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** The potassium content of fruit is really what keeps the insulin much, much lower. If you eat a piece of bread, you are getting very little potassium, but if you eat a piece of fruit with the same amount of sugar, the potassium will... pretty much take care of the insulin issue. It acts like insulin. And so when you eat a piece of fruit, you're having very little stimulation to your fat production. And the other thing, too, that I've found out is that white sugar, actually, because it's been filtered, is much less allergenic to the organism than the raw brown sugar, the rapadura sugar.

**CONTEXT:** How does the potassium content in fruit help regulate insulin response compared to starches like bread, and what is the difference in allergenicity between white and brown sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the manufacture of brown sugar, when you centrifuge it, the first wash is black strap molasses and I've noticed that there's usually a very smoky taste in the black strap and it has been a common practice to burn the cane fields to make it easier to harvest. And so, some of the brown stuff is smoke and the rest of it, if you just boil sugar, even white pure sugar, if you boil it at a very high temperature, driving off the water so that the temperature rises above 100 degrees Celsius, any impurities in it will start causing itching. Polymerization reactions and create allergens from the sugar itself and so the brown material containing a lot of biological materials other than sugar, heating that with the sugar can make some pretty intense allergens.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential allergenicity issues with brown sugar compared to white sugar, related to its processing and impurities?

**RAY PEAT:** And milk sugar. And milk sugar. And then, so that's number one. Number two would be raw honey. And then if you had to eat sugar, then it would be white sugar rather than brown, correct? Yeah. And then the starches are the least preferable form to get your sugar in because they have very little minerals to balance the high spike of glucose that's released and the high glycemic index they have, even in whole grains. Yeah, and that stimulation of insulin always leads to a surge of cortisol which tends to destroy the protein in your tissues to keep your sugar up against the effect of insulin. So eating even too much protein at a time without fruit will waste a lot of protein. I've seen people who are eating more than two pounds of meat a day who were having signs of protein deficiency with super amounts of cortisol being produced and tremendous amounts of amino acids in their urine. Wow. A waste. So not only do these starches, so yes, it's a well-known fact that cakes and cookies cause problems and diabetes. But it's not as well as the oils that are put in the cakes and the cookies, the vegetable oils, but it also can be too much protein not balanced by enough sugars can lead to the same situation.

**CONTEXT:** What are the preferred sources of sugar, and why are starches and excessive protein intake problematic?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, it's needed to make the transmitter substances. Nerve transmitter. Oh, okay. All right. So eat your fruit for antidepressant activity.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of folic acid in relation to depression?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, more and more people are recognizing the importance of aspirin and stopping inflammation. And that is not always interpreted appropriately, but... As we age, we accumulate more and more of the polyunsaturated fats in our tissues. And under stress, we have those circulating in the blood. And that means that they are available more and more chronically to produce the inflammatory prostaglandins. And so aspirin is, in a way, an anti-aging. It's a defense against a lifetime of accumulating polyunsaturated fats and it's now known that it prevents essentially all kinds of cancer to some degree if you have used it chronically but it's now being used therapeutically backing up other more conventional or toxic treatments but it's a very safe treatment. It's use is increasing. Aspirin has been around for a long time. It's very cheap. But originally they derived acetylsalicylic acid from, or precursors to that compound, from white willow bark and meadow sweet and other herbs. So it's a very ancient remedy.

**CONTEXT:** What is exciting about current cancer treatment approaches, and what is the role of aspirin?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the aspirin should be backed up always with plenty of vitamin K and not the synthetic K but natural K1 and K2. And vitamin K happens to be......structurally extremely similar to a tropical botanical drug called lapacho or lapachon. And that has been used for generations with lots of success for treating cancer. And it's analogous to several other drugs that have a good history of treating cancer. Emodin from aloe. And Caspera is structurally analogous to vitamin K and tetracycline, the microbial antibiotic. It has considerable anti-cancer action, but it doesn't kill the cancer cells necessarily. It protects the organism the same way Caspera does to protect the mitochondria.

**CONTEXT:** What should be taken with aspirin to mitigate its potential side effects, and what is the connection to lapacho and other anti-cancer substances?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, um, well you get similar things in fruits in the safest way, I think. Okay. Oranges have some substances that are even safer and better than quercetin. And, uh, narinjanin. For example, that's my favorite thing in that category. And also nettle leaf, not only is it high in vitamin K, I always like to go on about nettles. It's very high in vitamin K, but it also has quercetin as well as lots of minerals and antihistamine function. Well, the quercetin is part of the antihistamine function.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on quercetin for staying healthy, and what are safer alternatives?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, um... Yeah, the MediHerb tablets, I think you'd probably need to be using, I mean, if you're talking about just an anti-inflammatory effect daily, probably about one tablet daily, maybe split up into a couple doses, but if you're talking about an anti-cancer dose, it'd probably be more like nine tablets a day. White Willow Bark, see, White Willow Bark itself is so, you have to take so much of it, so if you make a tea, you have to drink a lot of tea. That's why when it's standardized and concentrated, it's more effective. And it is a problem with the aspirins, they have starches and other odd, weird ingredients in them, but the one brand that doesn't have as many terrible ingredients is the Western Family brand if you were looking for aspirin. Otherwise, for White Willow Bark, we have a standardized White Willow Bark powder. that is standardized to contain a certain amount of salicylic acid and the therapeutic dose is much easier with a couple capsules a day rather than gallons of white willow bark tea.

**CONTEXT:** What would be an average or therapeutic dosage of white willow bark, and what are the considerations regarding aspirin and its ingredients?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I haven't been following it recently but I've checked in on them over the last several decades and I see a lot of fraud. One lecture tour sponsored by them was to show that they had cured lung cancer and leukemia and this famous biologist from... University of California was using phony statistics to make it look like the American Cancer Society was responsible for the disappearance of both leukemia and lung cancer and the figures simply didn't show it for lung cancer if you use the right kind of statistics and the ending of atomic bomb testing. It was not accounted for the drop in childhood leukemia but they do propagandistic things pretty habitually I think.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the American Cancer Society and the current state of cancer treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the drug companies really want a good drug for them is something that you pay all your money for and keep taking as long as you're alive and they don't want people getting cured with something like aspirin and fruit juice. They would take their power away with them.

**CONTEXT:** Why do promising anti-cancer substances researched by scientists often not reach hospitals for patient treatment?
