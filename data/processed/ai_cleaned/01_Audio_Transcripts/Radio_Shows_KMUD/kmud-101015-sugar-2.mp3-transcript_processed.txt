**RAY PEAT:** "I've been writing a newsletter on health issues for about 30 years and I started that about eight years after... finishing my PhD research at the University of Oregon. Part of the reason for starting my own newsletter was seeing that the journals, science journals, are very doctrinaire and influenced by industry. So, since doing my study at the University of Oregon, I've been reading lots and......experimenting some on my own."
**CONTEXT:** Introduction of Dr. Ray Peat's background and motivation for his work.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, that actually started about 200 years ago anyway. At that time, they had defined... diabetes as the sugar disease because they discovered glucose in the urine and the mechanically thinking doctors said that if you don't put glucose in, it can't come out, but in fact, the glucose was being produced by dissolving the protein in the person's body and it turned out that the worst thing you can do is to starve them first. Sugar, because that accelerates the breakdown of both protein and fat. Two doctors, at least, in the 19th century, went against that conventional opinion and started giving their patients the amount of sugar extra in their diet that they were losing in the urine, figuring that they would die more slowly from diabetes. They found that they actually recovered very quickly and that curative effect of large amounts of sugar have been fairly recently demonstrated in animal experiments and in vitro experiments in which sugar stimulates the regeneration of pancreatic insulin producing cells."
**CONTEXT:** The historical misconception about sugar and diabetes, and the early evidence of sugar's therapeutic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, monkeys for example, who normally live on fruit, they've found that when fruit is scarce, they develop very high cortisol levels and that is something that pretty much happens in any animal individually....has a mixed diet containing carbohydrates. Some animals like reptiles can get along nicely on a protein diet and we can turn protein into sugar too, sugar and fat, but it happens that one of the effects of the sugar is to inhibit the cortisol which turns... protein nd the sugar so we have a spare protein don't have to eat so much of it and that has some beneficial effect the cortisol has many side effects other than breaking down the tissue proteins at the same time that it helps to digest protein foods and it changes the whole arrangement of......the way that metabolism works, so it's better if we can minimize cortisol. And the sugars also inhibit the chronic release of free fatty acids from storage, so that our body, our brain in particular, and some tissues such as the red blood cells, strongly prefer sugars over fats. and function better, and when we get enough sugar, we inhibit the release of fats from storage and allow these tissues to have all the sugar they need."
**CONTEXT:** The necessity of sugar for preventing cortisol-induced protein breakdown and for optimal brain and tissue function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, not only your... The cortisol is stimulated, dissolves, can dissolve various organs that will then release different free fatty acids and or proteins that the body will convert into sugar. So that's a less preferable backup mechanism. And the famous Arctic explorer, I forget his name, Bill Yalmer. Something reported that people that he knew their ages approximately seemed to be many years older by appearance than they really were and he didn't exactly know what the cause of that was but they were eating a mostly fattened meat diet. Fattened people. I try to lose weight by fasting. What happens is for a day or so their cortisol is still high and their metabolic rate is fairly high and so what they're living on temporarily is a meat diet as they dissolve themselves their muscles and fat. The thymus gland is one of the first to be dissolved and since we would eat ourselves up in just two or three weeks if we kept eating at the same rate our metabolic rate slows down drastically under the influence of these free amino acids liberated from our tissues and those turn the thyroid hormone off. The falling blood sugar and the rising free amino acids and nd free fatty acids all of these turn our metabolic rate down and then we can get along on a very low calorie intake but it slows down reproductive function, brain function, everything."
**CONTEXT:** The detrimental effects of fasting and protein-heavy diets, leading to cortisol elevation and metabolic slowdown.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah or pretty much anything because fasting turns off the liver's ability to detoxify things. So you're exposing yourself to increased toxins rather than decreased. The only thing that benefits is the intestine from not putting bad stuff into it. It gives the intestine a break but in the meantime you harm your liver and other organs."
**CONTEXT:** The negative impact of fasting on liver detoxification.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think for a person of normal activity and eating mixed foods, that's..."
**CONTEXT:** Recommended daily sugar intake. (The specific number is not provided in this excerpt, but the context implies a range of 170-250 grams).

**RAY PEAT:** "Lactose has a lot of special properties. So, it's a very good sugar. It's somewhat slowly absorbed, but it stimulates digestion. So, it's something that people often overlook as a sugar. It helps with the calcium metabolism, absorbing the other nutrients in milk. Sucrose consists of one unit of glucose and one of fructose. And that is fairly quickly broken into the components when we eat it. And the glucose stimulates insulin. And when they're eaten together, fructose, besides not itself stimulating insulin, it actually... slightly inhibits the release of insulin. So if you ate pure glucose, you would get a stronger insulin reaction. And in most situations, if you eat slightly faster than you're metabolizing, a surge of excess glucose is going to turn on your fat metabolism. And so when you take sucrose with a little bit of... the fructose component, it will moderate the secretion of insulin and the production of fat deposed."
**CONTEXT:** The beneficial properties of lactose and sucrose, and how fructose moderates insulin response and fat storage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Glucose is pretty essential for keeping the thyroid functioning. Optimally, but fructose does some extra things that cause it to raise your temperature and metabolic rate more than glucose alone would."
**CONTEXT:** The synergistic effect of fructose with glucose in supporting thyroid function and increasing metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Mostly fruits. Mostly fruits and honey and white sugar also have a little bit of fructose in them as well. Yeah."
**CONTEXT:** Sources of beneficial sugars like fructose.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thirty or forty years ago there was quite a bit of publishing activity relating to the high diabetes effects of... fructose because exactly of that stimulating effect on the metabolism but something is happening currently the last three or four years besides forgetting all of that they are inventing a lot of new stuff to direct people away from the anti-diabetic effect of fructose. Supposedly some of the motivation of that is the popularity of what they call the high fructose corn syrup or corn sweeteners. And those are more fattening than sugar, but it isn't because they are actually high in fructose. They have slightly more fructose than glucose, but a group in Los Angeles a few weeks ago... measured the amounts in some soft drinks and found that they accurately reported the content of fructose and glucose. But when they hydrolyzed the material, they found that there was much more carbohydrate in the drink than just the fructose and glucose. That's the reason. About four to five times as much caloric value in some kind of carbohydrate present in the drink that was not glucose or fructose, so if you have four or five times more food in your soda pop than you were thinking, you're going to be more likely to get fat, not because fructose is fattening, butâ€¦ Just because you're getting a huge amount of pretty much the equivalent of eating flour. So a huge amount of starch that strongly stimulates insulin, and insulin stores that starchy sugar as fat. Whereas if it was actually sucrose from white sugar, then it would be much easier for your body to store as glycogen in the liver."
**CONTEXT:** The mischaracterization of high-fructose corn syrup and the importance of distinguishing it from natural sucrose, highlighting the issue of excess starch in processed drinks.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a few years ago some samples were analyzed and then the government decided to drop it as soon as they saw that. They were full of mercury, and then the industry supposedly corrected itself, but the government isn't keeping up on it."
**CONTEXT:** Concerns about heavy metal contamination in high-fructose corn syrup.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, one of the things that has turned up a lot in recent years is breakdown of muscle, skeletal muscle. First, pains and then sometimes a seepage of enzymes and myoglobin into the blood damaging the kidneys. Well, the Lipitor is a statin drug, I believe. So aren't statins really hard on your liver, Dr. Pete? Yeah. And it's through that effect, I think, that they affect the muscles. The muscles are destabilized. If they aren't getting enough cholesterol, all of your organs, including the brain, suffer when your liver isn't supplying enough cholesterol, even though other cells can make it."
**CONTEXT:** Side effects of statin drugs like Lipitor, including muscle breakdown and liver strain, linked to cholesterol reduction.

**RAY PEAT:** "There was a study a few years ago of older people in nursing homes, for example, looking at their cholesterol as they aged and seeing what the life expectancy was in relation to cholesterol. The longest-lived people, I think, were up around 280 milligrams of cholesterol. So if it's not above 300 or so, then it's probably safer to have a little high cholesterol than to take these medicines that would compromise your liver, kidneys and muscles. Yeah, a Framingham study about 20 years ago saw that after the age of 50, people who have below 200 cholesterol are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. It's a very protective substance."
**CONTEXT:** The protective role of cholesterol and the potential dangers of artificially lowering it, with evidence suggesting higher cholesterol levels can be associated with longer lifespans and protection against neurodegenerative diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are some good articles. Chris Masterjohn has one. I think I have one on my website. Well, I don't have a computer. I don't do the internet. It was basically developed as a way to sell drugs. And products and it never since the 1930s it's been known that hypothyroid people are susceptible to many diseases including heart disease and that hypothyroidism is the basic cause of increased cholesterol because cholesterol has to be converted to progesterone under the influence. of thyroid hormones so if you're low in thyroid hormone your body increases cholesterol to keep the progesterone production going."
**CONTEXT:** The link between hypothyroidism, increased cholesterol, and the role of cholesterol in progesterone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well my daughter actually takes thyroid. She apparently has thyroid. Well maybe she needs to take a T3 T4 drug called thyrolar. She's probably only taking synthroid or or lavoxil. The metabolic rate is a mirror image. of the blood cholesterol level so that when your metabolic rate is below normal your cholesterol will defensively rise above normal and as you increase your metabolic rate your cholesterol will come down as a mirror image but doctors have disregarded the effect on the metabolic rate and they prescribe only high. The inactive part of the thyroid hormone and very often people stay hypometabolic despite taking thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** The inadequacy of T4-only thyroid medication (like Synthroid) and the importance of T3/T4 combinations for metabolic health, explaining how cholesterol levels mirror metabolic rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Definitely. It's not necessarily sugars that people should cut out, but it's the refined carbohydrates that they need to lower, to lose weight. The starches and the polyunsaturated fats are the main culprits in fatness."
**CONTEXT:** The primary drivers of fat gain are refined carbohydrates (starches) and polyunsaturated fats, not sugars themselves.

**RAY PEAT:** "The unsaturated fats are very reactive with oxygen, and the bloodstream is where there's the most oxygen for them to react with. The unsaturated fats that we make in the liver. If we eat too much sugar and are low thyroid and have high estrogen and high cortisol and such, we might have high triglycerides. But these made in the liver are saturated and they happen to be protective to the heart. So the thing is to avoid the things that cause the distorted blood lipids not to try to lower them. The lipids themselves, but to remove the cause."
**CONTEXT:** The reactive nature of unsaturated fats and their role in arterial plaque formation, contrasting them with protective saturated fats produced by the liver. The focus should be on addressing the root causes of lipid distortion, not just lowering lipid levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, that Splenda I think is the one that has chlorine in the molecule. And that. Exposed to bacteria, the bacteria can break down the molecule and liberate things in the family of organic chlorine compounds like chloroform related toxic substances so I wouldn't want my intestine exposed to Splenda."
**CONTEXT:** Concerns about the safety of artificial sweeteners like Splenda due to the presence of chlorine and potential for toxic byproducts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, our sugar is so much more nourishing, protective."
**CONTEXT:** The superiority of natural sugars over artificial sweeteners for nourishment and protection.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think there actually could be a difference because when chickens are kept in tiny boxes where the eggs won't get fertilized, they're... under extreme stress, and the stress is undoubtedly reflected in the egg, and so if they have the freedom of movement that would be necessary for fertilization, I think the eggs are going to be healthier."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for stress in egg-laying hens to affect the quality and healthfulness of their eggs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, one of the things that Zamenhof did besides adding glucose to the eggs or glycine was another thing it turns into glucose. He added progesterone and found that that also keeps the brain growing and it helps to stabilize, make more efficient use....of glucose and that glucose and progesterone work together, women with low progesterone tend to have unstable low blood sugar and many more problems with, all through the pregnancy, mostly related to ups and downs of blood sugar."
**CONTEXT:** The role of progesterone in supporting fetal brain development and stabilizing blood sugar during pregnancy.

**RAY PEAT:** "If your diet isn't providing either glucose or the mixture of glucose and fructose, your liver can't activate the thyroid hormone as fully. If you're living on a high protein diet and fad, your liver... will slow your whole body metabolism down and that's just as effective as if your thyroid gland had shut down. Now you're saying this because the liver converts T4, which is the inactive hormone, into T3. Yeah, the liver makes about 60 or 70 percent of the active hormone and once your liver slows down, if you try to boost it just with the... thyroxin T4, that will tend to turn your own thyroid hormone production down, so if you're going to supplement it has to be a balanced T3 and T4, but often just by avoiding the things that inhibit the conversion of thyroxin to the active form, avoiding too much of the muscle meat. Avoiding the polyunsaturated fats and getting enough of the pro-thyroid nutrients and chemicals. Sucrose and lactose are both effective at maintaining your production of thyroid active hormones."
**CONTEXT:** The critical role of glucose and fructose in liver's activation of thyroid hormone (T3). High protein/fat diets and polyunsaturated fats inhibit this conversion, leading to hypothyroidism. Balanced T3/T4 supplementation is preferred over T4 alone. Sucrose and lactose support thyroid hormone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, if a person really wants to concentrate on... on losing weight, using milk as their main protein, milk and gelatin, are the most favorable for weight loss, partly because the milk comes with such a generous supply of calcium, and calcium powerfully stimulates the metabolic rate. And having enough salt in your food is another thing. The salt and the calcium interact. To stimulate your metabolic rate, the sugar in itself, the fructose in particular, activates the whole range of cells independently even, but it activates the production of the active thyroid hormone. Apart from that, these things activate cells even if you're deficient in thyroid hormones. You can keep the activity going to a great extent with time. Sucrose, salt, and calcium."
**CONTEXT:** Recommendations for weight loss: prioritizing milk and gelatin for protein, ensuring adequate calcium and salt intake, and utilizing sucrose and fructose to stimulate metabolic rate and thyroid hormone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "So, the polyunsaturates, just in case there's some listeners that haven't heard our shows and Dr. Pete's discussion on polyunsaturated fatty acids, those are powerfully thyroid toxic oils, and they are found practically everywhere. They're corn oil, soy oil, canola, safflower, sunflower, hemp. Flax seed, fish oil, cotton seed, rapeseed, well that's British jelly, but it's canola in this country. All those different vegetable liquid oils, no canola is not corn oil. All those liquid vegetable oils are very very powerfully thyroid toxic and they block the thyroid hormone in many different locations."
**CONTEXT:** Identification of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as thyroid-toxic and their widespread presence in common vegetable oils.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that was a whole series of studies that showed that they inhibit the secretion from the gland by blocking the digestive proteolytic enzymes and they block the transport in the bloodstream and several different places in the cells. One of the... protein or enzymes that binds and reacts to the thyroid hormone happens to be a key enzyme in the response to fructose. It's activated both by thyroid and fructose. And the key of respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, is activated both by thyroid and fructose. And the polyunsaturated fats block these intracellular places as well as the transport and production."
**CONTEXT:** The multi-faceted mechanism by which PUFAs disrupt thyroid hormone function, including blocking secretion, transport, and cellular enzyme activity, particularly those involved in fructose metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ghee and butter are saturated fats, so they are not thyroid toxic and they are very liver supportive. And they would not be amongst that list of corn, canola, soy, cottonseed, sunflower, safflower. In fact, these saturated fats, they're being researched as cures for liver disease because they're so protective to cells that are under attack from the polyunsaturated fats. Alcoholic liver disease is being treated with the highly saturated fats such as butter and waxes from palm trees and cane and so on."
**CONTEXT:** The protective and liver-supportive nature of saturated fats like butter and ghee, in contrast to the toxicity of PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** "So if someone's going to drink, then they want to have a vodka and orange juice, right? Yeah, the fructose actually detoxifies the alcohol better than ordinary glucose."
**CONTEXT:** The benefit of fructose in detoxifying alcohol.

**RAY PEAT:** "The metabolic rate is a mirror image. of the blood cholesterol level so that when your metabolic rate is below normal your cholesterol will defensively rise above normal and as you increase your metabolic rate your cholesterol will come down as a mirror image but doctors have disregarded the effect on the metabolic rate and they prescribe only high. The inactive part of the thyroid hormone and very often people stay hypometabolic despite taking thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** The inverse relationship between metabolic rate and blood cholesterol levels, and how doctors often overlook this by prescribing only T4 thyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "So what do you think? Okay, so it protects a lot of things, but why do they think it's so bad that it's going to give you a heart attack? There was a study a few years ago of older people in nursing homes, for example, looking at their cholesterol as they aged and seeing what the life expectancy was in relation to cholesterol. The longest-lived people, I think, were up around 280 milligrams of cholesterol. So if it's not above 300 or so, then it's probably safer to have a little high cholesterol than to take these medicines that would compromise your liver, kidneys and muscles. Yeah, a Framingham study about 20 years ago saw that after the age of 50, people who have below 200 cholesterol are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. It's a very protective substance."
**CONTEXT:** The protective role of cholesterol, with studies indicating longer lifespans and reduced risk of Alzheimer's at higher cholesterol levels, suggesting that the risks of cholesterol-lowering drugs outweigh the perceived dangers of slightly elevated cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** "The starches and the polyunsaturated fats are the main culprits in fatness."
**CONTEXT:** Identifying starches and polyunsaturated fats as the primary contributors to obesity.

**RAY PEAT:** "The unsaturated fats are very reactive with oxygen, and the bloodstream is where there's the most oxygen for them to react with. The unsaturated fats that we make in the liver.

**CONTEXT:** Starches and polyunsaturated fats are the primary causes of weight gain.

**RAY PEAT:** "The unsaturated fats are very reactive with oxygen, and the bloodstream is where there's the most oxygen for them to react with. The unsaturated fats that we make in the liver. If we eat too much sugar and are low thyroid and have high estrogen and high cortisol and such, we might have high triglycerides. But these made in the liver are saturated and they happen to be protective to the heart. So the thing is to avoid the things that cause the distorted blood lipids not to try to lower them. The lipids themselves, but to remove the cause."
**CONTEXT:** Unsaturated fats are reactive and contribute to arterial issues. Saturated fats produced by the liver are protective. The focus should be on eliminating the causes of lipid imbalance, not just lowering the lipids themselves.

**RAY PEAT:** "The metabolic rate is a mirror image. of the blood cholesterol level so that when your metabolic rate is below normal your cholesterol will defensively rise above normal and as you increase your metabolic rate your cholesterol will come down as a mirror image but doctors have disregarded the effect on the metabolic rate and they prescribe only high. The inactive part of the thyroid hormone and very often people stay hypometabolic despite taking thyroid."
