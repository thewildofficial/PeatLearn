**RAY PEAT:** About 50 years ago or so, when I was in school, they were teaching that inflammation is part of the curative healing process, so we needed to kill germs and heal. But in the last 10 or 20 years, the change has been seeing it occurring in all of the degenerative diseases: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart disease, arthritis, and so on. So it's pretty abrupt in the 20th century that there was this sudden change to seeing inflammation as at least not all good, maybe all bad.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, could you briefly discuss what people generally understand when they hear the word "inflammation," and how that understanding has evolved?

**RAY PEAT:** Metchnikov had worked primarily as an embryologist, understanding the organization of developing primitive organisms and more complex. When he saw the phagocyte process, when he put a splinter in an organism and saw the cells gathering around it, he interpreted that in the context of what he knew best, which was how the organisms create and maintain their body structure. And it was partly the fact that the Nobel Prize went simultaneously to him with that very biological view of immunity, and to Erlich. Who was working with chemical poisons, and the idea of immunity as killing bad organisms took over throughout the United States and most of the world for most of the 20th century. And that as Americans started studying the white blood cells and the thymus gland and things that we think of as part of the immune system, they were influenced by the drug industry. Ehrlich's looking for the bullets to kill the evil organisms. And that passed over to thinking about antibodies and cells as aimed primarily at organisms that are trying to take over.

**CONTEXT:** How did Metchnikov's view of immunity differ from Erlich's, and how did this influence the understanding of the immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** The retroviruses in general, we've got lots of them, and they seem to be as much part of us as anything, and they don't do anything that for sure is harmful. And if you mess up an organ like poison the liver, you get a bunch of these retroviruses. Why they call them retro is that normally DNA makes RNA and RNA makes protein, but there are enzymes which will turn RNA into DNA, and that was first observed in 1979. But at that time, Trocin and Plamarc, they had been totally weeded out. In the late 1940s, with the Cold War, all of Plamarc's followers were fired from all of the teaching positions in the U.S., and so in 1979, when the idea that information could go from RNA to DNA was demonstrated, my professors unanimously said it's impossible. That's my mark and I'm not permitted.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed retroviruses and their potential role in disease. Can you elaborate on this, particularly in relation to the concept of genetic change and how it relates to your understanding of viruses?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, in many countries there was a schistosomiasis epidemic. It was pretty chronic and a very high percentage of Egyptians had it, and they were treated for that with some chemicals that injured their liver. And now they say that it was caused by spreading a virus, but other experiments suggest that just the chemical treatment that was aimed at killing this parasite could have been enough to cause the livers to express retroviruses, one of which is now called hepatitis C. So it's looking at the disease as a damaged particle rather than an infectious organism.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned an example from Egypt regarding schistosomiasis treatment and liver damage. Can you explain how this relates to the idea of disease being a damaged particle rather than an infectious organism?

**RAY PEAT:** If you look at the injury of the fetus, it heals without inflammation and it doesn't produce a scar and basically it's perfect healing. At a very early stage you can split the embryo and each part of the embryo will grow into a complete animal, but later in development you can cut or otherwise injure a part of the fetus and it simply zips itself shut, makes new cells and doesn't leave a scar or inflammation and it's after being born that inflammation as we know it occurs. We need to all crawl back into our mother's womb. And there are two things that happen when we're born. One is our carbon dioxide exposure goes way down. And the oxygen availability increases greatly. Sort of shift away from carbon dioxide, which is anti-inflammatory. And at the same time, when we're no longer protected by the uterus and placenta, which act as a filter, they let very little polyunsaturated fat in. Practically all newborns are considered deficient in the essential fatty acids, so called. But these begin building up during childhood from practically any diet that we're exposed to. And that combined with the reduced availability of carbon dioxide, you can account for basically all of the features of inflammation and degeneration that are distinct from the prenatal healing process. We still have some of the features of prenatal healing, and they can be recovered to some extent. For example, if you pack a wound with sugar, you can recover it practically. It heals without a scar and that's partly because it's not exactly approaching prenatal conditions but it's giving an extremely generous supply of sugar which can be used to make carbon dioxide. This is behind the Greeks using honey in deep wounds. But sugar makes it unnecessary for the cells to metabolize any of the fatty acids so that even if the organism has been eating them and integrating them into the tissues, the presence of sugar makes it possible to energize and repair cells without drawing down more of these unsaturated fats which produce all of the features that we know of as inflammation as distinct from healing.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the difference between fetal healing and post-natal inflammation, and what factors contribute to this change?

**RAY PEAT:** Another of the very basic things promoting inflammation rather than healing is the endotoxin from bacteria that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. And if your liver is well nourished and well energized, it can cut out practically 100% of the endotoxin. But if the intestine is stressed in any way, which can be nervous stress, increasing the adrenaline, it cuts down the blood supply. The reduced blood supply does things like release histamine and serotonin which make the intestine more permeable, letting more of the endotoxin get into the bloodstream. And the endotoxin does the same thing throughout the body. It increases the permeability, lowers the energy, increases the inefficiency that shows up as inflammation in its various things such as swelling, turning red, local heating because of the high blood supply. So, basically, stress is a big killer along with other things that promote inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** What role does endotoxin play in inflammation, and how can stress exacerbate this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping the intestine as clean as possible, moving stuff along. Raw carrots or bamboo shoots happen to be antiseptic vegetable material that doesn't feed the bacteria and tends to suppress the bacterial growth so that it doesn't come too far up the intestine, and they also bind the endotoxin and other chemicals that should be eliminated. If the intestine is sluggish, what the liver has excreted into the bile trying to get rid of will be reabsorbed farther down the intestine and come back to poison the liver. And if you keep a stream of good, clean material moving through, you can lower the toxins that should be excreted, and that would include unwanted hormones, including estrogen, which the liver should be able to 100% eliminate. As they reach the liver, it will reduce the endotoxin and shift the serotonin and histamine such that it will also lower the cortisol production and that total pattern will increase the good hormone progesterone, testosterone, for example.

**CONTEXT:** What are some practical ways to keep the intestine clean and reduce the absorption of endotoxins?

**RAY PEAT:** Some of them are very helpful. I mentioned that cleaning the intestine will lower the production of cortisol and raise the pregnenolone, testosterone and progesterone. Our natural most powerful anti-inflammatory thing is to stabilize the fetus is exposed to an extremely high concentration of progesterone until it's born. And so keeping our production of progesterone as high as possible can make a big difference in susceptibility, inflammation and degeneration. But aspirin and related things, a lot of fruit chemicals are similar to aspirin and have a protective effect.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond dietary and gut health, what other natural anti-inflammatory substances or hormones can help reduce inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** There's another one in grapefruit that happens to poison an enzyme system in the liver, letting estrogen accumulate tremendously. And this is such a well-known medical fact that in Fortuna Maternity Ward they say, we no longer serve grapefruit juice to our pregnant mothers because it interferes with the hormones. They didn't specify that it blocked the P450 enzyme, which helps the liver excrete excessively high, or all of the excess estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned grapefruit juice interfering with liver enzymes. Can you elaborate on this and its effect on estrogen levels?

**RAY PEAT:** About 70 years ago people were noticing that food restriction could increase lifespan 30 or 40 percent. Then it has gone through phases in which they saw that this could happen in even adult animals could live longer and healthier by reducing the food intake. But then they started trying different specific foods. And it happens that the foods which are eliminated are those which produce inflammation in various ways. For example, the polyunsaturated fats and the amino acids that contribute to inflammation such as tryptophan and methionine. Just eliminating one of these will increase longevity about 30 or 40 percent in animal studies.

**CONTEXT:** What have animal studies shown regarding food restriction and longevity, and which specific foods, when eliminated, have shown the most significant impact?

**RAY PEAT:** At high altitudes, all of these long-lived cultures in South America and the Caucasus and Nepal, they all lived at fairly high altitudes and were surrounded by glaciers in most of the cases, so that they're drinking water that was fairly recently high-altitude snow, which happens to be isotopically different from sea-level water. It's been refined by a repeated distillation as it rains out going to higher and higher altitudes. It becomes a metabolically stimulating light water. Where average water contains some of the metabolic, flowing, heavy water. But at the same time, the atmosphere at high altitudes is very low in oxygen, and so people retain more carbon dioxide in their tissues. That's another resemblance of the prenatal condition. And generally, they are sheep farmers, sheep can live at relatively high altitudes, and so they tend to either eat vegetables, fruits, or cheese, lots of cheese and milk-related dishes.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the potential benefits of high-altitude living for longevity. Can you explain the factors at play, such as water composition and CO2 levels, and how they relate to prenatal conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1930s when they first made isotopic clay, heavy water with deuterium replacing hydrogen, they found that it slowed biological processes, the daily rhythm, nerve conduction. And in 1950, they showed in mouse experiments that it tremendously accelerated the aging process. All of the features of aging, slowing metabolism and dying prematurely were produced. But it took about 50 years after that before people started experimenting with the light water from which the heavy water had been removed, and they found that, for example, they were experimenting with it in Russian space vehicles and they found that the condensed sweat had been filtered and it was a very light water resembling glacier water.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the difference between "heavy water" and "light water" and their respective effects on biological processes and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** The good effect of those serotonin uptake inhibitors, I think it's really other things, not at all serotonin. I think it's in spite of the serotonin. If you look at the history of serotonin, you see that in the 1950s it was discovered to be what makes the carcinoid syndrome or the carcinoid tumor so bad. And the tumor itself, instead of turning almost all of our dietary tryptophan into niacin, these tumors turn the bulk of it, more than half of it, into serotonin. And so they flood us, they're worse than Prozac. And the features well-defined for this massive overdosing of serotonin are a good insight into what's going on with the drug industry. The people flushed became depressed, anxious, and aggressive under the influence of serotonin, developed arthritic pains, a whole range of inflammatory degenerative symptoms. The skin would eventually thicken, heart valves would become fibrotic, and these are things that are now being seen associated with the uptake inhibitors: osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, obesity. And here serotonin is the supposed good guy. And it's just another mediator of inflammatory responses.

**CONTEXT:** You've expressed skepticism about the purported benefits of serotonin uptake inhibitors. Can you explain your reasoning, particularly in relation to the effects of serotonin itself?

**RAY PEAT:** I think pregnenolone, thyroid, and coffee are very helpful. Coffee? Yeah, you have to adjust to the coffee, but it goes with thyroid, sugar, progesterone, and so on, as part of an anti-inflammatory system. When we were talking about the anti-inflammatory substances, I should have mentioned caffeine as one of them. And also too with caffeine, if you're already running on a lot of adrenaline and you get very low blood sugar, if you drink caffeine that can worsen the symptoms. But if you restock your liver's glycogen stores through eating sugars that are lower glycemic index, but more importantly non-starchy sugars, then your body will not respond to the adrenaline like it would if you have very low blood sugar, so that's a process of adapting.

**CONTEXT:** What are some effective strategies for managing withdrawal symptoms from Prozac, and what role do substances like pregnenolone, thyroid, and coffee play?

**RAY PEAT:** Arnica is a very anti-inflammatory flower, and you really need to have an oil made from arnica. You'd want to make a macerated oil, and this is how we make it, and then we don't actually sell it to stores for retail like we do herbal tinctures. No, it grows at high elevations. I mean, I imagine it grows in the European Alps. Well, and also in Montana. It's Arnica Montana is the Latin name. But it doesn't grow around here. I don't know if you could get it to grow around here because it is such a high elevation plant. The strict sense of the word Montana is mountain. I thought it did grow in the US. Maybe up in Montana. There's lots of mountains up there. So it's definitely not... I thought it did grow in the mountainous United States. Anyways, we can check on that and see if I'm right or wrong here on the Montana, but you want to make a heat maceration in order to extract the anti-inflammatory compounds and you don't want to take it internally. I definitely don't recommend you take it internally, but it can really help to alleviate bruises and tendon sprains and tears just by rubbing the oil on the affected area immediately after the injury. It works really, really well. I've seen lots of evidence for it myself.

**CONTEXT:** How does arnica work to reduce inflammation, and what is the proper way to prepare and use it?

**RAY PEAT:** The gervishes in the 1920s and 30s were demonstrating that if you used quartz that passes certain frequencies of ultraviolet, they demonstrated that cells could stimulate cell division across the thin sheet of quartz, and that is being taken up again in the last ten years. More people demonstrating coherence. There are variations on that. One person is arguing and demonstrating that that cells sense and respond to infrared frequencies, but the most of the work is in the ultraviolet frequency of communication.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned research on cells communicating through quartz. Can you elaborate on this phenomenon and the frequencies involved?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the carbon dioxide is one of the sort of a hormone of metabolism, it acts like a universal hormone keeping everything in the optimal condition. For example, it holds histamine and serotonin in a bound position, it holds calcium in a bound position. If you just hyperventilate and lower your CO2 within a minute, your platelets, for example, which carry most of the serotonin in your blood in a harmless state, just a minute of hyperventilation will cause the platelets to release the serotonin and immediately cause capillaries to become permeable, leaking fluid out into your lungs so you can create pulmonary edema with a minute of hyperventilation just because you've messed up the carbon dioxide concentration.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide function as a metabolic hormone, and what are the immediate effects of lowering CO2 levels in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** I think Duesberg said we all contain hundreds of them. And we do. When there's an injury to the tissue, we do form antibodies. And some people will say that's evidence that they're an alien thing. But many years ago, someone did an experiment, I think it was rabbit cartilage. They removed a piece of cartilage and they would replace the untampered with cartilage in one group of rabbits, and it would just didn't produce any reaction. But if they twisted the cartilage just enough to damage the structure, just as you would if you fell and twisted your knee or something, when they put that one back in the same rabbit, it produced the rabbit produced antibodies to it like it was an alien thing. But what that means about antibodies in the case of our antibodies to retroviruses or whatever is that they're a part of a cleanup process. Something is disturbed, the antibodies are part of preparing the situation for our phagocytes to go in and remove the damaged material.

**CONTEXT:** You've suggested that we all carry numerous retroviruses. How does the immune system's response, such as antibody production, relate to the concept of a "cleanup process" rather than an attack on foreign invaders?

**RAY PEAT:** So, in the thyroid, people think about autoimmune antibodies as causing the problem. But just an excess of thyroid stimulating hormone because something is blocking the function, the pituitary increases its drive against the thyroid gland, and that overstimulation causes something like inflammation. And the body is cleaning up the damaged or stressed thyroid cells when it produces antibodies. And so if you keep the thyroid stimulating hormone low enough, the cleanup will proceed and the antibodies will disappear.

**CONTEXT:** How does the concept of autoimmune antibodies in thyroid conditions differ from the conventional understanding, and what role does thyroid stimulating hormone play?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, the celiac disease is one of the causes of both skin disease and arthritis. The celiac disease, among other things, will allow endotoxin into your circulation. Right. And low thyroid is probably the most common thing associated with just ordinary eczema. And that's because when your thyroid is low, the circulation to your intestine is poor, the serotonin is high, and this combination of endotoxin and serotonin, for example, will cause the skin to have abnormal growth patterns.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between celiac disease, eczema, and low thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, they can very clearly demonstrate the enzymes involved in it, but I think gluten is toxic in itself to anyone. It's just that some people are more resistant to it. It has an overlap with the transglutaminase enzyme, and there's a lot of it in the skin and in the intestine. And it happens to be an enzyme that's activated by estrogen. And I think that's why women have more of the problem with it. But it isn't that it's some particular disease, it's that gluten is just absolutely not intended as a food. The seeds create the protein gluten as a storage form, but also as a by-product it discourages animals from eating it because it contains these amino acids that contribute to inflammation. So the seed intends it to cause inflammation in your intestine. And a very tough person can withstand it for a long time, but it's not a good idea for anyone to eat it. And traditionally Europeans ate bread, but it was always soured, and the actual souring process does change the gluten into a less allergenic form, although some people are still react adversely to it. And soaking it for 12 hours or so increases the protein value tremendously while destroying the gluten. So soaking your grains before making the bread and then also souring them for 12 hours. You know, sourdough bread is risen in 3 or 4 hours, if that, maybe even 1 or 2. I asked a baker and he said 20 minutes. And that's not enough time for the cultures in the starter to actually break down the gluten and change it into a much less allergenic form. So traditionally we never ate bread products like we do today. And in fact, a lot of the European cake recipes don't even call for flour because flour was this highly prized possession to have in Europe, and most of the cakes and desserts were made with eggs and milk and sugar and not flour. And now statement rules have switched, but I know we're running out of time now. I mean, sorry, values have switched, and flour is cheap and butter and eggs are expensive.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, how accurate are the tests, and what is your perspective on gluten as a food source?
