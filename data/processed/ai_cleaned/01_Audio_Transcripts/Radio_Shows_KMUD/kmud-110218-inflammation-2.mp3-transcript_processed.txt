**RAY PEAT:** "I very early got the impression that education was largely indoctrination."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses his early academic experiences and how he perceived the educational system.

**RAY PEAT:** "I saw that the whole direction of the brain biology was towards a very reductionist computer analogy. And looking around the department, I saw that the other end of the organism... the reproductive physiology, was much more scientific."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his shift in academic focus from neurobiology to reproductive physiology.

**RAY PEAT:** "The whole estrogen receptor is a bit of a bit of a non-entity."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat challenges the prevailing receptor model for estrogen's action.

**RAY PEAT:** "I was studying the metabolism of the uterus in aging animals and trying to understand why in middle age infertility came about and the particular metabolic studies that I was doing corresponded to increased estrogenic stimulation with aging."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes the research that led him to question the established understanding of menopause and estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "I read way back to 1900 and up to the 1940s and 50s and I saw there was a sudden change in 1942... Soderwald and Landau were among the people who were studying the effects of excess estrogen on the uterus. And they showed that if you gave a greater dose, increasing amounts of estrogen caused miscarriage at earlier. The smallest dose would cause miscarriage at a very early stage, and if you waited until very late in the pregnancy, it would take a bigger dose. But it was a very continuous, graded effect in which the estrogen slight excess would be sufficient to kill the developing embryo."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat details his historical research into estrogen's effects on pregnancy, contrasting it with later interpretations.

**RAY PEAT:** "Saw that soot, just put a spoon in a candle flame and then extract it in a solvent, you could get hundreds of different estrogenic substances out of just soot. And this was wonderful for the drug industries because everyone could find an estrogen to patent. But there was only one natural progesterone and so that was not a viable drug. No one had a patent on it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the economic incentives behind the development and promotion of synthetic estrogens.

**RAY PEAT:** "So by 1942 the 13 major estrogen companies had their synthetic estrogens and the situation scientifically was that estrogen caused infertility. It was associated with aging. But since they had products they said here we have the female hormone and Being female means being able to have babies and so estrogen must be what causes women to have babies and They wanted to sell it for some popular use so they could sell it to millions of women and they came up with the idea that it would prevent miscarriage even though the science said the opposite."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes how the pharmaceutical industry misrepresented scientific findings to market synthetic estrogens.

**RAY PEAT:** "They got a team, men and wife, at Harvard to promote the idea that diethylstilbestrol, TES, that it would prevent miscarriages. And so they were prescribing it for years to women to prevent miscarriage and to make it healthier, baby and so on. And it turned out... probably they never would have had to stop selling it even though it was causing cancer and deformity. But about the same time it was getting recognized that DES causes cancer and doesn't prevent miscarriage but actually increases the risk. They were getting interested in a new project to sell to even more women, the birth control pill."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights the promotion of DES for miscarriage prevention and its subsequent link to cancer and birth defects, and the transition to the birth control pill.

**RAY PEAT:** "When they decided that the time was right in the 1940s, they didn't want their drug company known as the abortion producer. But by 1959 or 60, abortion was becoming, or contraception was becoming acceptable, but still abortion was a taboo. So they invented a story saying that if you take estrogen it will suppress your body's estrogen and prevent miscarriage by lowering your estrogen. And so they came out with the contraceptive so called abortion pill just as it was recognized that DES was causing miscarriages and cancer. That's how it was. They lost one product but immediately came out with another falsified story to sell the birth control pills."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the marketing strategy behind the birth control pill, linking it to the DES scandal.

**RAY PEAT:** "These people who were doing the real science were trying to explain why estrogen had these toxic effects. And they thought that natural estrogen was imitated by these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soot, which were famous and recognized as carcinogens. Estrogen was known to be carcinogenic and so they were studying the properties of soot and estrogen and finding that given estrogenic properties, the substance was also tended to produce inflammation and cancer, a very close association electronically in the nature of the molecule."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the early scientific understanding of estrogen's carcinogenic properties and its chemical similarities to known carcinogens.

**RAY PEAT:** "The defense department funded, well, the Atomic Energy Commission gave him permission to use radioactive isotopes and supplied the isotopes. Okay. And other labs, his competition didn't have either the grants or the isotopes, they were very tightly controlled by the Atomic Energy Commission, and he labeled estrogen and found that it concentrated in organs like the uterus, and since the entomologists were saying that it affects the whole energy system of the organism and the cell, changing the oxidation reduction processes and participating in the chemistry of the cell, he labeled two different kinds of estrogen, put the labels in two different places and added them to the uterine tissue and said that there was no interchange between the two. There were no oxidative reactions in which estrogen participated, and he published that, I think it was 1962, and the entomologists had been, the whole thing was based on estrogen participating as a chemical reactant, and he had the only means by which to demonstrate what he claimed, so his opponents didn't, didn't have the grants or the isotopes to challenge that."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how Elwood Jensen's research, funded by the Atomic Energy Commission, suppressed earlier findings about estrogen's chemical reactivity.

**RAY PEAT:** "But 10 or 15 years later, after the receptor dogma had been imposed on the world of biology, other people started using isotopes and showing that yes, the older entomologists were exactly right, estrogen does participate. The catalyst in enzyme reactions, especially transhydrogenation reactions that connect energy production to gene turnover and cell growth and so on."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that later research validated the earlier findings about estrogen's role in enzyme reactions.

**RAY PEAT:** "So that's how it initiates cancer cells? Yeah. It allows the energy to be short-circuited over into the growth rather than the function mechanism. So the cell stops functioning and doing its normal cellular functioning and just... The estrogen turns on the cell growth processes. Yeah, it drains the energy right out of function in the growth."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how estrogen's interaction with cellular energy processes can lead to cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "The fastest change that you can see in a cell within a minute or two of exposing it to estrogen is that it just instantly starts taking up water and as it takes up water, the water gets out of the cell's control and that's part of this short-circuiting, the energy process. The microtubules that are an organizing force in the cell that lets it do the work it's supposed to. These are depolymerized in the presence of estrogen and disorganized. And that's part of the cancer problem that the cell can't communicate from one part to the other because the microtubules are messed up."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes the immediate cellular effects of estrogen, including water uptake and microtubule disruption, linking them to cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "The water is normally under control of adjoining surfaces so that it's very unlike bulk water but in the presence of estrogen it becomes... bulk-like so that one of my experiments at the university was to put an old uterus, a young uterus and an estrogen treated uterus in an MRI machine and we could show that the old uterus and the estrogen treated uterus had loose water, disorganized water. It could be distinguished from the young healthy uterus."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat presents experimental evidence demonstrating estrogen's effect on cellular water structure.

**RAY PEAT:** "In England there's a big backlash against it. The industry succeeded so greatly in turning science completely upside down in the case of estrogen that... that took a lot of other hormones with it. Progesterone was suppressed and ignored because it would cure the things that estrogen was claimed to cure and actually caused. And it couldn't be patented as you said."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the suppression of progesterone research due to its lack of patentability and its beneficial effects, which contradicted the estrogen narrative.

**RAY PEAT:** "And prolactin had many toxic effects that were well recognized but since estrogen increases prolactin... There was a great pressure not to think very much about what it means that prolactin causes bone loss and contributes to osteoporosis, but it wasn't popular to think of the fact that estrogen increases prolactin and serotonin is another thing that has been strongly influenced by this inverted interpretation of estrogen because estrogen increases exposure to serotonin. Serotonin is one of the means by which estrogen increases prolactin. And serotonin does many of the harmful things that estrogen and prolactin do, including a direct cause of bone loss."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat connects estrogen to prolactin and serotonin, highlighting their detrimental effects on bone health and overall metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "People who take the... Fluoxetine type of antidepressants are seen to have a lot of premature bone loss because of the excess exposure to serotonin and the associated prolactin."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat points to the bone loss associated with SSRI antidepressants due to increased serotonin and prolactin.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the serotonin is, in a way, kind of a co-factor for estrogen. Estrogen increases prolactin, or serotonin. Systemically, and serotonin in turn increases the production of estrogen, so when one gets out of control they both tend to become dominant, and serotonin is involved in the inflammations produced by estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the synergistic relationship between estrogen, prolactin, and serotonin, and their role in inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Prozac type drugs keep the platelets and nerve cells from binding and keeping serotonin out of the way. And so they lead to overexposure to the serotonin."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the mechanism by which SSRIs increase serotonin exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** "5-HTP... works to raise your serotonin. It's basically providing you the precursor and your body makes more serotonin out of it. So the effects of serotonin in excess are going to be increasing estrogen, which slows your liver's metabolism. That can slow your thyroid down. That can lead to obesity. It can promote... by increasing estrogen, it can promote cancer."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat details the negative consequences of 5-HTP supplementation, including increased estrogen, slowed metabolism, obesity, and cancer risk.

**RAY PEAT:** "It might elevate your mood, but you also risk these other things. I mean, they used to give x-rays to help with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Oh, whoops-a-daisy. Sorry you got cancer."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat uses an analogy to illustrate the trade-off between perceived short-term benefits and long-term risks of certain treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** "The effect of the serotonin is to cause localized contraction of the tubes in your lungs as well as causing them to take up water and... promote some inflammation, but the contraction is the thing that's best studied in connection with asthma."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the link between serotonin and asthma, specifically its role in bronchial constriction.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are probably a dozen important types of estrogen, but almost all of them, the three main types, estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Those are the best known and have been used as drugs. Those all have pretty much the same effects but just at different potencies so that if you can turn your most potent estradiol into the others, you're protected against some of the most toxic effects of estrogen during pregnancy."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the different forms of estrogen and their relative potencies and protective roles during pregnancy.

**RAY PEAT:** "The estradiol is the most dangerous form, and that's usually what I recommend women have tested to make sure their most dangerous form is not too high."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises monitoring estradiol levels due to its potential toxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "The only reason you'd want high estriol is because... That would tell us that the estradiol is being detoxified, not that high estriol in itself is protective in any way, shape or form. Yeah, it's about ten times weaker than estrogen, so every little bit of estradiol that you turn to estriol, it's a down-stepping of your estrogen effect."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that high estriol levels indicate estradiol detoxification, not inherent protective properties of estriol itself.

**RAY PEAT:** "The tremendously decreased the amount of estrogen in the contraceptives but if it's strong enough to kill the embryo, it's strong enough to do some damage to the woman."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses concern about the potential harm of even reduced estrogen levels in contraceptives.

**RAY PEAT:** "So any kind of IUD with or without hormones....will create a hormonal imbalance which is what is the main thing accounting for the prevention of pregnancy. And thereby increasing your estrogen and increasing risk of cancer."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how IUDs, both hormonal and non-hormonal, can disrupt hormonal balance and increase estrogen levels, leading to cancer risk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Melatonin... its function seems to be as a way of detoxifying serotonin, the trigger that turns the conversion in the pineal gland of serotonin into melatonin, it's the adrenergic stress-related nerves... During the night your stress increases from the lack of light and this adrenergic system causes the pineal to convert serotonin to melatonin and in general in various places melatonin is functioning as an antidote to serotonin."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes melatonin's role in detoxifying serotonin, particularly in response to stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "But when people actually take melatonin? Sometimes it's probably protecting against the circulating serotonin but in itself in an otherwise healthy person for example in the animal studies it was capable of lowering both progesterone and thyroid while increasing estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat cautions against long-term melatonin supplementation, citing potential negative effects on progesterone, thyroid, and estrogen levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "People have been studied who were using vaginal creams, for example, and their blood level of estrogen was even higher than some of the oral pills were causing. So it's definitely a systemic hormonal influence, wherever you put it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat emphasizes that topical estrogen application can lead to systemic hormonal changes.

**RAY PEAT:** "I've known several women who had pharmacists make them up suppositories with a fairly high dose of vitamin A and a little vitamin E in cocoa butter or other way of introducing it. And the vitamin A......helps to strengthen the membranes and normalize mucus production."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests a natural alternative for vaginal dryness using vitamin A and E suppositories.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, all of the hormones that are bioidentical can have, they have to fit into the system in a balanced way and it's okay to have a physiological amount of any of these serotonin, estrogen, melatonin and so on, but... When you supplement estrogen or serotonin, you're most likely increasing something that's already excessive."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses skepticism about bioidentical hormone supplementation, suggesting it often exacerbates existing imbalances.

**RAY PEAT:** "The doctrine of replacement with the natural hormones is building on the history of the estrogen replacement with synthetic hormones. And what the... Neglect is that as a woman ages from age 19 to 39, for example, there's a steady average increase in the amount of estrogen in her bloodstream, as well as a fairly continuous amount of progesterone, which every cycle the estrogen is... forced out of the cells all through the body by the rising large amount of progesterone. And in the 40s, progesterone production is no longer able to fully keep up with this steadily increasing estrogen production with aging. And as soon as estrogen, as soon as progesterone decreases......and can no longer force estrogen out of the cells, the blood estrogen level will drop but the estrogen inside the cells will increase."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the natural hormonal shifts during aging, particularly the decline in progesterone's ability to counterbalance rising intracellular estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "Publications by some, I think they're Norwegians, Batra and others, and by Richard Blandow in University of Washington, showed that the tissues... of old organisms retain much more estrogen than the tissues of young animals, and the fact that you don't find it in the blood is simply because estrogen sticks inside the cells in proportion to the deficiency of progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat cites research supporting the idea that estrogen accumulates within cells when progesterone is deficient, leading to misleadingly low blood estrogen levels.
