**RAY PEAT:** The ideal fat is coconut oil because the short chain saturated fatty acids compete with the other fats that normally are slowing metabolism and oxidative metabolism. And so for a couple hours after you eat more or less a tablespoon of coconut oil per meal, for a couple hours your metabolic rate is increased, producing more carbon dioxide and accelerating cell repair processes.

**CONTEXT:** What types of sugars and fats and proteins should we be ingesting to keep our metabolic rate high?

**RAY PEAT:** The first principle is to dilute the radioactive isotopes with good stable relatively stable isotopes. So old food is best. The radioactive iodine isotope is practically all gone after three months after the production of it and the others will eventually tend to wash down into the ground and so the plants that grow in the first few months after an accident will contain those isotopes. So if you have canned food, dried milk or aged cheese, these are very safe and will continue to be safe for months because they were produced before the accident. Other principle besides diluting the isotopes is to increase your resistance to stress and radiation. And it happened that my very first newsletter 30 years ago was on radiation resistance and what to do in case of a nuclear accident. And at that time I reviewed a couple of thousand research articles both from the old APC, Atomic Energy Commission research, and a lot of it from the Soviet research. And the main conclusions that I found were that increasing the metabolic rate, which causes cells to retain magnesium, magnesium is very important in repairing cell damage, and the faster the metabolic rate is, generally the more damage can be repaired before it becomes established as a stress factor in the organism. The high metabolic rate produces carbon dioxide. Which has an antioxidant, anti-stress effect all through the organism. So if you keep your metabolic rate up and eat a balanced diet, your tissue is going to retain the magnesium it needs out of the food and produce the carbon dioxide it needs, assuming that you're getting adequate protein, sugar, fat, vitamins. a balance of minerals.

**CONTEXT:** What are the principles for protecting ourselves from radioactive particles and increasing our resistance to radiation?

**RAY PEAT:** Fruits that come from the tropics, the farther south the fruit is grown the longer it will be free of this high latitude Japanese radiation. So oranges grown in Mexico, Brazil and Florida are still going to be pretty pure in terms of radiation for a very long time. And the sugar and the minerals in oranges are very close to what we need. So coconut oil, orange juice and milk as a good source of calcium.

**CONTEXT:** What are some safe food sources to consider given potential radiation exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** During the atmospheric bomb tests in the 50s and 60s, I got interested in the study the government was doing. They were doing it secretly before it became public for a long time. They were collecting baby teeth from around the world to measure the fallout effects. The government began recommending that people not drink milk because milk was contaminated with the strontium which was taken up along with the calcium. But I looked at the actual analysis of the food value as well as the isotope content of vegetables and found that a person getting their nutrition from vegetables was going to have about five times higher exposure to strontium-90 than people who got their nutrition primarily from milk and cheese because the cows were able to concentrate the calcium. and filter out a little more of the strontium than the vegetables were doing.

**CONTEXT:** What was the government's findings regarding strontium-90 exposure from milk versus vegetables during atmospheric bomb tests?

**RAY PEAT:** Once it gets into your digestive system, if it's coming in incorporated in the food, there's really no way to sort it out. But if it's in the water, for example, if you can just keep a lot of fiber flowing through your system, like eating fruit that you know isn't contaminated. Carrots, for example, if you know that they're safely grown, uncontaminated, will sweep the material through your intestine, preventing the absorption of some nutrients at the same time that if you're exposed to a very concentrated dose from a rain or something, it's better to go hungry for a little while, while sweeping out your intestine.

**CONTEXT:** What are the best elimination methods for radioactive particles once they are in the digestive system?

**RAY PEAT:** It simply dilutes the radioactive isotope when you're taking in a lot of bold, stable iodine. It saturates your thyroid. Your thyroid shuts down and stops taking up anymore. And so you can add a radioactive iodine to a saturated person and it just gradually washes out without concentrating at a very high level in the thyroid. But if a person is deficient in iodine. Almost all of it will, once it gets into the bloodstream, it will stick in the thyroid gland and give an extremely high dose to the gland. And even more so to a developing embryo's thyroid gland. The fetus will concentrate even more than the mother's thyroid. The potassium iodide is very good protection but only from the damage to the thyroid gland. It doesn't do anything at all to protect against the other isotopes or the other tissues of the body as some people are saying on the internet. In fact probably if you took it more than enough to saturate your tissues the center for disease control advocates 160 milligrams one dose. If you took that much every day for a long time, your thyroid gland would shut down, your metabolism would slow down, and you would, all of your defensive reactions would slow down, so you would become more susceptible to injury throughout the rest of your body.

**CONTEXT:** How do kelp or potassium iodide supplements help protect against radioactive iodine?

**RAY PEAT:** No, just the minimum requirement is only 150 or 200 micrograms and even one milligram per day continued for a very long time increases the risk of damage to the thyroid gland, thyroiditis appears. Increasingly, when people eat just a milligram of iodine or more.

**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended dosage for iodine to avoid potential thyroid damage?

**RAY PEAT:** Ernest Sternglass, who got interested in the issue. When they were doing atmospheric bomb tests, the government timed their bomb tests in Nevada so that the wind wasn't blowing towards the big California cities. They wanted all of the fallout to go into Utah. And the population of Utah suffered the most from autoimmune diseases and cancer and other diseases. Occasionally, the rainfall would be so light that no fallout would come down until it got to the East Coast and one of these times Ernest Sternglass had his students studying how to use their Geiger counters and they found that there was a terrific amount of radiation at university which the government hadn't mentioned to anyone. But he showed that probably there were tens of thousands of miscarriages and the babies that survived a very high percentage were hypothyroid, even, there was an epidemic of babies born without their thyroid gland. And as long as they were being breastfed, the mother's thyroid was entering the milk at a high enough level to cover up the symptoms, so as soon as they were weaned, they were discovered not to have thyroid gland.

**CONTEXT:** What were Ernest Sternglass's findings regarding the impact of atmospheric bomb tests on public health, particularly concerning miscarriages and thyroid issues in babies?

**RAY PEAT:** Coffee is a good source of magnesium and of some B vitamins, niacin especially, and the caffeine is anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, and so if you happen to have some mobile isotopes that are still in your bloodstream and going through your kidneys, caffeine helps to flush them out faster and safely. It has a slight chelating effect as well as anti-inflammatory. And... The things that have an anti-estrogen effect as well as anti-inflammatory, the radiation effect itself imitates estrogen in the body. Everything that estrogen does can be imitated by radiation including making a rat go into estrus, for example. And if you're in a high estrogen state, then you're more susceptible to radiation injury. And that's why progesterone and thyroid and caffeine helping to lower estrogen and inflammation are protective against radiation, too.

**CONTEXT:** How do coffee and caffeine help protect against radiation?

**RAY PEAT:** Radiation effect itself imitates estrogen in the body. Everything that estrogen does can be imitated by radiation including making a rat go into estrus, for example. And if you're in a high estrogen state, then you're more susceptible to radiation injury. And that's why progesterone and thyroid and caffeine helping to lower estrogen and inflammation are protective against radiation, too.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between radiation and estrogen in the body, and what can help mitigate this effect?

**RAY PEAT:** There's a lot of confusion around glutathione because anything that harms your cells turns on a defensive reaction and increases the glutathione. And so a lot of things that have exactly the wrong effect are being suggested on the basis of increasing glutathione. But many harmful things by stimulating that defense reaction will increase glutathione. And taking a large dose of glutathione in itself, animal studies showed that it could be carcinogenic to the liver just by starting free radical reactions rather than stopping them.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of glutathione in relation to radiation damage?

**RAY PEAT:** The liver is the main detoxifying organ. The kidneys and brain have some of the same detoxifying enzymes, but the liver is where the great bulk of it....of detoxification happens and there have been studies in which beef were going into the slaughterhouse, their urine, blood, and tissues were measured, and a large proportion of the animals, more than a third, showed chemical contamination in the blood and urine, and practically all of them......were boycott....had the same chemicals in their fat and muscle tissues, the meats that are most popular, but only a very tiny proportion still had any of the toxic chemicals left in their liver for the first 24 hours after you're exposed to an insecticide, for example. It will collect in the liver and be bound to a certain kind of......protein, but during this first day in which it's collecting at a high concentration in the liver, the liver begins destroying it, and after just about 24 hours, the liver has cleaned itself and then begins the slow process of cleaning the blood as it draws toxins out of the muscles and fat tissues. The fats are relatively inert, and so the highest toxins accumulate there over the years, so the fatty meats are the most risky as far as the chemical poisonings go, the liver's the cleanest.

**CONTEXT:** Why is liver considered a cleaner and safer food source compared to fatty meats, especially in the context of detoxification?

**RAY PEAT:** Raw carrot salad.

**CONTEXT:** What was the name of the colon cleanser that was mentioned?

**RAY PEAT:** It has some antioxidant effect, but I don't think it has a big effect on iodine.

**CONTEXT:** Does garlic help bring iodine into the system?

**RAY PEAT:** The seaweed kelp and dulse, for example, or sea organisms like shrimp and oysters and clams, those are good sources of iodine. That's a good source of iodine. But the banana issue brings up an important aspect of radiation which is bananas are probably one of the richest food sources in serotonin and some biologists, Carmel Mothersill and Colin Seymour for example, have been studying the effects of low level radiation on cell. Physiology and communication and they find that at a very low level ionizing radiation causes cells to produce serotonin among other agents that even if you take the injured cells out of the organism or the culture dish, the water that they were in when they were injured becomes equivalent. To the radiation for other cells, the same kind of genetic damage caused directly by the radiation can be caused by the chemicals put into the environment by those injured cells and serotonin at a level above 20 nanograms per milliliter is one of those communicators of radiation damage. They, in one of their books, have a study by some of the biologists who worked with the Chernobyl victims, both the children who have been living in the region and the people who survived working at the accident, and they find that the serum taken from these exposed people 20 years after the accident their serum separated from their blood components added to another person's cells caused radiation damage equivalent in those cells and since they identified a very small amount of serotonin as one of the factors spreading this inflammation genetic destabilizing material I think it's good to avoid as many sources of serotonin as possible especially bananas.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between bananas, serotonin, and radiation damage?

**RAY PEAT:** I think shifting towards gelatinous meats away from muscle needs would help to reduce the tendency of the tissues when inflamed to produce serotonin. A good balance of vitamins and minerals helps to avoid excess serotonin production during inflammation, but all of those anti-inflammatory things that have been mentioned are basically anti-serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary shifts can help reduce serotonin production during inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** I think a good filter for well water is is adequate and progesterone is very anti-estrogenic and for men keeping the thyroid function high is the main thing. Aspirin and thyroid are able to inhibit the estrogen that's produced as a result of stress.

**CONTEXT:** What can men take to protect against the estrogenic effects of radionuclides, and what are the recommendations regarding bottled water versus well water?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think carbon captures almost any any solid will absorb to an activated charcoal.

**CONTEXT:** Can carbon in a water filter sequester iodine if it's present in the water?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they pass through your intestine. Well, yes eating them. They aren't going to be any more effective than a good cellulose. Anything indigestible that stimulates your intestine.

**CONTEXT:** Are brown seaweeds like wakami and kombu effective for removing heavy metals and radioactivity from the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, carrageenan is somewhat worse, but the alginate itself has the potential to be dangerously allergenic.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential risks associated with alginate found in seaweed?

**RAY PEAT:** For an emergency, like just for a period of two or three weeks, while the cloud passes over, I think it, it could be helpful to take a B complex supplement and to eat extra eggs and milk and very nutrient-rich foods. But a B vitamin supplement is pretty safe and helps to keep a maximal rate of metabolism supported.

**CONTEXT:** What supplements and foods are recommended for a short-term emergency period of two to three weeks during a radiation cloud event?

**RAY PEAT:** I think there would be a little bit of. Everything that was produced, there would be only a very slight difference in fallout in the rainfall. And going back to potassium, I know that Kala was asking about bananas, but orange juice is very rich in potassium and potassium will also help your body pick up less cesium like the iodine in the kelp will help your body pick up less radioactive iodine.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding cesium and iodine fallout, what is the role of potassium and orange juice?

**RAY PEAT:** Fifty years ago I proposed that the safe thing would be to have industrial sized greenhouses which during, if they were going to keep doing the atmospheric bomb tests, I suggested that all vegetables should be grown in either petroleum or coal-fired greenhouses providing fossil carbon dioxide to avoid the radioactive carbon isotope from the fallout, and using limestone as the safe source of calcium for fertilizer and other fossil minerals to give the complete non-radioactive food source for the plants and animals that were being used for food. But by 1963, the government had agreed to stop testing in the atmosphere. One of the reasons that I did my newsletter in 1981 on radiation protection was that beginning with that huge burst of atmospheric fallout from the bomb tests in 1963. The scores, all kinds of indicators of intelligence, babies born in nine months after 1963's burst of atmospheric tests, their SAT scores were showing up in 1981....as the lowest of history, and it turned out people were arguing that it was because more poor students were taking the test, but actually it was the high-scoring people who were eliminated from the SAT scores. The high scores decreased progressively in proportion to the amount of fallout being produced by the bombs.

**CONTEXT:** What was proposed for safe food production during atmospheric bomb testing, and what was the observed impact of fallout on intelligence indicators?
