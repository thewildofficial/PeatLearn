**RAY PEAT:** After I had studied and taught Literature and Linguistics, I decided that to understand consciousness and language, I should study the brain, but when I started graduate school in......specializing in nerve biology, I discovered that the brain scientists were just as dogmatic as the linguistic theorists, so I went into general physiology, specializing in reproductive endocrinology, and that was one aspect of that got me interested in the biological effects of radiation, although I had been interested in the fallout from the nuclear tests for many years as a big problem, so when I saw that the biology of estrogen was very similar to the biology of radiation damage, I tried to understand just what was going on in a cell that caused identical biochemical... events to occur either from a dose of x-rays or a dose of estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, could you please describe your academic and professional background for those who perhaps have never listened to you?

**RAY PEAT:** The body has many responses to injury and serotonin and estrogen are two of the most basic primitives. Responses to any kind of generalized injury and for example if you get sunburned in the next few hours you can measure a large amount of serotonin in the urine and that same thing happens for any kind of injury including ionizing radiation, dental x-rays....are enough to activate the production of serotonin and it's one of the basic defense mechanisms and what it does is activate simple things like shifting away from oxidative metabolism to glycolytic or even a kind of hibernating. A shutdown of systems at an extreme overproduction of serotonin, you tend to go into a hibernating state. Animals, according to the diet and weather stress and so on, before they go into hibernation for the winter will be producing more and more serotonin. And that's it. The basic purpose is to keep the machinery running while shutting down the expensive biological processes.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, what do you have to say about serotonin in terms of your knowledge and information on it?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s and 60s when the Soviets were worried about getting hydrogen bombed, they were doing a lot of research on ways to defend against very intense radiation doses. Serotonin was one of the things that they were studying and looking for safe analogs to use defensively because a big dose of radiation puts the organism in a state where it can tolerate with maybe reducing mortality for a given dose by maybe 50% in some cases. A dose of maybe a thousand rads and unfortunately for the kind of dose that we're more likely to be exposed to, serotonin is really what's causing the bulk of the damage. For example, if you give cells in a culture dish. The amount of x-ray exposure that you get with a set of dental x-rays, these cells will, if you put them in a photon detector, they'll be emitting photons, light produced by the cellular damage and excitation for over an hour after the exposure. And if you put......unexposed cells in the water that those cells are in, even without being exposed to radiation, just to the emissions such as serotonin into the water, the second batch of cells will begin mutating hours later. And people have thought......cultured these unexposed cells, exposed only to the chemical products produced by the injured cells, and for 30 generations mutations keep occurring and to form a human being you only need about 30 multiplications of the original fertilized ovum. So it's a... That one small exposure has tremendous repercussions and, for example, a man with an x-ray treatment to a brain tumor, for example, is much more likely to have children with major malformations. The injury is circulated through the body, even affecting the... health of the sperms and the probably animal studies suggest that these genetic instabilities can go on for many generations of whole cycling organisms passing on their unstable genes.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, you're saying that even a minute amount of radiation, or more, if they're not telling us the whole picture, the full story, and our cells are starting to express more serotonin and the vitality of our organism is trying to quell that cascade of inflammation, what can we do to keep ourselves in a vital state?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably one single atom fissioning in your body, it will cause... that cell or a few cells to produce those toxic communicating substances and the rest of the body, if the person is healthy, the rest of the body will shut down those excited signals. So it's a matter of balancing the vitality of the whole organism against the number of these. Inferred cells.
**CONTEXT:** So, if our cells are being exposed to a minute amount of radiation or more, and they're expressing more serotonin, and the vitality of our organism is trying to quell that cascade of inflammation, what can we do to keep ourselves in a vital state?

**RAY PEAT:** If you think of the old studies of the radiation causing DNA breaks, they found about 40 years ago that high thyroid function and the magnesium taken up into the cells under the influence of thyroid was the best way to accelerate the repair process so that you didn't have... the lingering mutations from breaking the chromosomes in the DNA. But that was the repair activation for fairly high doses. But there are processes that apply to even the lowest exposure. For example, a study in Seattle two or three years ago......found that a full set of dental x-rays to a woman who was pregnant but wearing a lead apron and so on......the exposure to her face would cause systemic influences that would cause the babies to be underweight and underdeveloped......just as if she had taken an estrogenic. is by a good dose of progesterone or even testosterone....just as if she had... The usual nutritional things that help the body constantly control the estrogen that it's being exposed to. So just average everyday stress has a great overlap with radiation injury and estrogen and serotonin happen to be the things that we have the best handle on for protecting ourselves. from the long range effects.
**CONTEXT:** So, if our cells are being exposed to a minute amount of radiation or more, and they're expressing more serotonin, and the vitality of our organism is trying to quell that cascade of inflammation, what can we do to keep ourselves in a vital state?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, to the extent that they really are acting largely on the serotonin, I think it's good to look for alternatives, but much of that is just advertising invented things for going with the TV commercials, the idea that they're a happy pill. They're raising your happy hormone and that sort of thing, but actually they're acting on many different processes, increasing adrenaline and dopamine and activating enzymes and inactivating other enzymes all through the body so no one really knows the full extent of what they're doing. It's beneficial, some of it isn't, so it goes pill by pill. There are a few very effective antidepressants that are the opposite. They're the serotonin uptake promoters, just exactly the opposite, but they even work better in most cases.
**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on the class of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of their negative effects, knowing what they do energetically?

**RAY PEAT:** The best studied is tianeptine. The brand name is Stabilon. Some people get it over the internet, but it isn't legal in the U.S. It basically promotes the uptake of serotonin so it's less active and it turns out to have lots of beneficial effects on bodily health for arthritis and diabetes. Lots of inflammatory things that relate to overexposure to serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** Which ones are, what are the drug names for those serotonin reuptake promoters?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've talked to quite a few people who were taking it as a... antidepressant, who had very dramatic physical improvements at the same time. And the physical conditions are all things that are known to be associated with high serotonin. And there's a whole class of anti-serotonin drugs that are becoming popular for more uses. For example... Some of their uses are to prevent nausea or diarrhea from radiation exposure. What they're doing is protecting you from the serotonin which is a byproduct of the radiation exposure. And you can even prevent sunburn with an anti-serotonin drug.
**CONTEXT:** So, with people that have diabetes and arthritis, maybe for them to take something that would block their serotonin like a Stabilon, then that would help their symptoms in arthritis?

**RAY PEAT:** Ondansetrin is the most popular anti-nausea anti-serotonin drug, but I think one of the best is called Blizzuride. L-I-S-U-R-I-D-E and all of these are based on the same indole molecular structure that serotonin is but they are tuned in a different way by additives, for example, adding bromine, chromocryptine is one that is used to treat pituitary tumors. because prolactin is promoted by stress or by serotonin or by radiation and by modifying the indole molecule from the ergot fungus is that's the basic molecule that is used for these anti-serotonin drugs by modifying it slightly blocks the effect of serotonin and fringes the pituitary tumor by preventing the stimulating effects of the serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** So what are some of the names of these anti-serotonin drugs that are used for nausea and diarrhea and radiation exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, the body has enzymes that are activated by stress. For example, in the pineal gland, adrenaline is the signal. Adrenaline rises in the darkness because of ordinary light. It is preventing some of the free radical activity that rises in the darkness that activates adrenaline and the adrenaline is the immediate activator of the enzyme which converts serotonin into melatonin. But the same enzyme system can be found in an inflamed breast or aromatic. A knee joint, for example, and in these situations of inflammation, melatonin is... Some people have believed that melatonin was at fault for causing rheumatoid arthritis. But actually, it seems to be performing the same function that it does in the brain, a way of eliminating... serotonin which is the actual pro-inflammatory substance and since serotonin stimulates cell division and inflammation the presence of this enzyme in the in the breast is being considered one of the approaches for preventing or treating breast cancer to accelerate the removal of serotonin. And into the breakdown of serotonin into melatonin.
**CONTEXT:** How about melatonin, Dr. Pete?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably melatonin has a fairly direct anti-serotonin effect. It hasn't been studied very much. But besides eliminating the serotonin by combining it chemically... turning it into melatonin, I suspect that the melatonin is actually a defense as an antagonist to some extent against the serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** I'm understanding that serotonin is converted by adrenaline into melatonin, and is that part of, as a body, has maybe done a lot of work that's sort of... downshift them into a sleep mode because I understand it's available as a supplement, melatonin is, to help people relax and get to a sleep state sooner.

**RAY PEAT:** The presence of the enzyme that changes serotonin to melatonin is present in flame situations. I think that's a way of getting down the level of serotonin. But I think the presence of melatonin itself blocks some of the effects such as free radical production. activated by serotonin. So melatonin in and of itself would be an anti-serotonin in effect I would I would understand.
**CONTEXT:** And when you say antagonist, I want to make sure I understand the term. Does it mean basically that it counters or converts whatever that material that it's an antagonist to into something else or neutralizes its effect?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I don't know how how great that effect is but I think there's evidence that it has some of that effect.
**CONTEXT:** So melatonin in and of itself would be an anti-serotonin in effect, I would understand.

**RAY PEAT:** A study. At UCLA that came out last summer analyzed the corn syrup sweetener that's used in soft grains and they chemically tested it and found that it contained just the amount of fructose and glucose that it was claimed to have, but then they hydrolyzed it and found that it contained polysaccharide starch-like material....containing four to five times the amount of calories that the original sugar had. So it's basically a syrup or a starch-like material with four or five times as many calories as you think you're getting from the sugars.
**CONTEXT:** I'm curious as to whether the huge influx of SSRIs such as Prozac, etc., may also have contributed to the rise in diabetes and obesity amongst very young kids that seem to be the lab rats for the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to giving them these new, allegedly wonderful antidepressants.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, these polysaccharides that aren't easily digested by our human enzymes are likely to feed bacteria lower in the intestine that produce fermentation products including lactic acid, which......are responsible for causing the intestine to increase its already great production of serotonin and to cause it to be absorbed into the circulation in quantities enough to affect behavior. Anxiety, for example, is increased in animals in proportion to the fermentation of these starch-like molecules. I suspect that the starchy materials in the corn sweetener are pretty directly increasing exposure to serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** I'm curious as to whether the huge influx of SSRIs such as Prozac, etc., may also have contributed to the rise in diabetes and obesity amongst very young kids that seem to be the lab rats for the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to giving them these new, allegedly wonderful antidepressants.

**RAY PEAT:** If you block a transmitter, the body adaptively increases the so-called receptors. So... Increasing the exposure to something usually decreases the receptors for that substance. In an adaptive process, everything ends up more or less the way it started. The whole idea of the receptor, I think, is just another ploy of the industry to make things simple for television advertising. And for medical school, when you look carefully at the long-range arguments behind the whole receptor idea, people for 60 years or more have been pointing out that the state of the organism and of the cell absolutely determines how... a given substance is going to affect the cell, exciting it or inhibiting it, for example. And it isn't necessarily that you make more of the so-called receptor protein, but that the whole state of the cell, the energy charge, for example, of the cell, determines what activation of that receptor protein is going to......due to the whole cell, so I think the only way to think of a receptor is that the organism is the receptor or the cell is the receptor because the state of the brain affects the way the gonad or the adrenal, for example, is going to respond to a given chemical because everything is constantly being... subjected to an herbaceous chemical and energy input.
**CONTEXT:** The pharmaceutical industry makes a claim that these SSRIs increase the receptors for serotonin, accounting for long-term effects even after the drugs are stopped. I wonder if you could comment about that.

**RAY PEAT:** For a long time it's been clear that hypothyroid people often have extremely high serotonin levels. And so... The active part of the thyroid hormone T3, synthroid is just T4 which requires the liver to activate it. The active thyroid hormone increasing will decrease the production of and retention of serotonin. And serotonin being inflammation promoting and affecting... Constriction and leakiness of blood vessels is a major factor in migraines, which are mostly associated with hypothyroidism.
**CONTEXT:** I'm currently taking Lexapro and also sometimes I get migraines and I take Imatrex and I know that Imatrex sure works well on those migraines. And you know, and I got a thyroid condition, so I have hyperthyroidism, so I take Synthroid. I just kind of wondered if there's a, if the serotonin uptake inhibitors are any kind of a problem for a, for a, you know, the thyroid situation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, cytomel is a good anti-serotonin thing, and with the right amount of it, it's... pretty effective against migraines. That was one of my first interests in endocrinology, was my own migraines. I found that it was largely an interaction between intestinal inflammation, which 95% of our serotonin is made in the intestine, and any kind of irritation in the intestine increases our exposure to serotonin. Especially if your thyroid function is low, causing inefficient sugar metabolism, hypothyroidism plus a sensitive intestine will cause periodic flooding of the system with serotonin, which can be measured in migraine attacks during an attack or just before an attack with serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** I'm currently taking Lexapro and also sometimes I get migraines and I take Imatrex and I know that Imatrex sure works well on those migraines. And you know, and I got a thyroid condition, so I have hyperthyroidism, so I take Synthroid. I just kind of wondered if there's a, if the serotonin uptake inhibitors are any kind of a problem for a, for a, you know, the thyroid situation.

**RAY PEAT:** There is a blood test for serotonin that I think more people should be checking on. Much more meaningful than the urine test and so on. And the long range effects of excess serotonin exposure are very similar to the long range effects of chronic radiation or chronic estrogen exposure. That they acutely can produce. Inflammation, but if you keep up the exposure in the long run, you increase your tendency to have fibrosis of various tissues.
**CONTEXT:** The upshot is, is there a problem to combine the Lexapro and the Imatrex and the Synthroid and the Cytomel and all that stuff they got me on?

**RAY PEAT:** Serotonin has some very direct actions on the cortisol producing system, and I think it's maybe analogous to the way surgery can cure things. In animal research, they have to do a control false surgery on one group of animals because it's so common for the trauma of just being cut to cure whatever it was they were thinking a surgery was curing, and a very painful beasting. It will activate your adrenals to the point that it can relieve a swollen knee, for example. Right, from the cortisol. Counter-irritation that doctors used to practice.
**CONTEXT:** I keep honeybees and get stung a lot, and I've heard it's good to stop inflammation, yet I get inflamed when I get stung. So what's going on?

**RAY PEAT:** One way we can protect ourselves from this radiation and the increased serotonin effects of inflammation is to replace our starches which are grains and beans and starchy vegetables like cooked potatoes and carrots and beets. Replace those with soft ripe juicy fruits and also by keeping our thyroid function high with lots of coconut oil up to three tablespoons a day plenty of foods with calcium, local dairy if it's still okay around here it seems to be that Eureka's level hasn't changed and also plenty of good fruit sugars.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, before we end the show, could you give some recommendations for nutritional advice regarding radiation and increased serotonin effects of inflammation?
