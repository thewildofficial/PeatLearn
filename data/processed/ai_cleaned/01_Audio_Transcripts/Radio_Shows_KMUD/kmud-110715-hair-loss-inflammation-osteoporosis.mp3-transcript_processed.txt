**RAY PEAT:** "I studied biology at the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology, especially reproductive physiology and quite a bit of biochemistry, but I considered myself an old-fashioned biologist, pre-molecular biology in my way of thinking."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to describe his academic background.

**RAY PEAT:** "My dissertation was on the effects of hormones on oxidative metabolism in relation to aging of the reproductive system."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the focus of Dr. Peat's studies.

**RAY PEAT:** "The belief in testosterone as the cause is similar to the old belief that males got prostate cancer because of having testosterone. Since males get a particular kind of baldness, it's easy to blame it on testosterone, but in fact there's no evidence showing that excess testosterone is responsible for it any more than excess testosterone causes prostate cancer, and so that's where the idea of increased sensitivity came in because there was no evidence of too much of the hormone."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if male pattern baldness is due to testosterone, referencing a common belief and a dermatologist's opinion.

**RAY PEAT:** "When you look at the actual hormone situation of people with lots of hair on their head and with not much, what you see is an excess of prolactin and cortisol in the people losing their hair, both men and women, and when you look at the effect of testosterone on the growth of the hair shaft, the higher testosterone makes it grow thicker and faster, and prolactin tends to cause it to fall out. In chickens and other birds, it's known as the molting hormone. In humans, it's the milk-producing hormone, largely, but it also regulates practically every other cell in the body. It has that analogous function of terminating the growth cycle of the hair shaft. Cortisol and prolactin both rise during stress. And they're... For a long time, people have been noticing the association of baldness with heart disease and also with a crease in the earlobe. And both of those have been challenged repeatedly, but there is clear evidence that they are associated. And what links those is also connected to prolactin and high cortisol, which is... The low energy production, a thyroid deficiency tendency, letting the metabolism of cholesterol go down more towards increased cortisol and less towards progesterone and testosterone and DHEA, things that do promote hair growth."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the hormonal basis of hair loss, contrasting the role of testosterone with prolactin and cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** "For sure wouldn't be likely to be higher than normal on the current lab standards for normal because they've increased the upper edge probably because of so much....exposure of the population to estrogen, which estrogen increases the production of prolactin and estrogen itself terminates the growth of hair."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if men with baldness would have higher prolactin levels, and Dr. Peat explains why current lab standards might be misleading.

**RAY PEAT:** "Back in the 70s, after the wave of pituitary tumors resulting from the high estrogen birth control pills, they found that the healthy range for women on the standard scale of units was around 12, somewhere maybe as high as 15. And for men was about 4 to 7 and they've now raised the upper limit for men to, sometimes they say it's as high as 20 and for women as high as 30, but all the men I've talked to who had close to 20, even though they were said to be normal, they all had developing breasts. So they obviously had at 20 it was might have been within the normal range that that laboratory stated, but if they're developing breasts and they obviously have far too much prolactin for a man to have. Yeah and fertility is best when a man has 4 to 7."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about specific prolactin ranges, and Dr. Peat elaborates on historical findings and the implications of elevated levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's not only the phytoestrogens from the hops, but the yeast that... all of the alcoholic drinks require the yeast produces estradiol, the powerful human hormone, as their own reproductive hormone."
**CONTEXT:** The host discusses gynecomastia in beer drinkers, and Dr. Peat explains the role of yeast in producing estradiol.

**RAY PEAT:** "The estrogen from the yeast at least will stimulate the adrenals to produce both estrogen and cortisol and all kinds of estrogen increase the cortisol exposure and so the cortisol makes the big belly and the estrogen among other things contribute to breast growth."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the hormonal effects of alcohol, and Dr. Peat explains how estrogen from yeast can lead to increased cortisol and estrogen production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, oh sure. You can identify the specific type of estrogen and progestin from the fields going right through the sewer processing plants right into the rivers and causing fish, muskrats, anything that lives in the rivers....getting the sewage from cities, they're being feminized."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the credibility of oral contraceptive pills as a source of environmental estrogens, and Dr. Peat confirms this.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, yeah, if you're going to drink the water you should run an over-activated carbon. But, I mean, wouldn't activated carbon be a fairly cheap way for sewage plants to process water? I guess maybe not. No. No, okay. The ozone is probably the cheapest, best thing because it breaks down chemicals like that. I think Paris has been doing that for 40 years or so."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about filters for estrogenic compounds in water, and Dr. Peat discusses activated carbon and ozone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they go up with stress in different proportions. The classical stress hormone is cortisol but prolactin responds to different kinds of stress. For example, anything that blocks your thyroid function and energy production tends to increase prolactin at the same time it increases the thyroid stimulating hormone. Those are both turned on by serotonin."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the connection between hair loss, cortisol, prolactin, and stress hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid makes you able to use oxygen, and the parathyroid hormone can do some useful things, such as shocking your bones into producing more cartilage stem cells and capillaries, simply by interfering with oxygen production. For a moment, that shock of oxygen deprivation... stimulates a regenerative process, but if you keep your parathyroid hormone up continuously, then you destroy the bone because it doesn't have enough energy to go ahead and build bone. So it's like a stress hormone. For the immediate or the very short-term, like cortisol, it uses, it mobilizes nutrients, it helps you get through that stressful period, but in long-term, it's very detrimental."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of thyroid and parathyroid hormone in bone growth and regeneration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin D happens to be closely involved in hair development, calcium, getting enough calcium in your diet. Well, they call it the vitamin D receptor, but it's... It's a regulatory material in practically every cell in the body, bones and hair both. And the receptor itself, even without the vitamin D, is involved in regenerating, making stem cells that will produce new hairs. And a couple of groups have discovered that... If you inhibit the parathyroid hormone, you can increase air growth. The natural inhibitors of the parathyroid hormone are vitamin D and calcium, are the main ones."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for practical recommendations for hair growth, and Dr. Peat explains the role of Vitamin D and calcium.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin A intake is another thing that helps hold down parathyroid hormones and adequate thyroid. And so you want to avoid everything that suppresses thyroid function, such as polyunsaturated fats. All the vegetable oils and get plenty of coconut oil. And vitamin A is found in liver and eggs and there's beta carotene found in lots of vegetables but that conversion process does rely on the liver and if your thyroid is suboptimal then that conversion process will probably not happen as ideally as you'd want it to."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for further recommendations for hair loss, and Dr. Peat discusses Vitamin A, thyroid function, and polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the last couple of years some people have found that topical thyroid hormone, the active T3 part of it. Applied to the skin stimulates regeneration and renewal and caffeine, which has some overlapping effects with thyroid hormone, caffeine is now being added to lotions and ointments and such to renew hair growth and it's a very cheap application."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about topical applications for hair growth, and Dr. Peat mentions topical thyroid hormone and caffeine.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think we're talking about... Yeah, I'm sure the caffeine would work, but it's cleaner."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if coffee or tea infusions would work as well as pharmaceutical caffeine for topical application.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, those are things that regenerate many skin functions, including hair growth. So if you took a little bit of olive oil and 25 milligrams of DHEA and about 50 milligrams of natural progesterone, and you mixed that all together, that would last you for about a week?"
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about a specific oil rub recipe for hair growth, and Dr. Peat confirms its potential benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know of any plants that have a testosterone like action. There could be some, but I've never run into either progesterone or testosterone in a practical sense in plants. There are some chemicals that test like progesterone in plants, but I've never seen an actual biological effect from them."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about natural testosterone boosters and the yohimbe plant.

**RAY PEAT:** "It blocks the stress hormones, primarily turning off excess cortisol production, but when you block the stress reaction, you prevent overproduction of estrogens, so it can leave your own testosterone unopposed."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about pregnenolone's role, and Dr. Peat explains its mechanism in blocking stress hormones and unopposing testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "I suspect it... It led to hypothyroidism. There's usually high prolactin and high serotonin during those appetite disturbances. It probably was starting because of hypothyroidism, but at a certain point your hair can start falling when your thyroid is really low and the stress hormones high."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about hair loss in a former bulimic patient, and Dr. Peat links it to hypothyroidism, prolactin, serotonin, and stress hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "And then aspirin is another thing that has some anti-stress pro-hair action."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for additional suggestions for hair loss, and Dr. Peat mentions aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** "The androgens usually are up but prolactin excess, the difference seems to be whether the prolactin is steadily high or whether it's... Surges are very high, but both hirsutism and hair loss are associated with high prolactin. And the thyroid supplement is a very reliable way to control prolactin in most women. Vitamin A and calcium also help to inhibit excess prolactin. And from a herbal point of view, Vitex is blocks prolactin, Vitex, Chase, Treeberry. And also, progesterone would help with blocking some of those high androgens that are promoting the hair growth in women."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about hormonal causes of unwanted female hair growth and hair loss.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and the thyroid will, if you have enough cholesterol, the thyroid will increase your progesterone, and progesterone, and pregnenolone, and DHCA."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the thyroid's role in hormone production, and Dr. Peat explains its connection to cholesterol and other hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "The enzyme that creates the melanin pigment uses copper as a catalyst, and the... Probably the best food for increasing your copper while decreasing the iron which competes against the copper is shellfish, shrimp, clam, lobster, crab, squid. All of those have a high copper content, not an excessive iron. And I think contrary to popular opinion about shellfish, they're actually lower on the food chain so they're lower in heavy metals and other contaminants than fish are."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about graying hair and Dr. Peat explains the role of copper and iron, recommending shellfish.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since iron accumulates with aging, if a person is going to eat foods that are very high in iron, such as meat or liver, I think it's helpful. In the long run, to have some coffee, right at the same time you're having meat, so that you don't absorb all of the iron."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about managing iron intake, and Dr. Peat suggests consuming coffee with iron-rich foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, iron is quite a damaging, quite a damaging ion itself, isn't it? It's very pro-inflammatory and oxidative and... Yeah, it attacks with the polyunsaturated fats and it tends to increase your serotonin."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the damaging effects of iron, and Dr. Peat explains its pro-inflammatory and oxidative properties and its link to serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** "None that I know of."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for vegetable sources of copper.

**RAY PEAT:** "Not enough to count."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if eggs contain copper.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, but you would probably get a toxic amount of iodine in your drink. Lead and heavy metals and too much of that? Yeah. The seaweed isn't very discriminatory on what metals it picks up."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about seaweed as a copper source, and Dr. Peat warns about potential iodine and heavy metal toxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Osteoporosis. It's, my current interest in it is that it's a good way to conceive the unified nature of aging processes. Because everyone's bones get thinner with aging and it corresponds pretty well to the loss of muscle tissue with aging. Generally it corresponds to the calcification of soft tissues that shouldn't have calcium and the excitatory processes of all of the inflammatory and nervous activity, muscle cramping and so on, all of these things are associated with the misapplication of calcium. Okay. Failing to put it in the bones and all of that is under the control of energy metabolism, so something going wrong with your thyroid and oxidative metabolism, the parathyroid lactic acid producing kind of metabolism tends to replace it and cause the stress atrophy, shrinking of the tissues."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's interpretation of the cause of osteoporosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Maasai people and other cattle raising people in in eastern Africa often get 5000 milligrams of calcium a day for a long period of time."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about reasonable calcium intake, and Dr. Peat cites the Maasai people's diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a thousand to twelve hundred."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a quart of milk has about a thousand milligrams of calcium.

**RAY PEAT:** "The carbonic acid, the carbon dioxide is deformed. That stimulates bone formation rather than breaking down the bone. And a really easy way to get an adequate level if you don't drink dairy or drink milk or eat cheese is to do eggshell powder for calcium carbonate. And like where a quart of milk has about a thousand milligrams of calcium. Am I correct Dr. Pete? Yeah, a thousand to twelve hundred. A thousand to twelve hundred. And if you have a quarter teaspoon of finely ground eggshell powder, if you take that three times a day with your meals so that your acid level is adequate, that's providing around two thousand milligrams of calcium. And that quarter teaspoon is smaller than most calcium pills you swallow."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about calcium supplements and their absorption, and Dr. Peat explains the benefits of calcium carbonate from eggshells.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, old cows are sometimes used to make the bone meal, and their lead content is really high."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential for heavy metal contamination in bone meal supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "And aspirin, people seldom talk about it, but aspirin improves calcium retention in bones. And it isn't as profitable as an osteoporosis drug as the bisphosphonates and such things. But it's very safe as long as you take it. Vitamin K, along with it, and vitamin K, it happens to be a pretty expensive vitamin, but it is right at the center of the regulation of calcium. It protects your arteries from calcification, and it allows the bone to use carbon dioxide. It carboxylates the proteins. that bind calcium into the bone. So you're protecting your arteries and building your bones when you have adequate vitamin K. And both aspirin and vitamin K are known practical bone building supplements."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for other recommendations for osteoporosis, and Dr. Peat discusses aspirin and Vitamin K.

**RAY PEAT:** "Kale is the vegetable that's richest in it, I think, and liver is a very rich source."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for food sources of Vitamin K.

**RAY PEAT:** "A serving of well-cooked kale will give enough vitamin K, but the Japanese have treated osteoporosis and hardening of the arteries with doses of vitamin K that were 500 times the normal dietary requirement. It's safe even at those high levels."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the amount of kale needed for Vitamin K intake and its safety.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, so. And the other thing too is nettle tea has some vitamin K besides the minerals."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the dosage of Vitamin K with aspirin, and Dr. Peat confirms the dosage and mentions nettle tea.

**RAY PEAT:** "Consuming adequate amounts of calcium will drive parathyroid hormone down. And will deposit calcium in the correct location not on the arterial wall."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the counterintuitive idea that calcium intake can prevent arterial calcification.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several people noticed that people taking psychoactive drugs were getting osteoporosis and the SSRI antidepressants that supposedly increase your serotonin, they don't reliably do that, but that's what we call them. We're seeing osteoporosis develop in people who had been on those for several years, and that led to some rethinking of bone metabolism, and they see that serotonin produced and coming mostly out of the intestine, reaching the bones as a result of inflammation in the intestine, for example, or from... taking a drug that increases serotonin is interfering with bone metabolism and causing early quick development of osteoporosis. And so now a couple of groups are coming out with drugs to suppress the synthesis of serotonin to cure osteoporosis."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the link between psychoactive drugs, serotonin, and osteoporosis.
