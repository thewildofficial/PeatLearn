**RAY PEAT:** Well it has some of the features of insulin, but it and insulin are just two of our regulatory factors that when one of them is slightly distorted we have so many other regulatory systems that nothing really changes much when one is a little off-centre.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the stimulation of IGF by milk, and whether it has a significant effect.

**RAY PEAT:** When you look at the functions in a given species, animals that are very big for their species have a high level of IPF.
**CONTEXT:** Further explanation on IGF and its function across species.

**RAY PEAT:** The most nutrition research is done for the agricultural food industry, they want to know how to make big animals, not intelligent, long-life animals. Like the cows and increasing the yield from a cow both in milk and meat. And some nutritional studies have found that your grandmother's nutritional level affects the development of your brain and so on. And in animal studies you can see it going on for four to five generations. The way a diet and the development of one individual goes, you can see the influence generation after generation affecting the development of the whole animal. Focusing on the size of the brain, for example, you can't determine anything really just in one generation.
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the limitations of current nutrition research and its focus on animal agriculture, and the transgenerational impact of nutrition on development.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, currently they're thinking that it's a methylation of the genes, but that's just the current variation on how genetic influences work. That's what I was in graduate school, I knew Carl Lindegren, who wrote the book Cold War in Biology, and he published a survey of experiments showing such things as a transgenerational influence or the influence of a plant's nutrition on the heredity and development of its offspring. That was in the United States. Barbara McClintock was showing that stress affects the genetics of a corn plant, but Carl Lindegren was reviewing older, much more radical stuff that shows that you can change the nature of a tomato plant's offspring by what you do to the tomato plant. Since genetic engineering became a profitable business, Barbara McLintock was brought out of obscurity, given a Nobel Prize, a MacArthur grant, so that the Monsanto people would have someone saying, see, this happens in nature. So when Pedro Basto says, oh, milk is bad because it stimulates IGF... there's not really enough science to know what might turn out. Four or five generations from now, that it is either good or bad. For example, people who drink milk might have great-grandchildren who are much smarter than they are.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the concept of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and its relevance to nutritional science, referencing historical research.

**RAY PEAT:** For example, a study of the radiation effects in Japan, they looked at all factors of life situation and diet and so on. And they saw that people who didn't drink milk had a much higher risk of becoming demented in old age and a later study in the US saw the same thing that milk has anti-dementia properties.
**CONTEXT:** Citing studies that link milk consumption to a reduced risk of dementia.

**RAY PEAT:** They don't really know that's just an association of big populations but it could involve something like the IGF but there are so many factors in milk just the high ratio of calcium to phosphorus is one of the extremely beneficial qualities of milk.
**CONTEXT:** Discussing potential mechanisms for milk's anti-dementia properties, highlighting the calcium to phosphorus ratio.

**RAY PEAT:** The next best food which people don't think about as food usually, but it's eggshell. I had a relative who cured his early youthful osteoporosis by having a tablespoon of powdered eggshell every day.
**CONTEXT:** Recommending eggshell as an excellent source of calcium, sharing a personal anecdote.

**RAY PEAT:** So one quarter milk has about 1,200 milligrams of calcium, right? And a whole eggshell is maybe 2,000 milligrams, and that is calcium carbonate, but the absorption of the calcium in milk is greatly improved by the presence of lactose in the milk when you compare the different sugars. Fructose is not as good as lactose, but it still is an important factor in helping to absorb calcium. Glucose or starch, starch breaks down into nothing but glucose. Starch has a very poor effect on calcium absorption. And when bone development was compared in rats that were made deficient in vitamin D, one group was given starch as its carbohydrate, the other was given sucrose. And despite being deficient in vitamin D, the sucrose-fed rats had strong bones. So sugar doesn't weaken your bones like we're told. No, it actually works parallel to a thyroid and vitamin D for stimulating the metabolism. Calcium, a T3 component of the thyroid hormone, and fructose all have some overlapping effects activating respiratory metabolism.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the bioavailability of calcium from milk, the role of lactose, and the impact of different sugars on bone health and metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** Studies of, for example, in Chinatown in San Francisco, people who hadn't grown up drinking milk were compared to people who had the same family, same genes, but it's just a matter of what you grow up exposed to. And when you take someone who has grown up without it and have them drink maybe a glass and a half total milk in a day, about half a glass at a time, in just two or three weeks, they are inducing the enzymes in their intestine. And when you look at various factors responsible for losing the enzymes, a deficiency of progesterone and thyroid or a bacterial infection of the small intestine, yeah, will cause the loss of those enzymes.
**CONTEXT:** Addressing lactose intolerance, explaining how enzyme production can be restored through gradual exposure and improved metabolic factors.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that usually develops in the upper part of the small intestine in people who are thyroid deficient. And then those people when they drank milk would have terrible gas because the bacteria would be digesting the lactose instead of the lactase from that should be normally produced from the small intestine. Yeah, but even those people can regain the enzyme then? Yeah. Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Elaborating on the connection between thyroid deficiency, bacterial overgrowth, and lactose intolerance, and the possibility of recovery.

**RAY PEAT:** Adele Davis talked about that in the 1950s that people think of calcifying kidneys and arteries and such, and are afraid of the calcium in milk, but she already pointed out the research showing that the people who drink the least milk or have the least calcium in their diet have the most kidney stones and the most calcified arteries, and that's because of the anti-inflammatory effect of calcium. It suppresses the tendency of your kidneys and arteries and other soft tissues.
**CONTEXT:** Countering the misconception that calcium causes calcification, citing historical research on calcium's anti-inflammatory role.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the calcium in your diet by having the anti-inflammatory and pro-thyroid effect is tending to direct the deposition of calcium as calcium carbonate into your bones and keeping the production of carbon dioxide by stimulating cell metabolism. The same carbon dioxide that deposits into the bones prevents calcium from depositing in arteries and kidneys by keeping it in a soluble state. So if you take enough in your diet, then it moves in the right direction and goes from the milk to the bone. If you don't, then it goes from the bone to your arteries. Yeah. The wrong way.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining how dietary calcium, in conjunction with thyroid function and CO2 production, directs calcium deposition to bones and prevents arterial calcification.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the factors in osteoporosis is if not high cortisol then high prolactin and both of those are caused by high serotonin and all of those... Serotonin, prolactin and cortisol are anti-bone formation and calcium suppresses all of those. Calcium in your diet suppresses prolactin, cortisol and serotonin, allowing the other bone building factors to be dominant.
**CONTEXT:** Detailing how calcium intake can suppress hormones that inhibit bone formation, such as prolactin, cortisol, and serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** That helps your liver function better and then your liver can manufacture more carbon dioxide. The engineer just had a question about ways to increase carbon dioxide. Any sugar, if you eat sucrose, it's similar to lactose, not quite as effective for absorbing calcium as the lactose is, but the sucrose in fruit or honey or just plain sugar is 50 percent. Fructose is 50 percent glucose and it just takes a little fructose to catalyze the more energetic burning of glucose producing carbon dioxide. So you don't have to eat a pure sugar carbohydrate diet to have optimal carbon dioxide production but it's okay to avoid starch entirely.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining how sugars, particularly fructose, contribute to CO2 production by supporting liver function and glucose metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** Something as simple as baking soda stimulates bone formation. And what's the mechanism for that? The carbon dioxide. Okay, just the carbon dioxide. And that's why for broken bone treatments, CO2 treatment as an infusing gas that you... basically put your broken limb into a bag that's filled with carbon dioxide.
**CONTEXT:** Highlighting baking soda's bone-forming effect due to its CO2 content and the use of CO2 in treating broken bones.

**RAY PEAT:** The body has such an affinity for carbon dioxide that even though there's a very high concentration inside your body compared to the atmosphere, if you put your arm or leg into a bag of carbon dioxide that'll flow into your body, same with carbonated hot springs, you absorb carbon dioxide. Out of the water, up the gradient into your body because your body basically has an affinity for it. And when you move into a high altitude or happen to live in a submarine for two or three months, your bones, even after months of the body having a higher CO2 concentration, the bones are still incorporating some of the CO2 out of your blood. That's why I feel so good when I go to the local hot springs, carbonated hot springs, Vichy and Ukiah, Vichy hot springs, because it's carbonated, it's water that's high in CO2.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the body's affinity for CO2 and how it can be absorbed from carbonated water and high-altitude environments, leading to bone incorporation.

**RAY PEAT:** The effect of carbon dioxide seems to improve the diffusion of the gas from the air into your blood capillaries in the lungs. So it helps them absorb more oxygen is what you're saying and then the cell will work more efficiently?
**CONTEXT:** Explaining how CO2 enhances oxygen diffusion in the lungs, leading to improved cellular efficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** So the first thing is that a lot of people have their imaginary history of the human race uh... conrad lorenz and uh... a couple of his followers uh... uh... ardre and morris described the uh... evolution of the killer ape where we came from that uh... a carnivorous ape made the uh... transition into humankind So meat was the basis of human evolution and other people are currently saying that Africans who lived along lakes or sea coasts ate fish and the brain is made of fish oil and so they needed to eat fish to evolve a big brain. But all of that is really reading backwards in the history from whatever people believe in the present.
**CONTEXT:** Critiquing speculative theories about human evolution, particularly those based on diet, and emphasizing the tendency to project present beliefs onto the past.

**RAY PEAT:** That's pretty well documented that for the last 10 or 20 thousand years, civilizations have been knowing how to domesticate grains of different kinds and that is, I think, the good basis for starting to think about the paleo diet, that definitely grain eating hasn't done anything. Great for the human brain or for general health. So as far as the caveman diet takes people away from a grain based diet, I think it's starting off in the right direction. But there's just not enough science yet to know what the long range effects of a given diet are going to be for sure.
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the historical role of grain domestication and its potential negative impact on human health and brain function, suggesting a move away from grains is a positive step.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the things we can see in a fairly short range is that one of the bad features of the grains and nuts diet is a high phosphate content, a high phosphate calcium ratio. And even a high meat diet has a high phosphate. Yeah, and the high meat diet has that same drawback unless you eat eggshells when you eat the eggs. And maybe chew on the bones. Some people eat chicken bones.
**CONTEXT:** Identifying the high phosphate content and unfavorable calcium-to-phosphate ratio in grains, nuts, and meat as a dietary drawback, and suggesting solutions.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the fresh grass has a high ratio of vitamin E to fatty acids and the grains. Especially if they've been stored for a while, the vitamin E is fairly quickly depleted and cows need vitamin E in proportion to the fatty acids because the bacteria which destroys the polyunsaturated fats in any plant material like grain or leaves. Bacteria hydrogenate those polyunsaturated fats in the cow's rumen so that 98% of the polyunsaturated fat is destroyed by the cow's bacteria if they have enough vitamin E.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining the importance of vitamin E in protecting fatty acids from oxidation in cows, particularly in relation to their diet of grass versus grains.

**RAY PEAT:** That's why milk tastes good from damp, wet, rainy countries. Lots of lush grass. I know in South Africa, when I spent a year there, the milk tasted terrible. I don't know if I ever saw any green grass the whole time I was there. Same in Israel. I remember the milk in Israel was pretty bad.
**CONTEXT:** Connecting the taste and quality of milk to the diet of the cows, specifically the presence of lush grass.

**RAY PEAT:** The amount in milk is maybe something up to as much as one microgram per quart. But, uh... For men, estrogen really is as much a male hormone as female. And the natural estrogen is processed in both men and women and detoxified fairly quickly. And about, I think it's 85% of the estrogen in milk, even though it's a very small amount to start with. A birth control pill, for example, has 30 micrograms. No one drinks 30 litres of milk in a day, but the bulk of the estrogen in the milk is attached to either sulphate or glucuronic acid, which prepares it to be excreted in the kidneys.
**CONTEXT:** Addressing concerns about estrogen in milk, explaining its low concentration and how it's processed and detoxified by the body.

**RAY PEAT:** The process breaks the particle of fat up into such a small size. But it doesn't separate by itself and that presumably is going to make any of the unstable fats in it oxidize faster. It has a small harmful effect but considering the alternatives if you go into a grocery store that has only homogenized pasteurized milk. What are the other foods that you'll find in the supermarket as alternatives? They're all going to be much more dangerous as oxidants or pro-oxidants.
**CONTEXT:** Discussing homogenization, acknowledging a potential minor harmful effect but contextualizing it against the greater dangers of other available food options.

**RAY PEAT:** If the fat particle gets in your artery directly, it will... When we secrete bile, the soapy material in the bile breaks up all of the fats that we eat anyway into particles of about that same size which do get directly into the bloodstream. So we have our own natural homogenization process with our bile that our liver makes to help us digest the fats.
**CONTEXT:** Debunking the theory that homogenized fat blocks arteries by explaining the body's natural fat emulsification process.

**RAY PEAT:** Definitely it's nutritionally better but that doesn't mean that you should eat soybeans or or bread or something if you can't get milk can't get raw milk. Right because you're weighing up the... the pros and the cons. And also too of course it depends what the cows are eating. Like we talked before about grain fed versus grass fed milk. Yeah that's that makes a big difference if you are getting milk from a dairy that has only one or two or three cows. What the cow ate the preceding day is going to have a big effect on the taste of the milk, the allergenicity. How well it keeps and so on. But if you have a thousand cows' milk being pooled together, it becomes a standardized product that is pretty invariable.
**CONTEXT:** Affirming the nutritional superiority of raw milk but emphasizing that pasteurized milk is still a better option than alternatives like soy or bread, and reiterating the impact of the cow's diet.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything in the cow's environment affects the nature of the milk. The hormone content varies according to the cow's stress level. They talk about that very tiny amount of... estrogen as a concern but most milk has at least 20 times as much progesterone as estrogen and so if you did get some active estrogen in your milk the amount of progesterone is more than enough to counteract its effect.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining how environmental factors and stress affect hormone levels in milk, and highlighting the counterbalancing effect of progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** The composition is definitely different, but again it depends a lot on what the goat was eating. When I was a little kid, one of our neighbors came back from the war with malaria and they had goats. As soon as he was able to drink his daily goat milk, he didn't have any malaria attacks. But periodically he had to go to the veterans hospital for a checkup and once when he was there he had a malaria attack and they wouldn't let him get his goat milk and he died from the attack. So I've heard that the goat milk protein is a smaller, more easily digestible like the sheep's milk protein compared to the cow's milk protein. Do you find that... In your experience, Dr. P, that people... you've known other people who have an easier time digesting goat milk versus cow's milk? Yeah, I've heard that quite a bit. And do you think that the size of the protein strand is what it's down to? I doubt it. I think that there are so many chemical differences that I wouldn't guess what was most important. I know that sheep's milk, when you look at the nutritional profile, it's very different to cow or goat's milk. It has a lot more fat and a lot more protein, but when you compare just if you're just looking at the protein and the fat and the goat's milk, it's pretty similar. But I guess again that depends on what they're eating and which cow's milk and goat's milk they tested.
**CONTEXT:** Discussing the nutritional differences between goat, sheep, and cow's milk, and the potential for easier digestion of goat milk, attributing it to various chemical differences rather than just protein size.

**RAY PEAT:** If you eat most of your carbohydrate as fruit and avoid the grains so you aren't getting excess. Then probably an eggshell a day will give you all the calcium you need. But where else could you get that amount of calcium if you refused to use calcium as an eggshell supplement? Oh, I suppose just a leaf based diet would. Eventually get enough calcium. No, just dark green leafy veg. But you probably have to make a fair amount of it to get the same. Yeah, and if it's well cooked you get more of the nutrients. Right. The experiment where they gave rats a vegetable diet of fresh vegetables another group had exactly the same vegetables that had been canned. And the ones getting the canned vegetables lived perfectly well and the others wasted away. Couldn't assimilate the nutrients.
**CONTEXT:** Recommending fruit-based carbohydrate intake and dark leafy greens as alternative calcium sources if eggshells are not consumed, and highlighting the importance of proper preparation for nutrient assimilation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the gums, in particular carrageenan, I've got an article on my website about carrageenan. A few years ago, probably three years ago, one of the organic cream producers, most of the grocery stores, stock. I started getting sick on their cream and saw that they were using carrageenan in their thick whipping cream. And the same thing happened with some of the ice creams I had been eating for years. They made me sick and I looked at the label and saw they were adding gums. And the Many of the cheeses are adding those as carriers for the flavoring agents, culture, microorganisms and such to make it easier to produce the cheese. And the dairy often doesn't realize that the culture organisms may be suspended in alginate or carotene. And one researcher has demonstrated in many animal experiments that carotene is carcinogenic. But the FDA and various agencies allow it to be used in food because they say it's only the degraded carotene which is carcinogenic. And when bacteria in your intestine act on it, they degrade it. But when it goes in your mouth, it's, according to the FDA, not carcinogenic.
**CONTEXT:** Warning about the potential health risks associated with gums like carrageenan, citing personal experience and research indicating carcinogenicity, and discussing the FDA's stance on its safety.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh sure. And contact with a can is another possible source of contamination. But the reason it tastes so bad is that it's heavily oxidized.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining that evaporated milk can be oxidized and contaminated by its packaging, contributing to its poor taste.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, just the soaking process, activating the enzymes in the dough, even if it's ground and can't sprout, 8 to 12 hours of being moistened allows the enzymes to activate the same process that would happen in sprouting. And so the phytic acid, for example, is broken down into inacidol and phosphate. And gluten is partly broken down, so that if you soak the bread too long, you don't get a light, spongy loaf, you get sort of a crumbly... Cornbread loaf.
**CONTEXT:** Explaining how soaking grains, similar to sprouting, activates enzymes that break down phytic acid and gluten, improving digestibility.

**RAY PEAT:** So people who are trying to avoid the heavy protein, anti-inflammatory diet, and they're actually getting a lot of grains in their diet, they're getting a lot of phosphorus, like you said, and the same thing as if people eat just a lot of meat and not very many grains, they're getting a lot of phosphorus, so both of those diet spectrums are out of balance as far as calcium and... Yeah, and the body can, at least in the short range, it can handle quite an imbalance. Lots of Americans have been growing up on a 7 to 1 phosphate to calcium ratio, where milk is 1.3 to 1 in the other direction. And probably the long range optimum is something like that in milk. Somewhere between a ratio of 1 to 1 up to maybe even 2 to 1 in favor of calcium dephosphate.
**CONTEXT:** Discussing dietary imbalances in calcium and phosphorus, particularly in grain-heavy or meat-heavy diets, and contrasting them with the favorable ratio found in milk.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, everyone should have a cow next door. There you go. Okay, but for people in the city... Then a goat if you're in the city. A goat on the rooftop. My father built a barn when we lived in southern Oregon that looked like a little cottage. The cow lived, ate, got milked in this little house and... It made the neighborhood look more like a residential, not a farm.
**CONTEXT:** Advocating for personal access to milk sources, suggesting keeping a cow or goat, even in urban settings.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you have one of the articles warning about... The dangerous estrogen metabolites in milk was done by this partnership of national institutes for health with the Science Applications International Corporation, I think it's called, and they are also effectively a branch of the Homeland Security Agency and......military defense project, internet technology, surveillance technology, and so on. They just featured in a book I'm reading right now by Peter Dale Scott about the politics of heroin smuggling in Southeast Asia, and they're very involved.
**CONTEXT:** Linking organizations promoting pasteurization and warning against milk to entities with ties to government surveillance and military projects, suggesting a complex motivation.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the motivation is very complex, but I think it's the new wave of what, in the 1930s, was a big campaign nationally against breastfeeding babies. And advocating early feeding of beans and bread and so on. And that is coming back in the ghettos first. They're telling women, if they're Mexican of origin, to wean their babies very early on beans. I think it's motivated by a kind of a class war. Make it cheaper if they're going to keep having food stamps, they don't want people buying fancy food like milk and meat and eggs.
**CONTEXT:** Suggesting that the push for pasteurization and against raw milk is part of a broader agenda to control food choices, potentially driven by economic and class-based motivations, drawing parallels to historical campaigns against breastfeeding.

**RAY PEAT:** I've been looking into this yogurt thing because yogurt is essentially the same as milk in the quantities of protein but it has a much much higher lactic acid content which is hard in your liver. And so there's this yogurt called faye yogurt. F-A-G-E. F-A-G-E, fudge or whatever but it says on there Greek strained yogurt and when you make cheese you strain the whey out and out goes the lactic acid and when you make yogurt you retain the lactic acid rich whey normally. Normal American yogurt retains the lactic acid rich whey. So this faye yogurt has 23 grams of protein per cup which means they have to strain out the whey in order to concentrate the casein and the cheese-like protein in the yogurt because they don't have any thickeners in it. And so that's a yogurt that's not tart because most of the whey the lactic acid rich whey has been strained out which makes it tart and actually it's not good to have a tart yogurt and to replace milk with the yogurt. Because of the harmful effect on the liver. The lactic acid besides burdening your liver causing a tendency to hypoglycemia from not storing enough glycogen, lactic acid also produces fibrosis, inflammation and even contributes to the cancer metabolism.
**CONTEXT:** Critiquing yogurt, particularly strained varieties like Fage, for its high lactic acid content, which can burden the liver, contribute to hypoglycemia, and promote inflammation and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you look at studies of aggression in dogs they treat them with these SSRI drugs and they find that... After a few weeks when their aggression has subsided, their serotonin has gone down. So the drugs that are sold supposedly to raise serotonin, when they work, they might actually be lowering your serotonin. And serotonin is a hormone of withdrawal, anxiety, and suppressing metabolism, lowering your demands. It's kind of an emergency anti-stress hormone that is necessary in context, but when you're chronically stressed, it's what causes stomach ulcers, contributes to fibrosis of every system, scleroderma, for example, hardening of the arteries, osteoporosis, the last couple of years. It's recognized as probably the main immediate contributor to osteoporosis, which is associated with depression and many other conditions, which are actually high serotonin conditions. So we would advise people not to use serotonin. And not to use whey protein powder because it's highly oxidized and the amino acids in whey are mainly tripped fan, which is the precursor. amino acid to make serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** Debunking the notion of serotonin as a "feel-good" hormone, explaining its role in withdrawal, anxiety, and metabolic suppression, and linking it to conditions like ulcers, fibrosis, and osteoporosis.

**RAY PEAT:** But one other thing I just want to say is the serotonin is, we've just been brainwashed to believe that serotonin is a feel-good hormone because the drug companies wanted to sell us the SSRIs, which don't actually, they don't appear to be raising the serotonin, they appear to be lowering it. And those patents are expiring so they'll be coming out with a new kind of antidepressant and we'll stop hearing so much about this and then we'll have to research that.
**CONTEXT:** Asserting that the perception of serotonin as a feel-good hormone is a result of pharmaceutical marketing, and that SSRIs may actually lower serotonin levels.
