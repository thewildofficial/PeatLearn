**RAY PEAT:** I guess I started basically when I started in graduate school. I had been reading on my own, but I decided to study physiology in the biology department at the University of Oregon in 1968. And since then I've been pretty much full-time working in physiology-related things. Reproductive endocrinology was what I did my dissertation on. How oxidative metabolism interacts with aging, estrogen, and so on to regulate fertility and sterility. Part of that thesis work was... It involves the aging of metabolism and how oxygen came to be wasted more and more with aging or under the influence of stress or high estrogen. And the age pigment, lipofuscin, was one of the things that I found was involved in high estrogen and aging or stress or radiation damage. And lipofuscin is... a breakdown product of polyunsaturated fatty acids, largely, with other things bound into little brown lumps in the cells. And it consumes oxygen and wastes energy and eventually can kill the cell. But its main function seems to be to waste oxygen and energy. And those are those little brown spots that people call age spots or liver spots on their skin. Yes, they form in the brain, on the skin, everywhere. And they tend to get formed faster and faster the more stress you're under. And pretty soon if you're under the influence of unopposed estrogen, they can just eat all the oxygen and not leave any for the cell functions. And that was what really started me getting interested in the unsaturated fat metabolism. I did that dissertation in 1972, and that was the year that John Yudkin published his book. I think it was called Pure White and Deadly or something. Pure White and Dangerous, maybe. And I read that and... I was so impressed by his argument that sugar increases blood lipids, saturated fats and cholesterol that that was what started me on the idea of recommending increased sugar for people who were under stress because I had already become convinced that there was no basis at all for the connection between high cholesterol and... saturated fats and atherosclerosis and heart disease and so on. And so when I would see someone deficient in progesterone, having too much estrogen and age pigment, they would often recover if they could increase their cholesterol production. And the simplest way to do that was to have them eat some extra sugar. And that started me seeing the therapeutic possibilities of sugar. But from there I worked backwards, understanding where the lipid hypothesis had come from, and especially the doctrine that essential fatty acids are essential nutritionally. And since they're what lipofuscin is made from... It seemed increasingly important to understand how that theory came about. So I saw that George and Mildred Burr were the ones who had created that idea in 1929 and 30. And in their experiment, they didn't at that time know......about most of the essential nutrients, vitamins and minerals. And so they fed what they thought was a complete diet. And when they eliminated the linoleic and related so-called essential fatty acids, their animals developed skin symptoms and various things that they called the bird disease. And their diet consisted to purify it so they could put in only the nutrients that were known in 1929. They used a high sugar content, a little starch and protein casein that had been highly purified. They recrystallized the sugar. Precipitated the casein to eliminate all the vitamins and minerals from it and then added what they thought were the essential nutrients. So the animals, when they removed linoleic acid from their diet, developed these scaly tail symptoms and so on. Three years after that, George Burr put......one of his rats under a bell jar and saw that it was burning oxygen at 50% faster rate than the rats getting the normal essential fatty acid diet. He decided that that was because their skin was leaky because he said the... the essential fatty acids create a barrier in the skin, just making this up out of whole cloth, but in the same journals where George and Mildred Burr published these ideas, those journals had already published articles by several well-known researchers showing that animals are healthier without fats in their diet. And lived longer, didn't get cancer and so on, but the Burrs just absolutely ignored the counter-evidence and just went ahead and published their doctrine and their financers supported them, but the world didn't pay much attention to it. Fifteen years later, in the mid-1940s, Roger Williams' famous lab in Texas, University of Texas......had been working on the B vitamins, discovering new B vitamins and essential minerals and such. And they created the exact diet that Burr had fed the rats, created the so-called Burr disease, and then cured it by supplementing them with vitamin B6. And so what had happened was that... On a high sugar diet, the animals were burning calories 50% faster than normal. And on a terribly deficient diet, they got scaly skin. Largely because of a vitamin D6 deficiency. And the birds, that pretty much just ruined their scientific accomplishment. But meanwhile... The pig industry had come to have problems with the chemical that they were using to reduce feed intake, shut down their thyroid function and make them get fat cheaply. And they found that by substituting a high polyunsaturated fat diet, soybeans and corn, they could suppress their thyroid. Just as well as using that toxic drug and make them get fat on a small food intake. And the BERS essential fatty acids turned out to be what was suppressing the thyroid. But at the same time, the seed oil industry was losing its market for... extracting these unsaturated fats to use in paint and plastic manufacture. And that turned the whole seed oil industry, all the seed products that were used to fatten livestock, they found that they could increase the sales of these extracted seed oils by promoting the idea that they were healthful for human consumption. They had been... hardening them to make margarine. And by promoting their health benefits, they could sell them directly as liquid cooking oils and salad oils. And to do that, they found that a biological effect was that they lowered cholesterol production, or lowered the cholesterol that appeared in the blood, causing an increase in the liver. It was a defensive reaction, but they created the doctrine of cholesterol as the cause of heart disease and to eat more of the unsaturated fats, even though they knew that they would create obesity as they did in the pig industry. They convinced doctors by a huge campaign that cholesterol was found in the wall of... arteries that were developing atherosclerosis and that since you could lower the cholesterol in the blood they argued that you would lower the cholesterol in the wall of the artery and that that would prevent heart disease. And Ravenskov much later showed that none of those arguments had any evidence to support them. The atherosclerosis didn't have a direct connection to heart disease mortality. Cholesterol in the blood didn't have a connection directly with the formation of atherosclerosis. And dietary fats, saturated fats, didn't create the cholesterol in the blood. But there was a slight......backsliding in the ability to sell doctors on the idea of eating unsaturated fats to lower cholesterol. There was a study with veterans in which putting them on the liquid oil diet, eliminating saturated fats, caused more of them to die of heart disease and a lot more of them to die of cancer. So there was some problem with... with that lipid theory already in the 1960s, and John Yudkin came out, he had been doing research since the mid-50s. In 1972 he published this book arguing that sugar caused heart disease because it increased cholesterol. And already, since I knew that cholesterol didn't have anything to do with heart disease. Except protecting against it to some extent. Right. That was where I started realizing that he was right on the issue that sugar would increase cholesterol in some people.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to share his scientific background.

**RAY PEAT:** Cholesterol protects every cell. It's increased in the location that's being injured, especially. But it's necessary for healthy cell division, DNA replication, nerve function, learning. It's our most basic anti-stress protective substance.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of cholesterol in protecting against damage from oxidized vegetable oils.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and what starts the inflammation in the artery wall and everywhere else is the breakdown of the essential fatty acids into the free radical products and lipofuscin. You can extract lipofuscin from every arterial plaque, every degenerative tissue. You find the breakdown products, but you don't find the fresh polyunsaturated fats because they're unstable. They break down quickly, and what you find is the cholesterol that's there repairing the tissue, the saturated fats that didn't break down, and the lipofuscin which is the X essential fatty acid. They really show insult.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on what unsaturated fatty acids are and their instability.

**RAY PEAT:** In an experiment I put a little clear plastic tube into the cork of a bottle of safflower or corn oil. And put the other end in a cup of water. And sitting at room temperature you could see the water being sucked up into the tube. As the oil sitting there was just consuming oxygen and becoming rancid, even at room temperature, but it is much faster at body temperature.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the common perception of sugar as being bad for you, similar to cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that's why that guy was calling us. The what do you call it dead that whitened or white and dead white and deadly and he said that it raised the cholesterol well now that they've proven that cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease and sugar raises cholesterol and that's a good guy so what else are they saying about sugar oh that uh lustig professor at university of california san francisco in his famous lecture uh uses the words toxic poison and evil someone counted 18 times in an hour and a half lecture and that was he was referring to fructose fructose yeah referring to fructose what the fruit the sugar that's found in fruit is toxic evil and deadly but but since sucrose is 50 percent fructose uh he was applying it to a sucrose too right or or the um high fructose corn syrup which is almost fifty percent fructose and he was saying that it's just like alcohol and being toxic to the liver but that's one of the weirdest things he said because for many years people have been showing that it detoxifies many things that enter the liver including alcohol it can increase almost double the rate of destruction of alcohol and prevent liver damage in the process. But many other toxins are detoxified in the presence of fructose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why mainstream medical science promotes the idea that sugar is bad for you.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's this momentum. They're committed to the mistaken cholesterol lipid theory of heart disease and I think you can sort of kill the scale and all of the ranting against cholesterol and animal fat has just slid over to concentrate on sugar and fructose.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the link between sugar, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

**RAY PEAT:** The same thing that Burr demonstrated. His diet, you know, was... most of the energy was from plain sucrose and his animals respired 50% faster than animals on a normal diet. That's been seen over and over, fructose in particular. Even a small amount of fructose added to a standard diet will catalyze the oxidation of other substances, glucose and fat, both. But mostly it catalyzes the use of glucose, turning it to carbon dioxide. So it helps your cells use oxygen more efficiently, helps the cell respire, which is basically function better. Yeah, and that increase is just about 30 to 50 percent in all of the publications where they've looked at it. And the increased CO2 is also very beneficial, and that's another erroneous belief or misconception that CO2 is actually bad and oxygen is good, but it's actually the other way around, isn't it? Yeah, and experimenters who have given a fruit toast supplement to diabetics see that they respond just as well or better than people without diabetes. To the ability to oxidize fructose and produce energy and one group happened to look at the fructose that's normally present in everyone's bloodstream and Compared it to diabetics and saw that diabetics are deficient in fructose. There's almost no fructose circulating in their bloodstream and so naturally it would be. Therapeutic to restore a normal level, but since they aren't able to metabolize glucose that's apparently why they metabolize fructose to carbon dioxide even a little faster than healthy people do. So that's orange juice and honey for diabetics. Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of sugar in metabolism and its effect on diabetics.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, I'm sort of ambivalent about it because some research shows that it is protective and can work somewhat like fructose, but my own experience with it is that it can cause a lot of digestive irritation.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about glycerin.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, when you eat any free sugar, sucrose or fructose or glucose, it is so quickly absorbed in the upper part of the intestine. The jejunum gets the biggest part of it. And... That means that you're not feeding sugar to bacteria because the intestine should be pretty sterile in the upper part. Right.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if fructose is non-fermentable.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's a whole topic in itself. If you look at the blood sugar in an animal or person carrying a tumor, their blood sugar generally is at least normal and even if they don't eat any sugar, they'll still keep their blood sugar at about the same level. And there have been many attempts to starve the cancer by lowering the blood sugar. But the cancer, the tumor is sending out signals to provide sugar and protein, amino acids and fatty acids that it needs to grow. And so if you cut off the sugar supply, all it does is send out more stress signals to increase the basically cortisol production. To break down your tissues, and it causes tissue wasting, the cachexia, that is the worst feature of cancer usually, is produced by the stress hormones which are converting your protein in tissues and fat tissues into food for the cancer to make up for the absence of sugar. One experimenter......using to treat tumors of, for example, the leg would, since the circulation could be isolated, they put in a high concentration of glucose into the artery feeding this tumor in the extremity and they could get an extremely high concentration of sugar to it and that killed the tumor. Without hurting the healthy tissue because the tumor has such an unlimited appetite for anything that it will eat itself to death. In vitro, if you feed unsaturated fats to cancer cells, they'll eat themselves to death. But in the body, the unsaturated fats are... under control, other tissues will consume them and be injured. And you can't do anything but stimulate a cancer with the unsaturated fats. But with high concentration of sugar, the experimenters showed that sugar would be consumed to the point that it would kill the cancer.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between sugar and cancer, and why sugar makes an affected joint hurt while honey and maple syrup do not.

**RAY PEAT:** The sucrose is the main ingredient in maple syrup, and the balance of fructose and glucose in honey is approximately the same. So it must be the other ingredients that are having the effect.

**CONTEXT:** The host expresses curiosity about the difference in effect between sucrose, honey, and maple syrup on an inflamed joint.

**RAY PEAT:** My parents ate astounding amounts of white sugar, astounding. And they both lived into their 19th. In reasonably good shape. So I find that very interesting.

**CONTEXT:** The host shares an anecdote about their parents' high sugar intake and longevity.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you're actually looking at glycemic indexes... the glycemic indexes of some potatoes and rice are almost double that of white sugar. Fructose, like you said, has a lower glycemic index than sucrose, but sucrose is not the guy that pure white sugar is not the guy that causes obesity and heart disease. Sure, if you eat enough of anything you're going to get an increased weight gain.

**CONTEXT:** The host questions the idea that white sugar is the culprit for obesity and heart disease, suggesting that other carbohydrates might be worse.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, if you were to... It increases your ability to burn fat by 30 to 50 percent, so you can eat much more without getting fat. Of the sucrose, as long as you stay away from the white flour and the white rice. Yeah. Yeah, because all the...

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if eating sugar without white flour would be less fattening due to a lower glycemic index.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, no, because there's no starch there. So the glycemic, if we're talking about glycemic index and raising your sugar and causing obesity. It's more the higher glycemic index. Well, I can weigh pretty fast on ice cream, but it's probably the calories and all the heavy foods and the egg yolks and yeah. It's the fat in the cream. But yeah, if you decided you were going to eat sugar, but not mixed with any kind of carbohydrates. I drink orange juice and I eat fresh fruits and I make lemonade and.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the impact of ice cream, which is mixed with fats, on weight gain and glycemic index.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that's, I believe in fruit toast and I think that's good, although you can overdo anything. I mean, when I drink fruit juice, I usually drink it without any added carbohydrates. I dilute it with half water so that I'm not getting too much even of the fructose, but there's like 600 calories sometimes in a quart of good juice that has no added sugars, that's from the fructose.

**CONTEXT:** The host shares their practice of diluting fruit juice and their belief in fruit toast.

**RAY PEAT:** All right. Fructose in particular acts very much like T3, but both glucose and fructose increase the conversion of the inactive thyroxine to the active T3 and they do several things to increase the thyroid activity, lowering the stress hormones as well as increasing the active thyroid hormone and the... Energy provided by both the glucose and the T3 in the liver will give it the energy to produce the cholesterol that's needed if you're eating enough sugar and not producing toxins in your intestine by eating hard to digest, fibrous, starchy foods. So they could replace their starchy carbohydrates, their breads, their grains, their beans, their rice. With fruits and honey in combination with the protein so it's not just sugar on its own and that would help their liver to increase thyroid hormone as well as to increase their cholesterol. Yeah and all of the sugary fruits come with a very high concentration of potassium and other minerals that help to metabolize the sugar in a safe way so you don't turn it to fat.

**CONTEXT:** The engineer asks about the link between hypothyroidism, low cholesterol, and starch intake.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh Yudkin, spelled Y-U-D-K-I-N. Okay great and then we also mentioned. He was the the one that popularized the glucose causes or sucrose causes heart disease. Right okay so that's a that's a myth his information. And then the medical doctor and PhD researcher Ufi Ravnskov, R-A-V-N-S-K-O-V, done many many good works there, looks like the cholesterol myths one of the one of the larger larger things that he's done that we are talking about this evening.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to repeat the names of researchers he mentioned.
