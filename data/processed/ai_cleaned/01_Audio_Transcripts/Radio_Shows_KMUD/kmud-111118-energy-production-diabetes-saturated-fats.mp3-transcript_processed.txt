**RAY PEAT:** "The people who created the idea of the essential fatty acids actually a few years later did an experiment with one of their lab people that I think really showed all of the important features of why people should not eat the essential so-called fatty acids. In 1929, when the Burrs published their claim that the polyunsaturated fats linoleic acid and linolenic, they said those are essential for life. Other biologists had shown that animals were healthier when they had no fat in their diet, had almost no cancer, and were spontaneously developing. But the Burrs simply ignored the evidence that the fats were harmful and other biologists ignored them pretty much for about 20 years because the evidence was so overwhelmingly against their claims. But in their faith that those fats were essential, one of their lab people... agreed to go on a fat-free diet for six months. And his health remarkably improved. His blood lipids changed somewhat. The cholesterol went down a little and the triglycerides went up a little. But the total lipids' quantities stayed about the same. He didn't get tired after a day's work, as he always had, and his life-long weekly migraine headaches disappeared forever."
**CONTEXT:** The discussion centers on the historical claims of essential fatty acids and early contradictory evidence.

**RAY PEAT:** "So it was all a marketing campaign to... sell the idea that not only are those fats essential, but they're good for you, and like a drug they'll prevent heart disease. But very soon people started producing evidence showing that in fact linoleic acid not only causes heart disease, but promotes cancer, immune problems, all kinds of... things similar to what they had seen in the animals."
**CONTEXT:** The shift from scientific claims to marketing of polyunsaturated fats is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and in the 1950s they were feeding a lot of fish to mink... in the main farms, and they were producing... what was called the yellow fat disease, which apparently was related to the age pigment lipofuscin, which is a brown pigment that develops from the breakdown of the polyunsaturated fats. So the fish oils were, right along with the deep oils, were seen to be toxic in the 50s and 60s. But by the 1970s, linoleic acid was... being recognized as a major cause of heart disease and cancer. And so they had sold the public on the idea of essential fatty acids. So they just changed the story and said, well, fish oils or linseed oil are a different kind of fat. They aren't the omega-6 oils like the deadly linoleic acid. After the omega-3, but those had already themselves been incriminated with the yellow fat and lipofuscin disease. So they just switched tactics to the N-3s and tried to sell those, huh?"
**CONTEXT:** The historical toxicity of fish oils and their re-marketing as omega-3s is explained.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and cholesterol is one of our most important protective antioxidants generally protective anti-toxin and for the unsaturated fats to lower that in the total production of it and the level in the blood it is part of why they're something to avoid the liver nodes to increase retain any cholesterol it can because it's needed for cell division to go on, for cell function to go on. All of the internal cellular processes rely on both cholesterol and saturated fatty acids. And if you overdose on the polyunsaturated, all of these intracellular mechanisms are deranged. By interfering with the cholesterol and saturated fat functions, the chromosomes, the spindles that helps the cell divide, separates the chromosomes and so on. All of these are stabilized and require cholesterol and saturated fats to function. And so you get deranged expression of genes. Deranged cell division if you have too much polyunsaturated fats."
**CONTEXT:** The role of cholesterol and saturated fats in cellular function and the detrimental effects of polyunsaturated fats are detailed.

**RAY PEAT:** "The safe oils are butter, chocolate fat, which is mostly stearic acid, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, beef fat, lamb fat, and olive oil. People think of pork fat and chicken fat as being bad fats, and they actually are bad fats because of what they feed the pigs and the chickens. So unlike beef fat or butter or cream and milk and lamb fat and any other ruminant animal that has multiple stomachs, the chicken fat and the pork fat are just as bad as the corn oil because basically the pigs and the chickens are eating corn."
**CONTEXT:** A list of safe and unsafe fats is provided, with an explanation for the difference in animal fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "And the Eskimos don't get heart disease because they eat a lot of fish. It's because they eat whale blubber which is very saturated. They live off of whale blubber."
**CONTEXT:** The traditional diet of Eskimos and its saturated fat content is discussed in relation to heart disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and vitamin E even in humans will cause some of that in the intestine if there are bacteria present with the fat, vitamin E lets bacteria saturate and detoxify some of the PUFA. So one of the... Small effects of vitamin E is to destroy the polyunsaturated fat rather than just protecting against its after-effects."
**CONTEXT:** The role of vitamin E in detoxifying polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is explained.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there are these specific needs, a protein deficient person or animal will gravitate towards a higher protein in the food, but the most intense... connection between need and appetite is between sugar and salt."
**CONTEXT:** The physiological basis for cravings, particularly for sugar and salt, is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, some people call it the Randall Cycle, but there's no cycle involved, it's just a competition. When you raise your free fatty acids, you inhibit the ability to oxidise glucose, and stress increases the free fatty acids, and oxidising glucose is what you need to overcome. The stress and so it's sort of a counterproductive reaction but the reason it's counterproductive is that our systems are designed not to eat PUFA and it's PUFA which very systematically it's just an amazing black and white almost difference the way the PUFA turn on the very stress hormones that. Interfere with the energy making it the body need more stress hormones and Blocking the energy so that we need more turning on the the very things that cause the problem"
**CONTEXT:** The Randall Hypothesis, concerning the inhibition of glucose oxidation by free fatty acids, is explained.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the properly functioning body would be logical. The stress reaction would provide energy in the absence of food, would provide the saturated fats from the storage, and at the same time it would inhibit the stress hormones and allow the cycle to be broken. So it's just that we happen to be living in a time since the 1920s when they make poisonous fats and our body is used to eating saturated fat for thousands and thousands of years and it's not responding to the unsaturated fats like it does to saturated. So we're just getting poisoned basically. It's not the body's fault. If science had simply been looking to understand the situation since 1930 things would have been very clear. The very systematic differences between saturated and unsaturated fats would have become perfectly apparent in just a few years of open discussion. But advertising just totally swamped the whole cultural situation. Even the scientists and doctors dealing with the situation. They don't see the picture of how clearly polarized the types of fat are in their effects on the physiology. It's just become a big snowball effect."
**CONTEXT:** The historical context of the shift to poisonous fats and the failure of science and advertising to address the issue is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Eat good fats and keep your energy working. Lots of snacks."
**CONTEXT:** A concise recommendation for maintaining energy levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "So whilst the misinformation that's out there concerning everything we've talked about is so prevalent don't believe that there's not another alternative because there is it's just you just have to open your eyes and open your ears."
**CONTEXT:** An encouraging message about finding alternatives to prevalent misinformation.
