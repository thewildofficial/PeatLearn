**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, there are some that are relatively safe, but it's the whole theory behind why they exist that is the problem. Mercury compounds used to be used, but basically they just kill the kidney cells and let stuff leak out. And they were the common diuretics for a very long time, until the 1950s. New compounds came on the market that had a variety of effects on the kidneys. And it was really the promotion of those that created an ideology that diuretics are really key to treating heart disease and several other problems such as toxemia of pregnancy. But really I think it's mostly a marketing strategy to orient physiology around making the kidneys leak out more water. The real problem is what causes the water retention and almost anything that seriously injures the organism causes water retention. Like a problem following surgery very often is that the person stops forming urine and is in shock. Any very serious sickness is going to in many ways cause the reduced ability to form urine properly. And it's sort of a plumbers approach to physiology to think of just opening up the kidneys and letting the liquid out faster.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on modern diuretics and their safety?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even before the inflammation there's the energy problem and there's something as simple as drinking too much water in relation to the energy your body is producing. For example, a low thyroid person who can't produce much metabolic energy is very susceptible to drinking too much water and getting a very general disruption of their physiology. A pint or so of water passing suddenly through your stomach to your intestine causes a surge of serotonin release. And that's simply a model of stress or shock in general, anything that shocks you or stresses you, tends to start the same process. But just a surge of water hitting the intestine is enough to increase serotonin, which then stimulates the production of prolactin. And prolactin is associated with water retention. Serotonin itself is in a direct way. And serotonin increases the production of aldosterone, which produces water retention and inflammation and sets off a chain of reactions that lead to such things as heart failure. And the unfortunate thing is when someone is low thyroid, they're usually very very thirsty all the time anyway so they crave that water and they think they have to have that water in order because they're well, they say their body's really craving it. It causes the tissues to retain water even though they aren't producing much evaporation through their lungs or skin, but it tends to leak out of their bloodstream into the tissues and produce edema. And edema is harmful to all of the tissues in a direct way. It turns on a whole anabolic system of shifting away from oxidative metabolism, activating lipolysis, the release of fatty acids, shifting cell metabolism towards burning fat rather than sugar, imitating diabetes and aging. So that's why you said that even any kind of leaf extract or tea made from a leaf of a plant is going to have minerals in it that help prevent this from happening. Yeah, and if you made a cup of tea, you'd sip on it slowly, you wouldn't just drink it down like a pint of water.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that low thyroid can lead to water retention. Can you elaborate on the mechanism and how drinking too much water exacerbates this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and if you made a cup of tea, you'd sip on it slowly, you wouldn't just drink it down like a pint of water. And the minerals, it isn't. It's essential that it be magnesium and potassium. Calcium and sodium have many of the same functions, even though each thing has its place in the mechanisms. If you're in shock, you can relieve the symptoms pretty much by taking more of any one of the alkaline minerals: potassium, sodium, magnesium, or calcium. In heart failure and lung inflammation, many of the things that happen with shock or aging or any serious disease, the lungs and the heart tend to get waterlogged and lose function. Just giving a very concentrated salt solution intravenously will relieve the symptoms very often. They've doubled the survival, or cut the mortality rate in half by just giving extra sodium intravenously.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the importance of minerals like potassium and magnesium. Can you explain their role in preventing water retention and how they relate to conditions like heart failure?

**RAY PEAT:** It's a very interesting point that you've just opened up there because that begs the question, why is it so often that doctors avoid, tell people to avoid salt and why is salt so maligned heavily as a problem element? Especially when they are swelling and then here they're using it in surgery so I mean it really got this big boost around 1950 when the diuretics came on the market that they found the diuretics took sodium out at the same time they took water out. And so they said you should get the same effect by restricting the sodium intake. And they applied that to pregnant women and Tom Brewer and some other people wrote about the horrible effects of sodium restriction in pregnancy. Plus using diuretics. If you combine the two you get more serious effects. After I had been reading Tom Brewer's work for a long time, I was seeing similarities between premenstrual syndrome and the toxemia of pregnancy that he had worked on. And I finally decided to suggest to young women who are having premenstrual water retention and not having any good results just by stopping their salt intake, I suggested that they follow Brewer's prescription to increase their salt intake when they were having edema, water retention problems. And to go according to their craving for salt, rather than avoiding the craving. The first person that tried it just had a total avoidance of premenstrual water retention the very first month she tried it. Quite a lot. Shooketh on even a food that was already salted, she would just add more, lots more onto it and just absolutely stopped right from then on, never had a water retention problem again.

**CONTEXT:** Given the common advice to avoid salt, why do you advocate for increasing salt intake, especially for conditions like premenstrual water retention, and what is the historical context of this advice?

**RAY PEAT:** David McCarron, 30 or 40 years ago, was studying the issue, and he looked at the figures that the government published that that recommendation was based on. And he thought that if you look at the figures carefully, the people who eat the least salt had the highest blood pressure. The people who ate the most salt had the lowest blood pressure. And he saw what the figures really showed that led to the misinterpretation was that low calcium intake was associated with hypertension. And the sodium was really there sort of as an innocent bystander, associated with the calcium deficiency.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned David McCarron's research regarding salt and blood pressure. Can you explain his findings and the role of calcium deficiency in hypertension?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, David McCarron, I think, has probably written maybe 150 articles on the subject. I think he was at Stanford or some California university when he started saying it's not high sodium, it's low calcium that causes hypertension. And I think that university invited him to leave.

**CONTEXT:** What was the reaction to David McCarron's findings that low calcium, not high sodium, causes hypertension?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's the essential idea. Yeah. So, the low calcium intakes cause the calcium to leak out of the bones and into the blood and that causes the calcification of the arteries. Calcium intake, among other things, increases your parathyroid hormone, which pulls calcium out of your bones and favors its movement into cells of all kinds, and when calcium is taken up by cells, it stimulates them and tends to make them contract, and that's one of the places that thyroid and the energy production comes into the question because carbon dioxide produced by the action of thyroid, carbon dioxide keeps calcium out of cells. Even if you breathe in a bag and increase your carbon dioxide or take baking soda or whatever, the carbon dioxide will relax your blood vessels by helping the calcium to move out of the blood vessels and back into the bones.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the mechanism by which low calcium intake leads to arterial calcification and hypertension, and how carbon dioxide plays a role in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Each of these things sets in motion a whole sequence of events. The low carbon dioxide, which lets calcium get into cells and excite them and tighten up the blood vessels, for example. It's low carbon dioxide also lets the platelets release their serotonin and the serotonin besides adding to the tension of the blood vessels makes them permeable and leaky so that the water isn't retained in the bloodstream but leaks through into the cells and the cells that are taking up calcium are also taking up water. Basically, 2,000 milligrams of calcium is a really important thing for somebody with hypertension to start implementing into their regime.

**CONTEXT:** How does low carbon dioxide contribute to hypertension through calcium uptake and serotonin release?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, David McCarron's data showed that this inverse connection between salt and blood pressure, the high salt users actually had lower blood pressure and one of the things that is involved there is that sodium helps the cell, stimulates the cell to expel calcium. The sodium activates the thyroid function and the thyroid function pushes calcium out of the cell and lets the cell relax.

**CONTEXT:** Can you further explain how sodium and thyroid function contribute to cellular calcium regulation and relaxation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he was talking about the protein and adding salt to your food. But the milk has other things besides the protein. The calcium has its direct effect on blood pressure, and the sugar of milk has its diuretic-like action. So the calcium and sugar add to the quality of the protein.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding Dr. Tom Brewer's diet for toxemia of pregnancy, what were the key components, and how did milk contribute to its effectiveness?

**RAY PEAT:** If you think of the sequence of stress effects that I mentioned: too much water leading to too much serotonin and aldosterone and prolactin, which are all inflammatory. And cause water retention. And if you choose your substances with reference to inhibiting any or all of those, that's going to be an anti-edema, anti-inflammatory diet or treatment. Thyroid and progesterone, for example, lower all of these things. Progesterone is a very powerful antagonist to aldosterone. And drugs are being developed to be very similar to progesterone, but to be patentable, so they can sell them as you treat heart failure and water retention and inflammation and so on. Using any of the natural steroids derived from pregnenolone, either progesterone or DHEA, will help with water retention and edema and heart failure and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond diuretics, what other substances or hormones can help with water retention and inflammation by counteracting the effects of aldosterone and prolactin?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, aldosterone is causing the inflammation and the water retention. Yeah, and aldosterone increases besides inflammation, it leads to fibrosis and prolonged heart failure and vascular and kidney disease and so on, leads to fibrosis, lung disease, everywhere that water retention and inflammation start, they tend to end up with fibrosis. So, 60 or 70 years ago, a researcher, Lipp Schutze, called pregnenolone and progesterone, the anti-fibromatogenic steroids. They start out inhibiting fibrous overproduction and end up protecting against tumors.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that aldosterone leads to fibrosis. Can you elaborate on the connection between aldosterone, water retention, inflammation, and the development of fibrotic conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, very high. And it shut down my kidneys, etc., etc. Yeah, that was nine, ten months ago. Once a month I do a calcium level check, blood test. But the problem is he's got me on 15 milligrams of prednisone. Yeah, well, the prednisone I'm sure is because the, uh, as an anti-inflammatory steroid, so because of the sarcoidosis and the inflammatory quote. So I know that caused the issue, but I think he's using prednisone to keep the calcium levels down, but the way you talk sounds like calcium levels are a pretty good idea. Well, calcium not in the blood, but in the bones, which is where the calcium should be, so consuming adequate dietary calcium in the form of powdered eggshells or consuming dairy in the form of milk. Getting about 2,000 milligrams of calcium a day will actually let you store the calcium in your bones and prevent it from being in your bloodstream, which is what happens when you don't take up enough dietary calcium. So when you said your blood levels were high, that's because your bones were allowing the calcium that was in the bones to leak out into your blood supply and that's caused more of the problem. The best way to lower your blood calcium would be to intake in enough dietary calcium.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding high blood calcium levels and sarcoidosis, you suggest increasing dietary calcium. Can you explain why this helps lower blood calcium and prevent issues like kidney shutdown?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that would also cause what Dr. Pete was talking about with calcium is that calcium in the endothelium, which is the tissue within the lining of the arterial, the arteries and the arterioles, the vascular supply that's under high pressure, that is actually made more stretching elastic by not having calcium taken up into it, which happens when there's too much calcium in the blood and not enough in the bones. Your body through parathyroids starts to pull out calcium from the bone. Yeah, we want to do the reverse. Exactly, so making sure you have a high enough dietary intake of calcium will be the best. There should be a lot of dairy products. Well, it doesn't have to be dairy products. Dairy products are very good and we do recommend milk intake. Four to six glasses of whole milk if you're not overweight or two percent if you don't want the fat so much. Right, I do. One of the other best ways of achieving high calcium in your dietary intake will be capsules of powdered eggshell. Oh, really? Yeah, I mean what Dr. Pete's always talked about in the past is taking your eggshells and just washing them out, washing that membrane out from the inside, storing them until you have ten or a dozen or so, and then putting them in the oven at about 350 on a baking sheet, a cookie sheet, and then put them into a coffee grinder, an electric coffee grinder, and then that resulting powder you can take about half a teaspoon a day will give you about a quarter teaspoon three times a day is just over 2,000 milligrams. So that 2,000 milligrams of calcium there will be very beneficial in terms of decreasing your blood calcium, but increasing your uptake of calcium into your bones. And we've seen this with our clients. We've seen that they have a high calcium level in their blood.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that calcium in the endothelium affects arterial elasticity. Can you elaborate on this and how dietary calcium intake influences this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the calcium and vitamin D work fairly synergistically, so. Yeah, I had kind of the reverse opinion. I thought lust was best. Well, no, because you want to bring your blood levels down by making sure you give it back to the bone. Give it back to the bone. Right, exactly, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned vitamin D supplements. Can you clarify the role of vitamin D in calcium metabolism and its relationship with calcium levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the ratio isn't as big an issue as a lot of books say. If you're getting a little excess sodium and calcium, it spares the magnesium. The sodium and calcium activate cell respiration and cell respiration is needed for cells to retain magnesium. So if you're low in sodium and calcium, you depend on a good thyroid function to retain magnesium. So any stress that increases aldosterone, for example, it's going to make you lose magnesium. So keeping your aldosterone and inflammation down, your thyroid, calcium, and sodium up is going to make you retain magnesium much more efficiently.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the ratio of calcium and magnesium, what is your perspective, and how do sodium and calcium influence magnesium retention?

**RAY PEAT:** Aspirin has been found to have a mild antiviral effect against several types of virus. Someone with AIDS sent me an old publication that they had begun a trial of aspirin for HIV infected people and they were getting good results when they discontinued the study, but it has been proven somewhat effective for several different kinds of virus, including the herpes or chickenpox type.

**CONTEXT:** What is your recommendation for chickenpox, specifically regarding aspirin?

**RAY PEAT:** You know, if you're having blood tests, it's good to have your vitamin D3 in the upper part of the normal range. And it would also be good to have the parathyroid hormone checked. When you're getting enough vitamin D and calcium, you will inhibit the parathyroid hormone. And the parathyroid hormone, although it has its place, you don't want it to be chronically elevated because it's a cancer promoter.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key blood markers to monitor for calcium metabolism, and what is the significance of parathyroid hormone levels in relation to vitamin D and cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** The carbon dioxide acts as if it's pulling more oxygen into the cell system. It activates the electron transport chain to use oxygen more quickly and effectively. So that is what would happen when this athlete would take baking soda. Yeah, they've done it with endurance races, giving them a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of the race. You would think that it would make them more alkaline. Alkaline is not a necessarily good state. The carbon dioxide actually enters the cell and becomes an acidic form from the baking soda bicarbonate. Momentarily makes your blood more alkaline, but the absorbed carbon dioxide becomes acidic inside the cell and the intracellular state should be slightly on the acid side when the oxygen is really working. They call it oxygen because it means acid former, and the acid that it makes is carbon dioxide. And in that slightly acidic state, oxygen is having its full action for producing energy. And it's that same energy production which takes the calcium out of the cell and lets the cell relax and recuperate properly. If you aren't producing or retaining enough carbon dioxide, the cell will begin making lactic acid. And the lactic acid leaves the cell in an alkaline stressed condition. Even though it's acidifying the blood, it's leaving the cell in a stressed alkaline condition that causes inflammation. So too much aerobic exercise becomes catabolic and inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** For athletes, how does increasing CO2 levels, for example, through baking soda intake, impact oxygen utilization and energy production at the cellular level?
