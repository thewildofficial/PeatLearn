**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I studied biology about 40 years ago at University of Oregon and since then I've been doing my newsletter and writing books and occasionally doing seminars for medical people, mainly, and over the years I've been thinking about the medical culture and what makes it so wrong. When I was in graduate school in, I think it was 1968 or 69, we had a seminar on cancer biology, and my part of it was the nature of carcinogenesis, and each person had a segment of cancer issue, and my part was to explain what things are carcinogenic and how they work. I listed 50 different types of things that are carcinogenic including inert objects embedded in the tissues, distilled water, and psychological stress. The professors were a little annoyed, well greatly annoyed. Because they, their whole point in doing the seminar was to work out the ways that mutations are carcinogenic. And they wanted me to talk about the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and such causing mutations. And that was just one very small section of what I covered in the carcinogen section. And since then, those biologists were still fairly in harmony with the medical view of cancer. But since then, with the cloning and stem cell research of the last ten years, biology has strongly turned away from that understanding of cancer. Those professors have retired, and I don't know what they're teaching now, but the active research in cancer is more in tune with the biology of stem cells rather than mutations.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked to outline his academic background and his early experiences with cancer biology research.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, it was when I did that seminar, but I was just gathering up stuff that was 30, 40 years old at that time, but it was still outside the academic preferences. But since then, because of the big changes in the gene industry, they've looked for natural events to parallel their genetic engineering. And so they've had to be open to people like Barbara McClintock, who showed that stress mutates corn plants and so on. And so that opened up the whole issue of psychological factors in the development of cancer and how stress affects immunity as well as cancer.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on how the understanding of cancer biology has shifted, moving away from a purely mutation-centric view towards incorporating factors like stress and environmental influences, aligning with earlier biological observations.

**RAY PEAT:** For decades people in the alternative health business have been asking that question how is it that doctors can forbid these experimental treatments to themselves or their family members if something really exists as an alternative they would not let their relatives die or themselves but it's such a deep cultural thing that they really believe it but they're trained in medical school in sort of a boot camp atmosphere where they don't have time to get philosophical about what they're learning but they're drilled with these ideas of genetic determinism and it was only less than 200 years ago that it was discovered that people are made out of cells and a few years after, someone discovered that people and animals are made of cells, they discovered that cancer is made of cells. And then, with Pasteur and so on, the germ theory of disease came up, and the atomic theory of chemistry and physics and so on. And everything fit into this being explained by the subunits that things are made of.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the historical reductionist approach in medicine, particularly the focus on cells and genetics, which influenced the understanding of cancer as a disease of "bad cells" or mutated genes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And that happened to fit the idea that a cancer is made of bad cells, some kind of difference in the cell. When genetics came up just a hundred years ago, genetics was used to explain what's different about cancer cells. And so they're a special kind of cell explained by a mutated gene which makes them. Completely alien to ourselves because they're genetically different right from the start they're different. So it's like a new being has come into existence of cancer. And the old tradition all the way back to the Greeks was to cut a tumor off or burn it off with a corrosive or with hot sticks or whatever. And so that line of medicine was being taught to people, and then they fit the idea of the alien cell into that tradition of cutting something out, and it was perfectly reinforcing. It was something that is not part of us that has to be eliminated, otherwise it'll kill us.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat details how the genetic theory of cancer reinforced the existing surgical approach of removing tumors, viewing cancer as an "alien" entity to be eradicated.

**RAY PEAT:** At the same time, other people were studying metabolism and physiology and trying to understand how an embryo turns into an adult. And seeing that there are fields governing the relationship of one cell to another in the developing embryo. Like electromagnetic fields? Well, including, yeah, including electrical gradients. But chemical fields, they didn't define the field. They just saw that a thing had an influence on its environment. And you would cut a piece of an embryo or even an adult animal, and then you could see a wave of cell division spread out. over the next hours in a ring around the entry. As a kind of messenger system or just a reaction? Well, some kind of a communication that the injured cells would send out something that would cause first one row of cells and then the next one to divide to replace the injured cell. Embryological developing fields and injury fields. It was partly electrical. The injured cells were found to produce a negative electrical charge, and that helps to organize molecules, and it probably involves even light emission from cell to cell as part of the field. And the idea of a cancer field was being demonstrated in the 1930s and 40s along with this field idea of developmental biology and they would show that if you found, say, a definite cancer in a piece of the intestine, if you examined circumference of rings around the cancer itself, you would find progressing away from that degrees of abnormality, grading off to normal through inflammation and different degrees of deterioration until finally it would be outright cancer at the center. So the idea of field and gradients of trouble were all the way through biology. But as soon as the molecular revolution came about with the great push from the government and the DNA doctrine started being used to explain everything, and they said that Information comes only from the gene to the expressed individual cell. The body is only a mortal product of the immortal reproducing genetic material. So that when virologists demonstrated that there were reverse transcriptases that made it possible to have an RNA virus, my professors wouldn't believe it because they said the information only comes from the gene and the organism is a passive product. They would say you're going to be a Lamarckian if you say that we can have RNA viruses. But since then this whole change in biology has happened. But medicine is still stuck on the idea of the alien mutated clone of different cells.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat contrasts the reductionist genetic view with earlier biological research on developmental fields and injury responses, highlighting how the molecular revolution and the DNA doctrine led medicine to ignore these broader systemic perspectives, even when evidence contradicted the gene-centric model.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but medicine didn't agree. Louis Pasteur had already done the damage. And by the time the DNA molecule became stylized. Medicine had just totally locked itself into that way of seeing things. And at that same time, interestingly, 1950, I think it was Reader's Digest where I saw the article about a man who was injecting cancer into hundreds of prisoners in Ohio and hundreds of his patients at the hospital. There was a cancer clinic in New York and he found that if he injected the cancer into a sick person, it wouldn't be thrown off immediately the way it was in a healthy person and if he injected it into a person who already had cancer, it would sometimes persist as long as they lived and so he said there's something in the body that either favors cancer or resists it and destroys it.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat draws a parallel between the Pasteur-BÃ©champ debate and the medical establishment's adherence to the germ theory, suggesting that this rigid adherence, coupled with the rise of DNA-centric views, prevented the acceptance of research showing the body's role in controlling cancer. He cites an early study demonstrating this principle.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, once one cell becomes mutated, the doctrine says that it produces a clone, all of the offspring are going to be essentially that cell, which is no longer you, and you have to destroy it or it will destroy you. When you actually look at cancers, they're very often polyclonal and full of even different numbers of chromosomes. The inflammation field, at its worst, is cancerous. Within the cancer, there are zones of bad and worse. As the cancer progresses, it gets more genetic deviations, and chromosomes are falling apart and so on because it's under such stress, but several people have analyzed the cancer more closely and have found that tissue can be perfectly normal and still functioning and contain. More than a thousand mutated genes and a typical cancer has hundreds if not thousands of mutated genes before it starts going bad. And 40 years ago people were demonstrating they had been storing bits of cancer tissue in deep freeze and when they would bring them out and thaw them. To grow in culture, sometimes they would use a solvent like the MSO or dimethylformamide or even some more biological things, butyrates and so on, and they found that what had been cancer when they put it in the deep freeze, if they brought it out and thawed it in the presence of one of these somewhat structuring solvents. It would revert to a normal tissue and not be cancer anymore. And around that time someone took parts of tumors from two different colors of hamsters, I think black and white or orange and black, so they could be distinguished. But they were just tumors and they isolated cells from each of the tumors. And mixed them with cells from a normal embryo and the developing embryo would normalize what had been tumor cells. And you would produce a perfectly normal hamster, black or red or whatever, showing that it had some of its inheritance from a tumor. Which is... given the right environment, was able to produce a perfectly normal hamster. So that's disproving the genetic abnormality theory that cancers are a defective gene, because if you can inject a cancer cell into a growing embryo, then... You'd think it would be cancerous.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat challenges the concept of cancer as a purely genetic defect by explaining that cancers are often polyclonal and that even cells with numerous mutations can revert to normal when placed in a supportive environment, citing experimental evidence.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and Harry Rubin and Anna Soto and Carlos Sonenschein, I think his name is, have been making that point that the organism really is, for most of the life of the cancer, the organism is in control and at some point the organism loses control and that's when it becomes a functioning cancer.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat references researchers who support the idea that the organism, rather than just the cancer cells, plays a crucial role in controlling cancer progression.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, getting away from that idea that it's a random mutation, the alternative is to realize that everything you're doing is either anti-carcinogenic or carcinogenic. For example, if you avoid sunlight or put on sunscreens because you are afraid of getting skin cancer, the avoidance of sun is very carcinogenic.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shifts to practical advice, emphasizing that lifestyle choices, including sun exposure, are critical in preventing cancer, directly contradicting the notion that avoiding sunlight is protective.

**RAY PEAT:** They just said in England, a report came out just the other month, I think in January, that the appearance of rickets... is becoming more and more prevalent because people are using Sun Factor 50 on their children in an attempt to protect them from skin cancers and actually they're getting rickets again now. So that was quite shocking news and so there I know in England now the wave takes a little time to travel from the West Coast here in America over to England but they're all making sure that Vitamin D and Calcium are being consumed and that people are encouraged to get out healthy doses of sun.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides a real-world example from England where excessive sunscreen use is leading to a resurgence of rickets, a vitamin D deficiency, underscoring the importance of sun exposure for health.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, sorry, a vitamin D deficiency where your knees are... Basically, it's a bone deformation and your bones don't form properly. Knock-kneed is kind of a common symptom of it, I think. Am I right in saying that it's a knock-kneed deformity, Dr. P? It can be. It can go bow-legged too. Right, both ways. Anyway, I thought that was quite interesting, so sorry to interrupt you. Boys are more likely to be bow-legged and girls knock-kneed because of the thyroid influence causing the joint to deform in different directions.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies the symptoms of rickets and adds a detail about how thyroid influence can affect the direction of bone deformation in boys versus girls.

**RAY PEAT:** For about 50 years now, people have been studying the effects of red light. And one of the, probably the basic effect of penetrating red light is to activate the respiratory enzyme. The mitochondrial oxidase enzyme is restored by red light. And that's it. Pretty well destroyed just by 12 to 15 hours of darkness in rabbit experiments. And so the reason mortality goes up at the end of winter is because nights are longer in the winter. And with using lasers or incandescent lights or sunlight, it doesn't matter what kind of light you get that penetrates you. Red light will go all the way through your body without a terribly great intensity. But sunlight is very good, even intermittent exposure over a period of 12 to 15 hours of good bright light will pretty well restore the energy-producing enzymes in the mitochondrion. And this enzyme is crucial. A thing that makes a difference in cancer. Farberg, 1929, demonstrated that cancer differs metabolically from healthy cells in being able to turn glucose into lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen because something has gone wrong with the mitochondrion in its use of oxygen. All that you have to do to create the metabolism is to knock out the cytochrome oxidase enzyme. And that happens to be a very fragile enzyme that Barberg was studying. And he didn't finish the explanation of how it works, but he He was the one that showed that cancer is a metabolic disease, not a genetic disease. And everything that is carcinogenic happens to weaken the function of that crucial enzyme so that the wrong kind of fat in the diet, the wrong balance of estrogen to progesterone... a deficiency of thyroid hormone or the wrong kind of radiation, ultraviolet or x-rays will destroy that as far as they can reach it. Ultraviolet only, that's in the skin, so the sunlight is still on balance because the red light restores the enzyme that ultraviolet is destroying. You don't. If you avoid sunburn, the sun is going to be a pure benefit.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the critical role of the mitochondrial oxidase enzyme in cellular respiration and how red light, found in sunlight and incandescent bulbs, can restore its function. He links the impairment of this enzyme to cancer, citing Otto Warburg's findings that cancer cells rely on lactic acid fermentation even in the presence of oxygen due to mitochondrial dysfunction. He also notes that various carcinogens, including dietary factors and hormonal imbalances, weaken this enzyme.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, ideally, from animal experiments... This enzyme tends to get damaged just by eight hours of darkness, so we shouldn't be in total darkness for longer than it takes to sleep. And then another question is, these low-energy light bulbs, those vary from incandescent bulbs. A little fluorescent things are going to cause an epidemic of cancer.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises against prolonged darkness, suggesting that even 8 hours can impair the crucial mitochondrial enzyme. He also warns against low-energy fluorescent bulbs, implying they are detrimental to health and potentially carcinogenic.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the incandescent bulbs have to be several hundred watts to really be protective. So I know you've recommended for people that have office jobs to have 250 to 300 watts of light from an incandescent bulb. Shining over their workstation, but how much of their skin would you recommend that they have exposed to that? 300 watts as much as possible, but for people with brain disease and motor neuron disease and such just shining it on their neck and head and back if possible that's the crucial thing, but getting the the whole body exposed is really the best thing because the Even though your feet, parts covered up with clothes, aren't going to be exposed, you're sending remedial signals through your nervous system that help to stabilize those enzymes and cells that aren't getting the direct light exposure, but ideally we should have light exposure all over.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends using high-wattage incandescent bulbs (250-300 watts) for office workers to ensure adequate light exposure, emphasizing that exposing as much skin as possible is beneficial, even for those with neurological conditions, as it sends systemic signals for cellular stabilization.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything that is stressful promotes inflammation. And even things like hives, some people get hives just from getting cold or from exercising. Or from not eating soon enough. Just dropping your blood sugar works the same as cutting off the oxygen supply. It keeps that crucial oxidative enzyme from getting the energy from the glucose and the carbon dioxide which should be produced from burning the carbohydrate in the absence. of sugar, oxygen or carbon dioxide that enzyme is going to fail and that causes the cell to produce lactic acid defensively, the lactic acid then triggers chain reactions, causes fat to break down and if you have eaten unsaturated fats that's going to produce the prostaglandins which cause chain reactions of more inflammation, more lactic acid production and one thing leads to another but basically it's keeping your energy up so that you can oxidize, respire to produce energy efficiently. So frequent meals, small frequent meals will help....to prevent that chain reaction of inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how stress, cold, exercise, and skipping meals can all promote inflammation by impairing the crucial oxidative enzyme. This leads to lactic acid production, fat breakdown, and prostaglandin release, creating a cascade of inflammation. He suggests frequent, small meals to maintain energy and prevent this cycle.

**RAY PEAT:** Red LEDs are demonstrated to reverse many of the changes of cancer that are being used to treat cancer experimentally.... But lasers, incandescent light and sunlight, as well as LEDs, activate that enzyme very efficiently. And most of the work has been done with the 630, I think it is, helium neon laser frequency or the LEDs in that range. But between 600 and 700 nanometers wavelength. The light is restorative to that.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that red LEDs, along with lasers, incandescent light, and sunlight, are effective in activating the crucial mitochondrial enzyme, with specific wavelengths between 600-700 nanometers being particularly restorative.

**RAY PEAT:** There is some benefit from some of the mostly around 700 to 800 nanometer wavelengths. Just the heat is beneficial. But the really specific restoration of that....enzyme happens in the far red, or from orange to red spectrum. So the far infrared is too... Too far.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that while far-infrared saunas may offer some benefit due to heat, the specific restorative effect on the mitochondrial enzyme occurs in the orange to red spectrum (600-700 nm), making far-infrared wavelengths less effective for this purpose.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, basically you're getting your vitamin D, but without the protective red and orange light, they're going to have a slight... immune suppressive effect. As your white blood cells run through your skin, they're subject to a slight sunburn themselves. So until you get so tanned that your white blood cells aren't exposed to ultraviolet, it's better to get your suntan in the real sunlight.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that tanning beds, while providing vitamin D, lack the protective red and orange light, potentially leading to a slight immune suppressive effect by exposing white blood cells to ultraviolet radiation. He advises getting a tan from natural sunlight for better protection.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the energised cell is really relaxed. If you imagine your muscles that are ready to work, they're soft and flexible and have... energy reserves so that you can do a lot of work with them, but if you work to fatigue, they swell up and start tending to cramp. That's because the presence of adequate energy relaxes nerves and muscles and other cells. And if you are deficient in the production of energy because you're mitochondrial....enzyme is impaired or because your thyroid is low and not activating that enzyme system. It doesn't take much stress to de-energize the cell and just like your muscle that you overwork, the cell that has had more stimulation than it can meet with its energy production, that cell is going to swell up like a tired muscle. And in that state, it's releasing lactic acid and histamine and prostaglandins. And in the case of an overworked muscle, it's usually just that your muscle is sore for a couple of days. But if you're chronically low energy, not getting enough light, exposed to things that are impairing the respiratory enzymes. Then you're going to be susceptible to, in various tissues, a breast or uterus or liver or kidney or brain that is experiencing hormonal or nervous or other stimulus. Mild chemical toxins, for example, will stimulate and excite cells. And if you're... near that threshold where your cell is barely producing enough energy to return to its relaxed state, it's going to shift over to glycolysis and produce lactic acid. And the lactic acid then sets off chain reactions that make the swelling worse.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that an energized cell is a relaxed cell. When energy production is deficient due to impaired mitochondrial enzymes or low thyroid, cells become overstimulated and swell, releasing lactic acid, histamine, and prostaglandins, similar to an overexerted muscle. This state makes cells susceptible to various stimuli and can lead to chronic issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and... The cell's overexcited, it's too excited? Yeah, and it can't relax. A cramp is the same thing. Right, so a truly energetic cell is a perfectly relaxed cell. Yeah, and a lot of people, if they tend to have seizures, they're more likely to have seizures at night and more likely to get cramps at night because in the darkness our respiratory......enzymes are gradually being impaired and so we're closer to the threshold where excitation can't be turned off by producing energy.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat reiterates that an energetic cell is a relaxed cell, and conversely, an overexcited cell that cannot relax is indicative of energy deficiency. He links this to phenomena like seizures and cramps, which are more likely to occur at night due to impaired respiratory enzymes from darkness.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, just the evidence, it's very seldom been... I looked at a professor at the University of California about 60 years ago, compared people who declined medical treatment and those who got the best available. And they lived longer if they declined the treatment. And there have been a few other little studies like that. There's a website, a man named... Gershom Zajacek, Z-A-J-I-C-E-K, who gives some of the evidence for how cutting out a tumor activates metastases that had been sitting harmlessly. And there's quite a lot of evidence for that. Even some doctors you can find... People on the internet, professors who are acknowledging that cutting out a tumor very often causes metastatic growths to spring up and there have been published studies on that showing that people get recurrences much sooner if they have surgery than if they don't.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat cites evidence suggesting that declining medical treatment can lead to longer survival than receiving the "best available" treatment. He also points to research and anecdotal evidence, including the work of Gershom Zajacek, indicating that surgical removal of tumors can paradoxically activate dormant metastases.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's pretty harmless. In fact, I think polyps, if you didn't... look for them, I think they would fall off by themselves. And so I think cutting them off, the body doesn't really notice that much has happened because they aren't deeply entrenched. They're ready to fall off all by themselves.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat offers his opinion on the removal of polyps during colonoscopies, suggesting it is generally harmless and that polyps might naturally detach without intervention.

**RAY PEAT:** Zajacek....talks about that on his website. Would you just... I think most people that are listening now would probably want to be scribbling down this name again, so I know it's pretty ethnic European or whatever, but would you spell the name out again? Yeah, the last name is Z-A-J-I-C-E-K. OK, Zajacek. Initial is G. G, OK, good, so people can go and check him out on the internet and Google search him.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat spells out the name of Gershom Zajacek for listeners who wish to research his work on the activation of metastases by tumor removal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I think the idea of the bystander effect that they've been seeing in in vitro studies with cancer cells for 50 years they believed that radiation caused cancer because it mutated the gene by radiation hitting DNA and breaking it but in the last 10 or 12 years they've noticed that if you irradiate cells in a dish and then take those cells out and put new cells in the dish, the new cells mutate. Right. Or if you mutate one cell with a beam of radiation, it sends out substances like serotonin and nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Just the same way the fish, the fish did the same thing. Yeah, yeah. That will mutate other cells and in your body that same thing happens. You don't have to mutate a cell by a gene by hitting it with radiation, you just have to stress it with these. substances that are emitted so that your whole body is experiencing bystander effects going in all directions. A study in Seattle found that a set of dental x-rays would cause a pregnant woman to have an underdeveloped baby, even if they shielded her abdomen with heavy lead. It was the bystander effect from what was happening to her face and brain from the dental x-rays poisoning everything else in her body.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the bystander effect in cancer, where irradiated cells can release substances that mutate neighboring cells. He uses a study on dental X-rays and pregnant women to illustrate how these systemic effects can occur even when the direct area is shielded.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it has some anti-inflammatory effects, which I think probably account for... the good it does, but there are some less toxic things that I think do more good.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat comments on Taxol, suggesting its benefits might stem from anti-inflammatory properties, but implies that less toxic alternatives could be more beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know it specifically, but I'm sure it has some of those same anti-inflammatory effects. Yeah, it also has some, it has a lot of liver herbs in it, so that helps your liver clear, you know, excess hormones, like you mentioned, if you have an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone, I'm imagining that due to the improved liver function, you'd be clearing more waste from the system and excess hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the Essiac formula, acknowledging its potential anti-inflammatory effects and the presence of liver-supporting herbs, which could aid in clearing excess hormones and waste products.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I mentioned that the, um, the crucial respiratory enzyme is, is protected by progesterone and inactivated by estrogen, uh, but the, the yeast. One of the oldest bystander effects known, at least 50 years ago, they discovered that, uh, if you irradiate any part of an animal, it'll go into heat as if it had been given a shot of estrogen. It can be its foot or its head or any part, but the bystander substances spread out and, uh, any inflammation....activates the aromatase enzyme, which makes estrogen. So, um, in studies of monkeys trying to measure the output of estrogen from its ovaries, they found that its arms were producing at least as much estrogen as the ovaries. Wow. That's amazing. So, a person isn't protected against estrogen just because they have menopause or have had ovaries removed. Every part of your body that's irritated or stressed or depleted of energy is going to become an estrogen factory. And that's in men and women.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that estrogen inactivates the crucial respiratory enzyme, while progesterone protects it. He highlights that inflammation anywhere in the body can activate the aromatase enzyme, leading to estrogen production in various tissues, not just the ovaries, and that this occurs in both men and women, regardless of menopausal status.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, there are... Great for business, because now they're saying that maybe breast cancer starts in utero. But first they were saying, if you cut off the breasts when a woman is 20, she can't get breast cancer. True. But now they're saying that maybe that's even too late for some cases, because it might have really started in infancy or before. The idea of metastatic little aliens is a tremendous business because you can never prove they aren't there. If you injure a person enough, you're going to find some even if they weren't there. There's a study done that showed... Like over 90% of people that were over the age of 50, correct me if I'm wrong here. 100%. 100% of people over the age of 50 that died in accidents or had autopsies done, they all had some form of abdominal cancer? Yeah, that was what Harry Rubin was told by a pathologist friend of his. But since then there have been a couple of similar studies that even looking at people over 35, they find... a very high percentage of them. If you look at this two or three organs, breast, uterus, prostate, very likely to find cancer in a high percentage. But by the age of 50, everyone couldn't have it diagnosed. So, I think that means be careful about getting a diagnosis.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat critiques the concept of metastatic cancer as a "business" model, suggesting it's used to perpetuate treatments. He cites studies indicating a high prevalence of microscopic cancers in older individuals, implying that a diagnosis should be approached with caution.

**RAY PEAT:** Dentists, a couple of times, when I was about 30 or so... told me, with a very grave expression, that I had a precancerous leukoplakia and I should have it biopsied. But since I had already experienced that lumpy development inside my cheeks, whenever I was deficient in vitamin A, instead of going to a cancer specialist and having a biopsy, I took vitamin A. And each time a dentist told me that, I cured it in a week. And then since I knew that leukoplakia of the cervix is biologically almost indistinguishable from leukoplakia inside the cheek, I told women who had the... Abnormal pap smears. Yeah, and biopsies showing so-called carcinoma in C2. I told them about that and they tried applying vitamin A topically and such. And I kept track of three dozen women who had that experience. All of them told their doctors when they went back two or three months later with no evidence of abnormality, the doctor lost out, a good hysterectomy with the doctors. In every case, didn't want to know what they had done.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares a personal experience of successfully treating precancerous leukoplakia with vitamin A, and how he advised women with similar cervical conditions to do the same, often resulting in doctors dismissing the positive outcomes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you're deficient in either thyroid. hormone or vitamin B12, you don't convert it. From beta-carotene into? Into vitamin A.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that deficiencies in thyroid hormone or vitamin B12 impair the conversion of beta-carotene into vitamin A.
