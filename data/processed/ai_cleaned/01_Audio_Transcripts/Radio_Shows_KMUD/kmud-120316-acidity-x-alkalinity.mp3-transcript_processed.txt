**RAY PEAT:** "These sort of traditional ideas about the acid-base balance of food they usually lead to a pretty good diet for example the Indian diet fruit vegetables and milk and cheese That's a good example of the Alkaline residue diet and So I don't have any disagreements with the dietary recommendations to eat lots of milk and cheese and fruit and vegetables, but it's the small details that people use to argue For certain refinements of that diet for example the the fear of milk Milk they they talk about the yeah The loss of calcium in the urine is indicating that maybe it's too much acid, but actually the residue of milk is on the alkaline side because of the very large amount of potassium and calcium in the milk, very similar to the vegetables that the cows eat to make the milk. They accumulate a huge amount of alkaline."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about traditional ideas regarding the acid-base balance of food and the alkaline residue diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and grains, nuts, beans and meats do have a very acidic residue or ash after they're metabolised. And the biggest part of that in meat, nuts and grains is phosphate. Proteins have a lot of sulphur, turns into sulphuric acid when it's metabolised. And those, it is possible to do biological harm by eating too much of those and not enough of the potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium. Which are predominantly found in fruits and vegetables. Yeah, fruits, vegetables, milk and cheese."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on what constitutes an acidic residue after food metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it helps to look at the picture in the very biggest context, which is that mostly we're a huge lump of protein, and protein is on average acidic, and if you just leave... acid sitting around in the environment, it will accumulate the base that neutralizes it. And so if we think of ourselves as a big piece of acidic protein, this just spontaneously will associate alkaline material with it. Potassium, magnesium, for example, will neutralize the acidity of the... protein, but as we energize our system by burning carbohydrates and fat mostly, the carbohydrate in particular turns into carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide has to constantly be leaving the organism. What comes in is oxygen, the oxygen combines with the fuel. Carbon and becomes carbon dioxide. So you have a neutral oxygen coming in. It's called oxygen, meaning the acid former. The acid that it forms in this case is carbonic acid. And we're constantly metabolically producing this acid which is streaming out of our cells. And how? Leaving through our lungs primarily, the kidneys hardly lose any carbon dioxide or bicarbonate. It almost all leaves through the lungs. And as the carbon dioxide is produced, combining with water, it turns into carbonic acid which ionizes. And so you have the acidic carbonic acid leaving the cell. As a charged particle, it takes the oppositely charged sodium, with it primarily sodium and calcium, are constantly being drawn out of the cell by this stream of carbonic acid being produced inside the cell. And so the alkaline minerals reach the bloodstream. in balance with the carbon, carbonic acid. And then the carbonic acid leaves the lungs as carbon dioxide, leaving an alkaline trace in the blood. The cell basically was neutral until it produced the acid. And then that neutralized protein gave up some of its... mineral alkaline material, which then shows up in the blood, so the pH of the blood is above neutral, about pH 7.4. Because of the carbonic acid? Yeah. And in this healthy metabolism, well, the carbonic acid which is left in your lungs, the mineral gets pulled out of the neutral cell, originally neutral, but as it's pulled out with the... the acid being constantly formed, the cell shows its basic protein acidity and so the respiring cell is normally slightly on the acidic side. A good healthy cell with plenty of oxygen will be around pH 6, 6.8. And if you stress a cell so it isn't getting enough... carbon dioxide, or stress it in any way, radiation, not enough oxygen, not enough of any of the things that it needs, the cell becomes activated and shifts to the alkaline because it can't make carbon dioxide to acidify itself, and it begins producing lactic acid very inefficiently. And the thing about lactic acid is that the sugar, instead of being oxidized all the way to carbon dioxide, comes to the point of pyruvic acid, and instead of that being oxidized, the cell reduces the pyruvic acid to lactic acid by taking some of the energy....substance that was produced in this metabolism, wasting it to get rid of the electron so that this NADH, NAD can go back and become reduced again and produce more of the conversion of pyruvic to lactic acid. And in that process, the lactic acid is taking protons out of the cell. And is raising the pH of the cell as the conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid increases the pH of the cell. Just the opposite of what the production of carbon dioxide was doing. So the stressed cell becomes alkaline."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an explanation of how the body maintains pH balance, including respiratory and waste product processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, it shifts internally to become alkaline when it's stressed, but the produced lactic acid accumulates in its environment, and that's where the acid is, in the surroundings, and then it shows up in the blood."
**CONTEXT:** The host questions the popular theory that cancer cells prefer an acidic environment, given the previous explanation of stressed cells becoming alkaline.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it not only acidifies the environment which in itself could be actually protective if it was acidified by carbon dioxide, but it happens that the lactic acid acts as a signal to do... all of the things associated with cancer, such as stimulating the growth of new blood vessels, so that the inflammation continues. It signals a lot of inflammatory changes, vasodilation and the formation of new blood vessels and the release of... Carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, lots of things producing free radicals and injury. So the lactic acid is functioning as a local poison or inflammatory agent. The acidity that it produces is a sign that something is wrong, but it isn't the acidity in the tumor that's harmful, because the tumor itself is internally alkaline."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if lactic acid plays a significant role in cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, even when we make it ourselves, it has these pro-inflammatory, swelling-producing, tumor-promoting functions. And when it's made by bacteria, it's somewhat more toxic. When the body receives it, either from a stressed muscle or a tumor, or from too much yogurt or some food that has been fermented, it goes to the liver to get detoxified. So every time you eat something with lactic acid, it's the same as if you had been stressed physically. Your liver has to work extra to detoxify it. And it has to have a source of energy to detoxify the lactic acid, turning it back into glucose. And glucose is right back where you started, so you've lost ground every time your liver has to process lactic acid."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's opinion on foods high in lactic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the... Nervous system is in control of metabolism to a great extent, so you don't have to run five miles to shift over into that stress metabolism if you're... Nervous system and emotional systems are very stressed. Just the thought of what you're doing... I mentioned it before that if you hang an animal by its tail or put it in a tube where it can't move, it will very quickly get an ulcer with lactic acid. Going to all of its systems, releasing histamine and other serotonin mediators of inflammation. But if you give something for the animal to bite, even though it's in the same restrained stressful situation, as long as it can defend itself by biting back, it doesn't get the ulcer."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how lifestyle stress can negatively impact health through an acidic situation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, it is actually the things like lactic acid and serotonin and the stress really is doing its damage by creating an intracellular alkaline condition. It's the alkalinity. For example, when someone is under surgery, they often get alters just from being operated on somewhere else. And if they are respirating them, that stress will very often give them lung inflammation and brain inflammation and so on. And they've found, gradually, 60 or 70 years after... The people who originally discovered it, they've found that if they don't ventilate them very thoroughly and let them accumulate quite a bit of carbon dioxide, their lungs and brain are protected and don't swell. So the acidity from carbon dioxide is extremely anti-stress and protective. It's the alkalinity that goes with producing lactic acid. Which does the harm."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if stress-induced acidity could explain why people who hold in anger are more prone to cancer, referencing the rat experiment.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's really the serotonin and other inflammatory things in the stomach rather than just the acid. The stomach is very good at holding extreme acidity safely, but when stress gives the wrong kind of signals and you don't have continuing respiration. Then you get the damage. So it's the presence of that acid under in a stressed cell that's then triggering the inflammatory mediators. You can't actually just measure because everyone's stomach is acidic. It's the most acidic environment ever. But I mean, they say when you have stomach ulcers, oh, you shouldn't have this acidic food. But it's not really down to the acid. Then you're saying it's more down just to the other inflammatory mediators."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if stomach ulcers in stressed individuals are due to acid or other inflammatory mediators.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I think it's very safe to consume a great excess of the alkaline material, which the fruit and vegetable and milk people do. And the body can produce, can change protein, for example, into ammonium. If it doesn't have enough mineral, it will waste protein, turning it into the equivalent of the alkaline material and using the ammonia as the cation equivalent of the sodium, so it can save the sodium and calcium and so on."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the realism of consuming alkalizing materials and their effect on overall acid-base balance, considering the stomach's acidity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I think they have... The main function is sparing protein that you would use for the kidneys to help to regulate the minerals. And, for example, when a person is fasting for several days, they will generally lose more protein than fat because the stress hormones rise and... They live on a pure meat diet when they're fasting as their tissues break down and if you during that fast, if you just drink the minerals, salt water, baking soda, potassium, magnesium and calcium, any of the alkaline minerals will radically spare the the amount of protein that you would be. consuming and wasting. So a fast is much less stressful and harmful if you're getting the alkaline minerals."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if consuming foods with excess potassium, magnesium, and calcium can actively raise the pH of one's environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes. Stress, that's really a primary thing that stress does, shifting to the alkaline and making lactic acid. The cells are in danger of getting into a chronically activated state. The panic attack is a typical thing where the body too easily shifts over. into making lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide and so the person feels that they're suffocating but in the long run that same thing can lead to degenerative diseases or cancer in which the cells are stuck in a panic attack condition and if you think of the original state of the cell as being the protein acid. Attracts the minerals to neutralize the acid, you can restore that condition with carbon dioxide just re-breathing it, getting your percentage of the acidic carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood up where it should be, you can stop the production of lactic acid, reverse these stress processes. And restore the cell to its relaxed, unpanicked condition."
**CONTEXT:** A caller asks if the carbon dioxide circulation/exchange discussed is why re-breathing carbon dioxide is calming during stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and for example, you can generally lower your blood pressure just breathing a minute or two in a paper bag a few times a day. I've seen people take their blood pressure down 30 points in just a day or two that way."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to achieve the calming effect of re-breathing carbon dioxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, every cell or tissue that you look at, it's protected if you restore the proper amount of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide in the gaseous form, it's easier if you think about the pH as the base balance of the organism, if you think of it as being pushed by a few factors, one of which is the amount of dissolved or gaseous carbon dioxide, so that breathing in a bag is one of the most powerful ways to... restore the proper balance. If you need more bicarbonate, the gaseous carbon dioxide will allow you to make more bicarbonate. And that will help you regulate your minerals and even help you retain more of your alkaline minerals. So it will help correct your balance either in the acid or base direction. Taking sodium bicarbonate, for example, will actually acidify cells that are in need of more carbon dioxide. Because when the bicarbonate has been deficient, when a cell is exposed to the bicarbonate, it will convert it into the acidic carbon dioxide and be able to lower its pH even more. So you've taken the alkaline baking soda."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if breathing into a paper bag is a de-stressor for cellular states.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. There have been experiments, for example, in marathon or bicycle races in Death Valley where the altitude is very low. They found that...I think it was a tablespoon of......baking soda at the start of the race......made them tolerate the stress much better."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if baking soda is recommended for athletes to help balance high lactic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the carbon monoxide is something that we produce under stress, and it lowers our ability to use oxygen and to produce carbon dioxide."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if smoking increases carbon dioxide in the body to promote relaxation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, well... Much of that is propaganda. When you look at the actual details of the population, it isn't as great as some of the articles have been saying. For example, one of the articles, if you look at the mortality figures, suggests that the average lifespan is 300 years. If you don't look at the whole structure of the population, it's hard to get an idea of what the real age-specific death rate is. You have to look at how likely a person is to die when they're 60 or 70 or 80 or 90 years old, rather than looking at the mortality per population. And that's the trouble with the... The United States, since the turn of the century, they stopped publishing the actual raw figures. They give an age-adjusted mortality rate. So I don't think anyone outside of the Bureau of Statistics really is sure what the longevity of Americans is doing right now."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the longevity of Japanese culture, considering their high smoking rates.

**RAY PEAT:** "It does, but it raises the carbon monoxide so seriously that that's the main effect and it's harmful."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if smoking raises carbon dioxide in any beneficial way.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, yeah. The average person is very good at getting rid of the sodium, and so the sodium bicarbonate is something that most people can use without experiencing edema or disturbance of blood pressure. Right. But the potassium bicarbonate, it has a relaxing effect on your blood vessels. So it can help to lower your blood pressure even more than the sodium bicarbonate, but you have to be cautious because too much of it can relax your heart."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if potassium bicarbonate can be used similarly to sodium bicarbonate.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the only foods I would suggest eliminating would be the grains and beans and most of the nuts. And home. Probably reducing most meats. Gelatin happens to be the part of the meat that doesn't have so many of the disturbing acidic pro-inflammatory effects. In the news currently is the pink slime tissue which is made from connective tissues. It seems to me that that might be the best part of the meat."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked for suggestions for an ideal lifestyle regarding acid and alkalinity and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's good. Salt, magnesium sulfate, epsom salts, and baking soda are all good. The baking soda helps you absorb magnesium if you have epsom salts. So that's a good combo, like maybe one pound baking soda and one pound epsom salts?"
**CONTEXT:** A caller asks if taking baking soda bouts, about two pounds per day, is safe for muscle soreness and lactic acid production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and some experimenters in naturally carbonated mineral springs found that people were absorbing carbon dioxide through their skin. Even though the body contains a lot of carbon dioxide, the body has such an affinity. for it that it will soak it up from the mineral water against the gradient. It's as if we had pumps in our skin. Because it's going from a high concentration, I mean a low concentration, to a high concentration. Yeah. It's a matter of solubility. The enzymes turn from the bicarbonate into the gaseous carbon dioxide form which dissolves in our fat. Hats and cells."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about absorbing carbon dioxide through the skin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, all of our foods except the grains and beans basically. are very good sources of vitamin C. The analytic methods have generally ignored it in meat and some of the solid foods like that, but it's present in meats at a very high concentration in the oxidized state. All you have to do is metabolize and you turn the oxidized ascorbic acid into the... common ascorbic acid."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the processing of vitamin C and its presence in foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and most of the tests don't really look at the molecule, they just look at the reducing power. And in... in some vegetables... and... and meats, for example, the... the tissue has oxidized it partly into dehydroascorbic acid, but as soon as you eat it, it turns back into ordinary ascorbic acid."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if concentrated orange juice still has absorbable vitamin C, even if it's in a slightly changed form.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and fish. And fish, right? And the fish."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about fish and chips preventing scurvy, referencing potatoes having vitamin C.

**RAY PEAT:** "The alkaline ash diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, milk and cheese, all of those are things that will help to let the stressed cancer cell repair itself as far as it can. And things like breathing in a paper bag. Increased carbon dioxide are probably helpful. As long ago as 1910, the insurance companies knew that people who lived at very high altitudes had a very low cancer mortality. And that has been tested experimentally 50 years ago, taking, implanting tumors in rats and leaving them near sea level. All of them quickly died, taking them up to 17,000 feet altitude. Half of them threw off the cancers and had no symptoms left, just from the carbon dioxide retention when the oxygen retention was lowered. The carbon dioxide, one of its basic functions is to assure the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. So, heavy breathing, hyperventilating is a way to lower the oxygen in your tissues because you blow out the carbon dioxide and you need a lot of carbon dioxide in your tissue to deliver the oxygen, open up the blood vessels and let the oxygen circulate and be used."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked for the best way to maintain energy in the body to deal with cancer, considering acidic states.

**RAY PEAT:** "I read it and... I was very impressed by his detailed studies. He seemed to have read just about everything about cancer in the first half of the 20th century. And so I tried to figure out how it was working. And the minerals are a very important part of it. Restoring the oxidative metabolism... he regularly gave his people armor thyroid. I think two grains was a very common dose for his patients."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on the Gerson therapy diet for cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "The armor product was standardized as to imitate the fresh glandular weight and so they would powder, de-fat the gland and powder it and then dilute it with glucose or lactic acid or something to increase the weight and volume until it was similar to the fresh piece of gland. before dehydration and so they called that the normal dilution and the powder itself was called the 3X concentrate meaning that the gland is three times more concentrated than the old armor thyroid pills and that means that one gram of the gland is equal to 15 grains. of armor thyroid so one gram of the fresh gland is equal to 15 grains of the armor thyroid yeah"
**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the dosage of mammalian thyroid needed if Armor thyroid is unavailable, referencing Dr. Peat's mention of Armor thyroid in Gerson therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the caffeine is um tends to enhance performance in mysterious ways that no one has really figured out how it works but uh the the gelatin has an anti-stress effect uh that that mixture seems like it would be pretty good baking soda gelatin content and you would need quite a bit of sugar with it preferably fructose"
**CONTEXT:** A caller asks what a "double latte espresso pink slime milkshake with baking soda a tablespoon on the side" would do for an athlete's performance in a Death Valley race.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, they feed on amino acids and turn the amino acids into sugar and then turn some of the of the sugar back into fat and then they metabolize the fat and with all that silly chemistry they produce a lot of heat with no no light or no no function to speak of that's why you can identify a cancer because it's so hot because it's it's burning protein turning it into amino acids and into sugars and into fat so that why thermography is quite a accurate way at looking for cancers in the body yeah and so if you can feed it as much sugar as at once then it won't eat your protein at least not so fast right"
**CONTEXT:** The host brings up the idea that cancers feed on sugar and asks for clarification.

**RAY PEAT:** "Okay, so it could prevent the wasting disease associated with cancer then and saturated fats aren't probably as good as as sugar for quieting stress tissues but they do have specific anti-stress functions so I would recommend avoiding all of the polyunsaturated fats because those turn on the stress reactions, increase your adrenal corticoids, adrenaline, pituitary hormones and so on and while the saturated fats inhibit those same stress systems."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if feeding cancer cells sugar can prevent wasting disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, um that was um a way to get all of the essential nutrients right okay and uh around the time I read his book I had been I met Leonel Strong who developed the cancer prone strains of mice who developed spontaneous breast cancer and he had been curing cancer just with an extract of liver and that was my first research project was using to try to find out what it was in the liver that in these liver extracts could cure cancer."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the injected liver extracts mentioned in the Gerson diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "He also wanted to eliminate salt from a diet too and that's a little bit of a strange one for me to get my head around just because I know you're again an advocate of salt as actually a very good product rather than what modern dietary trends would have us think otherwise."
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions Gerson's desire to eliminate salt from the diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "In working on the parathyroid hormone before he did his famous cancer preparations, he found that the alkaline minerals, to a tremendous extent, would substitute for each other. So you could, for example, cure, you could take out the parathyroid glands, which cause a calcium. But you could cure that with sodium or potassium or magnesium. So the salt could replace the calcium or the potassium or the magnesium. Yeah, to a great extent, any of those alkaline minerals can replace the others. So you don't have to worry about the balance so much, because having an excess, your body can sort them out."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Frederick Koch's findings regarding alkaline minerals and their ability to substitute for each other.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's what the racers, bicycle racers, were doing. In Death Valley?"
**CONTEXT:** A caller asks if eating a lot of baking soda can stimulate being at high altitude.

**RAY PEAT:** "Potatoes are the best vegetable protein known. They're better than eggs in terms of quality. What's the best protein? Potatoes. Potatoes are actually, they have... 106% of the protein quality right next to egg yolk. Right, so eight ounces, I think eight ounces of potato has eight grams of protein. Oh wow, I had no idea, I thought it was a carb. When you're eating the starch too, a liter of potato is like a liter of milk on average. Yeah, if you make potato juice and don't drink the starch that settles out. If you make the juice, then it's more like eating pure egg yolk. And you can even make a scrambled egg like preparation from potato juice, and it's quite tasty. Wow, and this would be healthy for the general public or for only people with cancer?"
**CONTEXT:** A vegan caller asks for different sources of protein, and Dr. Peat discusses potatoes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think there's someone who is now testing the raw stuff and he's going to tell me whether it made him sick. My experience is with cooking it's like scrambling an egg. Yeah, let the starch settle out before you cook it."
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if raw potato juice is recommended or if it should be cooked.
