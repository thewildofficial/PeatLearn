**RAY PEAT:** I got a PhD in biology at the University of Oregon in 1972, but I had been reading in biology since the late 1940s and avoided academic study because I saw that strange things were happening that didn't seem at all scientific to me. Even as a kid, it was very clear that political doctrines were influencing biological theories.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, would you just briefly outline your academic career?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea that genes create a disease if you can't find a drug that will neutralize that gene's product, then you have something to blame it on and explain why the doctors are powerless. It's incurable if it's genetic unless the drug companies can come up with something to alleviate the symptoms. But the actual evidence of how genes relate to health, it's really just a complete fantasy. The idea of a gene by the 1930s to 1960s, it was recognized as a metaphysical construct, even less based on evidence than the idea of a field, even though they didn't know exactly what the elements of the field were, they could demonstrate it. But the gene idea was simply an abstraction, until they applied the abstraction to the idea that there were certain stretches of DNA that they began calling a gene. But even that, the definition of a gene, has been changing even since the recognition of DNA as a component of inheritance.

**CONTEXT:** You think that a lot of the change or a lot of the stagnation was brought around by vested interests in medicine and guiding the dogma of genetics to produce a kind of controllable scenario where drugs can be introduced, targeted at specific proteins, for example?

**RAY PEAT:** Conrad Lorenz, who won the Nobel Prize, was a hero of practically all of the professors that I knew, even in the 70s. And he was a Nazi who designed his idea that genes control behavior specifically for Hitler's Institute of Racial Hygiene as an excuse for killing people who didn't have the behavioral traits that they thought were appropriate so that it justified political and religious killings, where the American view of eugenics had been mostly to sterilize. Sometimes they would euthanize babies, but mostly it was used to sterilize people they considered defective. That political idea of genetics derived right from the end of the 19th century. Wendell and August Weissman. They were consciously trying to destroy the Darwinian or Lamarckian ideas that the environment might be able to improve the intelligence of poor people. They wanted to have an absolute determinism that people of lower intelligence were simply, permanently, their children would inherit their traits and so on. So, at the worst, they could be killed or sterilized. But it was used to justify everything in society, not just particular sickness. For example, it was applied to the idea of toxemia of pregnancy. For example, it was used to justify everything in society, not just particular sickness. And the fetus was said to have a genetic defect which was poisoning the mother. But of course, the fetus had inherited it from the parents. And so it was denying that better diet could control or prevent pregnancy complications because all of that was genetically determined. The Scopes trial in which William Jennings Bryant argued against evolution, he was basically against eugenics, which was justified by the theory of a mechanical kind of evolution.

**CONTEXT:** So was that part of the motivation, or do you think that was a subconscious... a very conscious ideology?

**RAY PEAT:** There are several diseases or conditions that are distinctly controlled by particular genes. The type of dwarfism in which the bones don't develop, there is a definite gene mutation involved, but that doesn't say that the environment hasn't created that mutation in a particular controllable way. One way of looking at genetic uniqueness is that every organism requires a certain environment. A frog can't live in the same place an eagle can live. Every organism needs exactly the right kind of environment. And certain genes make you need more things from the environment. But even the genes that limit you, they can create a stress reaction, and the stress reaction can lead to changes in the genes. And this, the evidence has been accumulating now in American universities, Australian, among very well-known researchers. And this is, they've demonstrated that stress can produce directional changes in microorganisms using mechanisms similar to what Barbara McClintock recognized in the corn mobile genetic elements that move around under stress and accelerate the ability to adapt. So our environment is constantly having an effect upon our DNA and our DNA and our cells are constantly sensing a change in environment.

**CONTEXT:** If we're told by medical people and scientists per se that genetics are all pervasive as a cause, what's your take on how much genetics affect the organism?

**RAY PEAT:** James Shapiro, who was one of the people that discovered that bacteria can adapt to resist penicillin or antibiotics and that they can pass on that acquired resistance to their descendants or to other bacteria that they interact with so it can be transmitted both genetically and horizontally as an acquired trait. And Shapiro calls this natural genetic engineering in which the organism is adjusting its own inheritance to improve its survival.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, James Shapiro, who was one of the people that discovered that bacteria can adapt to resist penicillin or antibiotics and that they can pass on that acquired resistance to their descendants or to other bacteria that they interact with so it can be transmitted both genetically and horizontally as an acquired trait. And Shapiro calls this natural genetic engineering in which the organism is adjusting its own inheritance to improve its survival.

**RAY PEAT:** Huntington's disease typically becomes apparent as a problem when the person is maybe 40 years old. They were perfectly healthy or even some people have said that they were healthier than average up until the disease set in at the age of 35 or 40 or 45. And when you look at the specific gene that they're talking about, in the case of Huntington's chorea, it's a protein that gets an extra inserted stretch of glutamine residues. And this can change generation after generation so that the victim's offspring can develop years earlier than the parent and it can change quickly from generation to generation, indicating that something is actively contributing to the mutation. But the folding doesn't become a problem. You can have the gene for 40 years with no health problem at all. And what's known to activate the folding problem that creates the symptoms, these are environmental things that have been accumulating over the decades of ordinary living. And these features are now coming to be identified. For example, the unsaturated fatty acids. Cause misfolding of the prions in CJD and mad cow disease, radiation and the polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to accelerate the misfolding of the protein making it act like an infectious thing that spreads from one cell to the next and Parkinson's disease. And Alzheimer's, similar folding of proteins cause the symptoms and the factors that cause that misfolding are now being identified as environmental dietary factors.

**CONTEXT:** So, I guess let's go on to some diseases perhaps that are considered genetic by today's scientific thinking, which are probably more environmental. I know that things like the prion diseases and Huntington's chorea.

**RAY PEAT:** That's been done with prions in all the prion related diseases and in Parkinson's disease the protein is called alpha-synuclein and the DHA long chain highly unsaturated fatty acid is known to induce the misfolding and saturated fatty acids can block the misfolding. So the evidence is now looking like it's related to an aging process since with the aging the brain accumulates more and more DHA especially under the influence of estrogen. Women accumulate more DHA, circulate more of it in the blood and very typically, with the degenerative inflammatory diseases, women are more susceptible than men to several of the diseases. And DHA is one of the omega oils that they tout as being so anti-inflammatory and so good for women, DHA and EPA.

**CONTEXT:** And weren't you saying that even in a test tube when they add omega-6 oils to these proteins it encourages or it stimulates the misfolding and the misshapen?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it does several things. It breaks down and forms, for example, a corollian, which is a very reactive fragment that attaches to, for example, the TAR protein that is involved in the filament formation in Alzheimer's disease. And DHA activates the excitotoxic process, it increases the glutamate excitatory system, increasing the free glutamic acid in the brain fluid. And in all of these brain degenerative diseases, you can see increased breakdown products of basically the fish oil type of polyunsaturated fats in the cerebrospinal fluid and in many cases in the other body fluids, serum and such. So everything from the short acrolein up to the larger prostaglandin-like breakdown products of the polyunsaturateds that are called isoprostanes and neuroprostanes, and these show up increasingly with age and with dementia.

**CONTEXT:** And DHA activates... The excitotoxic process, it increases the glutamate excitatory system, increasing the free glutamic acid in the brain fluid.

So everything from the short acrolein up to the larger prostaglandin-like breakdown products of the polyunsaturateds that are called isoprostanes and neuroprostanes, and these show up increasingly with age and with dementia.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because their fats have been synthesized by their own bodies, made mostly from glucose absorbed from the mother. And the animal body can produce saturated fats and monounsaturated, like oleic acid. And our own series that are called the omega minus nine series of unsaturated fats. And at birth, these are the dominant fats in the baby's brain. And animal studies going back 30 or 40 years showed that if you feed pregnant animals a large amount of polyunsaturated fats, their babies are born with smaller brains and don't learn as well. And a group in France two or three years ago, basing their thinking on the addition of these fish oil type fats to baby formulas, they were looking at that argument that the brain is made of these and so they should help brain development. So they fed some pregnant women. A high polyunsaturated fat diet, hoping that they could demonstrate increased learning of the fetus by presenting sounds to the developing fetus and watching the learning reaction. And they found that their learning was retarded in the presence of the omega minus three fatty diet to the mother. In line with what the animal studies had shown.

**CONTEXT:** As a newborn infant, their brains have very little DHA and EPA?

**RAY PEAT:** They said, your brain is full of fish oil, so it must be good for the brain. But looking at a baby's brain, it's very low in babies. Well, maybe they were looking at Alzheimer brains. Yeah, exactly. The more demanded, not only Alzheimer's, but the other brain degenerative diseases, and old brains in general, have more than young brains.

**CONTEXT:** So did they think that these oils were useful for the brain, for the baby's brain, because they did autopsies on adults and found that the brains had a lot of these oils in them? Is that what they based it on?

**RAY PEAT:** The evidence from animal studies is really clear that the infant uterine environment, the twins have a very similar environment. They get basically the same nutrition. And so if the mother's health changes from pregnancy to pregnancy, the intelligence of the baby is going to be influenced according to what she was eating at the time. And animal studies show that this effect can be passed on for four generations at least. Studies of people who were starved during pregnancy in Holland and Russia, not only were their babies impaired mentally, but even their grandchildren showed impairment as a result of the conditions affecting the brain, the hormones, the whole physiology. So it's inherited, but it's purely a physiological, environmental thing that, if they had a super supportive environment, that could have been corrected and wouldn't be passed on from generation to generation.

**CONTEXT:** And the argument I've been making for a long time. And there was a genetically oriented argument for the idea that working class people would never rise to the middle class because of genetic influence on their intelligence. And I pointed out the evidence of the intrauterine environment and nutrition. And the article that I was criticizing, I think it was 11 pages. And the conclusions didn't even relate to the evidence they had presented, but the editors instead of just rejecting my two sentence rebuttal, sent it to reviewers to get their support for rejecting it. And the only evidence they cited happened to come from Hitler's Institute for Racial Hygiene.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, 30 or 40 years ago doctors were talking about the thrifty gene that caused some families to get fat on very little food. But that undoubtedly another example of the same kind of inheritance by gestational influence. If you're starving, the fetus adjusts to a very poor diet and becomes thrifty. They've never identified a thrifty gene or a gene for diabetes but people go on talking about a gene for obesity and fruit. For diabetes, when the country of Israel was formed, lots of immigrants came in from other parts of Africa as well as from Europe. The Europeans had a very high typically European rate of diabetes, but the immigrants from poor countries had almost no diabetes when they immigrated, so the first generation. Only the Europeans were diabetic, but after a second generation of living on a relatively abundant European style of eating, the immigrants' children were developing diabetes at the same rate as the European immigrants, totally destroying the idea of genetic diabetes.

**CONTEXT:** I guess my question to Dr. P would be that I had an argument with one of my professors in the university a couple semesters back and he basically said that there was a lot of evidence for the genetics and one of the things he tried to... There was a lot of studies, I guess, from twins that were separated at birth and I guess they reconciled 40, 50 years later and they did different measurements and stuff. And I was wondering how much of that would actually be genetic and how much of that could it be the shared intrauterine environment during the nine months of gestation?

**RAY PEAT:** For a long time I've been interested in the mechanism of sodium transport and I've suspected that hypothyroidism is sometimes misunderstood and a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is made. When I worked in the woods the first summer we had a cook who was fanatic for believing that if you worked hard and sweated a lot you needed salt. I had salt. So he would put, I think it was something like a tablespoon of salt in everyone's breakfast. And if you didn't eat your porridge that was horribly salty, you didn't get the rest of your breakfast. And within a few days I was tending to faint if I didn't take salt pills halfway through the day. And my skin was so salty. That I got crystals of salt on my forehead, eyebrows, glasses. It was actually just crystallizing pure sodium chloride. And I for sure would have been considered to have cystic fibrosis from the chloride coming out of my skin. But it was simply an adaptation to my particular kind of thyroid metabolism and an extremely high salt intake.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned before on the show about hypothyroidism and the downward spiral, I guess, that it can lead to high estrogen and then high stress hormones, low thyroid, low progesterone. And you mentioned supplemental desiccated thyroid to get out of that cycle. And I guess I'm just wondering, is that something that can work in the short term, like a few months, and you would get yourself out of that cycle, or is that something you would have to continue for the rest of your life, if it would replace your natural thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** I've seen a few people who needed it just for a few days and it broke a stress cycle. And there have been published cases like that. But if your body is loaded with polyunsaturated fats, every time you get hungry, these come into your bloodstream and interfere with the thyroid function. So the average person who is hypothyroid, maybe at the age of 20 or 30, their body is so well saturated with the antithyroid agents that it takes a couple years of a fairly strict diet before they can get along without thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** And would the same thing go for If the problem with that was low progesterone, would the same thing happen there with some people needing only a few doses, I guess, and it could get them out of that cycle?

**RAY PEAT:** That's much more frequent than the quick response to thyroid. I've seen, I suppose, 200 or 300 women who just needed one or a few doses of progesterone to get out of the cyclin and get going on their own without needing a supplement. So I've always resisted the idea of talking about hormone replacement, but very often, for example, one woman who, since puberty, had been very white-skinned with purple lips. It was just apparently her nature. She put some progesterone on her hand. And I was explaining how it's absorbed through the skin. A little later, she telephoned and said, as she was leaving the house, she felt something happening. And when she got home, she looked in the mirror, and her cheeks were pink, and her lips were red instead of purple. And weeks after that, when she visited her parents, the first thing they said was, what happened to your color change? It had existed for about 18 years at that point, and in just minutes, the progesterone apparently permanently changed her physiology, just one dose.

**CONTEXT:** My first question relates to the earlier part of your show. I saw a report, I think it was on KPIX out of San Francisco, within the last six months, one of the major affiliates. And it was about eugenics in the U.S., where there was a hospital in Sonoma, so-called hospital, where they took people whose parents may have been considered misfit for being tardy to school, or may have been involved in what was interpreted as prostitution, and they sterilized the kids. And in this report, they said that Hitler actually used that as a model, this hospital in Sonoma for what he did that was even more evil, of course, than that. Bad enough what they did here in the state of California for these young people whose fault it was none of theirs, what their parents had done. Or if it was on their own, they were late for school and considered mischief for society and didn't want those kids to move on and sterilized them. But I wondered if you had heard anything in what you had discussed earlier that was related to that school and our hospital in Sonoma.

**RAY PEAT:** Not that particular hospital. I've seen it mentioned. But there were several hospitals doing that in the U.S. in the 1920s. And American geneticists were the model for Hitler's eugenics program. That's fairly well known. The American Journal was called Annals of Eugenics, and it kept that name until 1954. Another journal was the Quarterly of Eugenics, and they kept that name until 1969. That public recognition of their role in Hitler's sterilization and murder campaigns finally caused them to change their name.

**CONTEXT:** My other question is completely unrelated to that. As you know, we're having an eclipse which enters, makes landfall in Humboldt County at a little after 5 on Sunday, May 20th, and it peaks between 624 and about 632, 634. And... My question relates to if somebody does injure their eyes, and of course they should use the number of 14 welders, glass, or other approved observing techniques which you can obtain at telescope stores, but if somebody does injure their eyes, is it possible to regenerate any kind of seeing with things such as beta carotene, vitamin K, and the like?

**RAY PEAT:** Immediately when the exposure has happened, in the first hour, red light, like seeing light through your eyelids, can have a detoxifying effect on the heat damage. It has partly, it stimulates circulation and lowers inflammation just to have mild red light exposure. Anti-inflammatory things, aspirin and vitamin E, help to stop inflammation from such injury.

**CONTEXT:** My first question is, could you explain how salt affects the thyroid? What affects it? Salt.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, it stimulates cells to use oxygen, and it works with thyroid to rev up the oxidation of sugar, producing carbon dioxide. So it's like speeding the metabolism? Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** So salt is okay? So then if you had an overactive thyroid, it would be best not to eat salt?

**RAY PEAT:** No, not necessarily because your body should govern your salt appetite. You'll not have a salt appetite if you aren't losing salt fast enough.

**CONTEXT:** And the other question is, when you're talking about polyunsaturated oils, are you saying it's not good to eat nuts like almonds and walnuts?

**RAY PEAT:** Right, I think they're major problems.

**CONTEXT:** For what I'm wondering is, have you, when I turned in the show, you were talking about how bacteria inherit resistance to antibiotics, I believe. Both horizontally and vertically would suggest inheriting acquired characteristics. And so I'm wondering if you could comment on how that might refer or impact on, say, the work that Lamarck did in his studies of inheriting acquired characteristics.

**RAY PEAT:** He made several points that he was not saying that it's just a matter of the inheritance of randomly mutated genes. He pointed out several other mechanisms of inheritance, but the anti-Darwinians were actually anti-evolutionists who didn't like the idea that organisms could have a purpose or could be intelligent and respond reasonably to the environment in a way that could be passed on to their offspring. The anti-Lamarckism was really associated with anti-true Darwinism and was a creation of late 19th century anti-Lamarckism evolutionists who became the basis for the neo-Darwinist movement, which is what suppressed this idea of a purposeful developmental field as being what is in charge of both expressing and organizing the genes.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so all of this denunciation of Lamarck... I'm really thinking about this from having read Arthur Kessler's book, The Case of the Midwife Ode. And so all this suppression of Lamarck's work and his ideas is, you're saying, is really dogmatic rather than real.

**RAY PEAT:** Dogmatic and even to the point of being irrational and unscientific. It just makes no sense in things like Mendelian inheritance in man. It's just like a cultish doctrine that doesn't have any basis anywhere.

**CONTEXT:** I read a paragraph in your latest newsletter on inflammation that Zajacek had done experiments revealing a cell streaming in tissues normally thought of as static and you brought out the example where he'd shown evidence that a similar transformation of function occurs in the pancreas with the a cyna cells that normally produce the digestive enzyme or pro...

**RAY PEAT:** The pancreas, like other tissues, is constantly regenerating and it's just our bad, dangerous fats in the diet that is constantly killing off the insulin-secreting cells. So it's possible to regain insulin-secreting cells. That was the basically what Zychek research was showing, right? Yeah, the organism is in very vigorous replacement everywhere. All the parts are turning over and in a very organized meaningful way doing its best to renew everything including the things that are associated with diseases such as lack of insulin.

**CONTEXT:** Just for our listeners to wrap up here for these oils that Zychek showed were harming the cells in the pancreas. Basically, polyunsaturated oils, if I can lump it all together, include every vegetable oil apart from olive oil, coconut oil, and animal fats such as butter, beef, lamb fat, and any fat from a ruminant animal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it stimulates cells to use oxygen, and it works with thyroid to rev up the oxidation of sugar, producing carbon dioxide. So it's like speeding the metabolism? Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** So salt is okay? So then if you had an overactive thyroid, it would be best not to eat salt?

**RAY PEAT:** No, not necessarily because your body should govern your salt appetite. You'll not have a salt appetite if you aren't losing salt fast enough.

**CONTEXT:** And the other question is, when you're talking about polyunsaturated oils, are you saying it's not good to eat nuts like almonds and walnuts?
