**RAY PEAT:** In the uterus, early in the development of the embryo, there's no blood supply, and so the cells are just absorbing oxygen and sugar and amino acids and vitamins and such from their environment. As the cells change, every time they divide, the environment for each new cell is different. The more cells there are, the more complex the environment is. If you happen to be next to a hungry cell, you won't get the same supply of oxygen and sugar. And so the changing shape as the embryo grows interacts with and modifies the supply of nutrients. So the very shape that the embryo develops into is governed partly by the supplies that the mother can deliver to it.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the parallels between development in utero, where scarring is absent, and how this differs in adults?

**RAY PEAT:** For example, they knew in the 50s already that if you lowered the blood sugar of a well-developed fetus using either estrogen or insulin, which would lower the blood sugar, the brain cells would simply stop multiplying as long as the blood sugar was inadequate. And when, if you take a chicken embryo and an egg, for example, its brain stops growing exactly when the hen's provided glucose supply is used up. But if you open the egg and inject a little bit of glucose, the brain will start growing again and the chicken will develop with a bigger brain than normal chickens ever had.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that in utero, brain development is directly linked to glucose supply. Can you elaborate on this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but from month six to delivery, most of the brain cells develop. In fact, about half of the brain cells that are present at month six die off. And that's how you can influence the size of the brain by providing sugar. The more sugar there is, the fewer of those month six brain cells will die off.

**CONTEXT:** You've suggested that pregnant mothers might benefit from a fructose IV. Can you explain why fructose is a good sugar to provide?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's what the baby wants, apparently, because it doesn't give any back.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key differences in tissue repair between a fetus and an adult, particularly regarding scarring?

**RAY PEAT:** In the fetus or embryo, if you remove some tissue, the adjoining cells simply multiply and fill in with more cells. Apparently, you've left the available nutrient supply increased relatively by taking out some cells, and so the neighboring cells have more and can simply grow faster and fill in the space. But in a mature animal, there are many things that interfere with that. The blood supply is interrupted if you have an injury, and so the supply of sugar and oxygen is reduced. And so there are mechanisms to make up for that to try to increase the delivery of sugar and oxygen. And this is a stress metabolism. It's your emergency backup. Basically, if you're not performing, if your body's not performing under ideal conditions, then it does the next best thing, which isn't a particularly good job.

**CONTEXT:** You describe a "stress metabolism" in adults. How does this differ from fetal development, and what are its consequences?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the glucose is largely provided during stress from breaking down proteins. First, you use up what's stored as glycogen, but when that runs out, then you have to break down protein. That's why it's important to only have... not go longer than eight hours without eating.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the importance of not going too long without eating. How long is too long, and what happens to glucose stores?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the lack of oxygen or the presence of lactic acid, which is produced by a lack of oxygen, either of those turns on the production of a very simple protein that serves as supporting material, but also it's a barrier substance. So that cells that are injured put out the framework collagen material. But too much of that will increase the distance that oxygen and sugar has to travel to reach the cell, so it can make the problem progressively worse. The more a cell embeds itself in collagen as a result of the stress, and so you get more framework material but less functioning cellular material, and that's a scar.

**CONTEXT:** How does the accumulation of collagen contribute to scarring and worsen the problem?

**RAY PEAT:** But if you look at the whole life development of the organism, every tissue has to renew itself constantly. Like your skin and your intestine, everyone knows that those are streaming from the stem cells at the bottom of the layer. As the cells multiply and mature, they reach the surface where they fall off. But every tissue and organ in the body is undergoing the same sort of movement from stem cells to mature functioning cells. And that is, ideally, that's just a continuation of the development of cells in the embryo and fetus. They're fed, they multiply, expand, and complexify. But as things interfere with the ability to use energy or oxygen, the mature animal progressively moves into a generalized inflammatory state. It doesn't take a specific wound to turn on these cytokines and hormones and so on, histamine and serotonin and so on, which are all the backup stress, generalized systemic stress. Starts turning these on in your fat cells, your liver, every organ can produce these. And that starts basically to shift the whole body in the same direction that scar formation goes. Your whole body loses vital functioning cells and replaces them with collagen, inert connective tissue. So that old meat, for example, is tough because it's full of collagen. An old animal hide is thicker and tougher because there's more collagen, and then kid gloves are delicate. But mature goat skin is a thicker kind of leather, and that happens in all of the tissues, a progressive basically turning towards a scar tissue type of function.

**CONTEXT:** You've described a systemic shift towards a scar-like state in aging. What are the underlying processes that inhibit the ideal use of oxygen and sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** The thyroid is the basic thing, and thyroid activates the respiratory enzyme, for which copper is the crucial co-factor. And so if you load up on iron, an excess of iron is one of the things that tends to displace this crucial copper, and anything that interferes with your thyroid function will also interfere with the functioning of this copper-containing enzyme. Too much darkness, not enough good light, reduces the activity of this enzyme. So people need to get lots of sunshine this summer, and it doesn't have to be during the hottest time of the day. Actually, it's more ideal if it's not during the burning hours, so it's in the morning or in the later afternoon, evening. It's the red light that's so regenerative and healing and helps your body use oxygen and sugar more efficiently.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key factors that inhibit the efficient use of oxygen and sugar, and how can light exposure help?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and in the absence of sunlight, if you just shine a very bright incandescent light on your tissues, within a few minutes, the oxidative enzymes are activated and reduce stress. And of course, the more of your body that's exposed to the red light from the sun is good, or from the light bulbs, normal incandescent bulbs, but even if you just walk around with short-sleeve shirts and shorts on in the summertime, you'll be getting, it doesn't matter which part of the tissue it touches, any part will help all of the tissues throughout the body.

**CONTEXT:** You've highlighted the role of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) in inflammation and scarring. Can you explain their negative impact?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the polyunsaturated fats that people consume in their diet from the liquid vegetable oils and the other sources of polyunsaturated oils have a very negative and inflammatory effect in the cascade that would otherwise produce active cell repair without scarring. And some of the worst inflammatory agents are produced directly from the vegetable oil polyunsaturated fats, omega-6 class. They form the prostaglandins, and these are very pro-inflammatory, and the fetus is highly protected against those. So that people talking about the essential fatty acids have noticed that human babies and calves are born in an extremely deficient state, and that's been used to sell the addition of fish oil to baby formula and such things. Oh goodness, when actually it's completely the opposite, that they don't need it and don't want it. The placenta protects the baby against those fats. They don't cross the placenta then? No, the sugar that the baby does absorb makes the omega-9 series, which are anti-inflammatory. So humans haven't eaten these oils in such large quantities ever before until the 1920s, and that's part of the reason why there are so many degenerative diseases.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that the placenta protects the fetus from PUFAs. What is the significance of this, and how do PUFAs contribute to degenerative diseases?

**RAY PEAT:** And we're going to talk about a few more like the pancreatic damage that happens to the beta cells from excess omega-6.

**CONTEXT:** Can you illustrate how PUFAs, specifically omega-6, contribute to conditions like diabetes by damaging pancreatic beta cells?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the American diet in the last 30 or 35 years, when the diabetes and obesity have been increasing so much, the polyunsaturated fats are the biggest increase in our diet, not sugar. If you look at the nature of the pancreas, there's a constant renewal of the beta cells that produce insulin in the pancreas. So the idea is that once you're diabetic, you're doomed to always be diabetic because you don't have the cells in the pancreas. That went out when people discovered the idea of stem cells. In one of my newsletters on sugar and diabetes, I mentioned the studies that showed that glucose stimulates renewal of the beta cells in the pancreas. So that's sugar for helping a diabetic's pancreas regenerate. To renew itself, but if since the polyunsaturated fats and the prostaglandins that they form are toxic to the beta cells, if you don't have enough glucose, you'll just keep killing any beta cell that appears. Even though you do have the stem cells, they'll be converted to beta-cells just to get killed by the PUFA. And it happens that the stem cell, the flow from the new cell to the mature insulin cell, it happens that one of the early stages in this streaming is from the glucagon-producing alpha cells in the pancreas. The alpha cells turn into beta cells as they mature, and the glucagon-producing alpha cell raises the blood sugar. And so if you have a lot of the alpha cells in proportion to the beta cells, that will create apparent diabetes because the glucagon causes the breakdown of protein tissue and increases the glucose, which is helpful potentially if it's only a temporary measure. So it's like a stress reaction. The body's trying to emergency save the lack of sugar in a diabetic's pancreas by increasing the amount of glucagon to raise the blood sugar.

**CONTEXT:** You've described a process where alpha cells in the pancreas can convert to beta cells. How does sugar influence this process, and how does glucagon play a role in diabetes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and then if you have a lot of sugar supplied, you don't need the glucagon-producing cells, so they move on under the influence of sugar. The flow is increased, and you produce the beta cells, and the sugar should be holding down the stress and preventing the free fatty acids which would form the prostaglandins that would kill the beta cells.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a study where diabetics were given sugar and improved. Can you explain this phenomenon?

**RAY PEAT:** So this is why you mention that study done in England that showed in the early treatment of diabetes they actually gave the diabetics sugar because they noticed they were losing so much sugar in their urine and they actually improved. Something like 12 ounces a day they said of the highest quality white sugar. And they started picking up weight. Because it lowered the stress and allowed their beta cells to fully develop. Within just a few days they stopped producing so much sugar in their urine as they were eating these huge amounts of sugar and as they stopped destroying their own tissues they began gaining weight instead of losing weight.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the concept of "cell streaming" and stem cells. Can you elaborate on your view that cells can transform into different cell types?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's easiest to see probably in the liver. Zychek has demonstrated that there is a flowing from the portal vein side of the lobule in the liver and moving the cells towards the central vein in the center of the lobule. But about 50, more than 50 years ago, L.P. Polishaev was demonstrating that kind of renewal in muscle cells and even brain cells, showing that even mature neurons, given the right kind of stimulation, can undergo mitosis and become new cells.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the idea of "adrenal fatigue." How does the adrenal gland renew itself, and what factors influence this process?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the current places where this is important is the idea of adrenal fatigue that a lot of people are talking about. It ultimately derives from the idea of Addison's disease and a misinterpretation of Hans Selye's stress research in which he showed that very intense stress would cause the adrenal glands to enlarge and even bleed and then die, and then the animal would die. But if the stress is moderate, the adrenal is very good at renewing itself. You can demonstrate the total renewal of the adrenal cortex by scooping out the contents. Everything that's inside the capsule of the adrenal gland can be scooped out. And the cells of the inside of the capsule, the fibrous capsule, there's a layer of cells that will multiply. And they will, within about three months, produce a fully-structured brand new adrenal gland. And so it's the same idea as the pancreas renewing itself, if you give it a chance. And the same logic that you can see in the feedback systems of sugar and glucagon and the shift to insulin in proportion to the available sugar in the adrenal gland, the cells that are near the capsule are the cells that produce aldosterone or the other class of mineral steroids, mineral regulating steroids. As they mature and stream towards the center, they turn into another layer that produces cortisol and the glucocorticoids. And then at the last stage, they produce the androgens and sex steroids.

**CONTEXT:** You've described the adrenal gland's renewal process and the differentiation of cells to produce different hormones. What role do stress-producing factors like serotonin play in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** And it happens that the things that are most stress producing, like serotonin, for example, you know, how one single cell knows that they have 36 cells of all the 16 cells in the body. After a year of keep trying, the single cell cells that turn back into Aisin-D MarBL are performed. You can make large bills taking away O69while gaining new카렷. Just like we were looking atELP, we sold one cell at a time, they gotlaughter. And there's an amount of cool stuff happening that makes people want to buy theковrion in a cheap way. Or shock, will turn on the activity of the glomerulosa layer that produces the aldosterone. And aldosterone intensifies some of these defensive stress reactions. And the people are now starting to speak of it as an endogenous toxin that activates so many of these stress reactions. But serotonin is a major factor in turning it on, but it's the first thing produced. And as the organism starts surviving, if it can get past that shock stage with adequate sugar, then the glucocorticoids are produced, and finally the sex steroids, which aren't needed if you're going to be in shock. I was starving to death and so on. They're the least important in the emergency mode, but the most important in a healthy mode.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that progesterone and testosterone can inhibit aldosterone production. How does this relate to achieving a healthy state?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so this is why it's so important to eat optimal nutrition so that all of your cells can function normally and healthily and regenerate. Yeah, and when you are in this healthy state producing an abundance of progesterone and testosterone, for example, these turn off the aldosterone production. So once you achieve the mature happy state, then even though your cells are still there and they're still streaming, their function is inhibited the same way that sugar is. It inhibits the function of the glucagon producing cells.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the traditional use of honey for wound healing. Can you explain why sugar, including honey, is effective in healing wounds, even without antibiotics?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in Africa, when there was no antibiotic available and they had to do chest surgery, they simply filled up the chest hole with massive amounts of sugar, and they discovered that it not only didn't get infected, but it healed basically without scarring. In the newsletter on diabetes, I mentioned some of the references where they find that packing a wound with sugar inhibits the formation of excess collagen and causes almost scarless healing.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that honey has antiseptic properties, while white sugar does not. What makes honey more effective for healing beyond its sugar content?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, honey never goes bad, right? Yeah, partly it's the osmolarity. It dehydrates things, but it also has the antiseptic, antimicrobial ingredients that white sugar doesn't have, and it has the fructose which promotes actual healing instead of scar formation.

**CONTEXT:** How does the energy supply from sugar contribute to cellular repair and prevent inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, keeping the energy supply equal to the demand is what short-circuits the inflammation system. It goes right to repair like the fetus.

**CONTEXT:** You've drawn parallels between toxemia/pre-eclampsia in pregnancy and aging processes. Can you elaborate on these similarities?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just about everything that happens to a woman in pre-eclampsia and to the fetus is similar to what is happening to advanced aging symptoms, loss of functional tissue, all kinds of circulatory problems, hypertension, nerve problems, liver malfunction, inflammatory processes everywhere. And in the 1950s, Dr. Tom Brewer was shocked when he saw the drug companies promoting the sale of diuretics to pregnant women to prevent edema, and at the same time, doctors began advocating salt restriction besides use of diuretics and diet restriction to prevent, supposedly to prevent toxemia, because toxemia involves swelling and edema, and so the drug company said, here's a diuretic to get water out of the body, but the mechanisms by which it gets water out reduces the blood volume, and that tells the kidneys that you need more circulation, more blood, and the kidneys signal with renin to activate the adrenals, for example, to produce more aldosterone to try to increase the blood volume, to save sodium. And so when you cut down sodium, you make the adrenals produce more aldosterone to retain it. Right, self-defeating. So Tom Brewer reviewed the evidence already in the 1950s. He had a good collection of scientific studies showing that more salt was the cure to toxemia. Protein was the thing he mostly emphasized, but protein and plenty of salt and calcium. So milk was the ideal protein because drinking two quarts of milk, you'd get more than 2000 milligrams of calcium. And the calcium is one of the things that helps to turn off aldosterone, and the sodium. It is very powerful at turning off the aldosterone, and the aldosterone is one of the immediate villains in producing many of the symptoms, such as leakiness of blood vessels, lets the water fall out of your blood, cause your feet and face and such to swell up. So just drinking more water just causes more demons.

**CONTEXT:** You've criticized the medical profession's advice regarding salt restriction and diuretics for pregnant women. Can you explain why this advice is counterproductive?

**RAY PEAT:** And that's still a common recommendation that doctors give to pregnant mothers. I'm not just talking about in general, but actually to pregnant mothers. They say, you need to increase your fluid intake. And they don't mean orange juice or milk or other nutritious liquids. They mean water.

**CONTEXT:** You've highlighted the importance of calcium in regulating blood pressure and counteracting aldosterone. Can you explain the mechanism?

**RAY PEAT:** And the medical profession has pretty much quietly forgotten about the salt restriction and diuretic episode because it probably would be considered a crime against humanity that would lead to replacing medicine with chiropractics or something, but now they're still doing silly things like advocating drinking more water. Okay, so to get on to calcium. And in its role, I think a lot of people don't understand this, and again, I don't know how it happens, I don't know how the whole thing happens with the salt restriction being a medical piece of advice and actually causing edema. I don't understand how people take it on board that the diuretics they're given are really doing the opposite of what they should be doing. Not what they should be doing is they shouldn't be used, but that diuretics are actually self-defeating in terms of how they work physiologically. And and how sugar has been so maligned and how it's so important. The calcium again is another one. So the concept of when you have a low calcium diet, i.e., you're not drinking a lot of milk, you're not eating cheese and the other sources, maybe greens, the other sources of calcium, that when you have a low calcium in your diet, your blood calcium actually gets bigger, the concentration of calcium in your blood increases, and that calcium is very damaging to soft tissues. Need to say a little bit about that because that's such, I think, that's another common misconception.

**CONTEXT:** You've stated that a calcium deficiency can lead to increased blood calcium, which is damaging. Can you explain this paradox?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, David McCurran, about 30-some years ago, worked at a California university and noticed that according to the government's own figures, the people who had the highest blood pressure ate the least salt, and the people who ate the most salt had the lowest blood pressure. And he said there's something wrong with this idea of restricting salt. And so he looked at the figures and saw that calcium was really the main thing affecting blood pressure. He got fired from that university and moved to Portland and had, I guess, about 30 years working at a university in Portland continuing to do research. So there are many papers by McCurran showing that it's really a calcium deficiency rather than the sodium excess that causes high blood pressure because calcium is another thing that will lower the stress hormones and that helps the stress and that helps lower blood pressure. The parathyroid hormone is what you can see most easily coming down when you eat more calcium and have adequate vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone increases aldosterone. And so you restrict calcium, your parathyroid hormone goes up, that makes your aldosterone stress hormone go up, that makes you increase your blood pressure and retain sodium.

**CONTEXT:** You've explained how calcium deficiency can lead to high blood pressure. Can you clarify the role of parathyroid hormone in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** The parathyroid hormone takes calcium out of your bones and moves it into all the soft tissues. Kidneys and arteries are where it causes the blood pressure to rise and the arteries to become stiff. So a calcium-deficient diet leads to hardened arteries and high blood pressure.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the negative effects of hypothyroidism on sodium loss and aldosterone. How does this relate to salt sensitivity, and what is the role of calcium and vitamin D?

**RAY PEAT:** The hypothyroidism causes you to lose sodium, and it's probably the main cause of people having high aldosterone. And once you have high aldosterone because of low thyroid or low calcium... Well, I had hyperthyroid, I had an overactive thyroid, and now I'm getting it under control. That's often a diagnosis, but it's often doubtful how factual the diagnosis is because stress will cause your TSH to give an indication of hyperthyroidism, and the high stress hormones can give you many of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but those can very often be cured by a supplement of thyroid. I'm actually taking thyroid now to balance me out.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that hypothyroidism can lead to increased aldosterone and salt sensitivity. How does thyroid hormone balance this?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid, by making you able to regulate your minerals, thins the blood and it makes it easier for your heart to pump the blood by lowering viscosity and regulating the minerals to maintain the right volume of blood at the right viscosity. So, investigating your thyroid function in more detail, you might not need the blood thinner because thyroid is probably the basic thing that keeps the blood viscosity low, and hypothyroidism is extremely common as a cause of hypertension, and that involves increased aldosterone, and that will create the appearance of so-called salt sensitivity. A calcium deficiency and low thyroid function make you actually sensitive to salt so that you can raise your blood pressure by taking salt.

**CONTEXT:** You've stated that calcium and vitamin D are crucial for avoiding salt sensitivity. What are the recommended daily intakes?

**RAY PEAT:** If your calcium intake is well over a thousand milligrams per day and your vitamin D is good, then there's very little likelihood that you will be one of those salt-sensitive people.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that progesterone can help menopausal women by moving estrogen from tissues into the blood. What happens to this estrogen once it's in the bloodstream?

**RAY PEAT:** No, if the liver is working, if you're eating enough protein and if your thyroid is okay, your liver will send the estrogen straight to your kidneys to be excreted as soon as the progesterone gets it out of your cells into the bloodstream. And there are several enzyme systems involved in this. The progesterone basically destroys the estrogen receptor that binds estrogen. It destroys the enzyme that releases estrogen from the glucuronic form to deposit it in cells. It activates the enzymes that are add the glucuronic acid to remove it from cells, and it shifts the oxidative enzymes so that they destroy the active form of estrogen. So everything progesterone does to estrogen system gets it out of the cells. Then your liver will send it to your kidneys to excrete.

**CONTEXT:** You've explained how progesterone helps the body excrete estrogen. Does progesterone also help the liver in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, progesterone activates the thyroid to do that.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the idea that acidic diets can cause the body to release calcium from bones. What are your thoughts on this, and what are the true causes of osteoporosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, one of the problems with calcium supplements is that some of the co-factors are very bad, like calcium phosphate. Some of the supplements have so much phosphate that it's the phosphate that increases the stress hormones and activates the breakdown of the bones. But the main things that take calcium out of the bones besides an excess of phosphate are cortisol, prolactin, and serotonin. And those all trigger parathyroid hormone. Yeah. And other stress hormones.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that phosphate can be detrimental in calcium supplements. What are the primary factors that lead to calcium loss from bones?

**RAY PEAT:** In terms of the caller's question about the acidic diet, do you think that has a direct effect on calcium mobilization from the bones into the blood? Well, phosphate is the main acidifying thing in the diet, and it mostly comes from beans, whole grains, and seeds and nuts, and meat. Sounds like a vegetarian diet. Oh, and meat, yeah, of course. So that's why I think the generalization is an American diet is very acidic because meat is very acidic, whereas dairy products are actually milk is almost, I mean, it's very neutral, if anything, it's a little bit alkaline because of the high calcium, and it's actually a calcium deficiency that will cause so much calcium to leach out of the bones and get deposited in the places you don't want it, like your kidneys and your arteries.

**CONTEXT:** You've stated that meat and grains can be acidifying. How does this relate to the idea of an "alkaline diet" and calcium deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the parathyroid hormone takes calcium out of your bones and moves it into all the soft tissues. Kidneys and arteries are where it causes the blood pressure to rise and the arteries to become stiff. So a calcium-deficient diet leads to hardened arteries and high blood pressure.

**CONTEXT:** You've explained that a calcium deficiency leads to hardened arteries and high blood pressure. What is the role of milk in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's a lot of milk.
