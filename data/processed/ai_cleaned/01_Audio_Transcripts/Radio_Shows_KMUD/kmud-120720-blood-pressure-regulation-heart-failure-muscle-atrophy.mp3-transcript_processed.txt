**RAY PEAT:** My graduate study in biology concentrated on aging of the reproductive system. Before that, I had been in various things: linguistics, art, thought of a variety of health-related courses, psychology, philosophy, and things that were perspectives on my basic orientation, which is biological, but biological in a very broad sense. I intended to study brain biology because of my previous work in linguistics and psychology; I wanted to understand how the brain handled consciousness and language. But at the university, I discovered that the biologists were really no more scientific than the people in the humanities and social sciences; it was very heavily ideological. That was why I shifted over to the other end of the organism where I could look at more physical, biochemical processes.

**CONTEXT:** Could you introduce yourself and your professional academic background?

**RAY PEAT:** I really started thinking intensively about saturated fats versus polyunsaturated fats at the end of the 70s, but I ran into the question very directly in aging research in the reproductive system because way back in the 1930s and 40s, people were showing that estrogen accelerated the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats, which intensified the effects of estrogen and accelerated aging, especially in the reproductive tissues. It took several years after finishing my dissertation before I got around to really concentrating on the nutritional implications of that and emphasizing the benefits of coconut oil around 1978 or 79. So way back then, there was already literature showing that the saturated fats, which are coming from animal fats and coconut oil, versus the polyunsaturates, which are the liquid vegetable oils and are now present in pork and chicken fat and fish because of what they're feeding these animals, including the fish, the farm-raised fish, and the whole food chain.

**CONTEXT:** You've been advocating for saturated fats over polyunsaturated fats for a long time. Can you elaborate on the research available even back then?

**RAY PEAT:** By the 1940s or 50s, polyunsaturated fats, both fish oil and seed oil, had been incriminated in intensifying some of the estrogen and age-related diseases. The Shute family, who were the first ones to popularize the therapeutic use of vitamin E, started out with it preventing blood clots related to high estrogen. That overlaps with the estrogen activating the breakdown and production of free radicals from the polyunsaturated fats and causing vascular disease and so on. So vitamin E was a fertility drug and an anti-estrogen nutrient, as well as a protection against polyunsaturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** Many consider vitamin E an antioxidant. You're saying vegetable oils and fish oils are free radical producing substances?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1940s, before that antioxidant concept was introduced, vitamin E was being thought of as an anti-estrogen. But in 1942, the estrogen industry basically took over the FDA and public consciousness and suppressed everything that incriminated estrogen in aging, miscarriage, and so on. Since vitamin E was identified by the Shute family and others as an anti-estrogen, the estrogen industry shifted the emphasis to protection against free radical oxidation. There was very quickly an awareness that there was an inverse relationship between the polyunsaturated fats and vitamin E. If you increased your vitamin E greatly, you could prevent damage from either estrogen or polyunsaturated fats. But with aging and the accumulation in the body, you had to increase the amount of vitamin E to prevent miscarriage, for example. My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, did experiments in which he showed that you could prevent middle-aged infertility just by increasing the amount of vitamin E in the animal's diet progressively. Extrapolating to human levels, it would be the equivalent of 400 units of vitamin E per day by the age of about 45 to maintain fertility. But that amount increases if you increase the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet. So if you carefully avoid the polyunsaturates, your requirement for vitamin E is very low. It creeps up gradually with aging. So then maybe the dietary amount that you can get from the foods you eat would be enough. But with increasing polyunsaturates in the American and all over the world diet, the need for vitamin E has gone up. It very quickly reaches the point where you can no longer stop the free radical production just by increasing the vitamin E.

**CONTEXT:** There were studies published in 2009 and 2011 that conclusively proved saturated fat intake improved mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure, and improved outcomes compared to polyunsaturated fats. What are your thoughts on this?

**RAY PEAT:** The 2011 study was by Galval and others. A high intake of saturated fat improves survival, while a high intake of polyunsaturated fat impairs survival.

**CONTEXT:** How do triglycerides affect blood levels, and how does this affect outcomes?

**RAY PEAT:** According to Horwitz and others, the 2009 study, there have been several studies that showed that a higher level of lipoproteins, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides are all associated with improved survival in heart failure patients. So a higher cholesterol is directly responsible for an improved outcome.

**CONTEXT:** This is staggering, as the medical community tells people to avoid saturated animal fats because they raise cholesterol, which is considered bad. Yet, peer-reviewed studies show improved outcomes with higher cholesterol. Why is this so backward?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's just a general weight of pressure from the industry. The seed oil industry created that myth because they found that eating a lot of seed oil would lower your cholesterol, and since you have cholesterol in atherosclerotic arteries, they said it must be causing the atherosclerosis. That was never demonstrated, and in fact, it protects you against atherosclerosis, among other things.

**CONTEXT:** And wasn't it the Japanese who showed that polyunsaturated fat is in the plaques in old, deteriorated arteries, oxidized omega-3 and omega-6, and that's underneath the cholesterol bandage, and the cholesterol bandage is trying to stop that rapid rate of oxidation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, this segment is the product of breakdown of the polyunsaturated fat. So we can look at cholesterol as an antioxidant; it's slowing down that rapid oxidation of free radical damage to our arteries. The cholesterol is actually bandaging that up and acting as an antioxidant. That was demonstrated and published already in a major medical textbook in 1922.

**CONTEXT:** It seems like a lie spreads around the world quicker than truth can get its shoelaces tied.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you put millions of dollars into advertising and bribes.

**CONTEXT:** A caller is asking about taking chia seeds for energy while on blood pressure medication (Almadopine) that makes them feel unenergetic. They also mentioned a family history of stroke and heart failure. What is your opinion on chia seeds in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know of anything in chia seeds that would be beneficial. They are very mucilaginous and could be acting as a laxative. If it works as a bulk laxative, it would make you feel better by lowering bacterial endotoxins.

**CONTEXT:** You've done personal research on aging and found things that are anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, or energy-producing, like thyroid hormone. Regarding heart failure, and the research showing saturated fats and higher cholesterol are protective, why is this the case?

**RAY PEAT:** The saturated fats tend to inhibit the stress hormones, which produce a shift to fat metabolism away from sugar metabolism by liberating fats from storage. Once you get too much of the polyunsaturated fats in your body, a little stress tends to become a big stress because that type of fat intensifies the stress hormones, creating a vicious circle. So the saturated fats turn off the inflammation rather than amplifying it. That applies to many things. About 30-35 years ago, a Hindu noticed that alcoholics in Indian regions that used a lot of butter didn't get liver disease. He did animal experiments and found that butter or other saturated fats protect the liver. There have been many studies since then published in the U.S. showing that even large amounts of alcohol don't hurt the liver if a person is getting saturated fats. But if they get any of the polyunsaturated fats, their hepatitis flares up and cirrhosis. The same with cancer: if you look at the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fats in the body, they call it the saturation index. The more saturated your fats are, the less susceptible you are to developing cancer. So fibrotic, inflammatory, and tumor diseases, as well as heart failure and blood clotting diseases, are all closely associated with the polyunsaturated fats and are protected against by the saturated ones.

**CONTEXT:** So these polyunsaturated fats interfere with energy production. You mentioned that lowering endotoxins in the gut can make someone feel better. Can you explain endotoxin and what foods to avoid to prevent the bacteria that produce it?

**RAY PEAT:** Endotoxin, one of the first things that it triggers is nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator. Both nitric oxide and endotoxin increase the production of serotonin. All of these, besides inhibiting the production of energy using oxygen and shifting it over to lactic acid production, all of these increase the leakiness of blood vessels. So in anything that impairs energy production, whether it's the toxins starting with endotoxin, nitric oxide, and serotonin, or if it's the actual environmental interference with your production of energy and supply of energy, all of these make your blood vessels leaky. All of them raise free fatty acids, which interfere with the use of oxygen. And the free fatty acids lead to a whole cascade of inflammatory mediators, especially prostaglandins. And the prostaglandins, in turn, interact, making more nitric oxide and other inflammatory mediators. So once you get loaded up with the polyunsaturated fats, all of these things tend to interact. The fats lower your thyroid function and increase your estrogen production, both of which intensify the inflammation, leakiness, and loss of energy production. Starchy carbohydrates that feed the bacteria that produce endotoxin can influence intestinal health and the dilation of blood vessels in the intestine. The best thing is to avoid eating them.

**CONTEXT:** You also recommend carrots and bamboo shoots because they are antibacterial fibers that bacteria can't feed on.

**RAY PEAT:** It's extremely rare for a person to have microorganisms that can survive a good supply of either carrots or bamboo fiber. Certain organisms can adapt to live on them, but it's very rare. Also, herbs like goldenseal and cascara bark can decrease the number of bacteria that are wreaking havoc and producing a lot of endotoxin, and therefore then help you protect your liver. And actually, the saturated fats are directly antibacterial; coconut oil is antimicrobial. It's antibacterial. Nothing grows in it; it just sits there for ages and doesn't change.

**CONTEXT:** What else interferes with energy production? You wrote about the substitution of iron for copper in the respiratory enzyme. Is this related to copper deficiency and iron overload?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the diet can affect it, but stress tends to intensify it. Not getting enough light, anything that stresses your energy production system, such as high estrogen or nitric oxide or low thyroid or too much darkness, will tend to make you lose copper from your respiratory system. As copper gets lost, iron just tends to fill in for it, binding to some of the same enzymes. It's a very reactive substance.

**CONTEXT:** So, with copper deficiency, what is a good source of copper?

**RAY PEAT:** Beef liver, calf liver. It has a lot of iron too, but the copper tends to concentrate in the liver. The place that copper occupies in the respiratory enzyme has a greater affinity for copper than it does for iron, so if you have an adequate supply of copper, then it will get picked up.

**CONTEXT:** Iron is very reactive and an oxidant. What else can interfere with thyroid hormone and affect heart failure and high blood pressure?

**RAY PEAT:** The polyunsaturated fats and stress are probably the most common things throughout Western diet culture. Traditionally, the cabbage family and beans were the main goitrogens, things that interfere with the formation of thyroid hormone. In the Andes and parts of southern Mexico and western China, there is still a tremendous amount of thyroid deficiency and cretinism. Beans are a major factor in the Andes and Mexico, and I think in China too, besides an actual iodine deficiency. But the cabbage family, especially if they aren't cooked well, like coleslaw, if a person ate coleslaw every day, they would very likely have a thyroid problem.

**CONTEXT:** Does poor protein intake influence thyroid hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1940s, studies showed that men who came out of concentration camps and started eating well would often grow breasts. They thought that starvation for protein in particular causes the liver to become unable to destroy estrogen, and thyroid is needed to inactivate estrogen. If you're getting low calories, but especially low thyroid, you turn your metabolism down so that you don't eat up the proteins in your muscles so fast. So a fairly slight protein deficiency will cause your thyroid to slow down defensively. That means that your liver is leaving more estrogen in circulation. And then estrogen blocks the enzymes which attach iodine to the protein to make the thyroid hormone. So just stress or a protein deficiency will let estrogen rise, and the rising estrogen will block the secretion from your thyroid, creating a vicious circle. Animal studies showed that vitamins B1 and B2, as well as protein, were the main things that activate the liver to inactivate estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What is the downside of taking 80 milligrams of Simvastatin for three years for cholesterol control after a heart attack?

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on how much it interferes with cholesterol synthesis, but one of the side effects that turns up is because when you interfere with cholesterol synthesis, you're also interfering with some other very essential things, such as the synthesis of coenzyme Q10 and other regulatory things. That can cause muscle problems because coenzyme Q10 is needed for producing energy.

**CONTEXT:** The caller's cholesterol is 49 HDL, 46 LDL, and 147 total. What is your opinion on this low cholesterol level, especially in light of research showing higher cholesterol is beneficial?

**RAY PEAT:** I doubt that there was any connection at all between the cholesterol and the heart attack if it was in the normal range. We might actually not have had enough protective effect from cholesterol. Cholesterol can protect you from heavy metal poisoning, many kinds of poisonings.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that atrophy related to a pinched nerve in the neck might have dietary implications. What are your thoughts on this?

**RAY PEAT:** There are several things that could hormonally and nutritionally relate to a pinched nerve. One of the most common situations of nerve pinching has to do with swelling of the sheath or membrane around the nerve. It swells up so much in, for example, a thyroid deficiency or estrogen excess that the water makes this sheath compress the nerve. If it's in a neck joint where your cartilage might be softened because of hypothyroidism, which tends to cause waterlogging of the cartilage and causes it to be overcompressible, the structure of the disc, for example, can compress under the weight of your head and upper body, causing the disc to spread out and push on your spinal cord and nerves. All of the connective tissues tend to swell up with high estrogen or low thyroid, so you want to check your hormones whenever there's a nerve pressure pinching problem. In dogs and horses, many years ago, they saw spinal nerve compression and paralysis of the rear legs. They found that a copper deficiency was responsible. The absence of light is one of the things that makes your respiratory enzymes lose their necessary copper, so the combination of darkness and possibly a copper deficiency in the diet will cause an energy failure leading to a swelling of the connective tissues, leading to pinching of the nerves.

**CONTEXT:** How does salt affect water retention, heart failure, swelling, and pregnancy toxemia?

**RAY PEAT:** Salt has some direct effects on the mitochondria, increasing energy production and shifting the balance of the cell in the right direction to produce more carbon dioxide. Working with carbon dioxide, it increases carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide helps to retain as much sodium as you need. Without sodium or thyroid, you tend to produce more lactic acid, displacing the carbon dioxide, causing inflammation and water retention. Many doctors insist that the more salt you eat, the more water you will retain and the higher your blood pressure will be. But David McConnell was the first medical person to point out that it's a calcium deficiency rather than a sodium excess that accounts for so much of the high blood pressure related to nutrition. Increasing your sodium intake tends to stabilize your blood sugar, partly because it works with thyroid to improve energy efficiency, but it lowers adrenaline, and that makes your whole system work more efficiently. It prevents hyperventilation, which is another way people tend to lose carbon dioxide and shift over to lactic acid. Drinking orange juice with a little salt in it can also lower adrenaline, making you calmer and more relaxed.

**CONTEXT:** What is your take on nitroglycerin for heart conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** It increases your nitric oxide, which is an age-accelerating free radical. That's the worst thing about it. As far as herbs for the heart, there are lots of herbs that are helpful, like hawthorn.

**CONTEXT:** What about coronary artery occlusion or blockage, which the medical fraternity attributes to cholesterol? What can people do to prevent blocked arteries from their diet?

**RAY PEAT:** Eating enough calcium is protective of the circulatory system and prevents hardening of the arteries with calcium accumulation. Vitamin K is very powerful at preventing calcification of the arteries. Vitamin K is very high in nettle herb and kale; liver is also a very good source of vitamin K.

**CONTEXT:** A newly diagnosed diabetic is asking for nutrient, dietary, and herbal advice.

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated fats are the best documented cause of diabetes. Avoid all those liquid vegetable oils, oily fish, pork fat, chicken fat, turkey, any poultry fat. Switch your diet to saturated sources: saturated fat, butter, coconut oil, beef, lamb fat. Polyunsaturated fats poison the pancreatic beta cells from producing insulin. Once those are removed, your pancreatic beta cells can recover and start producing insulin again. Glucose stimulates the regeneration of the beta cells. So, what they tell you not to do, glucose, is what you need.

**RAY PEAT:** I should mention the work of Uffe Ravnskov, a doctor who researched the role of saturated fats and unsaturated fats and showed that there's no basis whatsoever at any time in history for the cholesterol scare.

**CONTEXT:** What are your final thoughts for our listeners?

**RAY PEAT:** Make sure you get your saturated fats. Avoid the liquid oils. Make sure you get plenty of calcium and all that good stuff.
