**RAY PEAT:** When you want to lower your temperature, you sweat and turn pink so that your skin radiates and gets blood to the surface by convection and radiation to release heat in the environment. Cold-blooded animals like lizards, when they need to increase their temperature, move into the sun, or exercise. Running raises their temperature. For example, to treat an infection, a reptile will sit in the sun and let its temperature produce the fever that's needed to activate the immune system. Humans do that by tightening up the blood vessels in the skin and reducing sweating. And that, when we're producing a fever, we experience a chill. That, in the case of reptiles, they probably feel chilly when they have an infection and so they have to move into the sunlight so they feel warm and they don't feel comfortable until they have a temperature, have a fever. And when a person is experiencing chills, that means their temperature is rising because they're producing goose bumps, making the hairs on their skin stand up as the skin gets pale, cutting off circulation. And inside the body, the same adrenaline system is activating energy metabolism. Burning sugar faster or fat in some cases, producing heat faster and losing heat more slowly to raise the heat. And the opposite of that, to lower your temperature, you experience a heat surge. People very often confuse the sensation with the actual temperature. So lots of people think they're really getting hotter when they experience a hot flush. But if you measure the temperature, the core temperature typically drops by close to one degree Fahrenheit just in the minutes surrounding a hot flush.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the body's temperature regulation and how it relates to sensations of heat and cold, particularly during fever?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. The sensation that you experience is closely related to the thermostat. No one knows exactly how that thermostat works in an animal, but the physical basis for it seems to be the protein, water, fat system in the cell. As the temperature rises, it needs to change its chemistry to maintain a steadiness. To increase the set point, you stabilize this cytoplasmic system so that it becomes liquid, basically, at a higher temperature. And if you liquify the structure, it has to decrease the temperature to achieve the normal amount of order. But the details of it just aren't known, but it's equivalent to a mechanical thermostat.

**CONTEXT:** How quickly can this set point regulation be achieved, and what is the role of estrogen in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** When you administer estrogen to a person or an animal, their temperature, within probably minutes, but usually it's measured on an hour scale. It's a very quick reaction when the estrogen gets into the cells so that they're being excited by it. To offset that excitation, the temperature has to decrease. Apparently, the sensation of being exposed to estrogen is one of warmth, and that very sensation is what lowers our set points of the body temperature. So in the menopause, when women are experiencing hot flashes, it's really down to an increased estrogen and a deficiency of progesterone that's causing them to feel hot, but their actual body temperature is dropping, so their set point is at a lower temperature, therefore they sweat more easily at a lower temperature.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that progesterone deficiency is the cause of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, contrary to the common belief that estrogen deficiency is the cause. Can you elaborate on the historical context and marketing of estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** The evidence really is clearly on the side of the progesterone deficiency, but it started back in the 30s when the drug companies wanted to sell, at first, a synthetic estrogen product. Is that DES? Yeah, that was the first one, and they did have a synthetic estradiol. It became one of the staples. The ethanol estradiol was, I think they say, 17 times more powerful than natural estrogen, and that was an early product. And to sell those products successfully, they had to create an ideology. Estradiol was known to be the main ovarian hormone and already in the 1930s, they saw that estrogen was an anti-fertility, abortion-producing hormone, where progesterone was the real female hormone that made pregnancy possible. But just to market the product, they created this whole ideology calling estrogen the female hormone and saying that the ovaries fail. They simply run out of eggs at a certain age. And when they run out of eggs, they don't produce estrogen. And the failure of estrogen is the loss of femaleness. And so they said, if you replace estrogen, you can maintain pregnancy, prevent miscarriage, and prevent the loss of femininity with aging. But all of that was just an advertising campaign with lots of doctors fell for it, and lots of poor women suffered with deformed babies. Millions, yeah.

**CONTEXT:** You also mentioned the history of DES and its marketing for preventing abortions, which later became associated with abortion pills.

**RAY PEAT:** The drug companies got a husband and wife team that connected with Harvard, and they lobbied the FDA to approve it for treating menopause. And so they created the legal and public relations environment based on that completely false idea that estrogen was the fertility hormone.

**CONTEXT:** Despite evidence to the contrary, HRT is still prescribed. What are the risks associated with it?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, they stopped that trial they were doing on hormone replacement therapy because women were having strokes and heart attacks and their bones were not becoming healthier, but now back again doctors are prescribing HRT to menopausal women. And all of those events, the heart attacks, strokes, dementia, breast cancer, and so on, all of that stuff was known on the basis not only of animal studies going back 50 years, but even in human studies. They saw all of those things in very good studies. It was just that the government did such a big study that no one could easily deny it. But now they're running campaigns these last 10 years to reverse the effects of that Women's Health Initiative study. Well, pharmaceutical reps are some of the best paid salesmen and women, and they are convincing doctors. We have a very unsafe practice, unfortunately, because they're such good salespeople.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the relationship between serotonin, temperature regulation, and the misconception that serotonin is beneficial. Can you explain the role of serotonin in relation to night sweats and estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** 50 years ago, a similar thing with the drug industry and government happened in relation to serotonin. The disease carcinoid, an intestinal tumor that produces serotonin, was being studied just when serotonin was discovered to be both a brain hormone but mostly an intestinal hormone. And the drug industry with psychoactive chemicals wanted to, for various reasons that my newsletters talk about, wanted to create the idea that serotonin was the hormone of bliss, they've called it, and that it was something to be raised to create well-being. But still, the carcinoid study was identifying it as a stress-related hormone that caused flushing, one of the basic signs of having that intestinal disease was frequent flushing, as well as psychiatric symptoms. And one of the effects of serotonin is to activate the stress hormones, the cortisol system, and to activate aromatase, the enzyme that makes estrogen. But estrogen also releases and activates the production of serotonin. So it can become a vicious circle of stress, flushing, tissue breakdown under the influence of cortisol and so on. And cortisol is a backup mechanism for survival when normal healthy metabolism fails to work. Cortisol is the stress hormone that keeps you alive, but under an unhealthy metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's effect on metabolism relate to stress and the body's defense mechanisms?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen's basic effect is to shift metabolism away from sugar to burning fat as a basic defense mechanism. If you're starving, and starvation turns on flushing among other things, if you're starving, you don't want to eat up your body tissues converting protein to glucose. And so under stress, you have to turn your metabolism towards oxidizing fat. But at the same time, you turn off your thyroid, which is responsible for oxidizing sugar efficiently. So this keeps you alive through times of famine. It slows your metabolism down and makes you burn fat and spare your tissues by not turning protein to sugar.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that this fat-burning mechanism can lead to weight gain and torpor. Can you explain this in relation to animals and polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** And that metabolism tends to, in most species, it puts the animal into torpor or hibernation. When an animal is getting ready to hibernate, it tends to stock up its tissues with lots of polyunsaturated fats, and they found that they can bring on torpor or hibernation by either feeding them or injecting them with polyunsaturated fats. And if you give them sugar rather than unsaturated fats, you can keep them from going into torpor. And so this is a survival mechanism for animals in cold climates that they eat a lot of polyunsaturated fat-rich foods so that they can slow their metabolism and survive a cold winter where there's not as much food supply.

**CONTEXT:** You brought up the example of flamingos and their diet. Can you explain how their diet relates to fat saturation and their environment?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, they wade around in hot, salty water, eating algae that is living at this very, very warm water temperature, and the flamingos live basically on the blue-green algae, which at that high temperature, the algae itself couldn't live if it made polyunsaturated fats, because they would oxidize immediately. So they make saturated fats. And most of the blue-green algaes that are available here are grown in cold climates, and so therefore the fats in the blue-green algaes are very unsaturated and unstable.

**CONTEXT:** You also mentioned high CO2 concentrations in the water where flamingos live. Does this have any impact?

**RAY PEAT:** Some of the lakes that the flamingos wade in, the water feels viscous, they say, because of the high sodium carbonate concentration. The carbon dioxide bubbles out of the volcanic rifts and makes the water both salty, alkaline, and very rich in carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** You also mentioned that fish in the Amazon, living in warm water, have a high percentage of saturated fat. Can you elaborate on this and its implications for health?

**RAY PEAT:** They've analyzed the fat in Amazon fish where probably the average temperature is something like 75 or 80, maybe 85 degrees. They're in with season and rainfall and so on, but very warm water, and their fish, their fat is similar to butter for saturation, about 97% saturated.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that a male friend experiences anxiety attacks and night sweats, particularly in the morning before waking. How might this relate to estrogen or testosterone?

**RAY PEAT:** When a man is under severe stress, which can be infection or trauma or starvation, his estrogen multiplies and becomes equivalent to a woman's estrogen. And anytime you're under stress, and you're likely to waste your stored glucose and have fluctuating episodes of hypoglycemia, and that triggers several things, but especially the release of cortisol, which breaks down your tissue and turns it to sugar. And so when your stress is very high, usually at the end of the night, your cortisol is at its highest for the day. And when you're stressed by anything metabolic or an infection, for example, your cortisol can go extremely high as well as the estrogen. And that brings your blood sugar up, and bringing the blood sugar up lowers the adrenaline system, letting your skin produce sweat and become pink and hot. So the actual sweating and sense of heat goes with very high cortisol, which normally is the highest around dawn.

**CONTEXT:** So, if this gentleman is experiencing stress due to dropping blood sugar levels at night, what could he do to help?

**RAY PEAT:** Lots of people do that. I've known fat people who had a nightmare every 30 to 60 minutes during the night, and if they would wake themselves up after less time than was enough to cause the nightmare and had a glass of orange juice or milk, they could lengthen the time between their nightmares in just three or four nights by catching it in time using an alarm clock. And in just a week or so of preventing those surges of night sweats or nightmares, you can get your liver stocked up with enough glucose that you can sleep usually through the whole night. So it's really just a failure of glucose storage, and people don't get enough sugars. And we've spoken at length and we'll keep on about the need for fructose, fruit sugars specifically. If people consume enough fruit sugars each day, the glycogen stores can get replenished in the liver, and during the night when typically we're fasting, there's enough stored sugar to enable the person to get through the night without getting into that anxiety state using adrenaline as the next worst thing to keep things going. And another thing is that when somebody is stressed under physical or mental stress, they'll use up their sugar stores much quicker. And a lot of times when people are under stress, they don't tend to eat properly and they actually can tend to eat less, and then that just creates a very, very vicious cycle of stress hormones raising blood sugar by breaking down fat, and that whole backup metabolism that can lead to cancer, all sorts of destructive problems. It lowers thyroid and progesterone, which are the basic energy-producing protective hormones. And in the absence of those, then you have to increase the acute emergency hormones, serotonin, estrogen, and the various inflammatory things. And in just the last five or six years, there have been several studies showing that hot flashes, menopausal hot flashes, can be prevented just with sugar. A big dose of carbohydrate at bedtime will work better than estrogen. And that's just because it's replenishing the liver's store so that the liver doesn't have to rely on those stress hormones to get some sugar.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that estrogen can reduce hot flashes through an unphysiological effect, similar to morphine withdrawal models. Can you explain this?

**RAY PEAT:** The mechanism by which estrogen does have some effect in reducing hot flashes, it's a very unphysiological effect. When morphine withdrawal is being used as a model of hot flashes, they find that old animals can have such a low metabolism that they don't experience the hot flash. They can simply be already in the hibernating state and don't have the surges that cause the hot flashes. Estrogen lowers the metabolism and apparently it can put a person into so close to the hibernation state that they don't have the surges raising their metabolism enough to produce heat to cause the flush. But another effect is that these high doses of estrogen block the sweating mechanisms. In animal studies, if you look at the actual details, they were stopping the hot flushes, but using a dose of estrogen 2,000 times the physiological amount. And in some of the studies of humans showing that estrogen can stop the sweating and flushing, they were using 30 times the physiological amount of estrogen for a young woman, but giving it to menopausal women. And that's why so many women who take HRT have tend to put on a lot of weight because they're lowering their metabolism so much with all that high dose of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asked about athletes taking female hormones to mask the effects of steroids or corticosteroids. Can you comment on this and the impact on the body's stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone will cover up and protect against many of the toxic steroids. Pregnenolone and progesterone protect against several toxic steroids.

**CONTEXT:** What about statins and high cholesterol? What should one tell their doctor?

**RAY PEAT:** Tell them not to. I could send you a lot of research reports on that, but basically, you have to remember that they don't just inhibit cholesterol; they inhibit a whole system of related chemicals in the body and impair energy production and have not only the risk of muscle damage but also toxic effects on the brain and liver. Tell them you'd like to try a supplement of thyroid first and to get your cholesterol down that way.

**CONTEXT:** What about animal fats and cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** Good animal fats, saturated animal fats do not raise cholesterol. Avoid pork and chicken and turkey and duck fat. Grass-fed beef is probably the best, huh? And lamb. And lamb. And make sure your thyroid is working. Get your doctor to do a test and take your temperature. Below 98.6, that you could have a thyroid problem, and ask your doctor for a supplement.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that polyunsaturated fats block thyroid function. Can you elaborate on the relationship between thyroid, metabolic rate, and cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** The way it works is that the polyunsaturated fat blocks your thyroid at all levels of function. And in the 1930s, people who knew that removing the thyroid gland caused an immediate rise in cholesterol, they gave these people a supplement of thyroid and found just as an immediate decrease in cholesterol. So it's a mirror image. Your thyroid function and metabolic rate going up, your cholesterol goes down. I don't know. I've seen two people who had cholesterol of 450 or 500 milligrams per cent get down to normal in just a week by very, very intense supplementation with fast-acting thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** Let's return to night sweats. What is your understanding of night sweats in relation to temperature regulation and the body's need to cool off?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's the same thing. The body needs to be hot. The night signal is to cool off the metabolism to permit sleep. And you have to mobilize the nervous system in a different way, shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic. And parasympathetic activation makes you sweat. And getting your blood sugar up is the other thing that shifts you away from the sympathetic dominant. And the various things during the night trigger those nervous changes. Just lying down tends to shift you towards the parasympathetic dominant, making you sweat more easily. But then prolonged darkness increases the production of cortisol, which raises your blood sugar and shifts you again away from sympathetic to parasympathetic. So it's a combination of darkness, the day cycle, whatever the stress is, lowering your blood sugar, and then the compensating cortisol raising your blood sugar.

**CONTEXT:** What are some practical recommendations to help manage night sweats?

**RAY PEAT:** We talked about avoiding polyunsaturated fats and eating saturated fats in their place, so that means avoiding meat fat that's from pork, chicken, turkey, duck. One of the things that happens at night is that this shift of the nervous system tends to slow the digestive process, and it can allow bacteria to become more toxin-producing during the night. And keeping your intestine clean during the night as far as possible, and eating a carrot in the afternoon, for example, to stimulate the intestine and suppress some of the bacterial growth. A raw grated carrot.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that grass-fed beef is ideal. Why is that, and what about the fat content?

**RAY PEAT:** Grass-fed beef is, of course, ideal. The grass has a high content of vitamin E, and vitamin E is used primarily in the beef animals to destroy the polyunsaturated fats. And so the more vitamin E in the diet, the lower the polyunsaturated fat content of the beef will be. A grain-fed cut of beef will have more polyunsaturated oils. It's the ratio of saturated fat to unsaturated that is most important. So a grain-fed cut of beef will have less vitamin E and more of the unsaturated fats, but it's mostly the low vitamin E that lets the oil survive the rumen and get into the tissues. So it's the high percentage of polyunsaturated fat that is the danger, not the quantity of it, because if you have lots and lots of perfectly saturated fat, that makes it relatively safe. Like normal beef is 98% saturated and about 2% polyunsaturated.

**CONTEXT:** What are some recommendations to help decrease hot flashes for both men and women?

**RAY PEAT:** Sugar, carbohydrates in general, but especially fruit. Gelatin is the protein that's best because it doesn't make any serotonin. And salty foods help to stabilize your blood sugar and lower the stress systems. And there's also some herbs that can help to work on these different systems. Nettle root blocks the aromatase enzyme that increases estrogen. Vitex blocks prolactin, which increases estrogen. Aspirin blocks aromatase, and caffeine stimulates progesterone production. Lobelia occupies the nicotinic receptor, and it's not nicotine; it's lobeline, and it's also effective for helping people stop smoking.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that nicotine patches are being studied for their potential to lower aromatase and estrogen, thus protecting against hot flashes.

**RAY PEAT:** It's plausible that it would, since it lowers aromatase and lowers estrogen, it might protect against some of the symptoms of hot flashes and such. Lobelia occupies the nicotinic receptor, and it's not nicotine; it's lobeline, and it's also effective for helping people stop smoking.

**CONTEXT:** What is your website and where can people find your scholarly articles?

**RAY PEAT:** My website is www.raypeat.com. And I have lots of scholarly articles, probably 50 or so fully referenced articles on many different subjects. Mostly my interests are around polyunsaturated versus saturated fats, aging, how to prevent early aging, and hormones, so progesterone, estrogen, etc. All of my articles are free for those who can get on the web.
