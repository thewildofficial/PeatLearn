**RAY PEAT:** I've been interested in nutrition for many years. Between 1968 and 1972, I studied biology at the University of Oregon, concentrated on the chemistry and physiology of aging, especially the reproductive system. And that got me interested in many related processes. Before I went to graduate school, I lived in Mexico and was interested in the economics of nutrition and how to optimize good nutrition on minimum income. And I saw that the ancient Indian civilization had made some great technological advances in processing corn. Corn normally has quite a few toxins in it, but they discovered that cooking it with lime, calcium hydroxide, made it more edible and less toxic. So the traditional diet there was extremely rich in calcium, just as part of the tortilla and other processed corn. And that turns out to be something that's increasingly of interest to the biochemists of aging in the last five or ten years. Phosphate had sort of been ignored for about a hundred years in biology because it was sort of like water to a fish. It's always there and the inorganic form of it is usually just considered. It's sort of the raw material from which you activate proteins or form adenosine triphosphate, the energy containing molecule and so on. But recently the inorganic phosphates in itself is turning out to be very central to all metabolic processes.

**CONTEXT:** Could you explain how the South Americans were making the lime for corn processing?

**RAY PEAT:** They were just mining limestone. You burn limestone and then soak it in water and cook your corn in basically almost pure calcium hydroxide. That partly it makes soap out of the fatty acids and it removes the toxic unsaturated fats that interfere with hormones and it changes some of the amino acids. Ordinary corn tends to have too much leucine and that contributes to some of the toxic symptoms, but it's normally deficient in some of the vitamins and it happens that the lime process converts tryptophan to niacin. And so it's like a niacin vitamin supplement and that's why the nutrition diseases that occurred in the US southern states among people who lived largely on corn never occurred in the traditional Indian cultures.

**CONTEXT:** You've warned against tryptophan being a potentially harmful product.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, and the process of turning it to niacin happens to be very important in regulating phosphate, which otherwise would be one of the toxic features of any grain. Cereals, beans, seeds of any sort have a very high ratio of phosphorus to calcium. So they're not only adding calcium but they're giving a means for regulating your phosphate more perfectly because niacin happens to be an anti-phosphate nutrient.

**CONTEXT:** Is there a specific recipe they followed for this process?

**RAY PEAT:** The recipe seems to be a big kettle full of corn, and a big spoonful full of lime, and cook it until the shells pop off the corn. The little transparent husk loosens as the corn kernel swells up and becomes hominy. And so when it looks like hominy, you stir it a little to separate the cellulose husks, and traditionally they would let it stand in that liquid for a day, and that makes sure that the process is well done.

**CONTEXT:** Would using fire ashes be similar?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, that probably is better for some of the nutrients, and it makes a very delicious product. Corunda is one of the tamale-like foods made with ashes instead of calcium.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned saponification in soap making regarding the fatty acids. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know if they originally used the stuff for washing their clothes, but it is like a soapy solution that they pour off after the steeping.

**CONTEXT:** When you were in Mexico, you observed specific uses for ashes versus lime.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, they're both very delicious. They were all very delicious, all the many types.

**CONTEXT:** The main thrust of our discussion tonight is inorganic phosphate and its prevalence in the commercial food industry, and the pathology that comes from it. Can you talk about the age-related changes that occur with inorganic phosphate consumption and where most people's inorganic phosphate is coming from?

**RAY PEAT:** The main sources are meat and seeds, beans and nuts, whole wheat, much more than other refined white flour or white polished rice, those have the germ removed and the germ contains most of the phosphate. So it sounds funny to say that white rice and white bread have advantages, but nutritionally they do. Because they also don't have the PUFA, the polyunsaturated fatty acids. And other toxins as well. But the vegetable source of calcium that has the least phosphate would be leaves. And so since cows naturally prefer to eat a lot of leaves, cow's milk has a very good ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

**CONTEXT:** What kind of calcium to phosphorus ratio would you consider good?

**RAY PEAT:** Milk and cheese are about 1.3 to 1. And human milk is much better. I think if cows weren't given grain supplements that their milk would have an even higher ratio.

**CONTEXT:** So, grass-fed milk would have lower phosphate levels than grain-fed milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. People habitually eat a ratio of roughly five, six, or seven times as much phosphate as calcium, which probably shouldn't exceed about two parts of phosphate for each calcium. And if you stick to a mostly milk and cheese centered diet for your proteins, you'll stay close to a one to one ratio.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that three pints of milk a day would provide about 2000 milligrams of calcium. What about the phosphate intake from that?

**RAY PEAT:** In a quart, you get about 1200, somewhere around 1200, 1250 of calcium and just under a thousand of phosphate. So a quart and a half, you'd have around one and a half grams of phosphate. And so we were talking about how much meat would be the maximum amount you want to eat per day or grains or whole grains or legumes, beans. Probably something like half a pound would be tolerable. And if you wanted to put some eggs and cheese in there then maybe a little less than half a pound. You have to displace one phosphate source with the other.

**CONTEXT:** So, meats are a fairly high source of phosphate, and the calcium in meat is very low, as high as ten to one for phosphate over calcium. Can you describe the cellular aging effects of phosphate and how excess phosphate consumption can harm us?

**RAY PEAT:** In the last few years, a strange mutant mouse was discovered. They named it Clotho for a Greek fate, and this mutant mouse aged very rapidly and had most of the features of human aging, such as decreased lung function, respiratory failure, hardening of the arteries, osteoporosis, wrinkling of the skin, all of the basic things that we think of as aging. Calcification generally, deposition of calcium phosphate where it shouldn't be while taking it out of the bones where it should be.

**CONTEXT:** So, excess dietary phosphate is a factor in aging and disease processes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and a lack of the nutrients, such as niacin, which help to get it out of the body and keep it from being absorbed so freely.

**CONTEXT:** There's a link between lung cancer and increased inorganic phosphate consumption. Can you discuss industrialized food production and the use of inorganic phosphate in food?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it was probably in the 60s when they started finding that, I think it was because the government started regulating the adulteration of meat. They'd been simply adding salt water in huge amounts. They started regulating how much water they could put in meat and they started defining the chemicals that could be used and it turned out that phosphate, various forms, polyphosphate and phosphate salts were effective for making meat hold more water. And once that was approved, it became very standard and so all of the things you buy in delicatessens are likely to be hydrated. Ham now is, I think, unless you have it specially made, that's going to be hydrated with something like 15% extra weight. So they charge for it as if it's all meat. It makes it much more profitable. And also the diapers underneath pieces of meat in grocery stores that have pre-cut pieces of meat for sale are usually very waterlogged. And they can give these chemicals to animals and cause them to have edema at the time they slaughter them and that counts as the starting weight, then they can add 15% beyond that. So if you have very edematous animals, your meat is even more profitable.

**CONTEXT:** Fresh meat that is untreated and butchered does not leak water.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the 50s, I like to have a fried ham with eggs for breakfast, but starting in the 60s, I found that I couldn't get anything but boiled ham. Just put it on the frying pan and it would just fill up the pan with water.

**CONTEXT:** So, unless it's something like prosciutto that's been dry-cured, it's probably injected with water.

**RAY PEAT:** That's probably why prosciutto is so expensive then. Yeah, and this generally means that you're getting a tremendous extra amount of phosphate. So not only is meat already high in phosphate, then they add extra phosphate to it. So this is why they're noticing 5 to 6 times dietary intake of phosphate.

**CONTEXT:** So, if people are eating meat, eggs, dairy, whole grains, and legumes, they're getting phosphate. What are the best sources of calcium to balance this phosphate?

**RAY PEAT:** In plant materials, leaves really are a great source of calcium because they, turnip greens for example, have about 10 times as much calcium as phosphate, others not quite as much. But then you have to choose your leaves according to the toxins that you want to minimize. The cabbage family is anti-thyroid and some leaves. Well, all leaves have a fairly high unsaturated fat content and that can interfere with protein digestion. So if you can process the leaves ideally, then you can get very good nutrition out of leaves, high protein and high calcium. Otherwise, milk and cheese are pretty much the alternative sources, unless you want to grind up egg shells, and that's basically pure calcium carbonate.

**CONTEXT:** You also recommend nettle leaf steeped overnight for its calcium content.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you boil any of these leaves, turnip leaves, for example, you can just boil them quickly, get out most of the calcium, and then throw away the leaf. Have a good supplement.

**CONTEXT:** And you've mentioned that baking soda added to chard and spinach helps to block oxalic acid and release minerals.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it happens that baking soda has some of the same benefits that niacinamide has. It helps your body to excrete phosphate more easily. And anything that helps your body make carbon dioxide helps to excrete phosphate. And salt and calcium happen to stimulate the production of carbon dioxide. And so foods that are high in calcium and moderate in sodium will help to get rid of any excess phosphate.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding calcification in vessels and tissues, and kidney disease from phosphate overload, what are your recommendations for maintaining a healthy ratio of phosphate to calcium intake?

**RAY PEAT:** Lots of doctors for years have recommended cutting down on your calcium intake to avoid calcification. Same sort of reasoning that they know that calcium excites cells and so they say cut down calcium if you have seizures or high blood pressure or whatever, but it turns out that that's a whole aspect of calcium that has been neglected. If you are deficient in calcium, you tend to get cramps, might have seizures, bronchial spasms and asthma, the lack of calcium excites tissues, turns on the excitotoxic mediators, triggers inflammation, and sets up the conditions for depositing calcium. So when you're low in calcium in your diet, you're setting up conditions, increasing the parathyroid hormone for example, to take calcium out of your bones to make up for what you're not eating. And the parathyroid hormone releases serotonin among other things and histamine causing more inflammation, more calcification of the tissues, more tendency for the calcium to combine with phosphate and settle into the arteries, kidneys, brain cells, everywhere except the bones. So a calcium deficient diet is really associated with a lot of different inflammation and the stimulation of a lot of inflammatory mediators.

**CONTEXT:** And the tone of the small arteries is very responsive to calcium.

**RAY PEAT:** So if you're low in calcium your blood pressure goes up and for about 30 years David McCurran has been saying it's not sodium that causes high blood pressure, it's calcium deficiency. Deficiency, right. And so eating extra calcium can often cure hypertension or avoiding excess phosphate in the diet or a good ratio.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a study where a group was put on a diet emphasizing sugar, with a magnesium deficiency, and they went into a positive magnesium balance and retained calcium, but lost phosphate.

**RAY PEAT:** And to do that you can account for increasing calcium and magnesium while losing phosphate, I think only if they were turning over their bones and a young bone is formed from carbon dioxide and calcium, calcium carbonate, as the first bone, which is then replaced with phosphate during aging. So they were losing phosphate while gaining magnesium and calcium. I think that meant that they were building new bone.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned stiffness in the joints and back as a concern for aging. What dietary advice do you have?

**RAY PEAT:** Reducing the phosphate intake or getting a good ratio, ideally not much over two to one in relation to calcium, I think is important, and that closely relates to thyroid. I think the polyunsaturated fats which interfere with thyroid function. They interfere with progesterone production for example. They happen to also lower calcium in the blood so when you're under stress your calcium goes down and tends to deposit because specifically of the increased free fatty acids and so cutting down the unsaturated fats in the diet will help to improve your calcium ratio and your thyroid function and other steroids which are anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** So, an equivalent of three pints of milk a day would provide 2000 milligrams of calcium. What about other sources?

**RAY PEAT:** Or a couple glasses of milk with some eggshell powder or oyster shell powder or boiled greens. Those are all good ways, but trying to get to about 2000 milligrams of calcium would be a good start. Up your calcium level, and then keeping your whole grains and beans to not more than eight ounces a day, or your meat not more than eight ounces a day. So basically like eight ounces of your protein source would be a good ratio for your calcium to phosphate. And another thing I wanted to mention is eggshell powder. If you take a quarter teaspoon three times a day, that's about 2000 milligrams with your meals.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the addition of phosphates to meats to increase water content, do you think the industry is listening to concerns about phosphate additives?

**RAY PEAT:** I think they'll find some other way to make meat way more... some other way to get it to hold water. I'm afraid that one of those might be the gluey substances such as carrageenan or gums that's already in practice where they take waste fragments of meat or fish and add a jelly such as carrageenan or alginate and then glue the whole mess together with an enzyme that glues proteins together so it looks like a real lamb chop or... or a squid patty or whatever.

**CONTEXT:** So, reconstituted meats.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Would organic whole wheat pasta or organic meats have less phosphate?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, no. Unless they... it's a matter of whether they have added it to one product and not to the other. But the way the animal is fed depends more on whether it has a lot of grass versus grains. The grains can be organic, but they're still very high in phosphate, and so the animal will be slightly poisoned by eating them. So, grass-fed meat and milk from cows that are grass-fed will have a lower phosphate level than meat and milk from cows that are grain-fed. But grains are... because grains are very high in phosphate, so whole wheat pasta would be higher in phosphate than white pasta.

**CONTEXT:** There might be confusion between inorganic phosphate added to food and naturally occurring phosphate.

**RAY PEAT:** The phosphate they add to waterlog the meat versus the phosphate that's naturally occurring in the grains and the meat itself.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned in the past the link between calcification and hardening of the arteries, and that calcium deficiency can contribute to this. You also mentioned that vitamin K and baking soda can help reverse arterial calcification.

**RAY PEAT:** The Japanese have done studies using just vitamin K and a very high doses of it, very effectively rebuild osteoporotic bones while taking calcium out of arteries in their animal studies. But vitamin K is working on cellular energy and specifically on the handling of carbon dioxide as a group that lets the proteins handle calcium and things that increase your carbon dioxide work right along with vitamin K in helping to keep the calcium and phosphate in your bones rather than in your arteries. Even baking soda helps to build strong bones and in the way it's acting, it's the same as vitamin K or niacinamide, it's helping the kidneys to excrete a phosphate that you don't need, helping to deposit calcium and phosphate in the bones while taking it out of arteries.

**CONTEXT:** You've also mentioned the link between parathyroid hormone and calcium, and that hyperparathyroidism should be considered.

**RAY PEAT:** If people have good thyroid function and get enough calcium in their diet, they have pretty low parathyroid hormone activity towards the low end of what's now considered the normal range. At the middle of the so-called normal range, people tend to suffer inflammatory diseases, muscle pains, bone loss and so on, and the higher the parathyroid is, the more of these degenerative inflammatory diseases you have, and the first way to suppress that excess parathyroid is by eating enough calcium, but also vitamin D. That's the next most important thing. So if somebody doesn't get enough calcium in their diet, or vitamin D from the sunshine or from a supplement, then they will be eating their bones.

**CONTEXT:** In an experiment, a sugar diet built strong bones despite vitamin D deficiency, while a starchy diet resulted in weak bones.

**RAY PEAT:** And when you look at the experiment at the Linus Pauling Institute, or the William Brown experiment, sugar was lowering phosphate. And apparently that accounted for the sugar making up for a vitamin D deficiency. It helps to handle calcium properly by helping to avoid excess phosphate.

**CONTEXT:** Can this be an energy-driven process, with sugar as a direct fuel for cellular respiration?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it shifts, as they saw in William Brown's study, the high-sugar diet with calcium increased his production of carbon dioxide. When he started the experiment, his metabolic rate was 10 or 12% below normal. When he got on that diet, it came up almost to normal, and his production of carbon dioxide, or respiratory quotient, was higher than it had ever been.

**CONTEXT:** Would basal body temperature be a good indicator of metabolic rate?

**RAY PEAT:** That's the quickest way to look at it. Yeah. But also monitoring their carbon dioxide on blood tests.

**CONTEXT:** What about blood phosphate levels?

**RAY PEAT:** William Brown's was 4. When he started and came down to 2.7 to 3, I think it was. So that's another way people can monitor the phosphate levels in their blood.

**CONTEXT:** In the wintertime, do you suggest people eat more sugars due to decreased daylight and vitamin D exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it helps to activate the thyroid too. Your liver needs sugar to convert thyroxine into the active T3 hormone and I think people tend to crave sweets more in the winter, which is an adaptive instinct.

**CONTEXT:** You have low thyroid function and low body temperature. Do you have any suggestions?

**RAY PEAT:** Sometimes if you have eaten things that suppress your thyroid, sometimes just a deficiency of protein can create a low thyroid state, but usually polyunsaturated fats or too much of the cabbage family vegetables, too many beans and grains, all these have some anti-thyroid agents. Changing your diet away from those towards the fruit and milk and cheese categories. Those are the saturated fats. They don't have these toxic anti-thyroid effects, so butter and coconut oil can actually help to increase your metabolic rate and thyroid while reducing inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** Is it true that only one teaspoon of polyunsaturated fats a day can start suppressing the immune system and thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they've looked at various animal studies to see where the influence of polyunsaturated fats in increasing the cancer mortality, where it starts, and it's with 4 grams a day for the average human body weight. Which is one teaspoon. Yeah, and that, even the saturated fat foods like milk and coconut oil, cheese and butter and so on, about 2% of those fats are unsaturated, so even when you're avoiding the cooking oils and mayonnaise and so on, you're still getting two or three grams a day of the PUFA unavoidably. And the other sources are if anybody ever ate fried food out in a restaurant or you didn't cook it at home with your own coconut oil, you have a lot more than one teaspoon in a serving of fried food. Yeah, and the cancer mortality increases more or less in proportion to the amount of PUFA in the diet. So, polyunsaturated fats include fish oil, hemp seed oil, flax seed oil, canola, sunflower, soy, cottonseed, corn oil too.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned vitamin K and baking soda work similarly for hardening of the arteries. Do you suggest taking them, and how much?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin K you can get a high potency formula of a mixture of K1 and K2 and with that I think from 1 to 10 milligrams per day is up in the safe range as well as probably being therapeutic for the bones and arteries.

**CONTEXT:** Where can one get vitamin K, and if not available, can baking soda be used instead?

**RAY PEAT:** Liver and kale are the famously rich sources. I take liver once or twice a month at least. Kale is a good source, but I've known people who regularly take one or two teaspoons of baking soda with meals or after meals. They notice that it increases their endurance and energy, prevents fatigue and so on. It's interesting. I use it myself. Heartburn, it works incredibly well instantaneously and they've tested it on athletes and as much as a tablespoon at the start of a race can really improve their endurance and performance. But oh wow, I think usually the amount you take for stomach acidity is a good amount. And vitamin K, you can buy that online, a brand that's pretty pure and it's in a clean oil sources, Thorne Research Vitamin K liquid and one drop is one milligram. So we're talking about one drop a day of this stuff. It's pretty potent.

**CONTEXT:** You say one drop a day?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, one drop a day was... Dr. Peat recommended one to 15 drops of pure vitamin K.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding vitamin D, as daylight hours decrease, it's important for many processes, including offsetting calcification. The activated vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, seems to have negative effects on aging, and the anti-aging protein Clotho suppresses its formation.

**RAY PEAT:** So taking vitamin D and calcium are having a similar effect as that anti-aging protein, Clotho.

**CONTEXT:** Clotho was discovered around 1998 and is thought to be an anti-aging compound.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and they're doing experiments with mice, increasing the production of it makes them live extra long, after they get like 30% longer to have an extra dose of that protein. But since you can do some of the same things with fructose, niacinamide, baking soda and so on.

**CONTEXT:** What are some good food sources of niacinamide?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, liver. And milk, cheese, eggs, tortillas. Coffee? Oh yeah, coffee, a dark roast coffee is a very good source of also magnesium, which is, uh, works against phosphate with magnesium, with calcium.

**CONTEXT:** How many milligrams of niacin or niacinamide are in a cup of coffee?

**RAY PEAT:** I figured that, I was getting with the dark roast coffee, I could get close to 40 milligrams a day just from the coffee, drinking several cups.

**CONTEXT:** For those consuming high phosphate foods like meat, nuts, beans, and grains, adequate calcium intake is crucial.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, it's not an anti-vegetarianism or an anti-meat-eating program, but both of those things, the beans and the nuts as well as the meats are fairly high in phosphates and so calcium, as much as it's been maligned as a problem for hardening of the arteries or that kind of thing, it's really something that people need to make sure they consume more of and again, it's very synergistic with vitamin D. Whenever you eat the high phosphate foods like meat or nuts, if you are constantly having some sugar along with it, fructose in the intestine increases the resistance of the intestine to taking up phosphate, so it's like a phosphate blocker in the intestine while a phosphate loss promoter in the kidneys. Good sugar sources are of course fruit, fresh ripe juicy fruit, honey, sugar, milk has a good sugar, lactose. Those are all good sugars that have fructose in them or lactose is very similar in action to fructose. And it's sort of equivalent to protecting against the high iron content of meat by having some coffee at the same meal. But if you put sugar in the coffee, then you're protecting against the phosphate too and protecting your adrenal glands from lowered blood sugar.

**CONTEXT:** So, saturated fats, animal fats, milk, and cheese are good for calcium intake.

**RAY PEAT:** I think our ancestors had it figured out how to make it from. Definitely had it figured out thousands of years ago till now and I think we can't reinvent the wheel with all of our modern day processed foods. We're just coming back to where we came from. So I'm glad this research showing that the phosphate adulteration if you want to call it in meats is actually showing itself to be a potential problem as always, I think the industrialization or mechanization of our food industry turns up compounds that are cheap and no doubt make money and that's why they're added, but not always good.
