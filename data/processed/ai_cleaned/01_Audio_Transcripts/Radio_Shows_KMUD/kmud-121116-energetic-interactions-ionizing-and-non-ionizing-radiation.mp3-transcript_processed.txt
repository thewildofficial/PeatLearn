**RAY PEAT:** The brain could be cooked by overexposure and the technicians sometimes would eat up their hot dogs by putting them in the radar, in front of the radar antenna. And so he argued that he wasn't a biologist at all, he was a physicist. And he argued that that was the only danger from radar or microwaves was if it heated you up. And so he found that to heat up a beaker of salt water, noticeably, it required sitting in front of the radar for at least an hour at an intensity of around 100,000 microwatts per square centimeter. And so just to be safe, he and the government said that 10,000 microwatts per square centimeter will set the safety limit. But meanwhile, or earlier, the Soviets had been having technicians get sick working around radar. And so they did experiments to find out what the safe level was. And they determined that only 10 microwatts were safe. It should be allowed for technicians and only 1 microwatt per square centimeter for the general public exposure.
**CONTEXT:** What was the difference in safety standards between the Soviets and the US regarding microwave exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** There are reasons to think, based on good evidence, that the lower limits of interference with life are produced at much, much lower power levels than anything that people are now worried about. For example, one study found that brain electrical activity could resonate with a field if it was tuned properly, with a field with an energy of only one billionth of a microwatt. Just an incredible difference. This interaction there may not necessarily be harmful, but just to say that... Even at that level there was an interaction? Yes, something is happening. And in animal experiments they know that they can interfere with the orientation of bees and pigeons, homing pigeons, because to get lost if they put a magnet on them... Because they are using electromagnetic fields to guide themselves, aren't they? Yeah, when the sun is obscured by clouds, they rely on magnetic fields, otherwise they use the sun. And salamanders, I think, are about a hundred times more sensitive to the fields. And snails. There have been many studies through the 50s and 60s of the ability of organisms to sense these extremely weak... environmental fields and resonances. In the 50s and 60s, for example, human studies done by the, I think it was the CIA, found that if you shield a person from the Earth's resonant, a very, very small electromagnetic activity, the brain waves become disorganized. In other words, normal algorithms and similar brain oscillations in the 7 to 12 cycle frequencies, these are getting their cue from the Earth's resonance of the same frequency. If you drive the brain with a signal that... is larger than the Earth's resonant frequency, you can cause the brain to adjust its cycling. Or if you simply put a person in a cave, isolated from the Earth with a metal shielding around them, all of their systems become desynchronized, where normally each organ and system coordinates with the others. When you interfere with it the whole body loses its coordination so the monthly cycles get out of phase with the daily cycles and those with the more frequent hourly rhythms and so on. So the something that interferes with our sensing of the Earth's rhythms can have all of these effects. For example, menstruation, fertility, even mental clarity, causing insomnia, loss of ability to concentrate. And I think the mental effects are probably already being seen. I saw Michael Persinger in a video that's on the Internet called No More Secrets. He mentions that the abnormal, very common, rare experiences of extrasensory perception and such are tending to disappear from society. People aren't having those interesting experiences anymore. He thinks it's because of the pollution, which is, while the brain energy... the oscillation of our nerve cells and such, is just about at the same level of energy as the natural oscillations of the Earth's magnetic field. The pollution is thousands or millions of times more intense. So, even though our brains can tune in and select to a great extent these very weak fields... They are, the body is being influenced by this junk which is coming in at all kinds of frequencies.
**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of Earth's natural electromagnetic fields and how can artificial fields interfere with our biological rhythms and mental clarity?

**RAY PEAT:** The standard house current at 60 cycles per second is close enough to our common oscillations that it can have a very big effect. In Europe it's 50 cycles per second rather than 60. Okay, and those are known to affect the rate of cell division, the rate of developing blood vessels and so on. So if you use them in the right context, you can stimulate the growth of a broken bone or the revascularization of an injured tissue. But if it's just happening at random, it is known to increase the incidence of... of cancer, for example, promoting growth when it shouldn't, and many other kinds of biological disorganization. For example, Alzheimer's disease and ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. Those are very well connected with the circuits, the level of electromagnetic energy that... Lots of workers are exposed to, for example, from sewing machines. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is three times higher among people who work with machinery like that.
**CONTEXT:** How does standard household electrical current frequency (60 Hz) affect biological processes, and what diseases are linked to exposure to electromagnetic energy from machinery like sewing machines?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the rhythm is governed by the speed of the motor. Okay. And so you get these rhythms that are on the order of our own native rhythms from a few millimeters per second up to a... maybe a hundred per second.
**CONTEXT:** How does the rhythm of electric motors in appliances like sewing machines relate to our own biological rhythms?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the mental effects are probably already being seen. I saw Michael Persinger in a video that's on the Internet called No More Secrets. He mentions that the abnormal, very common, rare experiences of extrasensory perception and such are tending to disappear from society. People aren't having those interesting experiences anymore. He thinks it's because of the pollution, which is, while the brain energy... the oscillation of our nerve cells and such, is just about at the same level of energy as the natural oscillations of the Earth's magnetic field. The pollution is thousands or millions of times more intense. So, even though our brains can tune in and select to a great extent these very weak fields... They are, the body is being influenced by this junk which is coming in at all kinds of frequencies.
**CONTEXT:** What is Dr. Peat's theory on why experiences like extrasensory perception are disappearing from society, and how does it relate to electromagnetic pollution?

**RAY PEAT:** The very basis for the government policy ever since that 1947 to 50 study based on... jars of salt water heating up, the very basis for the whole policy is the image of the organism as a bag of chemicals in water, a solving water solution, an absolutely never founded model of what the organism is. So it's a horrible fantasy idea which leaves all of these... corporate and government people to say, oh, there's no danger, you're just a bag of chemicals in salt water.
**CONTEXT:** What is the flawed scientific model that underpins government policy on radiation safety, and why is it problematic?

**RAY PEAT:** St. George was one of the early people recognizing that life is an electronic process. And Alexander Gervich, even 20 or 30 years before St. George, was demonstrating that cells communicate through light. In the case of his experiments, it was in the ultraviolet region, but St. Georgie emphasized that resonant electrons can travel through the organism, and that opens up the possibility for these resonant interactions between other frequencies, not just the high-energy Gervit rays. Very low-energy rays which can resonate with groups of electrons that are behaving like an antenna, where the reductionist sees our cells as simply groups of atoms, each atom being the only thing which can absorb radiant energy. The St. George's model is that a great... molecular spans integrate the cellular processes by conductive electrons. So we are like an electrical piece of equipment.
**CONTEXT:** How did researchers like St. George and Alexander Gervich view life as an electronic process, and how does this contrast with a reductionist view of cells?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and in the late 1940s, two Romanians were the first ones to show coherent electronic interaction producing microwaves. Microwaves. They basically invented the maser or the microwave amplification by stimulating emission of radiation, the microwave equivalent of the laser. And just this last summer, some Englishmen found that they could make a maser that operates at room temperature by coherent interaction. of electrons at the microwave frequency. So now the physical, non-reductionist approach to matter is established, that masers do exist and can work at room temperature. So now we can go back and say St. George's thinking wasn't entirely unrealistic. He was describing the... chemistry or physics of a maser operating in the organism, but now we know that it's actually a thing that can be manufactured and exist at room temperature.
**CONTEXT:** What groundbreaking discoveries were made regarding coherent electronic interaction and masers, and how do they support a non-reductionist view of biological systems?

**RAY PEAT:** I think for the nervous system, especially because they emit... in the radio frequency and microwave frequency. So, those little squiggly fluorescent lights are related to microwaves? They do emit, yeah, that kind of radiation. Because they're uncomfortable to me, I don't like them, and everybody tries to tell me that they're not as bad as the long tube old-fashioned ones, and that they diffuse the light and that they're okay, and that they're better than incandescent, because they save energy. Now, if it saves energy, fine, but if it doesn't save the energy of the person, then what? And the disposing of them is very energy expensive. Exactly. Because of the mercury in them. So you think it's better to stick with incandescent bulbs? Yeah, I think they're still the best answer. LEDs, maybe.
**CONTEXT:** Are compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) harmful to the nervous system, and how do they compare to incandescent bulbs in terms of energy and safety?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think the light itself is, but there's probably activity in the computer even when it's asleep. Well, why does it make such pungent light when it's off? They just have these little LEDs to indicate... So LED lights themselves are very, very powerful? I don't think the lights are especially harmful.
**CONTEXT:** Are the small LED lights on electronic devices harmful, even when the devices are off or in standby mode?

**RAY PEAT:** The microwave is now pretty well shielded. In 1973, the Consumers Union... recommended buying no microwave oven because they weren't properly shielded. But now if you don't stand near them and just use them for a couple minutes, they aren't one of the worst problems.
**CONTEXT:** Are modern microwave ovens safe to use, and how have they improved since the 1970s?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's basically like boiling the food. Because I thought that it was... It stirred up the molecules and heated it up from the inside and that that somehow was destructive to the nutrients. That's not true? No, it's just like boiling. It does heat damage but nothing much worse.
**CONTEXT:** Does microwave cooking damage food nutrients more than boiling?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they have always disturbed my nervous system and made me feel uptight around them and people think I'm crazy. Well thank you very much for your call and I hope we answered your questions. Okay, I think we have another caller on the line so let's take this next caller. You on the air? Hi there, is that me? It is, you're on the air. Okay, well you know this subject, I'm appreciating this show but I'm a very long term person with electromagnetic hypersensitivity and I've... studied this for a long long time with some great experts in the field and I respect your opinions very much but you don't know the half of it folks and as someone who actually is a mind canary and I have to say that microwave ovens are not safe that modern microwave ovens emit quite a heck of a lot of stuff. I have to stand, you know, like a... six to ten feet away from all microwave ovens, not to get pressure in my head. I found that out in 1990. The process of how you cook food in microwave ovens, it isn't exactly like boiling because the process that heats it up actually does, in fact, impact, what would you call it, the actual, the field of the food, the textural quality of the electromagnetic bonds in the food. But worse than that is that there is so much ignorance out there and there is so much electromagnetic pollution because we have been kept totally in the dark because of the money just like tobacco and what I would urge first of all there is no level of radiation ionizing or non-ionizing that is safe. You know you have been talking about it and it is true and yet there is always women walking around with cell phones in their bras. I just read an article today about you know the incidence of breast cancer right where you held your cell phone. You know and they recommend you hold it five-eighths of an inch away from your flesh and I am like oh that will slow it down a little bit you know and maybe it will but the fact is that a huge amount of damage has been done over the last just in the last fifteen years really. This explosion of stuff and I am really worried guys. Because what I've looked at from almost dying from this is that yes you can supplement yourself with seaweed and you can get a hair test and find out what your mineral balance is so you can get it back to normal so at least your body has half a chance to fight off some of this stuff and you can eat as well as you possibly can and as organic as you possibly can but three to ten percent of the population like me are just not going to be able to function in civilization really. Anyway. And the rest of the people don't know why they feel vaguely sick, you know, and so, you know, I am so looking for people with with a solution, but I don't really see any solution except turning it off. Now, I realize that you may think I'm an extremist here, but I'm really not. I'm a pragmatist. OK, and what I see is that very, very slowly, after a whole bunch of horrible damage has been done, maybe we'll really regulate it mildly and then it'll be so cool. That the kids will think that they have to have it because it's banned, you know, the kids at the community school here in Mendocino used to take three or four wi-fi hubs, put them in a circle, point them inward, turn them on and stand in the middle of it to get an effect like bad speed. Okay, so that's, I'm telling you the truth. Yeah, that's fine, I appreciate your comments. And I would like to know. Do you have any solutions? We are going to discuss some ways to protect yourself from the DMF. What about the people who aren't just theoretically involved, but the people, like me, and worse, the people who are hiding out in canyons in Arizona, you know, in their campers, because they literally would have a heart attack, or a stroke, or, you know, die. These are scary things, though. Okay, appreciate your call. But rather than going on a crusade, which I can understand you feel very personally about, let's give us a moment to talk about some of the things that people can do to help themselves, and that will be more constructive than just damning the science, obviously, that's behind promoting it. Okay, so I appreciate your call.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential dangers of microwave ovens and electromagnetic pollution, and what are the long-term health consequences for sensitive individuals?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think if I lived near either a power line or a telephone company headquarters, I would have a metal roof and probably some metal screens connecting between the roof and some of the plumbing that's well grounded.
**CONTEXT:** What practical steps can be taken to shield a home from electromagnetic fields if living near power lines or telephone company headquarters?

**RAY PEAT:** I think as people become more conscious of the seriousness of the question, I think the pressure will force the rapid development of fiber optics and at least having other ways to communicate with electricity and electromagnetic. I know in major cities etc in Europe and I'm sure it's probably the same in the States but that most major cities have fiber fiber optic backbones running in a ring or in a grid through the city that will be a conduit for data transmission.
**CONTEXT:** What is the future of communication technology in relation to electromagnetic radiation, and what role will fiber optics play?

**RAY PEAT:** The microwaves are able to very quickly increase the beta amyloid characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms at least partly are known as well as the fact that there's a strong association between exposure and sickness.
**CONTEXT:** How do microwaves contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, specifically regarding beta-amyloid?

**RAY PEAT:** Their deficiency is involved in all of the degenerative diseases heart disease sudden death from heart stopping Alzheimer's disease they're deficient and especially relative to the estrogen level men with Alzheimer's have high estrogen low testosterone and the all kinds of injury whether it's ionizing radiation or electromagnetic waves longer waves microwaves and so on. These all lower testosterone and progesterone. And they all cause the cells to increase more estrogen and serotonin, right? Yeah, so it's not surprising that the radiation non-ionizing causes the same diseases that ionizing radiation does because they're all affecting the same basic physiology, lowering our protective hormones.
**CONTEXT:** How do deficiencies in protective hormones like testosterone and progesterone, and an excess of estrogen and serotonin, relate to the degenerative diseases caused by both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the types of radiation I didn't mention was what they're using now in airport scanners. The ones that aren't x-rays are in the millimeter wavelength. And about 20, 30, 40 years ago the Russians were working on the effects of those. They're very useful for navigation and various communication purposes, but because they were starting to put them into practice, they studied the biological effects and found that that wavelength is especially important in cell communication. And so, as with the other frequencies, the... TSA is telling the public that that's a completely harmless level of radiation and the energy level they're using in airports for those scanners are about 10 to 100 times higher than the Russian studies showed are involved in cell control and cell communication.
**CONTEXT:** What are the potential health risks associated with millimeter wavelength scanners used in airports, and how do they compare to Russian studies on cell communication?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, using the simplest... Older fashion technologies like wires is very important rather than the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Even the Bluetooth is emitting enough to add to the biological confusion. Well, you mentioned even if you put the little earpiece in your ear and it's connected to a wire to the actual cell phone, it would still be bringing some EMF, extra EMF to your brain. Yeah, in fact... Any metal in the environment is a potential source of re-radiated energy.
**CONTEXT:** What are the best practices for minimizing exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from modern technology, and why are wired connections preferable to wireless?

**RAY PEAT:** Things that are rich in magnesium help to stabilize cells because all of the stresses, ionizing or non-ionizing radiation... Fatigue and stress cells cause them to take up and hold calcium and that displaces magnesium. So if you have a magnesium-rich diet, a phosphate-poor diet, and avoid the polyunsaturated fat to lower stress and support the testosterone, progesterone, thyroid system, those foods... offer considerable defense. Caffeine is helpful to the extent that it increases progesterone and testosterone and thyroid, for example, and helps with any kind of radiation resistance. So in the herbal world, nettle tea is very rich in minerals, and raspberry leaf tea, any kind of green leaves. And in the vegetable world, you know. Kale, chard, collards, those are all very, very magnesium-rich foods. Phosphate-poor foods, like you mentioned, Dr. Pete, are going to be milk and cheese and eggs. Eggs have quite a bit, but not... And again, the greens. And the greens, right, they're phosphate-poor. The greens are good for you, aren't they, you see? They told you that when you were a child. They don't have a lot of phosphorus in them.
**CONTEXT:** What dietary and herbal strategies can help protect the body from the stresses of radiation, and how do magnesium, phosphate, caffeine, nettle tea, raspberry leaf tea, and leafy greens play a role?
