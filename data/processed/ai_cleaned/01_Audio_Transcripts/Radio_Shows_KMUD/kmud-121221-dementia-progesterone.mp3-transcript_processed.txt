**RAY PEAT:** "the effects of estrogen on biochemistry are, in many ways, exactly the same as those of ionizing radiation, and also paralleled the effects of too much polyunsaturated fat in the diet, or a deficiency of vitamin E. And that synergy between estrogen and... Radiation and the fatty acids is behind this month's newsletter."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to elaborate on his academic and professional background and how it relates to the topic of dementia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ultimately, it's using energy to do, you know, to convert chemicals into other chemicals and so basically all the cellular processes require a currency of some kind of energy and ultimately ours is oxidatively burning glucose. That's the best way of doing it, isn't it? Yeah, and under stress we can force our physiology over to burning glucose. fat instead of glucose and that causes several changes. It produces less carbon dioxide and it's likely to produce a lot of breakdown products that can cause inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to explain the need for metabolic energy in our bodies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most people have heard about the glycated proteins that people get in diabetes or aging. They call them the AGE. Right, advanced glycation end products? Yeah. Those stick to certain parts of protein molecules. And it happens that carbon dioxide also has a spontaneous ability to attach to those same groups. And if carbon dioxide is abundant, you can't get glycation because carbon dioxide is protecting that group. And it's also the higher carbon dioxide in the blood will help you utilize your oxygen better. I mean, within normal levels. Obviously, if you have too high of a level, carbon dioxide will probably cause problems. Yeah, it delivers oxygen to the cell. So it's still stressing the importance of oxygen. It's just a higher carbon dioxide will allow the cells to absorb more oxygen. Yeah, for example, in the brain, in proportion to how much glucose you're oxidizing and how much carbon dioxide you're producing, it not only releases the oxygen from the hemoglobin so it can get into the cell, but it... relaxes the blood vessels so the more blood brings oxygen. That's a general feature of carbon dioxide. It tends to relax things."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about his views on carbon dioxide and oxygen utilization.

**RAY PEAT:** "When our metabolism is working healthily, then we will be burning sugar for fuel and not fat. Under stressful situations, we burn fat, and if that fat is a polyunsaturated fatty acid from nut and seed oils, then it becomes quite a stress on the system. Yeah, and it happens that... Starvation or radiation or estrogen will all shift our oxidation from sugar to fat."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to explain the difference between burning sugar and fat for fuel.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the special problems of fasting, if you've been eating... of polyunsaturated fats in the past is that it gives you a pure diet of polyunsaturated fat with a terrific amount of oxidation byproducts when you go into a starvation state. Yeah, okay, that's the whole point of it, you're going to metabolize the fats that you have rather than the sugars during fasting and all those free fatty acids that are liberating, liberated rather. is going to be very damaging. They specifically spoiled the ability of the enzymes to produce energy from anything, especially from sugar. The failure to produce energy is almost exactly the definition of stress. Anything that makes you lack energy is stress. It turns on the whole system of responses to stress."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the potential dangers of fasting, especially for those who have consumed polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you've got a tremendously efficient liver, some people can go much longer than that, but as your liver gets less efficient, many people can only go an hour or even less without suffering the symptoms of starvation. Some people wake up every... one or two hours during the night with nightmares or pounding heart which happens when the liver runs out of its sugar supply."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the body goes into stress after eight hours of not eating.

**RAY PEAT:** "The features that people consider to define Alzheimer's in the last ten or twenty years have been the amyloid plaques and the neurofibril tangles. And it happens that the folding of these proteins that form amyloid fibrils, the folding is... intensified by free fatty acids if they're polyunsaturated. And those are released into the bloodstream when your liver runs out of sugar, basically, or you're starving. Yeah. And so chronic starvation and chronic exposure to polyunsaturated free fatty acids. Or chronic exposure to stress. That's a major factor in creating the amyloid, and the amyloid has sort of a chain reaction effect. Reading the tangles and the phosphorylation of top protein and the whole structural change that they identify as typical of the Alzheimer's brain."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why energy failure is responsible for Alzheimer's.

**RAY PEAT:** "Any injury to any tissue anywhere in the body happens to activate the enzyme which creates estrogen. It's like when you injure a tree it causes sprouting. By turning on hormones in response to the injury, that's how estrogen works. Many enzymes get turned on, but especially aromatase, which is the basic former of estrogen itself. And so in stress or any injury, aromatase appears and begins making estrogen right inside the tissue. And that happens in the Alzheimer's brain."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how injury leads to increased estrogen production in the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** "The mitochondria... these are the kind of factories, if you like, of energy production within the cell. And every cell has mitochondria. And these are also damaged by estrogen. Yeah, and not only... It is estrogen damaging them in at least six or eight different ways. It shifts from the ability to oxidize glucose. It impairs the very enzyme that uses oxygen several different places in the mitochondria. But besides poisoning the energy, it also......blocks the ability to turn cholesterol into steroid hormones. The brain is one of our biggest steroid-forming glands in the body. And its concentration of steroids, progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone, especially DHEA and progesterone, is about 10 times higher than in the bloodstream. It's probably the largest consumer of oxygen as well, right? Yeah, and the production of these neurosteroids is one of the major uses of oxygen. And so testosterone is produced in the brain as well as absorbed from what's circulating in the blood. And when the brain is injured, besides not making......these hormones as effectively as it should because of the damaged mitochondria, the aromatase enzyme begins turning testosterone into estrogen. And last month we talked about how the electromagnetic field exposure lowers testosterone. Any injury does that, ionizing radiation. Concussion, starvation, whatever. And these poofers you're saying are also another. Yeah, and so as the testosterone goes down, the estrogen is going up. And that causes other hormones. The brain is a source of signals to the other glands in the body. The gonadotropic hormones, FSH and LH. So basically we can look at estrogen as just a very big player in mediating inflammation and causing a lot of inflammation and it basically would be lumped together with prostaglandins and estrogen would be the opposite of what testosterone and progesterone does in the healthy brain."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to explain the role of mitochondria and how estrogen affects them.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's because the estrogen industry has done such a good advertising job. And when you're exposed to radiation, whether it be from x-rays or whether it be from satellites and... cell phones, it all increases your estrogen, which then blocks the testosterone in men and the progesterone in women and causes a cascade of inflammation. And it's now generally and widely accepted that the Alzheimer's brain is inflamed, but they don't like to talk about the connection between inflammation and the high estrogen production in the brain and the loss of progesterone and testosterone."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the perception of estrogen as a normal hormone versus an inflammatory mediator.

**RAY PEAT:** "Keeping your exposure to the polyunsaturated fats as low as possible, keeping the endotoxin exposure low and avoiding excess iron retention because all of the inflammatory things are following from estrogen and serotonin overexposure. It causes the release of iron from the breakdown of the hemoglobin molecule and the iron is a catalyst to the lipid peroxidation that is exaggeratedly high in demanded brains."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the most important factors for energy production and protection in the context of Alzheimer's.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's a very tiny fragment that comes mainly from the omega minus 3 fatty acids. Right, and they're in fish oil. I think because it's so small and chemically active, that's why it has greater effect by many times than the longer chain aldehydes and oxygens. It's much more potent, catalyzing the reactions, though, and apparently it lasts a lot longer. Yeah, and the fact that it comes from the... the oils that are being proposed as even cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Fish oil supplements and other omega-minus-3 fats are the main sources of acrolein."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to discuss acrolein and its damaging effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the ways testosterone works is to lower the luteinizing hormone. And people are now thinking that this gonadotropin, a pituitary hormone itself, has a big role in forming... Alzheimer's disease. For example, they've created transgenic mice that can't produce any of the LH pituitary hormone. And they are free of Alzheimer's disease when they're crossed with a strain that is bred to produce dementia. If they don't have the luteinitising hormone, LH, they don't get demanded. And other mice have similarly altered genetically so that they have no aromatase enzyme and can't produce estrogen. When they're crossed with the demented strain, they can age normally without dementia. And they happen to have twice as much testosterone in their brain as the normal mice. Can produce aromatase. So the estrogen is being produced at the expense of the testosterone. Partly because of the presence of the LH, partly just from the intrinsic injury of radiation or starvation or whatever. Because even x-ray exposure, it will increase estrogen and serotonin. In turn, those will block the effects of testosterone and progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the relationship between testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and Alzheimer's disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "And any kind of radiation, electromagnetic fields from radio and television and telephones and so on, or x-rays, dental x-rays and medical x-rays, or still the lingering fallout from the... Atomic bomb tests of the 50s and early 60s, probably that's a factor still in the increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease because radiation exposure usually takes at least 10 years and up to 40 years to produce cancer and Alzheimer's disease."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the long-term effects of radiation exposure on Alzheimer's disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "The consumption of milk decreased during this time. And there have been several studies that showed that milk drinkers have less Alzheimer's disease. And so the declining milk happens to coincide with increasing polyunsaturated fats. The previous exposure to large amounts of radioactive isotopes that were absorbed into the tissues doing their damage when the person was younger."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the correlation between declining milk consumption, increasing polyunsaturated fats, and Alzheimer's disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid is the main thing responsible for increasing it. It causes the genes to be expressed. It causes the copper to be absorbed that the enzyme uses as a co-factor. And light is another major factor because with the......stress of metabolism, the copper can get detached from the enzyme and the exposure to ordinary visible light, the red long waves of light that will pass right into your brain, these happen to lift the copper atom just enough to restore its position in the cytochrome. Should it energize the copper ion? The copper is reactivated by the red light that's absorbed in the tissue. That research was done about 40 years ago, but just in the last year, a group in the U.S. did memory studies and they showed that just shining some red light on the head improves memory."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of thyroid hormone and light in improving energy production and memory.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ultraviolet damages cells are primarily by interacting with polyunsaturated fats. A couple of the visements also interact with ultraviolet light, but the worst damage is done by the oxidation of unsaturated fats. And so aspirin is very protective against sunburn. Progesterone and other things that stop the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats will protect to a great extent against ultraviolet and sunburn or against ionizing radiation. But you don't want to count on taking aspirin and progesterone. It's better to avoid the radiation itself. Don't have your dental x-ray. Dentists can work on your teeth without x-rays. They can do root canals without x-rays. Don't just say it's okay. You'll have progesterone and aspirin afterwards."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the health benefits of natural daylight exposure, particularly red light, and any cautionary advice for those with high polyunsaturated fatty acid stores.

**RAY PEAT:** "The exposure to red light, if it comes within an hour of the ionizing or ultraviolet exposure, does something very similar to what it's doing in repairing the energy of the mitochondria and improving the memory and so on. It stops the electronic excitation that......continues causing chain reactions of oxidation of the polyunsaturated fats. They've given experimental animals killing doses of gamma rays, for example, but if they shine very bright red light on them in the first hour, they aren't killed."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat about the protective effects of red light against radiation.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's best to keep as much incandescent long-wave light on your skin, as much of your skin as possible, for as many hours of the day as possible, just turning it off for eight or nine hours while you're asleep. And avoiding... The too intense light during the middle of the day in summer is important because of the circulating oxidative products of the polyunsaturated fats poison your whole body. It's the same effect. If you x-ray your hand, your brain and ovaries and such will experience an estrogenic effect. It's not localized. It doesn't stay just where the x-ray was. No, they circulate. Same with sunburn. You absorb the poisons all through your body. It's too intense and not counteracted by progesterone or aspirin or such. So depending on the time of year, before 10 or 11 a.m. and after 2 or 3 p.m.? Yeah, and just enough to get your vitamin D requirement, which is... Quite a bit, but you don't want to get sunburnt. So if you're burning, it's too much. Up until the burn point, it's good for you."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat for recommendations on healthy light exposure during the dark winter months in the Pacific Northwest.

**RAY PEAT:** "The most intense effect you can get from the right combination of thyroid, T3, and a big dose of vitamin B1 if the rest of your nutrition is good. I've told several people. To try that over the years and no one has scored under 800 on the graduate record exam or the other standardized exams where that's considered just about a perfect score. What they did is taking about 100 milligrams at the start. It lets you have access to just about everything you've ever known or thought. 100 milligrams of B1. Yeah. There you go. That's incredible. And liver is a great source of all your B vitamins. Yeah, you have to back up your physiology. The thyroid and B1 can't do it all by itself."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about ways to increase intelligence and maximize learning, mentioning Dr. Peat's past use of vitamin B1.

**RAY PEAT:** "You said that there was a study done on sewing machine workers and how they had a three times risk of dementia or Alzheimer's because they were exposed to an electromagnetic field from the motor of the sewing machine. Yeah, I think that was people who were working eight or ten hours a day for a long time. Like in a sweatshop situation. So even something that people think is harmless like a motor can cause an imbalance in the estrogen and the progesterone levels."

**CONTEXT:** A caller brings up a study about sewing machine workers and electromagnetic field exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are also known as omega-3 and omega-6 oils, are found in all nuts and seeds. Coconuts are also found in nuts and seeds. Oil is a very saturated fat so it does not contain any of these polyunsaturated fats. So we're talking about hemp seed oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, safflower, canola, sunflower, sesame, peanut, olive oil is not considered a PUFA as we like to call them because it has about 10% PUFA. It only has 10% PUFA and the other 90% is monounsaturated. So not if you have just a normal amount in your salad dressing, it's not going to cause too much trouble. But I mean all these fats, butter and meat fat, all has a tiny bit of PUFA in it. Two or three percent. Right, so we will all accumulate PUFAs even if we eat a completely saturated fat diet."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks for clarification on why liquid oils, specifically nut and seed oils, are considered bad.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I was working in the hamster lab at the university and got interested in the unsaturated fats, I bought a bottle of, I think it was corn oil, and put a rubber tube in the top of it with a rubber stopper and put the other end in a bottle of water. And I was doing respiration experiments at the time....on tissue with a Barberg apparatus that, as the tissue respired, would suck water up the tube. And this bottle of corn oil was respiring about as fast as my tissues, sucking water up as it oxidized. So they're very prone to oxidation and going rancid. Even if they are not rancid before you eat them, they will go rancid inside your body. And it also includes fish oil. Fish oil is much more unstable oxidatively than even the ordinary corn oil. And it's the byproducts of that breakdown that you mentioned, that the acrolein is another very powerful... Acrolein and all the lipid proxidation, it's very harmful. Free radicals, basically it's causing a massive free radical reaction in your body that can last up to four years because your body to break down a fat cell."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the oxidative instability of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's higher in the monounsaturates the higher in oleic acid than the other nut and seed oils so it isn't that is the one nut i will eat occasionally because it doesn't seem to have near as much polyunsaturated fatty acids"

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about macadamia nut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "The monitors that most people use these days are flat screen monitors they're not the cathode ray tubes and those crt screens were very very strong emitters... they're not as bad as the crt screens that people used to stand in front of... the old kind of like monitor screen yeah like the old tvs they were very bad yeah the crt is a flat screens the plasma screens they're not as they don't have the same after a couple years my parents working on those old computer screens they had to get glasses"

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the radiation from computer screens.

**RAY PEAT:** "Don't keep it on your lap and maybe get a detachable keyboard so you're not putting a motor or in a battery that's emitting electromagnetic fields on your lap or your body then you can type away and because that the actual liquid screens you know the flat screens they do not they're not radioactive and I admitting things like television not like a television no"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises on how to mitigate exposure to electromagnetic fields from computers.

**RAY PEAT:** "A walk in nature yes I've just you know I'm frustrated I walk on the beach yeah okay and I forgot my third question but I love your show and bless your hearts and thank you for joining me happy new year yeah happy christmas and happy new year to you thank you for your call"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests walking in nature as a form of "deprogramming" from excessive computer use.

**RAY PEAT:** "The particular thought that they have is that uh it uh removes an excess of electrons from the body but actually the earth is also a source of electrons and uh i'm fairly sure that uh there is benefit from uh having a some kind of a more or less direct contact with the earth i'm not sure the argument in that book is exactly right but i think the point is is good"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat comments on "earthing technology" and its potential benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** "Grounding everything in the house is probably a good idea but still staying away from the machine as far as possible is the best thing so you know using like apple tv which is obviously you know a wireless uh frequency going to the house of things are i'm assuming are really bad for us was just adding to our load of non-ionizing right radiation you know it's just it's more more that you might not need if you can be connected to a wire rather than using a wireless."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises on minimizing exposure to wireless technology and prioritizing wired connections.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the butter is good, and I think it's better to eat the whole liver. Rather than just the oil, because there is a lot of polyunsaturated fat in the oil. And you'll get the same vitamins in the actual liver rather than in the oil of the liver. And many more vitamins besides, you don't get the K, vitamin K is in the liver but not in the oil. And the B vitamins are not in the oil either, that you would get in the liver."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on fermented cod liver oil and coconut oil for Alzheimer's, referencing the Weston A. Price Foundation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since the unsaturated fats are poisoning your... energy-producing system and blocking the thyroid action, usually you can notice your metabolic rate speed up when you take a tablespoon of coconut oil. And that only lasts for an hour or so after a tablespoon full. So if you do it with each meal, you're getting, in effect, a thyroid activation which restores your energy production for a while. So coconut oil and sugar and thyroid are things that help to offset the polyunsaturated fats."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how coconut oil can help offset the negative effects of polyunsaturated fats by supporting thyroid function and energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** "I really can't even hear you unfortunately. I guess I just put my question out there if you heard me. Yeah, we heard your question and we'll go ahead and answer your question."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about juicing cannabis leaves for dementia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, definitely that's putting out... 60 cycle fields very strong and close to your body, so it's better to use your heating pad on the bed before you get in, or your electric blanket the same, turn it off when you get in bed. Fields that are closer to our own bodies are more dangerous, and 60 cycles like we were talking last month is what normal electricity is. And our bodies like 7 to 10, so it's getting pretty close compared to a lot of these higher-frequency things."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the safety of using a heating pad.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know anything about it. I don't know anything about the oil, but I know that green tea has a lot of antioxidant and anti-aging compounds, like a lot of other caffeinated. Plants and substances do. I've actually seen a seed oil from green tea when I was in Korea, but I don't know anything about it. I didn't know that tea had enough to make an oil, enough fat in it to make an oil. It was very expensive."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about green tea oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, but that's consistent with everything else that endotoxin does. It increases your serotonin exposure. That's how serotonin works....to increase estrogen, free fatty acids, and so on, poisoning the mitochondria. And high serotonin is characteristic of autism. And so cleaning up the intestine, several approaches have done a similar thing for autism. And anything that lowers the serotonin seems to help autistic. Thyroid or drugs. Such as ciproheptadine and various anti-serotonin drugs."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat comments on Dr. Andrew Wakefield's work with autistic children and its consistency with the effects of endotoxin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Along with the toxic effects on the intestine of endotoxin, I should mention that particles that are being increasingly used in our food supplements, such as titanium dioxide and silica, silicon dioxide, these particles have been put into... animals' noses and they find that they go directly to the brain and cause inflammation in the brain. Similarly, in the intestine, any particle that is ingested can get into the bloodstream and reach the brain where it can cause inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the inflammatory effects of particles like titanium dioxide and silica in food supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "I know you're a big proponent of not eating grains and starchy root vegetables and instead eating fruit. And part of that is because the particles have... of starch themselves can get into every compartment of the body, including the brain. And there's another doctor that uses this for autistic children, a diet of just fruit and honey for all their carbohydrates, and the children are in much better shape."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why he advocates for a diet of fruit and honey over grains and starchy root vegetables.

**RAY PEAT:** "In fruit juice, orange juice and guava, for example, are very high in substances that knock out the estrogen-producing enzyme. They're aromatase inhibitors. These are apigenin, naringenin, and hesperitin. Soybeans happen to have......a substance that does exactly the opposite, called genistein. So for Christmas avoid soy and eat oranges instead."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights the aromatase-inhibiting properties of certain fruit juices, like orange and guava, and warns against soy.
