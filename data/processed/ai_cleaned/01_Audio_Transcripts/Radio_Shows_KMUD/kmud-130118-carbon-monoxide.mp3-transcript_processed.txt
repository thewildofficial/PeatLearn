**RAY PEAT:** I went from teaching linguistics and humanities subjects right in the graduate school in biology because I wanted to understand how the brain works when it does things such as making language or art and so on. So I was studying nerve biology at the beginning and found that that was a very dogmatic area, I think at every university, but including the University of Oregon where I started in graduate school in 1968. And so then about six months, I had switched over to the other end of the organism, reproductive physiology, and how aging affects that.

**CONTEXT:** Would you just give people an idea of your academic and professional background?

**RAY PEAT:** Old brains in general have increased amounts of the enzyme that produces carbon monoxide in the tissues. Any tissue can produce it, but stress increases the amount of the enzyme. And so the more stress there is, the more risk there is of poisoning itself. And not only increasing age increases the enzyme, but they find that schizophrenia brains have increased amounts of the enzyme making carbon monoxide. Alzheimer's brains and Parkinson's brains in the particular area affected by the Parkinson's disease. They see an increased amount of the enzyme and in breaking down the heme, which is its basic purpose, it releases iron as well as carbon monoxide and deposits of iron are found in the Parkinson's brain in that area.

**CONTEXT:** This is something that relates fairly intimately with carbon monoxide, doesn't it, that there is... many different processes that cause, or have been shown to exacerbate the formation of Alzheimer's in any given population.

**RAY PEAT:** The enzyme, first off, is heme oxygenase, isn't it?

**CONTEXT:** And just give us a run-through of what that's doing.

**RAY PEAT:** It attaches oxygen atoms to the heme molecule, which is what carries oxygen in hemoglobin. The heme molecule is what binds iron, and that, in turn, binds oxygen. But carbon monoxide is similar enough electrically to oxygen that it can out-bind oxygen to the hemoglobin in its place.

**CONTEXT:** So we can be exposed to carbon monoxide from external sources like burning fuel, but you're saying that this is also happening inside our bodies and inside our cells due to an enzyme?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's just the only way the body has to get rid of unused or inappropriately released hemoglobin. Anytime a tissue is injured and leaks blood, the hemoglobin is potentially very toxic in itself. And so to detoxify this hemoglobin, which would act as an enzyme, just wildly consuming oxygen, the enzyme is there in every injured tissue that tends to bleed or release heme to destroy the heme and turn it into things that can be recycled, such as the iron atom and the carbons from the heme molecule.

**CONTEXT:** So this enzyme has a function in damaged tissue to help mop up the waste products, but in... certain brain situations like we've been describing, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, it's in excess amounts.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, apparently because of chronic stress. And another brain situation in which they find that exactly associated with the problematic cells in the brain, multiple sclerosis in the plaques. They find the increased amounts of the enzyme making carbon monoxide.

**RAY PEAT:** About 20 years ago, I had gotten away from the cancer carbon monoxide connection for several years because I couldn't find anyone willing to listen to the idea that it was such a neat idea to explain how the Warburg cancer theory works. But I came back to it in the 90s, applying it to multiple sclerosis, because the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are very similar to those of multiple sclerosis.

**CONTEXT:** Go ahead and describe them.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, clots tend to form in the brain, and every place there's a clot, the blood vessels become leaky, and our proteins leak out into the brain and are part of the inflammatory process. And the carbon monoxide activates those same processes. Tendency to clot, definite tendency of blood vessels to become leaky and let things inappropriately seep out so that any time you have a situation of leaky blood vessels, injured liver, for example, leaking its enzymes, inflamed muscles leaking enzymes and proteins, heart attack leaking its substances, you find hemoxygenase and carbon monoxide there making the cells more permeable and leaky.

**CONTEXT:** Am I right in thinking that carbon monoxide is actually produced by tumors too?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, yeah. In transplanting a tumor into an animal, they found that it had many toxic effects on the animal. For years they talked about a toxic hormone or a cancer hormone. And in one set of experiments, they gave a chemical to the animal receiving the tumor implant, a chemical that would inhibit hemoxygenase and stop the formation of carbon monoxide, and to stop the toxic effects of the transplant.

**CONTEXT:** So is that for a potential anti-cancer treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are several groups working on it. They can stop cancer growth like for a week at a time with an injection of one of the chemicals that just turns off hemoxygenase, and they're designing many chemicals that will do it, for example, reverse structure RNA molecules that interfere with the production of the enzyme very specifically.

**CONTEXT:** Then this would have possible clinical applications with Alzheimer's and Parkinson as well, then, if it's actually turning off that enzyme.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the degenerative stress-related diseases, cancer and the brain aging. Atherosclerosis and arthritis involves excess carbon monoxide too.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so let's just go back for the benefit of the listeners using, listening to this program right now who perhaps don't have the same kind of scientific background so they can understand a little more about heme oxygenase. You mentioned that this enzyme heme oxygenase is part of our body and every cell has the ability to utilize or break down rather the products of hemoglobin into you mentioned iron and carbon monoxide and then there's a pigment called bilirubin. So this is happening our blood cells are turning over every 90 days and the spleen mops up these blood cells. Constantly breaking down the red blood cell into byproducts like the hemoglobin and carbon monoxide and bilirubin 24-7 so this is the process that is happening in our bodies anyway but what's the mechanism behind which we're protected from the carbon monoxide?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, one design feature is that having it all happen in the spleen keeps it away from your brain and heart and reproductive organs and so on.

**CONTEXT:** What about those people who've perhaps had a splenectomy and it's been taken out or it's been ruptured or damaged so they don't have one?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know exactly what the consequences are, but you would think that it would expose their other tissues more to effects of chronic stress.

**CONTEXT:** What about when someone has like an enlarged spleen? You and are they just able to do that much better? Because usually enlarged spleens are indicating liver disease or other problems.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I imagine that as long as it's confined to the spleen, the main purpose of the organs is to keep it happening somewhere that the carbon monoxide has the chance to diffuse away in the bloodstream before it gets to the organs.

**RAY PEAT:** The main purpose of the talk and this discussion is that we'll get onto that as well in a little while, is that propane, if it's burnt incompletely and the byproducts of that incomplete combustion are carbon monoxide and environmental pollution from traffic exhaust high in carbon monoxide. That's basically what we're looking at.

**CONTEXT:** Smoking, yeah, as another good example of carbon monoxide exposure. And even wood smoke too, right, Dr. Peat?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a bad stove or fireplace can put out a huge amount of carbon monoxide. And even if you have a perfectly adjusted gas stove, if you put a cold pan down on the burner so that the flame touches it, cooling the flame is going to make it release carbon monoxide.

**CONTEXT:** So tell me, you had a recent encounter with somebody, you were consulting with someone and they were lucky enough to get their hands on a good carbon monoxide meter, so just talk about that a little.

**RAY PEAT:** They were all having symptoms and they noticed that they were worse in the winter when the house was tightly closed up and they happened to have access to a very sensitive meter that would measure down to a few parts per million and found that just 15 minutes of having the stove on, the burners were producing 15 parts per million and the oven 29 parts per million, 18 and 29. And it's a matter of how long you keep breathing it, because if it fluctuates then you have a chance to breathe it out as well as breathe it in. And in one particular experiment with rats, they exposed the rats to the supposedly upper safe limit for human exposure, for example, in cities, 50 parts per million. And in just one hour of exposure, the rat's brains were structurally damaged.

**CONTEXT:** So were they getting infarcts or some other kind of damage?

**RAY PEAT:** No, much less. Much less than that, yeah. Small cellular changes.

**CONTEXT:** Right, so it was the beginning of something bad, something worse. And that's what you mentioned is the level in a lot of cities, right? 50 parts per million.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it comes and goes. But they saw permanent changes in prolonged exposure to even lower amounts in the animals, 30 parts per million, for example.

**CONTEXT:** So the average housewife who spends all her time cooking over the stove... No, sorry, that's not the average housewife. It could be exposed to a lot more than healthy levels because gas stoves could be emitting a large quantity of carbon monoxide.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the symptoms are very rarely associated with carbon monoxide poisoning, because that sort of is you traditionally think of the person who's shot himself in a garage with a rubber pipe coming out of the exhaust pipe into the garage, right? Yeah, and for many years, doctors thought only in terms of the blood being saturated with carbon monoxide and not being able to deliver oxygen to the tissues. But the carbon monoxide goes right into all of the tissues, and we've got many, many enzymes that use heme. It isn't just the blood and myoglobin, but for example, the steroids, the enzymes that make steroids use the heme group. And so the most intense symptom of getting your tissue saturated is you poison the energy-producing enzyme. But very moderate amounts of chronic poisoning will shut down your ability to produce steroids so that the testosterone level, for example, falls with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. But interestingly, the adrenal corticosteroids are increased under the stimulation because the adrenals are designed to recognize stress, emergency situation, which carbon monoxide is. But the actual enzymes that produce the bulk of steroids are blocked by carbon monoxide.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Carbavule 91.1 FM. And from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated to this month's topic of carbon monoxide. The number here if you live in the area is 923-3911 or if you live outside the area 1-800-KMUD-RAD. Okay, so we're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat and he's explaining some of the mechanisms behind carbon monoxide poisoning and we're just covering some of the some of the sources of which perhaps we probably haven't really considered that much. So I think the thing with stoves, the cook stoves, I never really, I mean I always recognize the fact that they... a poorly adjusted flame was probably the main cause of carbon monoxide emission from propane burning appliances and that the presence of an orangey type flame rather than a blue or a kind of violet flame was indicative and then soot and that kind of thing, sooty deposits around the nozzle were pretty diagnostic of incomplete combustion but you're saying that if you can put a pan of water, a cold pan of water on the stove... Actually, on the burner, there's sufficient cooling there to cool the flame to the point where there will be incomplete combustion and carbon monoxide generated.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and typically you see a little bit of the flame turning yellow where it hits the pan.

**CONTEXT:** Right, exactly, yeah, I think we've all seen that. But the other point about this carbon monoxide emissions from propane stoves is that people's houses are becoming more and more airtight. I know our house is very airtight, so it's, you know, maybe the older drafty houses a little bit leaking out of your stove, it was diluted with plenty of wind. Plenty of air. So do you think we're going to see more Alzheimer's now, Dr. P, continue with everybody's airtight houses?

**RAY PEAT:** We are seeing, it's just whether or not it's coming from propane stoves or not. The first symptoms are often so light. People just think they have chronic cold or sometimes people get anxious or depressed. Some people have crawling sensations on their skin, muscle cramps, heart arrhythmia. Practically any symptom you can think of, it's well known as a sign of carbon monoxide poisoning, but it's just very rare for anyone to think of it when they have the symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** What about those heaters that you see in a lot of people's houses? Space heaters also. Yeah, that are actually gas-powered heaters. I guess maybe they're more popular in England than they are here.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a lot of people used to have them even without a vent.

**CONTEXT:** Well, these ones in England, people have in their house don't have any vents. It's in the front room, radiating heat.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the same as a gas cooking stove.

**CONTEXT:** Another thing to cover too is the government regulations concerning the presence of carbon monoxide detectors in houses now, I think probably for a few years. It was first things it was smoke detectors and then it was carbon monoxide detectors. Describe briefly, because I've seen the limits and the statutory regulations, government regulations and industry regulations that have set these limits. Just describe them for us a little bit.

**RAY PEAT:** Years ago, I bought one of the cheap meters and was testing it on various things and nothing would register until I put it in the garage with the car running. I left it for, I guess, half an hour and still nothing happened. It wasn't strong enough. I learned that the government requires, or the industry and government, requires that they not sound an alarm unless the concentration is reaching the life-threatening point. So if it's a low level below 50 parts per million, one of the standards says it has to stay at that concentration for 48 hours steadily before the alarm comes down.

**CONTEXT:** And so what would that do to your brain if you had a 50 parts per million steadily for 24 hours? 48 hours?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think they require the alarm to sound after something like 30 to 60 minutes of a 50 part per million concentration. They've got the charts published, but it's definitely not a healthy concentration, but they don't want you bothering the fire department anytime you're just getting a burst of 70 parts per million because it won't kill you soon.

**CONTEXT:** Or complaining to your range manufacturer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** So what about this meter that you said is very very sensitive? What's the name of this meter?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, I have seen it on the internet. I don't know the brand. One company that makes them is Kidde, KIDD.

**CONTEXT:** All right, they're manufacturers of smoke alarms, too. And I think it was their company that had one for three hundred and forty dollars that actually registered down in parts per million, which is exactly useful because...

**RAY PEAT:** And in real time.

**CONTEXT:** You want to know, for example, if you breathe out a healthy person will make less than one part per million exhalation. If they're very sick and under stress, under stress, they might go up to five parts per million just from their internal production. And I know I'm pretty sure we have a call on the line, but let's, let's give it a couple of seconds here because it's not 7:30 yet and I want to make sure that we can keep covering more more material. The thing that struck me earlier when I was looking at some of this was that smoking exposes a smoker to about 500 parts per million carbon monoxide from a cigarette. You're in that little stream, right? So let's, let's try to be comparative here and, um, in terms of incomplete combustion from a propane stove. And you said 28 parts per million for the oven and 18 for the... If you had that concentration of the cigarette in your room air, you would be dead pretty quick.

**RAY PEAT:** At 500 parts per million.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, because you're breathing quarts of air for every puff of smoke.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, so it's very diluted. So what do you think, what would that, I wonder what a quart to a puff would work out as a concentration? Probably 30, 40, 50, somewhere around that.

**CONTEXT:** A bad, so standing around your oven could be just as bad as smoking cigarettes?

**RAY PEAT:** Definitely in some houses, if the oven is not well adjusted.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the thyroid is the essential thing for energizing the burning of any fuel, and if your thyroid function is low, your liver is, in a way, the first organ to feel it, because the liver stores sugar, and if you're wasting energy, your liver fails to store sugar, and becomes inefficient, eventually fibrotic, and so on.

**CONTEXT:** What should I do here?

**RAY PEAT:** The main dietary things that suppress the thyroid function are the polyunsaturated fatty acids, and that's why I've mentioned the importance of saturated fats such as coconut oil and butter and sugar as a way to make your own fat to avoid the dietary oils such as safflower, soy, corn oil and so on, which are anti-thyroid, and fish oil.

**CONTEXT:** So then this would have possible clinical applications with Alzheimer's and Parkinson as well, then, if it's actually turning off that enzyme.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the degenerative stress-related diseases, cancer and the brain aging. Atherosclerosis and arthritis involves excess carbon monoxide too.

**RAY PEAT:** Getting warm lowers the stress hormones and so it gives your body a chance to recover. But if you haven't changed your diet that was causing the problem, then cold weather or other stress will tend to bring back the hypothyroidism.

**CONTEXT:** But isn't it also that the decreased daylight hours, Dr. P, make your thyroid hormone less able to be picked up by your cells?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the mitochondria that I was talking about, the toxic effects of darkness, the thyroid is trying to keep those mitochondria functioning. And during the darkness, the various toxins, including carbon monoxide, interrupt the function of the mitochondrion, and that means it blocks the function of the thyroid. But if you increase your thyroid, you can compensate a little bit for that disruption during the darkness. In animal experiments, they found that removing a rat's thyroid gland, they would have to give four times as much supplement in the winter as in the summer because of the increased stress of the dark days. And when I tested it on myself, it was exactly four times requirement difference according to the season. And if you asked your doctor, they wouldn't recommend that you increase your thyroid medication four times in the winter months versus the summer. So something that you have to follow your own symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** Right. So it's almost as if the thyroid is being wasted on trying to help the mitochondria when you're getting less light, I guess. Like, you're producing a similar amount. It's just being wasted on trying to keep your energy up with these stressors.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it does. It does spend more of the thyroid substance and get it thrown off, but if you have your tissue well saturated with the safe nutrients rather than the dangerous polyunsaturated oils, your mitochondria are much tougher. They've found that you can remove the mitochondria from an animal that hasn't had those unsaturated fats. And mitochondria survive in the test tube much longer and are more vigorous. So it's the polyunsaturated fats that make the mitochondria so susceptible to injury.

**CONTEXT:** Do you think, Dr. Peat, that this is because of the lipid membrane that the mitochondria is surrounded by is made up of saturated oils that don't oxidize like polyunsaturates and that's why they last longer?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, the very structure. You can extract all of the fat from a cell and you still have the mitochondrial structure in shape because it's mostly protein that gives the structure and those proteins are tightly interacting with fats and a lot of those are unsaturated. So if you get too many unsaturated ones, they oxidize and damage the proteins. So it's the mixture of protein and fat.

**RAY PEAT:** Warburg was just using tissues isolated from animals, but Russians were the ones who used whole animals and they would give them a killing dose of gamma rays and if they very quickly within an hour flooded them with red light it inactivated the effects of the radiation. So it wasn't radiation itself, it was a cascade of chemical events that could be interrupted by the red light. And when you get sunburned, part of that cascade of events is the production of carbon monoxide.

**CONTEXT:** All right, so it was olive oil that did tissues, it was experimenting with tissues rather than animals.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, any animal that isn't a ruminant will express in its tissues pretty exactly the balance of fats in its food. And that includes people and pigs and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys. Yeah, but sheep and cows and camels, for example, will produce milk that has almost about 98% of the bad fats have been destroyed by bacteria in their rumens, so that it's 98% monounsaturated or saturated or the trans-fat variations. Conjugated linoleic acid, for example, which is actively being sold as an anti-cancer or weight loss agent, but you find it naturally in butter and milk. And also that would include venison, elk, antelope, mule deer, moose, and all those animals have a fat that congeals at room temperature.

**CONTEXT:** When you see chickens, they have such soft, almost runny fat these days.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, because it's very polyunsaturated because they're eating corn and soy meal. It's the same with pig fat. When my grandmother used it, it was a solid like butter. And even most researchers have been calling it a saturated fat now for 50 years, and a couple years ago someone bothered to analyze it and found that it was 30% PUFA.

**CONTEXT:** Well, we just... And we had some friends who butchered a pig that was fed mostly apples. And vegetables from... And vegetables... From the farm....from their farm, and they had a 70-pound pig. And 30 pounds of it was fat and 40 pounds of it was meat, and it was all solid. So that would be like good quality lard.

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. That's where your lard would come from for baking pastries and other goodness. That's the way to make good eggs, too. Feed them lots of vegetable matter.

**CONTEXT:** Right. Because the sugars will cause the animals to make saturated fat. So you feed your animals your excess fruit in the fall, which is what was happening with this pig. Then they'll tend to make saturated fat out of that sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, thank you for your answers. That's very interesting. Thank you.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, exactly. It's just hard to overcome. For example, a researcher in India noticed that in his area where people eat a lot of butter, alcoholics didn't get hepatitis and cirrhosis and so he did the study with rats and fed them butter and lots of alcohol and they didn't get hepatitis and cirrhosis and a group has been researching that now for about 25 years showing that fish oil and unsaturated vegetable oil interact with a little bit of alcohol to activate iron, causing oxidative damage, liver inflammation and fibrosis. But if you have practically an unsaturated fat-free diet, alcohol is really pretty harmless.

**CONTEXT:** And didn't they do that study in Chicago as well 30 years ago you told me about?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Nanji is the name of the main researcher, Nanji.

**RAY PEAT:** Basically research has shown that if you're eating the unsaturated fatty acids, those go rancid in your bloodstream and damage your arteries and then your body needs to stop that massive free radical reaction where it's consuming oxygen and going rancid and so your body puts a cholesterol bandage over the rancid oil. So Japanese scientists have found when they remove that cholesterol bandage, they find a plaque of oxidized omega-6 oils and there's lots of research showing that this is actually what causes damage to the arteries and it's not at all saturated fats because saturated fats are so stable and would not create a free radical reaction like that.

**RAY PEAT:** Not at all, no, not at all.

**CONTEXT:** Because a lot of people are very afraid to eat butter because they think it's going to clog their arteries. What's the reality?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the same thing that applies to the liver applies exactly to the arteries, except the arteries are the first place that the unsaturated oxidized fats will injure. They come out of your...

**CONTEXT:** I understand that it's bad to do this to the unsaturated fat but why do people think that butter and you know and animal fat is going to clog their arteries?

**RAY PEAT:** Because of 50 years of propaganda from the seed oil industry basically.

**CONTEXT:** So you're basically saying that unsaturated fat will clog your arteries quicker than butter?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, exactly. And when it's when the seed oil industry was unable to sell their oils to the paint companies and that because the paint companies started buying their oils from the petroleum industry, they needed to market their corn and soy oil to to humans because there was no other market for it and that's when Mr. Mazzola would drink a cup of corn oil and say it's great stuff it lowers your cholesterol and he unfortunately died at a very young age of a heart attack. So it caused such an arterial blockage but basically they needed to sell their oils and they boycotted all tropical oils, the palm and the coconut oils which will not cause heart attacks and promoted corn oil and there you have it.

**RAY PEAT:** Now, what about olive oil? Olive oil is only 90 percent um only 10 polyunsaturated and 90 monounsaturated. So it is not going to block your arteries like the other liquid oils, but of course you wouldn't want to use it in excessive amounts because it still is 10 polyunsaturated.

**CONTEXT:** So you're saying the butter is the healthiest or a coconut oil, butter, coconut, palm.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, and saturated fats from animals like beef and lamb.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it takes something that is basically covering the space between you and the source geometrically. Something that is a small area just can't catch a broad emission coming at you. So it's like they have these things called block socks for your cell phone. So the side of your cell phone that has an antenna that radiates to get its signal, if you put that block sock that has this metal barrier next to your body and the phone faces out, then it's not going to be penetrating you the same way as if you didn't have that block sock. Does that make sense?

**CONTEXT:** So I guess just to reiterate, how do we exactly protect ourselves from EMF of the laptop computer then? I'm sorry, I didn't quite follow. I understood the analogy for or cell phone, but I didn't quite understand for a laptop.

**RAY PEAT:** Just think of it as light that's coming from your computer or whatever. And if the light is touching some important part of your body, the rays, whatever they are, microwaves, are going to be following the line of sight. So you need something basically as big as the object emitting to catch the radiation.

**CONTEXT:** I see. OK. So would you suggest it's placing the laptop on a table or a surface and not obviously using it on top of your lap, say on a pillow or something like that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the lap is not a good place to keep a radiant source. Potentially, you see, you could use an external keyboard on your laptop and then put the laptop underneath the table or in a slot like that to block the EMF from the laptop and then use a monitor also connected to your laptop. You could just use your laptop as the processor. And you can get a little EMF monitor and you can see on your laptop it reads danger and six inches away it doesn't pick up any EMF. I mean, that's a real rough crude monitor you can buy at the hardware store. But, you know, keep it as far away from your body as possible.

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated fat activates the production of carbon monoxide. So if someone had Alzheimer's and they're taking fish oil, it's a really bad combination. And it's the kind of thing that I would imagine most of the industry is telling you is good for Alzheimer's and good for chronic obstructive lung disease and things like atrial fibrillation and other cardiovascular disorders.

**CONTEXT:** We have one quick question about horse meat. Is that good or bad?

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on what the horse is eating, but it'll reflect exactly what the horse ate. So it's very likely to be fairly unsaturated unless in some countries they feed them. For example, dates were a major food in Iraq. They would have a very saturated fat if they ate dates.
