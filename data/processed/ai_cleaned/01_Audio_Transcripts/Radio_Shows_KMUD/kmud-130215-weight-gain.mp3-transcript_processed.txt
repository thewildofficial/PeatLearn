**RAY PEAT:** "After I had taught linguistics and English and such for a while, I decided to go to graduate school in biology at University of Oregon. Graduated there with my Ph.D. in 1972, specializing in physiology and biochemistry, especially reproductive physiology. Right after I left university, I worked for a while with a diet company, counseling people in weight loss. So that was 41 years ago."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked to detail his academic and professional career.

**RAY PEAT:** "Basically, you shift over to burning fat rather than sugar. At rest, your brain and red blood cells need sugar, and they'll keep burning it regardless of where they have to get it. If you don't eat enough of the necessary nutrients, your body will convert your muscles... to sugar to keep feeding your brain what it needs. And if you are eating enough sugar or things which can be turned into sugar, then your body doesn't have to break down its own tissues to make the necessary glucose for your blood cells and brain. And in that condition, your muscles, at rest, don't require... practically any glucose. They can do fine on a pure fat diet. But that's the resting muscle. If your muscles are under stress, very intense exercise, the muscles will begin burning almost pure sugar. So it's the massive muscle at rest which will burn fat calories and... leaves the protein for your functioning tissues and sugar to sustain your essential brain and immune system and such."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining the difference between glucose oxidation and fatty acid metabolism, and how stress impacts this.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "So this is why you're an advocate of muscle building because then it helps convert your fat into... well, it helps your body to burn the fat for fuel rather than just using the sugar. And when the muscle is stressed, it... begins actually producing estrogen. When you're building muscle in a safe way, the muscle begins producing testosterone actually right in the muscle, which helps the rest of the body. The heart is one of the main targets of testosterone. So well-developed skeletal muscles are actually... sustaining the heart muscle as well as the brain and the lungs which need the stabilizing anti-inflammatory steroids."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking why Dr. Peat advocates for muscle building and its relation to fat burning and hormone production.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, yeah, everything that tends to kill you shrinks your muscles. The frailty is the basic thing that associates with aging, bones and muscles. Go away at about the same rate of aging."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if muscly people have longer lifespans.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Except when it does that it also needs to make some sugar for your brain and so it breaks down the tissues. The first to go is your thymus, which in just a few hours they used to think that adults didn't have a significant amount of thymus tissue because they looked at people who had died. After being sick, and even if you die slowly after a traumatic accident, your thymus is gone. It just takes a few hours of intense stress for the thymus to be dissolved. And so a long fast will just completely devastate your thymus tissues. It turns into sugar very quickly."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining what happens to the body during starvation or a low-calorie diet, specifically regarding tissue breakdown.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "And the skin is... relatively dispensable too in the long run. So your skin atrophies very quickly with the fast or even a low-calorie diet. And then the muscles go... you can live months on your muscles providing sugar for your brain if necessary, if you have big muscles. But lots of the women that I used to see who were there for a weight-loss diet. You couldn't find a bicep muscle or a calf muscle. They would try to tighten their muscle and they couldn't feel or find anything either in their upper arm or lower leg. The muscle was maybe the size of a person's index finger. So when they would first start eating a good diet, the first thing that would happen would be......pounds of water loss. Their tissue would suddenly come out of the stress condition and get rid of some of the stored water. Then the muscle would start growing. The first week they might lose 10 or 15 pounds of water. Then for about a month they would start putting on weight as their muscles began growing."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is describing the physical changes observed in women undergoing severe dieting and their subsequent recovery with a proper diet.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "There was a study of using radioactive testosterone and they not only saw that the runners' muscles were... atrophied, but comparing them to weightlifters who had developed huge skeletal muscles, with these isotopes they could make a picture of their heart, lungs and brain and so on. All of their tissues had atrophied so that the lean, long-distance runners also had lean, lean, slabby hearts, very thin hearts involved. It's a heart healthy form of exercise. It's a stereotypical picture of health, that kind of Kenyan long distance marathon runner. You know, a lot of things happen. Fertility is often reduced because the testosterone goes down and the very immediate thing that you can see in even fairly low intensity exercise is that the lungs lose some of their ability to diffuse. Oxygen in and carbon dioxide out, the actual substance of the lung air sac thickens with just a fairly moderate amount of continued exercise."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing the physiological effects of long-distance running compared to weightlifting, citing a study.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's a kind of edema, mild inflammation, and sports anemia is a recognized thing. It's a combination of all of those. little stresses and shift away from the anabolic testosterone to the females are always relatively anemic because of the influence of the balance of estrogen relative to the androgens and sports anemia is somewhat like the feminizing effect of estrogen on the blood system."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if the thickening of lung air sacs in runners is an inflammatory process.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, lots of things can interfere with your......high rate of metabolism. Things that suppress your thyroid are the basic most common thing, but anything that can increase your cortisol or even your glucagon can interfere with your metabolism, slow down your metabolic rate. Serotonin, estrogen, for example, both lower your body temperature. And many stresses can increase those, and those tend to increase the glucagon, shift you away from being able to oxidize the glucose and instead depend on fatty acid oxidation."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is responding to a question about predispositions to inefficient glucose oxidation, mentioning PUFAs and cortisol.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "So sluggish digestion could increase estrogen and serotonin, and radiation could increase estrogen and serotonin. One of the ways to get rid of unneeded estrogen by way of the liver excreting it and if your bowel is sluggish you reabsorb it and if your bowel is irritated and sluggish it secretes much more serotonin than needed which affects your whole hormonal system bringing up the stress hormones and contributing to lower temperature."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining how sluggish digestion and other factors can increase estrogen and serotonin, impacting metabolism.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "So eating carrots. With vinegar or lemon juice or just carrots and taking liver herbs like cascara and dandelion root, milk thistle can help with sluggish bowels. Yeah, and just eating what you consider to be the most delicious food can greatly help the intestine secrete more juices so things digest faster and move along more smoothly. So enjoy your food. Yeah."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is offering practical advice for improving digestion and bowel function.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I'm just doing an occasional knee bend. Squatting and standing up again and maybe getting some five pound dumbbells and lifting those in different motions. Just a few lifts, two or three times a day and when you're doing that maybe squat once or twice."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is suggesting gentle muscle-building exercises for a sedentary 60-year-old lady.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, make the muscle know that it's been active. Warm it up a little, but not enough to make you get out of breath or anything."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is commenting on the benefit of strengthening muscles through resistance training in small bursts.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that kind of stress is good for the muscles."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the benefit of basic yoga postures for muscles.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so, and I'm basing that on some studies that were done on plant tissues about 30 or 40 years ago. They found that any kind of tissue put in sunlight or ultraviolet light got some excited free radicals or excited electrons. End. Shining red light on those would just immediately quench those that had been excited, but if you keep living tissue in the dark it starts building up more of those excited electrons over a period of 30 minutes or so you can see an increase in them."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining the benefit of using 250-watt bulbs (presumably red light) before bed and upon waking, referencing studies on plant tissues.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The metabolism has these cycles. The 24-hour cycle is the basic thing, but it is subdivided into roughly 90-minute cycles of ups and downs for the blood sugar and the adrenaline. Everything is mobilized a little bit and if your liver is running short on fuel, the cycles become more intense and the dream cycles go with drops in the blood sugar and surges of the nerve chemicals such as adrenaline."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining the relationship between metabolism, blood sugar, adrenaline, and dreaming cycles.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If your body is well rested from six or eight hours of sleep then the dreams are likely to have a very pleasant quality getting ready to go out and do something. Yeah, it's preparing you to wake up. Yeah as opposed to them. That's pretty cool. As opposed to the nightmares. Yeah as opposed to the 1 a.m. nightmares. Right exactly so that means that your body is really stressed out and it's yeah not getting what it needs."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing the quality of dreams and their relation to stress and rest.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It shows that you're not evaporating very much so in an extremely humid climate that wouldn't be so bad but in a if you're indoors and Have a relative humidity of about 50, then it means that your metabolism is slow and not producing much heat."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining the significance of fluid intake and output in relation to metabolic rate and heat production.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Very healthy like 12 to 15 year old people I burn fuel very wastefully but that's when people are the least likely to die is when they're wasting fuel like crazy so basically when you said least likely to what to die to die around 12 to 15 people are are the healthiest and most resistant to stress."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing the metabolic rate of young people and its relation to health and stress resistance.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If they increase your exposure to serotonin or decrease your adrenaline, they'll slow your metabolic rate and make it harder to burn calories."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining how anti-anxiety and antidepressant drugs can cause weight gain.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, if you use 1% butterfat milk, that's only 400 calories per quart, where whole milk would be almost twice that much. And one of the tricks of orange juice is that there are some good chemicals in it which are anti-estrogenic and some other fruits. Tropical fruits are some of the anti-estrogens are very important for the metabolism as well as the minerals and type of sugar and such."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing the caloric content of milk and the anti-estrogenic properties of orange juice and other tropical fruits.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "And with milk it isn't just the protein but the calcium. It's very important as an anti-inflammatory, anti-stress, anti-depressant and so on. People who eat the same number of calories without milk are much more likely to be fat than the people who are regular milk drinkers."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is highlighting the benefits of milk, including calcium, for reducing inflammation, stress, and depression, and its role in weight management.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "In Russia and the Slavic countries in general, I found that there was really no reliably good milk in the cities. And the people all had bad teeth and were fat. Food was very cheap, but milk was scarce. Probably proteins in general weren't as cheap as the average food. But crossing over the border into Finland, it was very impressive to see how many stores had displays of cheese in the window. And the people were all healthy looking and slender compared to the other side of the border."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is sharing his observations on the health and appearance of people in Russia and Finland, relating it to milk and cheese consumption.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It stimulates your metabolism and suppresses the stress hormones. Whereas 400 calories from baked potato and rice would......increase your stress hormones and suppress your metabolism."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is comparing the metabolic effects of calories from orange juice versus baked potatoes and rice.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and then there's the matter of the starch particles that if you don't have some saturated fat with them, the starch particles can set up a whole pattern of stress and injury by entering your bloodstream, which people taking supplements should... Be very careful to avoid anything with particles such as titanium dioxide or silica. Those are very allergenic particles that are in all supplements, practically. Yeah, and those things getting into the bloodstream trigger the stress hormones, and obesity is the least of the things they contribute to."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is warning about the potential for starch particles, especially without saturated fat, to cause stress and injury, and advises caution with supplements containing allergenic particles.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on how you respond to the cold. Some people... steam up the windows of the bedroom so the window runs water down and collects at the bottom of the window sill in the morning. Those are people who lose a lot of weight by evaporation during the night. You can see the water collecting on the cool surfaces. And people in warmer climates are warmer so their metabolism stay up during the night. And they probably are thinner because of that, right, Dr. B?"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining how body temperature and evaporation during sleep relate to weight loss.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "When your body temperature drops in the night, because you're slowing it down to resist the stress, but if you reach a certain temperature, you turn on the inflammatory stress-producing hormones and so you get not only the darkness but the cold extremities causing stress. So it's better to be comfortable if you're actually trying to shed weight is better to be comfortable at night, correct?"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is elaborating on the impact of body temperature and stress hormones on weight management during sleep.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If your feet reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit they're producing toxic stress inducing substances. So don't run around barefoot with cold feet."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is providing a specific temperature threshold for feet that indicates stress production.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It varies with the person but you should try to avoid the things that affect your metabolism harmfully like starches and polyunsaturated fats or and some some plant materials are toxic like but otherwise just want to appeal to eat whole grains like brown rice and millet uh no there's almost nothing of value in those even if it's if it's not processed i don't mean like white rice uh well uh the white rice is relatively free of irritants and toxins but it has very little of food value in that a lot of vitamins and fiber and things that were good for you not compared to like say orange juice."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing what constitutes "delicious food" and advising on foods to avoid, while also commenting on the nutritional value of white rice compared to orange juice.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I mean if you're trying to lose weight and I wouldn't recommend you eat ice cream, but if you're You're not trying to lose weight. You're happy with your weight and you're having trouble sleeping. It can help a lot of people."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing the role of ice cream for those not trying to lose weight but experiencing sleep difficulties.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Milk contains a good balance all in itself because it has some some fat some protein and some sugar."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining why milk is a good food combination, contrary to the idea that milk and sugar are a bad combination.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Many juices are are good it's the minerals and antioxidants as well as the sugar that are important but grapefruit juice for example has a chemical that causes your liver to increase estrogen in the body. Oh no, I don't mean grapefruit juice. I'm thinking of apricot juice, peach juice, berry juice, grape juice, those kinds. Grape juice is very good as long as you consider the calories. It has more concentrated calories than orange juice. Some tropical fruits... are very good. Guava, for example. Uh-huh. Mango? Uh, carrot juice is another one that should be avoided except in small amounts because of the high carotene content. It's very metabolically suppressive. Oh, it is. It antagonizes both thyroid and progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing the benefits of various fruit juices, highlighting grapefruit juice's estrogen-increasing effect and advising caution with carrot juice due to its metabolically suppressive properties.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Milk, cheese, and some of the fruit juices are the best things."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is answering a question about what is good for thyroid function and metabolism.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The 400 calories of brown rice is going to be much more metabolically suppressive than the 400 calories from fruit juice."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is comparing the metabolic impact of calories from brown rice versus fruit juice.
