**RAY PEAT:** "I studied physiology at the University of Oregon for several years, 1968 to 72. The circulatory system wasn't my main interest, but I ran across interesting work done in the 1940s by one of my science heroes, Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, who happened to be studying the effects of estrogen and progesterone on the heart of animals and blood vessels. And his work exactly matched what I was doing in animal aging and the effects of those same hormones. So I was interested in the circulatory system as it relates to the endocrine system especially."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat for a brief description of his background.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It's the standard thing that gets into the news or the science journals or the universities. It's strongly influenced by the giant corporate interests and estrogen happens to be a very profitable thing, multi-billions of dollars per year, so they can control the public perception of the hormones in their interest. Part of the idea of selling estrogen as a beneficial thing was that women live longer than men, and since they were selling estrogen as the female hormone, they said that it must be estrogen that accounts for why women live longer and have lower incidence of heart disease before menopause. So at one point, they actually did a trial of giving estrogen to men, and when they started having more heart attacks, they stopped the experiment, but that didn't kill the idea that estrogen is heart protective, and so for 50 years, they carried on promoting the idea of giving estrogen to women to protect their heart until the Women's Health Initiative results came out with women having more heart attacks on the estrogen trial."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the misleading advertising surrounding estrogen's supposedly positive effects.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "There's only one product, one substance, that really has the effects of progesterone. And just about anything that is interfering with the use of oxygen has estrogenic effects. Several extracts of soot were demonstrated to be estrogenic, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very estrogenic. Even cyanide has some estrogenic effects, or putting a plastic bag over an animal's head or irradiating any part of the animal with x-rays or gamma rays is estrogenic, so the concept of estrogen is something very easily brought to market in a product where progesterone is one single molecule that can't be imitated exactly with any alteration."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks why they didn't start with progesterone instead of estrogen.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The fact that it should extract estrogenic mutants that you can produce for less than one cent per dose if you want to. Where progesterone has to be exactly duplicated. For years they were extracting it from the corpus luteum of sow ovaries and it took tons of ovaries to produce a few grams of progesterone. So they found how to manufacture it from plant steroids that were closely similar in structure. Like wild yam and trillium and other herbal products. With a few chemical alterations, they could become exact copies of the progesterone molecule. But since no one could patent that one substance, they introduced small changes, making it no longer progesterone, but they said it was close enough to progesterone. But it would be better than progesterone because they had a patent on it and could advertise it and they devised tests that had something in common with the real progesterone molecule, a certain change in cells of the uterus, but that let them call it a progestin or progestogen. Because it had something in common with progesterone, but they implied that it supported gestation. But, in fact, these were the chemicals that were the basis for the birth control pill because they prevented gestation. So, really, they should be called anti-progestins."

**CONTEXT:** The host inquires about the price difference in manufacturing estrogen versus progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the manufacturing process and cost of estrogen versus progesterone.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Any tissue that's injured will begin producing its own estrogen, so the idea that a woman is estrogen deficient at menopause is just a complete fabrication. Someone was measuring the estrogen manufactured in a monkey's ovary, and to measure the change from the blood going in to the blood coming out of the ovary, as a control, they measured the blood going into the arm and the blood coming out of the arm of the same monkey, and found that the monkey's arm was producing more estrogen than the ovary. And since women at menopause still have their arms and legs, there's no way that they're going to have a decrease in the basic estrogen. So there's another medical myth that we've been told, is that in the menopause you're suffering from lack of estrogen when in fact you're suffering from a lack of progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the common medical myth of estrogen deficiency at menopause.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that has been demonstrated and published, but in books rather than journals. The journals are so controlled by the industry that you get real science in. In a lot of books, it never gets into the medical indexes or journals. Or at medical school, people are not taught what the research is showing."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the lack of progesterone at menopause and its scientific backing.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I compared the biological abstract publications or the chemical abstracts on topics related to medicine to the Index Medicus, which was the print forerunner of PubMed, and found that typically even the most important things took 20 years before they were mentioned in Index Medicus. After they were already in a generally accepted scientific existence, and the first mention in the medical literature was generally that it was not a valid medical concept, and like Vitamin E medical journals for several decades were saying it was a very dangerous substance and shouldn't be taken."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the slow pace of medical research adoption.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the very recent articles on that topic I concluded that Estrogen causes sudden death, sudden cardiac death, and progesterone prevents it. And what they were talking about was the arrhythmia caused by prolonging the excited phase of the heart action. And the electrocardiogram has several phases. The last phase of that is called the repolarization wave, or the T wave. And when that has repolarized the cell, the cell is ready for a good, strong next beat. But if it is delayed by staying in the excited state too long, the atrium might send a signal for a new beat. And if it superimposes on that excited state, the cell can't recover enough to have a proper full beat, so it'll have a slight premature convulsive movement, but not an effective pumping stroke unless it has fully repolarized. Estrogen is the basic thing that tends to extend the excited state. It's similar to what happens in epilepsy during periods of greatly excessive estrogen. The brain cells can't get out of the excited state and there's an epileptic seizure. Progesterone prevents that by quickly accelerating the restoration of the readiness state or the relaxed state of the nerve. The same thing in the heart muscle or skeletal muscle, any kind of cell that's excited is quickly restored by either progesterone or thyroid. Both of them have the energy restoring effect in slightly different ways. The thyroid increases the energy production needed to relax the nerve or muscle. Progesterone stabilizes the relaxed state so that it can hang on to the energy produced by thyroid. Where estrogen interferes with both of those processes, slowing the action potential is what they call the excited state electrically."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to explain the physiological interactions that cause muscle contraction and how estrogen and progesterone affect arrhythmias.

Where estrogen interferes with both of those processes, slowing the action potential is what they call the excited state electrically."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of thyroid hormone in muscle relaxation and how it relates to progesterone.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "When the cell is in its excited state, besides the electrical changes that are being measured, many other properties of the cell are changed. For example, one of the immediate obvious effects of estrogen excess is that cells take up more water or release water more slowly. So, in this one second or fraction of a second state of excitation of nerve or muscle, the cell momentarily takes up a little bit of water, swells up a little bit. And then as it relaxes, it squeezes the water out. And so if you are having the premature contraction and not letting it relax fully, the cell is actually getting a little waterlogged with each of these false beats. And that's an effect that estrogen has on every place that it acts, whether it's pituitary, uterus. Breast tissue or heart or nerve, it's causing a slight waterlogging and swelling of that cell."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the cellular effects of estrogen excess beyond electrical changes.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the differences between heart failure in women and in men is that the diastolic relaxation phase is more often defective or obviously defective in women and in that poor diastolic relaxation the cells become progressively more waterlogged and unable to relax and in that over-hydrated state, they also can't get rid of the calcium that comes in when the water enters, and so it ultimately can lead to actual calcification of the heart. There was a picture published by the Mexican Heart Institute of a very old woman's calcified heart that looked somewhat like a bone and there was a famous story, a 19th century story about someone who was cremated and had a limestone heart. I think the idea for the story came because people actually do get such highly calcified hearts, but it's really the end stage of that chronic over-hydration, over-excited inability to relax. And this is all principally because the calcium is being taken up and deposited in the tissues."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if estrogen's effects on waterlogging and blocking progesterone are why women in the HRT trial had heart attacks.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, there have been a lot of theories about that. I suspect that the fact that estrogen increases the carbon monoxide in tissue probably overlaps with the high chronic exposure to carbon monoxide of smokers. Okay. Let me think now. The air pollution carbon monoxide is highly associated with increased heart events and hospitalizations for heart attacks."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the link between oral contraceptive use, smoking, and increased incidence of stroke and heart attack.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "There are a lot of things other than the electrical property of the heart or the hydration. There are a lot of things other than the blood volume is one of the factors. For example, high estrogen women are susceptible to varicose veins ultimately, or before that, just swelling or distension of the veins. For example, putting your hand straight down, sometimes the veins on the back of the hand swell up, and the legs tend to do that. A high estrogen phase of the menstrual cycle, and when the veins in the legs are distended, much of the body's blood supply is in the legs, and so it isn't coming back to the heart at the normal speed. And this means that in that condition, if the woman stands up and her blood tends to fall into her legs, there will suddenly be a smaller return to the heart, so that the heart doesn't have very much blood to beat, so it has fast little strokes, because the blood simply isn't being returned. And so that situational arrhythmia or tachycardia is not necessarily connected to the electrical instability, but simply to the way the blood isn't getting sent back to the heart. But that, again, is linked to high estrogen causing the veins to descend and to swell up."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about restoring normal heart contractions and what factors are involved besides electrical properties and hydration.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, progesterone increases the smooth muscle tone in the wall of the veins, and so if your progesterone is deficient, the veins bulge with a very slight pressure on them. Just like holding your hand, if you hold your hand at your waist, if your progesterone and other things are right, you won't see your veins. But if you're low in progesterone or under stress, even at waist level, you're likely to see bulgy veins. So there you go, women. There's a good way to see if you're aging or under stress is if your veins on the back of your hands are bulging at waist level. I frequently look at our clients and analyze what the veins on the back of their hands look like at that level to see how well their body is responding to supplementation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of progesterone in vein tone.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Prostaglandins being an inflammatory mediator causing kind of vasoconstriction is actually relieved by progesterone and both in angina and myocardial infarct, progesterone is a pretty important compound if it can be got to a patient in a very short order because it will actually restore this system. It's very much like cortisol as an anti-inflammatory inhibiting the many different kinds of inflammation promoting things with prostaglandins are probably the most important ones for people who eat quite a bit of unsaturated fat but it doesn't have the harmful side effects of taking cortisol or the synthetic glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatories."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of prostaglandins in heart attacks and if progesterone can relieve them.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, they both stop the inflammatory process which leads to tissue damage and the brain is more sensitive in many ways than the heart. There has been research going on now for several years showing that if you can get a big dose of progesterone to someone who has had a potentially fatal head injury, they will have a high survival and recovery rate because the progesterone stops the progression of brain damage. It does the same thing to any tissue that is injured. It stops the progression by reducing inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if progesterone and aspirin work similarly by blocking prostaglandins in the event of a heart attack.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It's estrogen dominance or a poor ratio, a poor ratio of estradiol to progesterone. So even if the progesterone is maybe fake progesterone in the form of birth control, that can lead to the heart palpitations you're discussing?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if estrogen dominance or low estrogen typically causes palpitations.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of the synthetic progestins so-called in birth control or others actually have some protective effect. There's one called drospirinone that is probably the closest to natural progesterone that they've come up with in function and it's being used to treat heart failure for example where natural progesterone would be the best overall treatment but this is a patented drug that is now being accepted because it opposes the pro-inflammatory effects of aldosterone the salt regulating steroid hormone which progesterone is the natural antagonist of that but this synthetic is a very relatively safe drug for protecting the heart against failure and fibrosis and inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if synthetic progesterones in birth control can lead to heart palpitations.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, just the presence of an irritant in the uterus will lower your natural progesterone and so even if it's releasing a progesterone I think it's likely that the effect is by reducing your ovaries natural production and over time my body should begin to produce natural progesterone again."

**CONTEXT:** The host describes experiencing palpitations after a Mirena IUD and asks if the body will eventually produce natural progesterone again.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "As soon as the irritation stops and if your diet and everything else are good It'll recover quickly."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the recovery of natural progesterone production after IUD removal.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The graded raw carrot is they're basically to mop up excess bowel estrogen so and other toxins yeah and other waste products so it does have a very real effect in lowering excess hormone from the bowel."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the function of graded raw carrot.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It's very absorbable, right? Yes if you stick your finger in it and if you're familiar with the taste of progesterone in about a minute you can taste the progesterone same idea as putting DMS. Oh on your skin the progesterone Just goes right through so that you couldn't get get the systemic effect pretty quickly through your skin. Right. I've rubbed on a lady who had heart failure, I've rubbed olive oil on her arm and then I rubbed progesterone, probably about a teaspoon of progesterone, which had about 90% vitamin E and 10% progesterone. And within half an hour, the veins on the back of her hands were completely flattened. And to start with, they were very elevated. So it definitely gets absorbed into the skin pretty quickly. It's just quantity and quality. Quantity of how much you use and the quality of the product."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the absorbability of progesterone cream through the skin.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "There are several things that will start that process towards hypertension and inflammation and degeneration. Low blood sugar is enough to start the process of signaling your kidneys to send out renin and starting the process to produce aldosterone. Not eating enough salt is another thing that raises the aldosterone. If your blood vessels leak for any reason, if something makes them permeable such as hyperventilating, you lose a little blood volume and anything that lowers your blood volume or sugar or sodium will cause your kidneys to activate the process that ends up increasing aldosterone. And the aldosterone has the central function of making you not lose sodium so fast. Keeping the sodium inside your bloodstream helps the blood to absorb water so that it doesn't form edema. It stays in the circulatory system, nourishing the tissues. But the side effects of that essential regulatory aldosterone, the side effect is to lose, instead of losing sodium, you lose potassium and magnesium. And the loss of potassium and magnesium are very important in causing the heart rhythm problem. The repolarizing restorative process of the heart muscle means that the cell can retain magnesium and potassium and excrete the excitatory sodium and calcium. And so if you're restricting salt, or having hypoglycemia, or losing blood volume for any reason, your aldosterone is going to tend to make you lose the stabilizing magnesium and potassium, and all of your cells will tend to become unstable electrically and functionally."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the renin-angiotensin system and aldosterone's role in hypertension and inflammation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Protein deficiency is another thing that will start this whole process. And salt deficiency? Protein, salt... Sugar. Sugar. Yeah. Hypoglycemia."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about other factors that can initiate the process leading to aldosterone imbalance.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Low thyroid is the main cause of that inappropriate loss of sodium. Hospitals don't seem to realize how important that loss is. Sodium loss problem is, especially in older people, but under the influence of estrogen it happens too."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses lupus, seizures, sodium loss, and thyroid function.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I know from my research that the seizures that go along with lupus, catamenial epilepsy, go along with low progesterone or low estrogen. It's my own assessment that it's low progesterone, but I just had my blood drawn a couple days ago. I'm finishing my menstrual cycle right now, but I had a regular sodium level. And so it seems like maybe cerebral salt wasting was what was going on."

**CONTEXT:** The host shares her personal experience with lupus and seizures, relating it to progesterone levels.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the best thing is to start with Pregnenolone, using it orally, because that will normalize. It can produce testosterone, DHEA, as well as progesterone, and so it will tend to keep your hormones more in balance than applying big doses of progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about treating varicose veins in men and if rubbing progesterone on the skin is too drastic.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Pregnenolone. And you can find it at... where are you calling from color? I'm just outside of Redway, a little bit. Okay, yeah, so at Chautauqua they'll have pregnenolone. Menolone. Pregnenolone, and it's a precursor for all of our steroid hormones. Oh, okay, okay. All right, great. Okay, just to make sure that you heard the name, it's preg, as in pregnant, pregnenolone. Preg, oh, okay. Yeah, P-R-E-G-N-E-N-O-L-O-N-E. Okay. So it's a found in men and women, it's made from cholesterol. From our liver so it's a very common hormone in everybody."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on the name of the supplement mentioned.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Your taste and craving would be the best way to judge because everything affects your thyroid hormone. If your thyroid is a little bit low You need lots more sodium in your food. If your thyroid function is good, you can get along with a very low sodium intake and not have any problem. The reason women tend to have salt cravings around ovulation or premenstrually or in pregnancy is because of the excess of estrogen and low thyroid or low progesterone. Causes them to lose sodium. But if your thyroid and hormones are good, you don't have to worry at all about adding salt to your food."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the recommended daily sodium intake for a 155-pound, 42-year-old male.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Okay, Michael, so it's all about your tastes. And also, too, if you're having a comprehensive metabolic panel done, you'll see a sodium level on there, and sometimes if people are not sure how much they should be eating and not eating enough. They're not really craving it. Sometimes it can be low even in that sort of situation. And on that same test the albumin works with the sodium and thyroid to regulate the volume of your blood and therefore all of these functional energy electrical systems."

**CONTEXT:** The host elaborates on judging sodium intake based on taste and blood tests.
