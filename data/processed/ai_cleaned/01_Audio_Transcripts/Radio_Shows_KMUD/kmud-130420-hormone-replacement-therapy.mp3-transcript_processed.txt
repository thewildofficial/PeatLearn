**RAY PEAT:** As a kid, I was interested in science, but I would read old medical books and encyclopedias and such, and I very early got the impression that education was largely indoctrination. I found that literature as an undergraduate was a field where I could see the actual evidence, the material that we were studying without interpretation of the professors. It was years and years later that I finally decided to go to graduate school in science when I realized that I could get through it without having to fight with the professors. I could just be quiet and do what I wanted to do. So, I enrolled at the University of Oregon in the biology department, starting as a specializing in nerve biology. I was interested in how the brain could do things like handling language and images and such. I saw that the whole direction of the brain biology was towards a very reductionist computer analogy. Looking around the department, I saw that the other end of the organism, the reproductive physiology, was much more scientific, so I shifted over to that specialization. My professor, if I would get unusual results, would say, "Well, if it's repeatable, just go ahead." But in the nerve biology section, if the results or the interpretation were a little off, it really happened; you had to throw away the evidence. Talk in terms of indoctrination and the models that were so popular then and probably still are now. When I was studying, the whole receptor-ligand interaction was just dogmatic: a particular compound elicited a particular effect when it was bound to an enzyme or to a cell.

**CONTEXT:** Could you elaborate on the historical shift in understanding estrogen's function and the role of the receptor model?

**RAY PEAT:** Surrounding estrogen, the estrogen receptor, you actually have a very good understanding of the background enzymatically how it was before it was taken over by, and unfortunately, I know it sounds like another conspiracy, but it's the truth. In terms of pre-1940s, the people studying enzyme interactions were then effectively taken over by big pharma and corporate manufacturers for the want of increased sales of their products. The whole estrogen receptor is a bit of a, a bit of a non-entity, I understand. Yeah, it was 1970 when I was working on my dissertation, and I was studying the metabolism of the uterus in aging animals and trying to understand why in middle age infertility came about. The particular metabolic studies that I was doing corresponded to increased estrogenic stimulation with aging. That led me, since all of the current textbooks in the 1960s were saying that menopause is when the ovaries wear out and stop producing estrogen, so I read way back to 1900 and up to the 1940s and 50s. I saw there was a sudden change in 1942. All through the 1930s, when my thesis advisor was a student, into the 1940s, his thesis advisor was Richard Landau, who was a professor of biology at the University of Washington Medical School. Soderwald and Landau were among the people who were studying the effects of excess estrogen on the uterus. They showed that if you gave a greater dose, increasing amounts of estrogen caused miscarriage at earlier stages. The smallest dose would cause miscarriage at a very early stage, and if you waited until very late in the pregnancy, it would take a bigger dose, but it was a very continuous graded effect in which a slight excess of estrogen would be sufficient to kill the developing embryo. This was going on all through the late 1930s into the 1940s. The hormones of the ovary were identified in the mid-1930s as the very major substance produced in the ovary was progesterone, and estrogen was a minor substance. But it turned out that other people doing research on how estrogen worked at this time saw that soot, just put a spoon in a candle flame and then extract it in a solvent, you could get hundreds of different estrogenic substances out of just soot. And this was wonderful for the drug industries because everyone could find an estrogen to patent. But there was only one natural progesterone, and so that was not a viable drug because no one had a patent on it. So by 1942, the 13 major estrogen companies had their synthetic estrogens. The situation scientifically was that estrogen caused infertility, it was associated with aging, but since they had products, they said, "Here we have the female hormone, and being female means being able to have babies." So estrogen must be what causes women to have babies, and they wanted to sell it for some popular use so they could sell it to millions of women. They came up with the idea that it would prevent miscarriage, even though the science said the opposite. They got a team, a man and wife, at Harvard to promote the idea that diethylstilbestrol (DES) – DES, which is just awful – would prevent miscarriages. They were prescribing it for years to women to prevent miscarriage and to make a healthier baby and so on. It turned out, well, probably they never would have had to stop selling it, even though it was causing cancer and deformity. But about the same time, it was getting recognized that DES causes cancer and doesn't prevent miscarriage but actually increases the risk. They were getting interested in it for a new project to sell to even more women: the birth control pill. So when they decided that the time was right in the 1940s, they didn't want their drug company known as the abortion producer. But by 1959 or 60, abortion was becoming a, contraception was becoming acceptable, but still abortion was a taboo. So they invented a story saying that if you take estrogen, it will suppress your body's estrogen and prevent miscarriage by lowering your estrogen. So they came out with the contraceptive, so-called abortion pill, just as it was recognized that DES was causing miscarriages and cancer. So they lost one product, but immediately came out with another falsified story to sell the birth control pills.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the receptor dogma. What is the truth behind whether or not estrogen binds to a specific receptor, and what were the lies surrounding the science produced to support the estrogen industry?

**RAY PEAT:** These people who were doing the real science were trying to explain why estrogen had these toxic effects. They thought that natural estrogen was imitated by these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soot, which were famous and recognized as carcinogens, and estrogen was known to be carcinogenic. They were studying the properties of soot and estrogen and finding that given estrogenic properties, the substance was also tending to produce inflammation and cancer. So it was a very close association electronically in the nature of the molecule. These were activating enzyme systems in particular ways according to the exact nature of that inflammatory, carcinogenic, estrogenic electronic configuration. This was reaching a peak in the 1950s, and the government moved some of their investment from chemical warfare into endocrine research. The opinion of many people is that the intention was to use it for population control. The Nazis had been using estrogen on people in slave camps and such. But the U.S. government got very interested in estrogen after the Second World War and gave a big grant to a group who, it's an ongoing tradition of a group associated with the University of Chicago, Michigan, and Lawrence Livermore Radiation Lab and UC Berkeley. The project that was funded for Elwood Jensen was the leader of it. He had been working in chemical warfare and wanted to create a new idea for how estrogen worked that would not involve all of this interesting chemistry which explained why estrogen was a very intense toxin and carcinogen. He wanted to say that all it does is activate the female genes. That women are characterized by having a uterus and breasts, and the function of these is governed by their genes, their female genes, and these genes are activated in their particular organs by an estrogen somehow turning a switch that would only activate those female genes and not involve all of this nasty chemistry of cancer and inflammation. But they knew that soot caused cancer in the late 1800s from the chimney sweeps. But that was exactly what Jensen wanted people to forget. Just forget all of this enzymology and chemistry that people have been working on, which in such elegant ways showed the similarities of the carcinogens and estrogens. But he wanted to say that it's like a lock and key: the female organs have a very specific lock, and the estrogen is a key that sticks only into that lock. Estrogen receptors are now known to be found all throughout the body, right? And in men. And in men. There you go. But no one was, at that time, the real science was thinking of the whole cell and the whole organism as the responsive unit to things like estrogen. He was arguing that there was just one little switch molecule in the cell which would neatly turn on only the female genes, and so it wouldn't have the possibility of these other actions. The Defense Department funded, well, the Atomic Energy Commission gave him permission to use radioactive isotopes and supplied the isotopes, and other labs, his competition didn't have either the grants or the isotopes. They were very tightly controlled by the Atomic Energy Commission, and he labeled estrogen and found that it concentrated in organs like the uterus. End. Since the enzymologists were saying that it affects the whole energy system of the organism and the cell, changing the oxidation-reduction processes and participating in the chemistry of the cell, he labeled two different kinds of estrogen, put the labels in two different places, and added them to the uterine tissue and said that there was no interchange between the two, there were no oxidative reactions in which estrogen participated. He published that, I think it was 1962, and the enzymologists had been, the whole thing was based on estrogen participating as a chemical reactant. And he had the only means by which to demonstrate what he claimed, so his opponents didn't have the grants or the isotopes to challenge that, to disprove it. Because the research up until that point had been showing that estrogen causes cancer, but the drug companies, after 1942, wanted to sell the oral contraceptive pill, they wanted to sell DES, which is known to have caused cancer for generations later, and the babies of the mothers who took it, and now HRT. So they were talking about three different majorly used drugs that they knew caused cancer, and doctors are still prescribing them today. Some of the particular enzymes involved in cancer and estrogen function were well known to the enzymologists, but Elwood Jensen's group said, "No, they don't use the fancy isotope as a demonstration to say, no, they don't participate, they're not oxidized and reduced." But 10 or 15 years later, after the receptor dogma had been imposed on the world of biology, other people started using isotopes and showing that, yes, the older enzymologists were exactly right. Estrogen does participate as a catalyst in enzyme reactions, especially transhydrogenation reactions that connect energy production to gene turnover and cell growth and so on.

**CONTEXT:** So, how does estrogen initiate cancer cells?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it allows the energy to be short-circuited over into the growth rather than the function. So the cell stops functioning and doing its normal cellular functioning, and just the estrogen turns on the cell growth processes. Yeah, it drains the energy right out of function into growth.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed estrogen's role in cancer. What about other hormones like serotonin and melatonin, and their connection to estrogen and overall health?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen is related to asthma too, and the effect of the serotonin is to cause localized contraction of the tubes in your lungs, as well as causing them to take up water and promote some inflammation, but the contraction is the thing that's best studied in connection with asthma.

**CONTEXT:** A caller mentioned taking 5-HTP for depression, asking if it's beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** The Prozac-type drugs keep the platelets and nerve cells from binding and keeping serotonin out of the way, so they lead to overexposure to the serotonin. Are you familiar with 5-HTP? That's what you get at the health food store. That's supposed to be like an amino acid, or... Yeah, plain tryptophan is bad enough, but the 5-hydroxy tryptophan is one step closer to being serotonin. So you think that it's not good for me to take it? Everything that I know suggests that, for example, there's increased risk of breast cancer and obesity and many bad effects. How can it increase obesity? By slowing metabolism and suppressing thyroid. 5-HTP does that? The antidepressants? Well, no, I don't mean the... I don't mean like Prozac. I'm just talking about 5-HTP. The antidepressants, the amino acids... Well, it hasn't been studied as much as the antidepressants, but it works to raise your serotonin. It's basically providing you the precursor, and your body makes more serotonin out of it. So, the effects of serotonin in excess are going to be increasing estrogen, which slows your liver's metabolism, that can slow your thyroid down, that can lead to obesity, it can promote, by increasing estrogen, it can promote cancer, and... It says it elevates your mood. Well, you have to, you have to weigh it up. It might make, elevate your mood, but you also risk these other things. I mean, they used to give x-rays to help with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Oh, whoops-a-daisy. Uh, sorry, you got cancer. My aunt had a lot of x-ray treatment for her acne on her back, and she had a terrible form of breast cancer. Ooh! Which turned into bone cancer, and she died at the age of 50. Well, I certainly don't want to slow my metabolism or my thyroid down or any of that. Um, uh, you know, I've done with the menopause thing, so I figure my estrogen has balanced itself out, and I've never taken the replacement. It seems like he's not talking about how it became so outrageously popular for women with menopause, the little pink pills, the HRT, you know, hormone replacement therapy that everybody was taking because they didn't like having hot flashes and, you know, other things that went with, you know, mood swings and menopause symptoms. But my approach was that it was a natural occurrence, and so it didn't really need to be medically changed. I didn't feel I had a symptom that was bad enough that I needed medical intervention. Maybe I was just lucky and I had mild symptoms, although I did have a lot of hot flashes. But it was only in the last maybe four or five years that it's been suggested that I take this 5-HTP as if it was like on rest. I mean, I don't need to increase my serotonin if it's going to slow down my thyroid and up my estrogen and be bad for my heart valve. That's right. So, that's all the things that he said it did, right? Yeah, and it's not, again, because Dr. Peat has spent his life researching things and doing research on even the articles, is this faulty science? Is this promoted by a drug company who did this research? When he says that, it's not him saying that as though it's his own opinion, he's adopted that opinion from researching the evidence. Okay, well, I just want to say again that I'm not talking about the Prozac or the Zoloft or the pharmaceutical serotonin drugs. I'm specifically talking about 5-HTP, which you get at the health food store, where it seems like it's this benign thing that can't hurt you. No, but it's all part of the same system. Yeah, sure, Prozac might increase your serotonin to a much higher degree than taking 5-HTP, but it's all working on that same system, and if a little bit is that the body naturally produces in the bowel, because your bowel wall naturally produces serotonin, if a little bit is stimulating inflammation and degeneration, then you wouldn't want to increase that, even through natural means.

**CONTEXT:** A caller reported their asthma completely resolved after stopping SSRIs and asked if serotonin is related to asthma.

**RAY PEAT:** Several things related to asthma. Estrogen is related to asthma too, and the effect of the serotonin is to cause localized contraction of the tubes in your lungs, as well as causing them to take up water and promote some inflammation, but the contraction is the thing that's best studied in connection with asthma.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the different types of estrogen, can you explain their impact and how they are metabolized?

**RAY PEAT:** There are probably a dozen important types of estrogen, but almost all of them, the three main types, estriol, estrone, and estradiol. Those are the best known and have been used as drugs. Those all have pretty much the same effects, but just at different potencies, so that if you can turn your most potent estradiol into the others, you're protected against some of the most toxic effects of estrogen. During pregnancy, enzymes are detoxifying estrogen by many different routes, but the index of a healthy pregnancy is when the estriol is high because that means you're destroying your estradiol very quickly. So the estradiol is the most dangerous form, and that's usually what I recommend women have tested to make sure their most dangerous form is not too high. And these different forms are exactly the issue that Elwood Jensen denied happened. He said estradiol can't turn into estrone and estriol. But, in fact, that's a major way of either activating or inactivating estrogen, according to the cell's energy system. So the only reason you'd want high estriol is because that would tell us that the estradiol is being detoxified, not that high estriol in itself is protective in any way, shape, or form. Yeah, it's about ten times weaker than estrogen. So every little bit of estradiol that you turn to estriol, it's a down-stepping of your estrogen effect.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on modern birth control methods like the pill or NuvaRing, and their safety?

**RAY PEAT:** The tremendously decreased the amount of estrogen in the contraceptives, but if it's strong enough to kill the embryo, it's strong enough to do some damage to the woman. About 30 years ago, there was quite a bit of agitation among women's groups for FDA approval of the traditional cervical cap, which the ideal thing was made by a metal worker or a dentist with a metal casting outfit. They would use a dental mold-making material to get an exact impression of the cervix, and then they would cast silver or gold or some inactive metal in the shape of the cervix, and it would form a vacuum seal, and it could be used, could be left in place for weeks at a time. Under the pressure from the women's groups, the FDA gave its approval to a rubber so-called cervical cap, which was actually shaped more like a baby bottle's nipple with a huge projection chamber on the end, which was supposed to be filled with spermacidal goo. That immense structural projection caused it to almost instantly be displaced, and so they were terribly unsuccessful, which is like a way of inserting a spermacidal cream or jelly. But the FDA approved that but wouldn't approve the one that actually worked because, I think, they were simply working for the contraceptive pill industry. And then as far as the IUD, they now have IUDs that have hormones that secrete a small amount of hormone inside the uterine cavity, so that would be a similar situation. Yeah, the signal from inside the uterus travels through nerves and other conduction up the fallopian tube to prevent the ovary from producing the amount of progesterone that it should. So any kind of IUD with or without hormones will create a hormonal imbalance, which is what is the main thing accounting for the prevention of pregnancy. And then thereby increasing your estrogen and increasing risk of cancer. Yeah. So the only, that's one, the one possible safe method of contraception would be the silver or the gold. But they don't make those. But they don't make them. Is there, is there anything else other than natural birth control? Rhythm or method? Yeah. Fertility awareness method. Not too much else, huh? Yeah, I think the rhythm cycle method is the best.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on melatonin?

**RAY PEAT:** It has its own endocrine problems; it can disturb your progesterone and thyroid production if you take a lot of it. Its function seems to be as a way of detoxifying serotonin. The trigger that turns the conversion in the pineal gland of serotonin into melatonin is the adrenergic stress-related nerves. During the night, your stress increases from the lack of light, and this adrenergic system causes the pineal to convert serotonin to melatonin. In general, in various places, melatonin is functioning as an antidote to serotonin. So biologically, it's evidence that you're responding to stress with a detoxifying process. The similar enzymes that exist in the pineal that are activated by the stress can also be found in inflamed joint tissue and in breast cancer, for example, and serotonin is involved in the pathology of both of those situations. So if our enzymes could turn it more quickly into melatonin, then there would be less of a serotonin problem. But when people actually take melatonin, sometimes it's probably protecting against the circulating serotonin, but in itself, in an otherwise healthy person, for example, in animal studies, it was capable of lowering both progesterone and thyroid while increasing estrogen. So in the meantime, in a short-term emergency situation, it could be okay, but again, long-term it's going to have negative side effects. Yeah, that depends probably on the person, but it's much safer than serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** A caller is using a vaginal suppository containing estradiol for dryness and is concerned about its systemic effects. What would you recommend as an alternative?

**RAY PEAT:** People have been studied who were using vaginal creams, for example, and their blood level of estrogen was even higher than some of the oral pills were causing. So it's definitely a systemic hormonal influence, wherever you put it. Right. So obviously, if there's any familial, even if there isn't a familial history, but especially if there is a familial history of any estrogen... I've known several women who had pharmacists make them up suppositories with a fairly high dose of vitamin A and a little vitamin E in cocoa butter or other way of introducing it. The vitamin A helps to strengthen the membranes and normalize mucous production. Okay. Okay, good. Well, that's a pretty... And in the meantime, if you can't find a pharmacist to make it, vitamin A palmitate and vitamin E, you can buy those capsules and try that.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on bioidentical hormones, particularly those derived from soy and wild yam, compounded by pharmacies?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, all of the hormones that are bioidentical can have, they have to fit into the system in a balanced way, and it's okay to have a physiological amount of any of these, serotonin, estrogen, melatonin, and so on, but when you supplement estrogen or serotonin, you're most likely increasing something that's already excessive. The doctrine of replacement with the natural hormones is building on the history of the estrogen replacement with synthetic hormones. What they neglect is that as a woman ages from age 19 to 39, for example, there's a steady average increase in the amount of estrogen in her bloodstream, as well as a fairly continuous amount of progesterone, which every cycle the estrogen is forced out of the cells all through the body by the rising large amount of progesterone. In the 40s, progesterone production is no longer able to fully keep up with this steadily increasing estrogen production with aging. As soon as estrogen, as soon as progesterone decreases and can no longer force estrogen out of the cells, the blood estrogen level will drop, but the estrogen inside the cells will increase. Publications by some, I think they're Norwegians, Batra and others, and by Richard Blandow at the University of Washington, showed that the tissues of old organisms retain much more estrogen than the tissues of young animals. The fact that you don't find it in the blood is simply because estrogen sticks inside the cells in proportion to the deficiency of progesterone. So that was probably the reason why they recommended it is because of low blood levels, and so Dr. Peat's advice would be to not use it.
