**RAY PEAT:** From 1968 to 72, I was in graduate school at the University of Oregon and I did my dissertation on reproductive aging and how oxidative metabolism changes with age. And I found that the changes that happen are causing basically the menopause equivalent in animals. It is something that happens in every tissue in the body. It just happens that in the uterus is where I did my dissertation work. But I was interested in aging changes in the brain and ovums and so on. And it turns out that the same chemical and biological processes change through time in all of these tissues. And... In my dissertation, one of the aging theories that I talked about was the collagen theory of aging, that estrogen excess causes wastage of oxygen, basically suffocating tissues the way radiation would, for example, and destroying the... ability to use oxygen, and as a result of that, excess collagen is produced by the... fiber... collagen-producing cells, fibroblast, in the connective tissue. And with aging, the collagen becomes progressively denser and more cross-linked, creating an oxygen-deprived... environment. So, my emphasis at that time was on how estrogen produced by irritation or aging causes more collagen to be produced and to become more dense, creating further interference with oxygen consumption.
**CONTEXT:** Could you explain your academic and professional career for those who haven't heard you before?

**RAY PEAT:** In congestive heart failure the heart muscle simply gets weaker. Less able to pump a full volume of blood with each stroke. And the diastolic phase which should be a relaxation phase is inadequate. The heart stays partly contracted and so it has a short stroke. It doesn't make up for the shortness of the stroke. It tends to pump faster and ordinarily when a heart muscle pumps faster it has a bigger stroke so that it doesn't have to simply increase the speed, it can increase the volume with each stroke. But with heart failure that's impossible so it tends to lead to a fast but weak heartbeat.
**CONTEXT:** Could you explain the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it becomes waterlogged, a higher concentration of water in the tissue. That's because it isn't relaxing fully and when it doesn't relax it's like when you work a muscle tremendously. You can actually make a muscle swell up in just 15 or 20 minutes of very intense contraction. Your muscle will gain weight because it doesn't relax fully and retains calcium and excess water. So a very fatigued biceps muscle, for example, is temporarily equivalent to... what's happening in a failing heart, and with that condition of retaining water and calcium, if that persists for a long time, because the heart isn't getting enough sugar or oxygen, whatever it needs to relax, or if it's being stimulated by estrogen, for example, that prevents the full relaxation, then... Chronically, it tends to produce more collagen, and that collagen tends to become hardened. So, at first, it's just a swollen condition, then it gradually becomes a fibrotic condition, and that can actually lead to the development of a bone in the heart, a calcification that actually contains crystal and calcium.
**CONTEXT:** What happens to the heart muscle itself in congestive heart failure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the steroid from the foxglove is similar in structure and function to progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned digoxin from the woolly foxglove as a strengthener of heart contraction. How does it work?

**RAY PEAT:** St. George did experiments 50 or 60 years ago in which he showed that progesterone acts on the heart using a rabbit heart. It acts like......digitalis to increase the staircase effect of heart contraction in which a faster simulation increases the stroke and amount of blood pumped with each contraction. And that's because the progesterone or the digitalis is accelerating the ability to both contract and relax.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned progesterone is similar to digitalis. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's why the failing heart has a very weak small beat because it isn't relaxed and it's becoming harder just by being filled up with water the way your muscles, when they swell up, they feel harder. OK. OK. And I'm very, yeah, I'm fatigued from that, from that swelling.
**CONTEXT:** Why does the failing heart have a weak, small beat?

**RAY PEAT:** When you're exercising, you will notice the beats per minute increase as you use your muscles and consume more oxygen. But at the same time that your healthy heart is beating faster, it's beating harder. So when it's going maybe 130 beats per minute, it will also be thumping very hard, and you can feel your pulse in your wrist or throat as a big bulging throb with each beat. That's the staircase effect. It's both going faster and having a bigger stroke with each contraction.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the staircase effect. Can you explain that in relation to efficient heart contraction?

**RAY PEAT:** It turns out that exactly the same things are happening in skeletal muscle and heart muscle. People have known it empirically. Doctors have seen the changes in their patients for 100 years and found that thyroid was correct. Those are problems of both the heart and the skeletal muscles, but now... fairly recently, with analysis of the genes and proteins, you can see that, in fact, exactly the same things are involved in the growing pains which come with somewhat low thyroid function around puberty, usually a couple of years before puberty. Estrogen is increasing blocking thyroid function. That makes the cell fatigue more easily so it retains water. The pain is associated with, usually in the late afternoon and evening, the muscles have progressively retained more water and calcium and are painful and swollen. If a person in middle age becomes a very hypothyroid... They start getting the same thing. Fibromyalgia is one of the variations on that.
**CONTEXT:** Does the waterlogged effect of cardiac muscles in congestive heart failure relate to growing pains?

**RAY PEAT:** The muscle disease of hypothyroidism or hypothyroid myopathy, it involves leakage of enzymes from the skeletal muscles. That has been the assumption. That's, in fact, the part. It's also leaking those proteins, you can identify proteins coming from both the heart muscle and the skeletal muscles in the hypothyroidism or in heart failure.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned fibromyalgia. What is the connection to hypothyroidism and muscle weakness?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, creatine kinase is the first thing to look for if you're suspecting. A thyroid-related pain problem.
**CONTEXT:** If someone suspects fibromyalgia, can it be tested in a lab by giving a urine or blood sample to find myoglobin or creatine kinase?

**RAY PEAT:** In hyperthyroidism, you can see it in an electrocardiogram or if you kneel and have someone thump your Achilles tendon, so your toes twitch. Away from your body, the relaxation, if your thyroid function is good, the relaxation will be instantaneous and your foot will relax with a floppy instantaneous complete relaxation. If your thyroid is low, it will come back slowly to exactly where it started and the heart is doing the same thing with a prolongation of the QT interval. T-wave represents repolarization or relaxation. So you can see it in either your Achilles tendon or looking at the electrocardiogram. And when that is slow, that means the cell is retaining water and calcium. And in that swollen state, it is permeable, it absorbs things that it shouldn't and it leaks. Some of the enzymes that shouldn't leak, so you can see those in the blood during fatigue or hypothyroidism.
**CONTEXT:** How does muscle weakness in hyperthyroidism manifest, and how can it be observed?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the conduction and time, the race of nervous conduction is slowed in hypothyroidism. And so there are different things involved in ordinary functioning. A hypothyroid person will tend to react......10 milliseconds or 20 milliseconds slower than a person with a good thyroid function. I've seen when someone popped a firecracker on the 4th of July, I saw people around the room. There was sort of a wave of jumping. You could tell who the hypothyroid was by how fast they jumped.
**CONTEXT:** Is the speed of reflexes related to the ability to relax muscles quickly, and is it a sign of good thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** The brain as having exactly the same process of excitation and relaxation as your heart muscle or your leg muscle, when the brain is fatigued If it's somewhat hypothyroid, it gets the equivalent of a growing pain or a cramp and it can't relax fully and that amounts to insomnia and so if you can energize the brain cells, you can get sleep to come on quickly and the active thyroid hormone and magnesium and sugar are the things that most quickly will restore energy to your brain or your muscles heart and so on.
**CONTEXT:** How does insomnia relate to thyroid function and brain cell energy?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, fruit is extremely important and avoiding polyunsaturated fats... because the... heart is much more efficient using oxygen when it's burning sugar rather than fat and having plenty of all of the minerals calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Those interact very closely. People think of calcium as the exciting ion which it is when the cell is excited and can't get rid of it. Thank you. Calcium happens to inhibit some of the hormones that maintain inflammation and excitation. So if you are well saturated with all of these minerals, the alkaline minerals, that will help the heart to relax more quickly and then contract more quickly.
**CONTEXT:** What are the best foods for the heart and what is the best diet?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there you go. And obviously table salt, I know we've done several. Several shows on salt and how good it is for you, but I think we need to keep reminding ourselves again that there's absolutely no truth in the fact that salt is harmful. It's actually very very beneficial for you and actually lack of salt is more harmful.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding minerals for the heart, you mentioned calcium, potassium, magnesium, and sodium. What are good sources, and what about salt?

**RAY PEAT:** One point about the sodium is that if you restrict sodium... you increase your aldosterone and one of the current interests in heart drug treatment is to find an aldosterone inhibitor but the eating enough sodium is the simplest way to inhibit excess aldosterone. It's too cheap and they can't patent it.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the importance of sodium. What is its role in relation to aldosterone and heart drug treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your cholesterol level up, fruit is one of the best ways to help the liver make enough cholesterol. And then, if your cholesterol production is good, thyroid and vitamin A are the main things for turning cholesterol into progesterone. Which not only has anti-seizure effects, but it has heart protective effects, steadying the heart rhythm the way Digitalis does, and blocking albasterone, preventing fibrosis of the heart, and so on. So, keeping your cholesterol production up, but having the factors that convert it to progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned estrogen can cause heart attacks and catamenial epilepsy due to an estrogen-progesterone imbalance. What can be done to balance hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** The effect of having a raw carrot every day, or bamboo shoots, these are antiseptic fibers which can't be easily broken down by microorganisms. And so, they don't stimulate bacterial growth.... tend to sterilize the intestine and at the same time, the fiber binds the estrogen which your liver is producing and excreting all the time in the bile and prevents it from being reabsorbed. So immediately, you can see a decrease in your estrogen level a day or two after eating a raw carrot. And that's a good thing. Reduction of absorption of bacterial products and estrogen very quickly reduces your stress and cortisol production, and that allows your progesterone to increase.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned vitamin A is important for converting cholesterol to progesterone. What about the effect of eating raw carrots or bamboo shoots?

**RAY PEAT:** The simplest thing is to avoid starches and polyunsaturated fat, because those are the things that promote...
**CONTEXT:** Regarding gut health and the GAP diet, what should be avoided?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the olive oil is saturated enough that it helps the carrot with the germicidal action. Coconut oil, butter, and olive oil are especially associated with the fiber of carrot....help to suppress microorganisms.
**CONTEXT:** Do you consider olive oil something to avoid in the context of gut health and the carrot's germicidal action?

**RAY PEAT:** Basically, it's doing everything you can to restore a good, intense metabolic rate, restore the energy level of cells so that they don't go into the stress state. The high serotonin trains the nervous system. To stay in a stress state because serotonin activates the pituitary ACTH and adrenal system. And ultimately the way to break that pattern is to increase your cellular energy production, lower stress, keep your thyroid function up, and keep the estrogen down.
**CONTEXT:** What can a person do to recover from getting off SSRIs?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, people seem to take about a year to feel. Fairly normal again, even doing everything right.
**CONTEXT:** How long does it typically take to recover from SSRI withdrawal?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the serotonin itself creates an inflammatory state in the nerves and body in general. So they affect your whole metabolism tend to increase fat production. And stress. And so you want to concentrate on keeping your whole body in an unstressed condition. Eating frequently is probably one of the helpful things. Not forcing yourself to go on adrenaline.
**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of serotonin on the body, and how can one maintain an unstressed condition?

**RAY PEAT:** It's pretty well established that you......damage the tissue, create stress in the brain. The cancer rate increases when your head is exposed to the microwave frequencies.
**CONTEXT:** What are the ramifications of having a competing frequency from a cell phone next to the heart?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so. The Japanese and Chinese have some drugs that they make from extracts of the bamboo plant and I think they get the strongest ones from the leaves but I think there is the same antiseptic and probably anti-cancer material in the shoots.
**CONTEXT:** You've been exploring eating bamboo sprouts. Do you think there's any antibiotic material in the water you boil them in?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I think there's a worse process that all the companies, all the big companies are using the last five or ten years, which is to use enzymes to......break up the pulp so that they have less waste and more volume in the juice. The stuff that used to be pretty solid material that had to be discarded has now been...
**CONTEXT:** Regarding orange juice processing, are you aware of companies using enzymes to break up pulp?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah. Okay, so the fresh is definitely better, but drinking the processed ones are still going to be better than not doing it, right? For example, people with heart pains, even with frozen orange juice concentrate, you can see a very quick relief from mild heart pains just by drinking a pint of orange juice per day.
**CONTEXT:** Is drinking processed orange juice still beneficial, even if fresh is better?

**RAY PEAT:** I think there is a definite relation between sinus or tooth infections in the heart, but I don't think it goes from the sinus or tooth to the heart. But I think it's endotoxin from chronic intestinal inflammation. But I don't know. Sometimes bacteria enter the bloodstream along with the endotoxin but just the endotoxin alone is enough to cause sinusitis and inflamed periodontal tissues and at the same time it's causing those changes in the heart, calcium retention, water retention, easy fatigability.
**CONTEXT:** Is there a relation between chronic sinusitis and heart strain, possibly due to infection?

**RAY PEAT:** When the simple foods and the fibers to disinfect your intestine, when those aren't enough then the drugs that are most helpful in my experience are aspirin and the antihistamines. Benadryl for example if you could get the pure chemical that's better than prepared tablets and ciproheptadine which is an antiserotonin. Antihistamine and then antibiotics.
**CONTEXT:** What can be done for chronic sinusitis if simple foods and fibers aren't enough?

**RAY PEAT:** Avoidance of inflammation is vitamin D. Have you had a blood test for vitamin D?
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned vitamin D helps the general immune system and avoids inflammation. Is 10,000 units of Vitamin D3 a reasonable dosage?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Framingham study found that people over 50 who had at least 200 cholesterol or higher had a much lower risk of Alzheimer's disease because it's brain protective as well as heart protective.
**CONTEXT:** What is a recommended cholesterol level, and what are its benefits?

**RAY PEAT:** I know a dentist who cured a chronic. Dental problems like periodontal disease with simply giving his patients a laxative and he would talk at dental conferences and say he was a good surgeon but he found there was no need at all to do periodontal surgery if he gave the patients laxatives but the idea didn't catch on among the dentists.
**CONTEXT:** Do you have any suggestions for treating a chronic tooth infection, perhaps related to dental issues?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, often if you keep a... the vegetables that you've been eating, put them in a plastic bag where they don't get oxygen and then keep them at 98 degrees for a few days and you'll basically see what happens to them because we don't have enzymes for breaking up the cellulose of vegetable material and so the bacteria are favored by the warm moist conditions....and the bacteria can thrive on raw vegetables.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned avoiding raw vegetables. Can you explain why?

**RAY PEAT:** Raw carrots are the exception among vegetables because being a root vegetable they happen to be. Very germicidal bacteria won't touch them in the transit time.
**CONTEXT:** So, should I avoid salads and other raw vegetables, except for raw carrots?

**RAY PEAT:** Sunlight is the best in general and if you're going to be exposed to full sunlight very long then you have to worry about sunburn and so avoiding sunburn is the only caution but......many hours a day of brilliant light, white light, incandescent light or sunlight. It has many effects, balancing the hormones, increasing your defensive hormones such as progesterone and testosterone. And just a year or so ago, an American researcher trained... rats and found that just shining red light on their heads, because red light penetrates through the tissues, found that their learning was improved just by exposure to light.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on light therapies, such as red light therapy?

**RAY PEAT:** It helps your whole system, lowers the stress and probably lowers the tendency to absorb endotoxin through your intestine.
**CONTEXT:** Can light therapy be helpful for a tooth infection?

**RAY PEAT:** The drugs that lower cholesterol, one of the accepted side effects of both of the main categories of cholesterol-lowering drugs is to cause occasional muscle breakdown, a rhabdomyolysis. Muscle dissolves itself and one of the known things is the interference with the production of coenzyme Q10, but that isn't the sole reason for the muscle breakdown. The simple lack of cholesterol, cholesterol is a cell stabilizing substance with hormone like action, which in the absence of......progesterone and the other protective steroids, it actually has a cell protective effect in the skeletal muscles and in the heart. The same process that causes rhabdomyolysis of the skeletal muscles can happen in the heart. Cholesterol deficiency is tending to kill heart cells.
**CONTEXT:** What are the harmful effects of lowering cholesterol, and how does it relate to heart failure?
