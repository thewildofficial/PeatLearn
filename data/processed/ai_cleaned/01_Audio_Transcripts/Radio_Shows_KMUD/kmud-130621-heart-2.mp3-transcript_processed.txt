**RAY PEAT:** The advice to substitute the polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats is a key component of worldwide dietary guidelines for coronary heart disease risk reduction. However, clinical benefits of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids, the omega-6 linoleic acid, have not been established.

**CONTEXT:** The host is summarizing recent articles that support Dr. Peat's long-held views on fats.

**RAY PEAT:** The advice to substitute vegetable oils that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, or PUFAs as they're known, for animal fats rich in saturated fatty acids, has been a cornerstone of worldwide dietary guidelines for the past half century. Now, when this advice originated in the 1960s, PUFAs were regarded as a uniform molecular category with one relevant biological mechanism and that was the reduction in blood cholesterol, so they said.

**CONTEXT:** The host is presenting evidence that contradicts the prevailing dietary advice regarding fats.

**RAY PEAT:** The evidence that potentially carcinogenic preservatives in processed meats as well as high heat cooking methods have influenced perceptions that red meat per se has adverse health effects. How the preparation and cooking methods used for foods that are traditionally classified as saturated fat foods may be producing substances from PUFAs and carbohydrates in those foods that are promoting disease. Also stated that studies suggesting the positive health effects from dairy fat and tropical oils both high in saturated fatty acids and therefore were discredited as unhealthy and the hazards of diets with increased carbohydrates as a result of being lower in fat in low fat diets followed to improve health especially cardiovascular health.

**CONTEXT:** The host is highlighting findings about the negative impacts of certain cooking methods and the mischaracterization of saturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** The dietary intake of saturated fatty acids was about the dietary intake of fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids and the incident of stroke and coronary heart disease in Japanese communities, which are famous for consuming fairly large amounts of the polyunsaturates, especially in fish oils, saying that saturated fatty acid intake was inversely associated with age 6 and energy-adjusted incidence of risk for total stroke, total and deep intra-parenchymal hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke. So saying that all of these things is cardiovascular disease. Etiologies were all definitely higher in people that consumed less saturated fat.

**CONTEXT:** The host is presenting research on saturated fat intake and cardiovascular health in Japanese communities.

**RAY PEAT:** Coffee. I know Dr. Peat likes coffee for its magnesium content, but there's another article here presented by the European Society of Hypertension in 2013. During their scientific sessions, it was actually published June the 18th, 2013. Green tea and coffee may guard against stroke. Chocolate nudges down blood pressure and new meta-analysis. And coffee versus heart failure, a few cups per day protects. So I know Dr. Peat's always pushed coffee has been a good source of magnesium and another good antioxidant type food.

**CONTEXT:** The host is mentioning the benefits of coffee, aligning with Dr. Peat's views.

**RAY PEAT:** The food supplement that was linked to lower prostate specific antigen in prostate cancer patients was a mixture, they called it Pomi tea. And the main components of it were broccoli, broccoli, green tea extract, pomegranate, and the other product. um gosh was the other product was well those were those were three of them there was four in it but they were um turmeric that was it turmeric okay so they found that this mixture significantly lowered prostate specific antigen compared with placebo in a study of 400 again 420 patients with prostate cancer in a double blind placebo controlled randomized trial so again uh dr pete's always mentioned uh things like the antioxidants and the flavonoids has been very beneficial components in foods and that's why he's so behind food as a medicine rather than you know supplements and drugs etc and he's very much behind getting your dietary dietary medicine from food.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing a supplement with beneficial components, reinforcing Dr. Peat's emphasis on food as medicine.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure what the motivation is exactly because the information has been sitting around for 50 or 60 years I guess someone has slipped on their public relations for the fish oil and PUFA letting this stuff leak through into the media It's certainly a big industry, isn't it? I've seen some of the numbers that are touted as generating income for fish oil sales and they're pretty staggering.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is commenting on the recent emergence of information that supports his views, suggesting a shift in industry messaging.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 50s and 60s I had taught various places, in humanities mostly but 1968 to 72 I returned to graduate school intending to study brain biology but I... found quickly that the nerve and brain department in the university was among the most dogmatic molecular biology genetics and brain studies were highly dogmatic so I shifted over to the physiological chemistry of aging and the reproductive system for my thesis.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is describing his academic background and the shift in his research focus.

**RAY PEAT:** You see a lot of stuff in the medical literature that is spreading the propaganda line and superficially it presents itself as science or research on the effects of the fats on the animals and so on, but when you read it closely... It's just like a professional trick in which they compare things that they know or should know to be extremely toxic against the thing they want to sell and see it's less toxic than this other thing. But since it's common knowledge that the other thing is just powerfully toxic. Anything compared against it practically will look beneficial. That's just almost a trick of the trade. Just to keep selling a pretty profitable product, especially the fish oils. I can't imagine, well I do imagine why the industries do what they do because ultimately things that are waste products, when they're turned into a profit... a profitable product. Some of the bad research is just carelessness. For example, for about 30 or 40 years, people referred to lard as the saturated fat, and then they would use some middle of the range of vegetable oil, like canola or something, and show an advantage....to the vegetable oil over lard, and say lard, the saturated fat, has these disadvantages. But during this period they were feeding the pigs corn and soybeans to fatten them, because specifically of the high unsaturation of the food. And so lard was an extremely highly unsaturated fat. Hundreds and hundreds of research papers compared it, using it as the so-called saturated fat.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining how research can be manipulated to promote certain products, using the example of lard and vegetable oils.

**RAY PEAT:** As far back as the 1920s, probably earlier, it was identified as a major protective, defensive molecule. For example, around 1920, someone injected half a dozen different toxins, heavy metals, snake venom, infectious bacteria. Just about anything that was considered extremely toxic, and then they gave the animal a cholesterol injection and found that it antidoted all of those harmful things. And that has been repeated about every 20 years or so. Someone repeats a similar experiment showing that in any system you look at, increasing the cholesterol improves functioning. For example... Injecting it into animals that are being trained, it improves their memory and learning ability. It turns out to be a component of every part of a cell's anatomy. The nuclear framework, the cell division apparatus, the respiratory system, everything. They talk about it as a membrane. component, but it's really everywhere in the cell.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing the protective and essential role of cholesterol in the body.

**RAY PEAT:** I've known several doctors and such who deliberately kept their cholesterol down and bragged about having 100 or 120 milligram percent cholesterol and I don't think any of them live much beyond 40 years.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is sharing his observations about the negative consequences of artificially lowering cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** The framing him studies found that over the age of 50 People who didn't have higher than 200 on the cholesterol were more likely to have dementia showing a protective effect on the brain.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is referencing studies that link higher cholesterol levels to better brain health in older adults.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there's a very close connection between polyunsaturated fats and it's inversely related to thyroid function at every level. If you take one particular function of thyroid, the......formation of the hormone or the secretion from the gland, or its transport through the blood, or its action on the respiratory, or the genetic system in the cell, each of these functions decreases as the unsaturation of the fat molecule increases. And so the low thyroid, which allows muscles to fatigue......more easily simply because energy isn't being produced by respiration at the necessary level, as the muscle is fatigued, it activates processes that try to provide more energy, but in doing that, they liberate fats from storage so they become free fatty acids. This not only......further suppresses the thyroid and the energy production, but it starts an inflammatory process so that the muscle, instead of just becoming fatigued and working less, shifts over to becoming inflamed and breaking down, and sometimes the muscle breakdown can kill a person.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining the detrimental relationship between polyunsaturated fats and thyroid function, leading to muscle fatigue and breakdown.

**RAY PEAT:** One experiment with just walking fast on the treadmill to keep the heart rate up to about 120 or less, they found that the liver's production of the active thyroid hormone decreased radically. in less than an hour of that kind of exercise and if the person is very healthy the thyroid will bounce right back from that kind of stress but if their tissues are loaded with the thyroid suppressive fats that much exercise liberates the fats and keeps the thyroid from recovering quickly.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is discussing how certain types of exercise can suppress thyroid hormone production, especially in individuals with high levels of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, uh uh one experiment that got my interest about 30 years ago or more was looking at the school performance of I think it was high school kids and their heart rate and they found that the ones that had the highest grades averaged an 85 beats per minute at rest and the average of around 70 were the lower performance students.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is presenting research linking higher resting heart rates to better cognitive performance.

**RAY PEAT:** In general that very slow heart rate correlates with very slow everything, sperm production. For example, it's usually very low in those endurance runners.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining that a very low heart rate, often seen in endurance athletes, can be indicative of overall metabolic slowdown.

**RAY PEAT:** Some of the drug companies are doing some trick research to make it look like it's better to have a lower heart rate. But what they're doing is including... people with heart failure. And when your heart is in the process of failing, it beats more weakly, and so it has to beat more often. And so when you include people with heart failure, then you see that those with a fast heart rate are about to die.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is exposing a potential bias in research that promotes lower heart rates, by including individuals with heart failure.

**RAY PEAT:** Well partly it keeps the cells alive, but as long as the heart cells are able to respire using sugar, using glucose, and producing carbon dioxide, any muscle cell in the heart that is damaged will be replaced by a recruited cell. Stem cell may be coming in from the blood or another part of the heart which in the presence of the thyroid and the good environment of plentiful glucose and carbon dioxide will mature into a muscle cell. But if the cell is blocked by these free fatty acids which interfere with the use of glucose, then the... The cells of the heart produce lactic acid and lactic acid is a signal to produce collagen and the stem cells arriving get that kind of signal from the environment of the sick heart and turn into fibroblasts and produce connective tissue so the heart becomes progressively fibrotic and less contractile cells. And in experiments... They've produced two kinds of heart enlargement, one in which the heart simply works harder like when you take more thyroid it pumps harder and pumps more blood or if you block the output of the heart by having what produces high blood pressure you create more resistance and that causes the heart to enlarge. But the stressed, plugged-up heart enlarges by producing more collagen and becomes by-product but the enlarged heart that has developed with increased function and thyroid provision is a good, muscular, functioning heart and when animals have been caused to develop an enlarged, fibrotic heart with the other type of heart interference, then giving them T3 over a period of time causes the fibrosis to regress and be replaced by good, functioning heart and that kind of animal research has been somewhat indirectly applied to a... people preparing cadaver hearts for donation for transplants and they found that if they gave the donor heart before they removed it, if they provided T3 to have it ready for removal and transplant, the transplant was much more successful.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining how thyroid hormone, glucose, and carbon dioxide support heart cell regeneration and prevent fibrosis, while free fatty acids contribute to heart damage.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in the liver part, every place it's been studied, it helps to reverse the fibrosis.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is confirming the antifibrotic properties of T3.

**RAY PEAT:** I think developing good new tissue. Stem cells and keeping the environment low in lactic acid and high in carbon dioxide allows the differentiation to go in the right direction. And organs and tissues are always trying to break down and renew the extracellular matrix which is where the collagen... fibrosis exists, that's always being broken down and replaced in the thyroid deficient, stressed person. The replacement becomes worse than it was, but with adequate thyroid and nutrition, fibrosis is replaced progressively by more functional tissue.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is elaborating on the mechanism by which T3 promotes tissue repair and regeneration.

**RAY PEAT:** The fat is a chain of carbon atoms and they're covered with hydrogen atoms and if you remove some of those hydrogen atoms on the typical middle of the chain carbon there are two hydrogens and if you remove those from... some of the carbons, that's unsaturating it. It just means, if it's saturated, it means it has all the hydrogens attached that it can hold. And polyunsaturated means that you've got more than one set of carbon atoms with a double bond of electrons between the carbons lacking the hydrogens or the carbon. Where the hydrogens had been filling every possible space. And the other thing, just to bring out that saturated fats are easily identified more or less by having a characteristic of being fairly solid at room temperature. And that doesn't apply at all to the living state where we live at 98 or 99 degrees, those fats. Aren't at all more stiff or rigid in any way, but there's a whole literature that talks about them as if they stay stiff when they're at our body temperature. Promoting the ideology that they're bad for you, right? Yeah, in fact, each carbon in a saturated fat is free to rotate against its neighbor. And the removal. Of the hydrogens, creates a stiff bond between those carbons, so actually... In the polyunsaturated? Yeah, the polyunsaturated is less free to rotate than a saturated fat.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining the chemical structure of saturated and polyunsaturated fats in simple terms.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yes, in fact, the fact that the highly unsaturated fat......is easily attacked by oxygen means that the fats on the surface or wherever they are very quickly tend to attach chemically to adjoining proteins and so when you look at it in the right situation you see that the polyunsaturated membranes are often very rigid because of oxidation attaching them to the... protein underlying them.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining how polyunsaturated fats can become rigid due to oxidation and protein attachment.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you tried antihistamines, such as ciproheptadine, which is both antiserotonin and antihistamine?

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is suggesting an antihistamine with antiserotonin properties to address the caller's issue with rapid peristalsis.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they have a slight belladonna or atropine-like side effect.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining the mechanism by which certain antihistamines can slow down bowel movements.

**RAY PEAT:** Both of them. Are anti-inflammatory and that's part of the protective effect is the protein which carries the cholesterol itself has a very important biological effect defending against things that would irritate and inflame but some of the studies have shown that there's a close correlation between high HDL. And some of the inflammatory diseases such as cancer because it rises defensively against exposure to those chemical irritants. So the level of HDL or the proportion of the total cholesterol partly is just reflecting how stressful your environment is. For example... Drinking too much alcohol will raise your HDL, being exposed to too much of the fish oil type of irritation or peroxidation will raise your HDL defensively.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining that both HDL and LDL cholesterol have anti-inflammatory properties and that high HDL can be a defensive response to environmental stressors.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think it's as simple as that, but two or three to one is......is usually reasonable. Two or three LDL to one HDL.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is providing a general guideline for a healthy LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, definitely CAT scans are not safe. That amount of radiation is known to have a permanently inflammatory action, and the more of them you have, the more certain it is that there will be some lingering damage from them. But the swollen lymph glands... Sometimes it can just mean that you're being exposed to allergens or possibly foods that you're somewhat sensitive to. It's very common in the spring to have a period of several of the lymph glands around the throat and neck to swell up because of air, pollen, and......possibly changing foods from the season change.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is warning about the dangers of CAT scans and explaining that swollen lymph glands can be a reaction to allergens or food sensitivities.

**RAY PEAT:** If an antibiotic made it go down, I would just keep trying that line of approach, and maybe have a raw carrot every day to help to clean out your intestine.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is suggesting continuing with antibiotics if they are effective and incorporating raw carrots into the diet for intestinal cleansing.

**RAY PEAT:** Eating a fiber like a raw carrot every day has an antibiotic action, and you have to know which herbs... you're working with, because some of them could increase inflammation. Okay. There are definitely things like gallium aparene, which is cleavers, there are definitely fresh juices of that, which is very well indicated for lymphadenopathy, as is poker, poker is extremely strong, and you definitely don't want to use too much of it, because it has a very narrow spectrum of activity beyond being toxic in its own right, and obviously things like... Smilax Sarsaparilla, which is used as a lymphatic agent, and Blue Flag, the iris versicolor, is also a good lymphatic agent.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is recommending raw carrots for their antibiotic properties and suggesting specific herbs for lymphatic support.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if it softens and seems normal after taking an antibiotic for a few days, that means pretty well that it wasn't cancer.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining how a reduction in swelling after antibiotic treatment can indicate that the condition is not cancerous.

**RAY PEAT:** The hardness is a very accurate way to diagnose. They found that when doing breast cancer surgery that just feeling the lymph nodes in the armpit, they can diagnose accurately just by whether they're hard or not, whether there's cancer in them. So you're saying if you took the antibiotic and the swelling went down, it wouldn't do that if it was hard and cancer? Yeah, it would stay hard. Okay. Okay. Would it stay the same size? No, it could get smaller, but if the part is hardened and cancerous, it has like a mesh of compacted collagen surrounding the cells. which are becoming defective, and that collagen takes days or weeks to soften up when it's being cured.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is elaborating on how the hardness of a lymph node can indicate the presence of cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think that's probably just expressing low thyroid function. The cholesterol is the precursor to... several of the protective hormones, Pregnenolone, Progesterone, and DHEA. Well, she's had thyroid problems, and she's going to get reevaluated to see if she's on the right level of medication, because she seems to need to take thyroid. I think her thyroid doesn't produce enough on its own. As your thyroid function goes down, your cholesterol goes up in a defensive reaction. I see. Trying to keep the production of those protective hormones up. End of. So when you take thyroid you start turning cholesterol into the good stuff and so the cholesterol goes down.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining that high cholesterol can be a sign of low thyroid function and that thyroid hormone therapy can help regulate cholesterol levels.

**RAY PEAT:** Not true. No. Polyunsaturated. Uh-huh.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is refuting the notion that butter and beef fat clog arteries.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you just name some of the popular ones, mayonnaise is almost always highly unsaturated, corn oil, safflower oil. Hemp seed oil. Yeah, linseed oil and fish oil. And olive oil contains about 10% of the potentially dangerous polyunsaturateds, but it has so much of the monounsaturateds that it's relatively safe. And all the seed oils are the same thing, right? Yeah, olive oil is a fruit oil, technically.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is listing common sources of polyunsaturated fats and clarifying the composition of olive oil.
