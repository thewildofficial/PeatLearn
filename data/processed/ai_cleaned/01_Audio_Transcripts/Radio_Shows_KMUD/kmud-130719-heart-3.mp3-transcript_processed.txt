**RAY PEAT:** When the organism is exposed at a very early stage, such as during gestation or infancy, the signals for development are changed so that the... especially the reproductive system is changed. But besides changing the individual by......giving it false signals, the DNA is altered slightly by attaching methyl groups to it as part of that misguided development. And that means that the ability to express enzymes for the rest of its life will be influenced unless it can somehow remove those methyl groups. But typically they will last for three or four generations even without further change. So the changes that happen to one individual can be passed on for generations, altering the fertility, for example, until it can attempt to cause the species to simply disappear.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion about the amount of pollution that we are, as an organism, exposed to directly from estrogenic-like substances in the environment?

**RAY PEAT:** Despite all of the 40 years at least of propaganda trying to sell estrogen to men to prevent heart attacks, for example, they found that they died faster when they took estrogen, but they keep coming back trying to sell estrogen as a heart protective hormone, and the Women's Health Initiative somewhat set that back by showing that the use of estrogen replacement therapy for menopause increased the number of heart attacks as well as cancer and dementia. But despite that, they're still hoping to bring back their sales to the 2002 level where they dropped off so sharply. But just in the last day or two... An article appeared from Yale Medical School doing what they call a meta-analysis, meaning picking out some articles from junkie medical magazines and analyzing them for the type of results basically they want. Until the Women's Health Initiative, the medical journals were... 20 or 30 years were just swamped with the heart protective benefits and the brain anti-Alzheimer's effect and even the anti-cancer effects of estrogen and despite the Women's Health Initiative these people are now looking back through journals and drawing out of them the kind of information they want and this study so-called published by the Yale people claims that tens of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily by refusing to take their estrogen treatment for menopause.

**CONTEXT:** What have you found from estrogens' effects on heart failure and cardiac death?

**RAY PEAT:** Although estrogen is a cell excitement, in the process of simulating one kind of cell activity tends to make it retain water. The individual cell stays excited too long and in the process of being excited the cell admits water and it has to relax a certain length of time to expel the water and so under the influence of too much unopposed estrogen cells tend to get more and more waterlogged and even though they're excited they progressively lose the ability to contract fully because in contracting the protein mechanism has to be interacting with itself rather than pushing against a swollen amount of water and that means that in a muscle such as the wall of a vein under the influence of high estrogen and low progesterone, testosterone and so on, the wall of the vein becomes waterlogged and can't contract periodically to maintain its tone. And the same thing happens in nerves, heart muscle, everywhere in the body that estrogen is able to have its influence. In these estrogen-dominated cells, the ability to contract becomes progressively weaker. Albert St. George demonstrated the effect of estrogen and progesterone on heart muscles over 50 years ago. And it showed that under the influence of progesterone, if you stimulate......the heart at an increasing frequency, each stroke becomes stronger. So it is an efficient way to respond to frequent stimulation. It relaxes in between, gathers its equipment together, and then has a bigger contraction under the influence of progesterone. But if it is influenced or dominated by estrogen......it is unable to accumulate that information that the stimulation is increasing in frequency. So the estrogenized heart will respond to the fast stimulation by just more of the same weak little contractions. That's basically how a failing heart behaves.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that varicose veins were a fairly important outward sign or a visible sign of the lowered ratio of progesterone being the good hormone the healthy anti-inflammatory hormone, so it's a sign of lowered progesterone to estrogen. What would you say about that?

**RAY PEAT:** Testosterone has an anti-cancer value as well just recently. Another study came out showing that a testosterone deficiency is a strong predisposer to prostate cancer.

**CONTEXT:** You've always mentioned non-stressful exercise, not the aerobic type where you get your heart rate up to 160 and you're breathing rapidly. You want weight-bearing exercise that doesn't make you breathless. You've said that kind of exercise increases your ability to produce muscle, and that muscle also, through the action of thyroid, enables your body to metabolize things more efficiently. But that muscle also metabolizes the steroid hormones and with exercise it can actually secrete testosterone. But in resting or stressed muscle, without adequate stimulation from good food and thyroid, muscles produce a lot of... estrogen. In one study, they were using the blood draining from a monkey's arm as a control comparison for the blood coming out of the ovary. They found that the monkey's arm was producing as much estrogen as its ovary. And that probably isn't a good representative of the average person. Because the monkey was anesthetized and so on and under the influence of stress and chemicals. But basically any stress tissue is going to tend to produce estrogen. But a well exercised strong muscle begins producing testosterone and stops producing estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** So muscles that are in their own right can secrete testosterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the skin is known to produce testosterone among other steroid hormones. It might be the body's biggest endocrine. Synthetic factory.

**CONTEXT:** Is there anywhere else in the body that testosterone can be secreted from besides the testes?

**RAY PEAT:** And that pretty much can be generalized to other muscles. Everyone is hearing the bad news about the anti-cholesterol drugs. that cause muscle breakdown. Sometimes the muscle breaks down so completely that the proteins leaking from the broken down muscle poison the kidneys and can even kill the person. But that's because cholesterol is a stabilizing factor for the skeletal muscles and if you stop cholesterol synthesis. The muscles are very susceptible to damage and those same processes are known to occur simultaneously in the heart muscle. The leakage of those proteins that can damage the kidneys, they always assume it is coming from the skeletal muscles but the heart under those chemicals is known to leak the same proteins.

**CONTEXT:** I know you've mentioned a previous study that positively associated an improved outcome from heart failure in relation to an increased cholesterol level.

**RAY PEAT:** The thing that's in the research a lot lately is the hypoxia-inducible factor which is the protein. It shows up, first they were seeing it wherever they cut off the oxygen supply, but that same protein can really be induced by cutting off the glucose supply too, so it really should be called the energy deprivation protein. Call it by its initials HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor. So it's not so much related to oxygen deprivation as sugar deprivation? Yeah, energy deprivation. That has been studied primarily in relation to cancer and finding ways to block that protein production. But it turns out that just getting enough glucose and oxygen delivered to the tissue is a very simple way to inhibit. That protein turns on all of the bad processes. Steam oxygenase with carbon monoxide production, nitric oxide synthase, lactic acid production, prostaglandin production causing inflammation, activating aromatase and so on. And then lactic acid in turn....activates the HIF hypoxia factor, so once it gets started the inflammation tends to promote more inflammation and hypoxia.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned the link between hypoxia, which is a kind of oxygen deficit, and cancer. The protein hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) can be induced by cutting off glucose supply as well as oxygen.

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide turns off the production of lactic acid. Simply the ability to turn off lactic acid production is one of the basic protective features of carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** You've always promoted a CO2, a carbon dioxide rich environment as being a beneficial cellular matrix. Is there anything negative about hypoxia, considering that carbon dioxide is beneficial?

**RAY PEAT:** The water in ordinary clay is structured differently from bulk water. But there's also a question of how long the influence of that surface can last. Gerald Pollock at the University of Washington, there are some videos on the Internet that you can see his demonstrations of some of the odd behavior of water, even in fairly bulk situations. But ordinarily it doesn't make any difference whether you drink water that has been boiled recently or frozen recently. It's mostly a matter of degassing that makes it behave differently according to its recent history. It's safe to drink tea or coffee water that's been boiled. But what matters is the state of the water inside the cell, and that's governed by the energy of the metabolism. The ratio of things like carbon dioxide to lactic acid. In the lens, the proteins in other hard tissues, collagen is the main protein that gives it stiffness. But in the lens, the main protein is called crystalline, and it happens that crystalline is very well ordered. With reference both to the structure of water and to the wavelength of visible light, so that the water surrounding these proteins in the lens is so well ordered that it doesn't interfere with or reflect or absorb the light passing through it. So it's an essential protein for maintaining the transparency of the lens. This protein, if you compare it to collagen or albumin or other common proteins, the protein can bind very firmly much more water, about twice as much water as other proteins, and hold it under its influence. So, really, the water of the lens and the protein is in a tight system in the normal state, but when... the energy processes fail and you absorb influences such as estrogen, polyunsaturated fats, lactic acid, various toxins, then the energy is unable to repair the system and the water gets out of control of these proteins and it starts at... becoming ordinary bulk water that interferes with the passage of light and lets junk accumulate such as broken down fragments of polyunsaturated fats. Acrolein, for example, breaking down from the N-3 proteins is a major factor in a cataract formation.

**CONTEXT:** When we have these tissues that are experiencing edema, and we have excess water, is that water considered not to be structured at its optimum? And do we produce our own water, and is that a more structured water? Is the water content within foods like orange juice or milk considered optimum structured water?

**RAY PEAT:** The water that has been filtered through an orange tree or a cow, it's at least very purified compared to how water would get out of these plummings. We do make quite a bit of water metabolically when we eat carbohydrates in particular. We turn some of the oxygen that we are using to produce energy. Some of that becomes water and the metabolic water is just intermixing with the water that we get from the food itself. But the nature of the oxygens contained in carbohydrates can influence the......metabolism of the cell. The hydrogens as well as the oxygens are a mixture of isotopes of different weight in everything that we eat or consist of, we have a mixture of these different weight isotopes and heavy water deuterium oxide, it slows down our metabolism. So there's a slight difference in the water that we get from tropical sugar versus beef sugar that's grown up in a high altitude because of the rainfall is separating the heavy water from the light water.

**CONTEXT:** So there is a slight difference in the quality of the water depending on where the fruit grows? And in a way, the water, like you're talking about in the lens of the eye, it's structured so that it's almost like crystalline, and that it actually structures the different materials that it's intermingling with?

**RAY PEAT:** The protein structures the water, and then the water emits. Things electrically.

**CONTEXT:** I take about a hundred milligrams of Metoprolol every day for five years. I also take isosorbide for my heart. I've had like seven heart attacks in the last nine years. With this much Metoprolol, is this something I should be concerned about? Should I talk to my doc about it?

**RAY PEAT:** The only safe way I know is to lower cholesterol. chronically is by increasing thyroid function. In 1936 or 7, people demonstrated that if you remove a person's thyroid gland, their cholesterol level goes up as a mirror image of their oxygen consumption going down. When you give them a thyroid supplement, the cholesterol will fall. As the oxygen consumption increases, that's a very simple mechanism that doctors prefer to prescribe drugs with the toxic side effects. And just lowering the cholesterol, even if the drug didn't have other side effects, the cholesterol is normally destined to turn into DHEA. Pergesterone, testosterone and so on. And so if you push down the availability of cholesterol by any mechanism, you're going to tend to deprive the body of those steroids that it should be forming.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding thyroid supplements, does it matter if it's T4 or T3?

**RAY PEAT:** It would very much matter depending on what their situation was, which one they may or may not be short of. The study that led to the substitution of thyroxin or T4 or the natural combination T3 and T4 was a test on male medical students, average age in the early 20s, and being male they didn't have the problems that typically females have about five or ten times the incidence of thyroid problems. So they tested thyroxin on a population that was extremely inappropriate for testing a thyroid product and they said it works just like natural thyroid and since it was a commercial proprietary material they preferred it to the natural product. But after about 10 or 15 years the actual active hormone T3 was identified and studied and it was found that this is what women lack typically causing them to have five or ten times the thyroid problems that men do because estrogen interferes with the gland's secretion of both T4 and T3 but it especially interferes with the liver's ability to convert thyroxin to the active hormone T3. So many women actually get worse symptoms when they take thyroxin because... it suppresses the little bit of T3 that their thyroid gland is producing, yet doesn't add to the amount of T3 that should be produced by the liver.

**CONTEXT:** Is there another reason why the excess estrogen found in postmenopausal women or even menstruating women works against them, works against their thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and some of the typically female problems such as endometriosis are just amazingly responsive to the proper thyroid supplementation. Yeah, because once the thyroid goes down......then estrogen goes up, and since the estrogen blocks thyroid action, it becomes a vicious circle.

**CONTEXT:** What about the relationship between hops, which are in the same family as cannabis, and their proestrogenic compounds?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, definitely, yeah. Hops is a very powerful estrogen. Right. Is there any similarity, given that the plant's in the same family? I'm sure there's a lot of overlap. Almost every plant has some estrogenic or anti-estrogenic material but mostly they're estrogenic because it's a defensive material that for example acts like birth control pills for predators. The known effects of heavy marijuana smoking are definitely estrogenic but some of that could just be that any kind of smoke is estrogenic.

**CONTEXT:** Is there any parallel between smoking and the presence of CO2, which you consider beneficial, and the potential dangers of smoke?

**RAY PEAT:** The... Carbon monoxide can accumulate and have some chronic harmful effects, such as on the liver function, but I think the real danger of smoke is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are inflammatory and estrogenic and carcinogenic. Just anything you burn is going to produce some of those ends. Then any smoke of a plant material is going to produce some dioxin type material. Right.

**RAY PEAT:** The wetness in the eye associated with cataracts is the same kind of wetness that's found in tumors. It's found in the heart during heart failure and also in the brain during brain disease. And despite the fact that the failing heart becomes hardened even calcified and the tumors are a skiffer than healthy tissue and even with age in a very serious dementia the brain can become sort of rubbery with so many connective tissue cells despite the fact that the tissue is becoming firmer these thick degenerative states. Actually contain more water so that if you dry a piece of the organ, it loses much more weight than a healthy organ would. In relation to the given amount of nucleic acid and proteins and so on, these degenerative tissue tissues have a very high percentage of water. But besides these... actual percentage of water, the water changes state and becomes relatively more like free bulk water. It can be frozen or the healthy cell is functioning somewhat as an antifreeze binding the water so that it isn't as free to move out of the cell or to be frozen.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that your research is showing that wetness as opposed to dryness, the wetness in the eye associated with cataracts, is the same kind of wetness that's found in tumors, in the heart during heart failure, and in the brain during brain disease.

**RAY PEAT:** It can be frozen or the healthy cell is functioning somewhat as an antifreeze binding...has a much higher percentage of water per protein molecule, and if you freeze that, it'll crystallize easier than a healthy lens. And this can be studied in an MRI machine, because you can very clearly see the difference between the water that's bound firmly to the cell in the way it should be. Or the water that's just sitting there as excess useless water plugging up the cell functions.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that excess estrogen is one of the main causes of menopause, and to bring that down into line with the anti-estrogen hormone, pregnenolone or progesterone would probably be the most efficient way of doing it. And usually thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Right. Because the cholesterol tends to rise at menopause. And if thyroid is adequate, that will keep turning the cholesterol into more of the pregnenolone and progesterone to protect against estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What would you suggest as the best herb or herbs for menopause?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, really, it's probably as much about your excess estrogen as anything else. I know, Dr. Peat, in terms of menopause, you would probably suggest that excess estrogen is one of the main causes, and to bring that down into line with the anti-estrogen hormone, pregnenolone. Or progesterone would probably be the most efficient way of doing it. And usually thyroid. Right. Because the cholesterol tends to rise at menopause. And if thyroid is adequate, that will keep turning the cholesterol into more of the pregnenolone and progesterone to protect against estrogen. Right, good.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that the only real function of estrogen is for implantation of a fertilized ovum, and outside of that it wreaks havoc in the female body, and does nothing very good in the male body. You also mentioned that advancing age in females makes estrogen a very negative and inflammatory molecule.

**RAY PEAT:** Hops is a very powerful estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Is there any similarity between hops and cannabis, given that they are in the same plant family, in terms of their estrogenic effects?
