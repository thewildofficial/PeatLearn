**RAY PEAT:** The connection between starch and polyunsaturated fats and aggression was clearly established and they had an environmental set up that allowed aggression to kill off part of the population fairly quickly. So I don't think it was just an objective study of the effect of sugar because the so-called stock diet consisting of some grains and soy......protein or soy flour and corn starch, added 25% corn starch, so the grains contained the polyunsaturated fats and it was a model of the aggression-promoting diet, but they didn't mention that in their publicity about the fact that the so-called normal diet allowed higher survival in the females than the sugar-rearing diet, with the equivalent of three sodas per day. So what they did was create an arrangement in which feeding the one group of animals so that they became aggressive. The setup was such that they could... take over the food supply, the nesting arrangement, and generally bully the weaker animals until they died. So that extremely high mortality is not produced by drinking three sodas a day. It would be if you had to associate the sugar-reared population... with the population living on starch and polyunsaturated fats would endanger the passive people.
**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing a study that claimed sugar was poisonous to mice, causing high mortality. Ray Peat explains the flawed methodology.

**RAY PEAT:** There were animal studies with lung cancer specifically that are very relevant to that and they found that T3, the active thyroid hormone, inhibited the growth of the cancer cells. But that T4 increased their growth and increased the metastatic ability of them. And that's similar to some studies that started about 30 years ago published in JAMA. There was a study in, I think it was the late 80s, comparing......studying a group of five women who had been treated for hypothyroidism with T4 only, such as Synthroid, comparing them to a group of women who weren't given any thyroid supplements. So they had chosen a group of hypothyroid women and reported that the ones who received... the T4 or Synthroid had a higher rate of osteoporosis. But since low thyroid is compensated by a high cortisone and high prolactin and other stress hormones which cause bone problems including osteoporosis, what they were doing was looking at a population with......the deficient thyroid problem treated insufficiently with something like 100 micrograms of T4. And it has been known for decades that women are much less able to convert T4 or synthroid into the active hormone. So it's especially inappropriate for......treating women with hypothyroidism to give them only T4.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about a study linking Synthroid (T4) use to lung cancer. Ray Peat explains the differential effects of T3 and T4 on cancer cells and the historical context of T4 treatment for hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** In general, both of the... thyroid hormones, if you can convert the thyroxin into T3, they both can have a very important anti-oxidative damage function. By increasing the rate of useful oxidation, they keep electrons from escaping from the electron transport chain in the mitochondrion and prevent the random....oxidative damage, just uncoupling the production of the energy, so you're wasting oxygen and fuel with some drugs, for example, that used to be used for weight loss, which activated the oxidation the way thyroid does, but without producing useful energy, even that kind of uncoupling. is known to reduce oxidative damage. So when you're finding increased oxidative breakdown products, when you give T4, it shows that you're not activating oxidative metabolism the way thyroid normally does. You're interfering in some way with the respiratory system.
**CONTEXT:** The host inquires about the physiological effects of T4. Ray Peat explains how thyroid hormones, particularly T3, can prevent oxidative damage by improving mitochondrial function.

**RAY PEAT:** That observation that Alzheimer's people have drastically reduced living variety, they tend not to socialize as much as people who are resistant to Alzheimer's, as that started me thinking about the general range of stimulation and animal studies. Beyond simple, more or less voluntary isolation that people, old people often develop the habit of just staying at home and watching television or something, beyond that animal studies did various things, isolation at different ages, separating the baby animals from their mothers right after weaning, giving them solitary confinement until they're middle-aged, and even tightening up their environment to the point of holding them so they can't do anything at all. There's a gradient all the way from living in a playground, basically. With slides and wheels and various colored objects, balls to push around, and so on. All the way down to being rolled up in a blanket so you can't move. But you see the same things happening. The worse the stress is, the smaller the brain gets. Depression is known to... increase cortisol and cause atrophy of all of the tissues, and that includes the brain. So they see that after about three years of just being psychologically depressed, people show a smaller reduction of the brain volume. And animal studies starting in the 1960s at University of California, Berkeley... They first found that animals given stimulation, a big playground to roam in during when they weren't eating and sleeping, they found that they learned better, could solve problems better. So they examined their brains to see what was happening and they found that the enzyme cholinesterase... was increased in proportion to how much they were stimulated and how well they learned. And they kept that study going on generation after generation and found that it not only increased this enzyme that destroys acetylcholine, it involved enlargement of the whole brain, especially the cortex. And each generation, both the enzyme increased and the brain got larger. So it's passed on. Yeah. Physiological sort of inheritance, which is getting some study now in the last ten years. But at the time they were just interested in the fact that......the environment could cause these major biological changes, especially in the brain.
**CONTEXT:** The host introduces the topic of environmental enrichment and its potential role in combating brain atrophy and Alzheimer's. Ray Peat elaborates on the impact of stimulation and isolation on brain size and function, referencing early animal studies.

**RAY PEAT:** But a lot of people said, well, if you're destroying acetylcholine at a higher rate and the brain gets bigger, that must mean you have more activity of the cholinergic nerves making acetylcholine. But that isn't what they found. They found that the enzyme that destroys it was increased. As the brain got bigger and that kind of reasoning without facts shifted over to thinking about the deterioration of the brain in Alzheimer's disease and they saw that there was less tissue in the brain. Parts of the brain especially in the cholinergic part and no one suggested that maybe overexposure to acetylcholine might have something to do with why the nerves atrophied because the various stress signals increase the various factors that cause brain shrinkage. So they proposed poisoning the enzyme cholinesterase which was associated in the animal studies with increased intelligence, memory and brain growth. They proposed doing just the opposite, poisoning that enzyme to increase the amount of acetylcholine in the brain. And the first drug that was proposed and used according to that. The theory was tachrine was the name of the chemical and several studies by the late 90s they were seeing that it did absolutely nothing for the Alzheimer's dementia but it did cause a terrifically high incidence of liver disease.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat continues his discussion on brain function and Alzheimer's, explaining how the understanding of acetylcholine metabolism was misinterpreted in the development of Alzheimer's treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 70s it happened that Parkinson's. disease was they were looking around for other things than L-DOPA to treat it with because that didn't work too well and some virus treatment investigations have found that a derivative of camphor or a similar compound that was used to cure herpes and influenza also had nerve protective action and they thought why not use this amandadine or adamantane amine to treat Parkinson's disease and they found that it did benefit Parkinson's disease which involves among other things an excess of acetylcholine and this amandadine was known right from the time of the virus studies it was known to be an anti-cholinergic drug and it was recognized as an anti-cholinergic when it was being used to improve Parkinson's patients but the Alzheimer's people seeing the success with Parkinson's disease wanted to try it in their population but since they were already treating with something that increased the cholinergic acetylcholine they couldn't very well switch right over to something absolutely opposite to inhibit the cholinergic system so they suddenly discovered that as well as being anti-cholinergic, amandadine and the very similar, memantine, they found that they also inhibit the excitotoxins, the glutamate aspartate excitatory system. So suddenly this anti-cholinergic drug became an anti-excitatory drug and was fit to be used in Alzheimer's patients. In combination with tacrine or the galantamine or other drugs to poison the enzyme, which this new drug was activating.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the history of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's drug development, highlighting the repurposing of amantadine and memantine.

**RAY PEAT:** The stress hormones, rather than pushing higher and higher on the cortisol and adrenaline direction to excite things, run the heart at a faster rate, the body shifts when it sees futility, inability to escape. It can simply switch gears and turn off that system and turn on the acetylcholine cholinergic system. And the confinement, inescapable stress, which is the extreme of isolation, the extreme opposite from enriched environment, this turns on the... The cholinergic dominant system which lowers blood sugar and in consequence lowering the blood sugar activates histamine release. Some of the acetylcholine nerves such as the vagus nerve amplified their influence by releasing histamine which is... It's very similar in its effects to acetylcholine. So you can think of this kind of inescapable stress as turning on the histamine type of cholinergic reaction. So this is really a kind of death situation. This would be going towards death and away from life. Yeah. Biologically.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains how inescapable stress can lead to a shift towards a cholinergic dominant system, characterized by lowered blood sugar and histamine release, which he associates with a "death situation."

**RAY PEAT:** In the learned helplessness experiments of the 60s, Martin Seligman......is the person who made that famous, he's now doing military research, he found that if you almost drowned a rat but saved it, even the rats that saw it being saved would swim on for days before they drowned, and if you put the saved rat back in, the experience of being saved......would cause it to swim much longer than the average rat that might give up after a day. That sounds like the seed of hope to me. Yeah, but if you simply held the rat in your hand until it got the idea that it was powerless, one experience of being unable to escape, you would drop it in the water and it would basically drown in 30 minutes. Wow, wow. Far out. The state of the heart they found was in a turned off state, basically a cholinergic anti-mobilization of energy state.
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat references Martin Seligman's learned helplessness experiments, illustrating how the perception of powerlessness can lead to a state of reduced energy mobilization.

**RAY PEAT:** They do studies and claim that it almost doesn't change the food at all. It seems like the... The idea behind it in part at least is that they could drop supposedly drop their sanitation standards to zero and then rely on their patient to kill bacteria Yeah, yeah, but it does It changes the flavor fairly drastically it gives it a rancid flavor almost instantly But the public gets accustomed to degraded food Yeah
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about food irradiation. Ray Peat expresses skepticism about the claims of minimal impact, suggesting it's a way to mask poor sanitation and alters flavor.

**RAY PEAT:** Um I can't say that I've witnessed any long-term effects myself. I know a lot of people use it for skeletal muscle relaxation. That's its main indication, is to relax skeletal muscle, which is why it's termed an anxiolytic. Yeah, I think ceremoniously when it's used, it's probably ingested in large amounts, and so I think it does have a fairly profound relaxant activity. If you were to use Kava Kava in a, quote, therapeutic sense. The dose would probably be nowhere near as much and you'd probably experience some general anxiolytic action, but not as profound perhaps as you would if you were in a Kava ceremony.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about long-term negative effects of using Kava tonically. Ray Peat states he hasn't witnessed any, and describes its primary use for skeletal muscle relaxation and anxiolytic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** The reason women have five to ten times the number of thyroid problems of all sorts than men do is that their liver... is relatively unable to convert T4 to the active T3 hormone efficiently. In the 1940s, when T4 was synthesized and brought out as a product, it was tested on male medical students, and it worked in them just the same as armor thyroid extract. But they didn't bother testing it on a female population, which...
**CONTEXT:** A caller asks if converting T4 to T3 automatically happens. Ray Peat explains the gender difference in T4 to T3 conversion efficiency, linking it to historical testing practices.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the old normal concentration in the blood of T4 and T3, when the gland was producing it and the liver was activating it, or when a person was using armor thyroid. As a supplement the ratio. Well, I'm not using that so I mean is this working for me or is there a reason for me to take the armor instead or what? Well if you have any symptoms of hypothyroidism remaining then that would mean that your liver isn't activating the T4. Well when they take it when they do the blood test and they say that my my thyroid is at a normal level that's they changed the normal level of previous to the use of pure thyroxin there was a very slight difference like a four to one or ten to one ratio of thyroxin the t3 in the blood but now they consider 50 to one to be normal and are you saying that test the blood test isn't reliable for me to know The blood test has been standardized on a population of people who have been using only thyroxine rather than the natural thyroid or people who have no thyroid problem at all
**CONTEXT:** A caller questions the reliability of blood tests for thyroid function, as their levels are reported as "normal" despite potential issues. Ray Peat explains how the definition of "normal" has shifted with the widespread use of T4.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if your TSH is in the low normal range, and if your temperature and pulse rate... are good, and if you don't have any symptoms, then you're handling it properly. But what are the symptoms of having a low thyroid? Our cold hands and feet are very common. Low blood sugar, anxiety, fatigue, depression, dry skin, edema, inability to go very long without getting hungry, craving sweets.
**CONTEXT:** A caller asks if they should switch to Armour thyroid. Ray Peat outlines the indicators of proper thyroid hormone management: TSH levels, basal body temperature, pulse rate, and the absence of hypothyroid symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** There was a study of people with hyperthyroidism treated by three different kinds of doctors. One did surgery, one did the radioactive iodine to kill the thyroid, and the third group got just the thyroid-suppressing chemical. And the patients on the chemical, most of them, after six months, recovered. And, uh, the......portion, about 30% that didn't recover in six months, with another six months they recovered, just with the suppressing chemical. And then they went on to have a functioning thyroid afterwards, rather than having it destroyed.
**CONTEXT:** A caller describes their experience with hyperthyroidism and the treatment options they chose. Ray Peat shares findings from a study comparing different hyperthyroidism treatments, highlighting the effectiveness of thyroid-suppressing chemicals.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think it's all made from corn starch industrially and You have to Just test it yourself. Some people have a fairly intense quick reaction allergic to it. Other people do beautifully on it. And I'm not sure if it's the person's difference or the product's difference.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about fructose supplements. Ray Peat suggests that industrial production from corn starch may be a factor in individual reactions and recommends self-testing.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you've ever tasted blackstrap molasses, sometimes you can taste smoke in it. And they used to burn. The cane fields, to make them easier to harvest, and so they would be smoky, and then they would boil it down, and the molasses would collect minerals, a lot of nutritious stuff, but also the junk and smoky material. And even with a very clean material, like maple syrup or the... Magade juice, those come out very clean and when they're cooked, the high temperature, if it's browning the sugar, that's breaking down the sugar itself and producing some highly irritating, possibly toxic materials. So if these different sugars were produced properly, they would be great, but we're kind of playing it safe. By just getting white sugar, this is probably the purest form of glucose and fructose, right? Yeah, if they could, for example, be concentrated in a vacuum with a moderate temperature, maybe something like pasteurization temperature, that would be a very safe way to make sugar without having to wash the brown stuff out of it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the preference for white sugar over less refined sugars. Ray Peat explains how processing and high temperatures in less refined sugars can create irritating or toxic byproducts, making purified white sugar a safer option.

**RAY PEAT:** One problem with grapes if you don't wash them very carefully is that the white bloom on the skin if you... if you rub it and polish it that comes off it's because yeast grow on the waxy surface of the skin I've wondered about that because you can almost see it yeah and so the fungus growing on the skin always has its normal amount of estrogen in it which could be a drawback so even if you just chewed it really really well it probably still wouldn't help in that aspect would it? well yeah but a moderate amount of grapes I don't think that amount of irritation is going to worry most people
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the skin of seedless grapes. Ray Peat points out the presence of yeast on the grape skin, which can contain estrogen, and suggests that moderate consumption is unlikely to cause significant issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, it deactivates the enzymes but it doesn't uh destroy the allergens.
**CONTEXT:** A quick addendum question is asked about whether cooking deactivates enzymes in tomato seeds. Ray Peat clarifies that while enzymes are deactivated, allergens remain.

**RAY PEAT:** Clean white salt like sea salt without additives is good.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the type of salt Ray Peat recommends. Ray Peat advises clean white salt, such as sea salt without additives.

**RAY PEAT:** The stress hormones that lead to Alzheimer's disease. Iron is sort of the end point of all of these changes. Nitric oxide and the prostaglandins. Activate enzymes which release and deposit iron in the brain where it then continues amplifying the destructive reactions.
**CONTEXT:** A caller mentions iron deposits in the brain as a factor in Alzheimer's and the potential of turmeric to chelate iron. Ray Peat confirms the role of iron in amplifying destructive reactions in the brain, linking it to stress hormones, nitric oxide, and prostaglandins.
