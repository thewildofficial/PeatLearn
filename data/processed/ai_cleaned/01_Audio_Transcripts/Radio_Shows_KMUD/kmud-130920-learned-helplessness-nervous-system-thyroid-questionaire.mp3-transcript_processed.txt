**RAY PEAT:** In the general way doctors still think about them was a set of ideas established just about now. A hundred years ago, with opposition between the relaxing side and the mobilizing emergency side, and that has tended to be called the fight-or-flight reaction for the sympathetic nervous system that is based largely on adrenaline, the relaxing side. is based mostly on acetylcholine. But in the last 30 or 40 years, a lot of complexity has turned up, even though in the general sense those oppositions are still accurate. But it turns out there's a lot of overlap. Part of the nervous system does things that can also be done by the other side. And each one has more repertoire than just adrenaline or acetylcholine. They can interact in various ways with serotonin, histamine, and so on. The relaxing side of the nervous system, supposedly. The hundred-year-old idea is that it takes care of peristalsis and secretion, largely. And it slows the heart rate for relaxation and weakens the strength of the heart contraction. But it strengthens the peristalsis movement of the intestine. And the wall of the bladder and the ureters stimulates secretion of a lot of glands but it relaxes the sphincters of the intestine and the bladder and gallbladder and such so that it goes with secretion, digestion and excretion. All of the basically vegetative processes.
**CONTEXT:** Could you briefly discuss the two arms of the nervous system, the sympathetic and parasympathetic, before we get into the main topic?

**RAY PEAT:** The place that it started to be understood was in the learned helplessness situation. They saw that when an animal believed it couldn't escape from a stressful situation its heart slowed down instead of accelerating the very same signal that would make an animal's heart race if it was wandering around freely and had the possibility of escaping. If it was in a trapped situation, its heart would slow down and it would give them a little too much stress and threat. Its heart would actually stop in a relaxed position or... without that belief in the impossibility of escape, it would go on struggling for days, swimming in a tank for example, or with the expectation that it wouldn't be able to escape, it might drown in five or six minutes.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned stress-induced excitotoxic effects of the parasympathetics. Could you describe that further, particularly in relation to learned helplessness?

**RAY PEAT:** The brain processes that allow learning and... intelligent behavior. The cholinergic nerves of the brain are very important and as well as the serotonin, adrenaline, and several other types of nerve have to be functioning, but several types of evidence have made doctors concentrate on the loss of the cholinergic system. And... If you stimulate the cholinergic nerves, you can improve learning and behavior. But if you aren't increasing energy to keep up with that increased stimulation, you put the cell in a stress between having to work harder but not having the fuel to do it. So if you're... Cortisol is high, for example, interfering with your ability to use sugar. Or if your blood sugar is simply low and you're being stimulated, then the cell tends to die. And the reasoning that the Alzheimer's disease was simply a wasting away of the cholinergic nerves led to treating it. For the first 10 or 15 years, just with the chemicals to increase excitation of the cholinergic nerves. And that wasn't working at all. People were dying at a higher rate with liver disease and such. But from the 1950s, people were already suggesting treating dementia and other brain degenerative diseases with... atropine and other chemicals that block the cholinergic nerves. And amandadine, which is now used for treating Parkinson's disease, was one of the chemicals considered anti-cholinergic in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. And it... since people were seeing actual improvement with the anti-cholinergic chemicals... Someone said, why not try adding that to the treatment, instead of stopping the excitatory cholinergic drugs? Why not add one of these? So they reclassified them as acting against another excitatory nervous system, the system that causes glutamate, MSG. Nerve toxicity. So they now call it an anti-NMDA chemical, Memantine, which is similar to Amandadine. So it's a very similar chemical which used to be called anti-cholinergic, which is being used for both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. But they still go on with the doctrine that they have to stimulate the cholinergic system too. Even though that has never shown improvement.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the standard treatment for Alzheimer's, how does the current approach, which focuses on stimulating cholinergic nerves, potentially worsen the condition based on current understanding of the nervous system?

**RAY PEAT:** A lot of people by now have heard that uh there is a premenstrual related epilepsy uh that results from an excess of estrogen in relation to progesterone because uh estrogen is excitatory well progesterone is coming and it happens that estrogen intensifies the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system while progesterone tends to relax that. You can see that parasympathetic function of estrogen in the uterus if there's too much estrogen in pregnancy it will cause... strong contractions of the uterus and can cause miscarriage and it's activating if you give the drug they give to treat Alzheimer's which is a pro-cholinergic drug it will cause spasms of the uterus just like estrogen so estrogen is acting with or through that part of the nervous system and when... for about 50 years there was a puzzle about how acetylcholine or the cholinergic nerves could inhibit the heart and the sphincters while causing contractions of the various ducts and intestines and so on and they proposed that something was being released in the cells that combined with acetylcholine... to determine whether it was excitatory or inhibitory but the main thing that happened is that acetylcholine causes cells to produce nitric oxide... the chemicals that became famous with Viagra and Rogaine which causes vasodilation.
**CONTEXT:** You've spoken about estrogen's destructive features and its link to the parasympathetic nervous system. Could you elaborate on how estrogen intensifies the parasympathetic system and its connection to nitric oxide?

**RAY PEAT:** The thyroid and progesterone both interfere with the production of nitric oxide. And in a situation of underfunction of the thyroid gland or system, it's now pretty well established that high blood pressure in the... a very high proportion of the cases is produced by hypothyroidism and because of the belief that nitric oxide it has a beneficial effect of increasing circulation as with Viagra and Rogaine the thought was that hypothyroidism must be lowering nitric oxide, but in fact it increases it while still causing contraction of the blood vessels and tightening up increasing blood pressure. So the effect of thyroid is to stop excess nitric oxide or excess cholinergic function or excess estrogen.
**CONTEXT:** In the presence of adequate metabolic energy, such as sufficient thyroid, would nitric oxide still be able to cause these negative effects?

**RAY PEAT:** The... in situations... They were studying learned helplessness, which produces increased acetylcholine and nitric oxide. They found that either progesterone or thyroid T3 would block the formation of that behavior. It would keep them from dying prematurely. The thyroid and progesterone both interfere with the production of nitric oxide.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that both thyroid and progesterone can block the formation of learned helplessness. How do they achieve this in relation to nitric oxide?

**RAY PEAT:** But what causes DHEA and testosterone to be turned......into estrogen excessively is anything basically causing stress, irritation, inflammation. The enzyme that makes estrogen, aromatase, is activated by anything that stresses cells. The processes that are reversed. by thyroid and progesterone are activated by, for example, prostaglandins which are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids which happen to synergize with estrogen in many ways. The prostaglandins activate the formation of estrogen and progesterone thyroid. And aspirin too will turn off aromatase by, among other things, inhibiting the activity of the enzyme that makes polyunsaturated fats turn into prostaglandins.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding DHEA and its potential conversion to estrogen, what factors, particularly stress and inflammation, influence this process, and how do thyroid and progesterone counteract it?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, in an emergency situation, you can have a good probability of either stopping or reducing the severity of seizures just with progesterone. But in the long run, you want to stop the intake of the polyunsaturated fats that activate estrogen and inhibit thyroid. The degree of unsaturation of the fat corresponds to the degree of interference with thyroid hormone. So fish oil is more anti-thyroid than the seed oils. And these singly unsaturated fats in olive oil, for example......is very weakly anti-thyroid. Butter, coconut oil, cream, beef, and lamb fat, for example, are not anti-thyroid. The traditional diets before 1940, even in the industrial countries, people... commonly got quite a bit of thyroid in their food. If you would stew a chicken or a fish, for example, the thyroid would always break up and be consumed as part of the food. And with that traditional diet, a person probably averaged about the equivalent of maybe 30 milligrams a day of heartworm thyroid in the natural, fresh... glandular material. So the one thing that has contributed to hypothyroidism resulting in high estrogen and overactivity of the parasympathetic excitatory system, one factor is just the removal of natural thyroid from the food supply. But at the same time... The diet has been industrialized to include lots of these seed oils, which are both proestrogen and antithyroid, and in themselves, they are excitatory, produce edema of the brain and so on.
**CONTEXT:** For someone experiencing premenstrual seizures, what is your approach to treatment, and what dietary changes are recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah Vitex has traditionally been a pro progesterogenic uh for sure and definitely used for menstruating women to reduce the severity of symptoms of high estrogen which would typically be edema pms etc mood swings um and long heavy bleeding um just just very briefly did you say dandelion root did you mean dandelion leaf? both of them the root is the strong diuretic and the leaf is a mild diuretic both liver tonic yeah the roots actually a colugog it's more of a bile stimulant and the leaf is specifically a diuretic and it contains potassium so it's better than the ferrucimide and the other so-called potassium sparing diuretics um but anyway i'm more interested in uh helping you out here with dr pete's advice for your epilepsy i think that's probably the most uh the most pertinent part of what you said the minerals are very important too for uh getting the balance of of the nervous system making sure you have enough of all of the alkaline minerals potassium sodium calcium and magnesium and uh fruit and milk are very important for those yeah you recommend i know you recommend magnesium a good source of that is coffee and uh calcium obviously is the milk and dairy products and then sodium was just from regular salt and you do advocate uh people use salt and that's been a whole topic of other previous shows so probably best not to go in that in that direction
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned chaste tree berry (Vitex) as a source of progesterone. What is your understanding of its effects, and how does it compare to other diuretics like dandelion root?

**RAY PEAT:** Well uh decaf is is fine as a source of niacin and magnesium but another good source of all the minerals but especially magnesium is well-cooked green leaves the undercooked greens aren't digestible and and can actually increase your inflammatory nitrate oxide and such and irritation of the intestine from starchy undercooked vegetable matter will by increasing the nitric oxide that causes water retention causes the intestine to suck up water and put it into the bloodstream but it causes the kidneys to lose sodium so the problem that happens with a lot of stress and degenerative conditions is centered around the water retention but imbalance produced by losing sodium too fast. So first aid is just to get your minerals up. For example, resuscitation can be done more efficiently with extremely hyperosmotic concentrated......mineral solution, sodium chloride, for example, six or seven times more concentrated than the physiological solution. Just injecting a small amount of that can bring a person out of shock because it inhibits the formation of nitric oxide, helps the kidneys retain sodium, and starts the system producing energy. But just making sure that you're daily diet. Includes plenty of sodium and and the other alkaline metals is a very helpful
**CONTEXT:** Regarding mineral intake, you mentioned coffee as a source of magnesium. What are your thoughts on coffee's acidity and its impact on mineral absorption, and what are better sources of magnesium and other minerals?

**RAY PEAT:** I was just previously mentioning that hypothyroid people have increased nitric oxide, but at the same time they have a tendency of... too much contraction of the blood vessels and high blood pressure. So at least nitric oxide isn't able to maintain a good blood flow if your thyroid is low. The thyroid does... I think the basic thing that relaxes the blood vessels produced by a thyroid hormone is carbon dioxide. And hypothyroid people tend to have... chronically increased lactic acid in their blood, which displaces carbon dioxide. And carbon dioxide relaxes blood vessels in a very different way than the... interfering with energy supply that nitric oxide does. Carbon dioxide retains a high energy level while relaxing. Partly just by changing the electrical pH behavior of the cell that acidifies the cell which relaxes it and that relaxing effect of increasing carbon dioxide from higher thyroid function makes your capillaries and arterioles relax. And let the blood flow through, providing oxygen to the tissues which then produce more carbon dioxide and keep the system active and circulating. And the carbon dioxide and thyroid both tend to increase the stroke volume of the heart the same way progesterone does. The parasympathetic nervous system and estrogen decrease the stroke volume and weaken the heart. Thyroid has an energizing but relaxing function. It increases the ability of cells to retain magnesium because magnesium is bound. To the ATP energy-carrying molecule and by increasing the oxidation of the cell to produce ATP, the cell then binds magnesium and releases calcium which is the excitatory thing. So, if you have magnesium in your system and are producing carbon dioxide, your cells will retain the relaxing. And you can see that in the way your muscles work, your heart, it shows up in the electrocardiogram as a quick repolarization, getting ready and relaxed, ready for a new stimulation. And in your brain, it shows up as quick transition from wakefulness into sleep at night without having to... go through a lot of preparation. The brain is able to quickly relax by increasing its ATP and oxygen and carbon dioxide.
**CONTEXT:** People often associate thyroid hormone with being a stimulant and causing high blood pressure. Can you explain why this is not true and how thyroid hormone actually promotes relaxation and good blood flow?

**RAY PEAT:** A good person to read on that issue would be Harold Hillman who did experiments with it in England and got fired or got retired prematurely. But it's definitely something Russian research in the early 70s showed that... certain musical tones would cause muscle to increase its ATP production. And that was disregarded because the level of the energy in a given vibration was considered to be too small to exceed the thermal agitation of the molecules of the muscle. But actually the muscle is organized. with long-range structures in the water which form, in effect, an antenna that can receive sound waves of these very low energies. So it's physically very plausible and verified by Harold Hillman.
**CONTEXT:** What is your understanding of claims that listening to sounds at 528 Hz can heal DNA?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1930s, it was demonstrated and graphs were published showing that when a person's thyroid gland was removed, as their metabolic rate declined, the blood cholesterol increased. And when they were given a supplement of thyroid... It was just like a mirror image. As the metabolic rate increased, the cholesterol declined. And at the time, that was just a gross empirical observation, but it allowed many doctors to diagnose hypothyroidism simply by looking at elevated cholesterol in the blood. It was one of the well-recognized signs of hypothyroidism. But when the... The essential fatty acid lowering of the cholesterol and drugs to lower cholesterol came on the scene. It was discouraged, the connection between thyroid and cholesterol, because it was too simple to cure high cholesterol, to correct it, just by correcting the thyroid function. But how it works is that it activates the conversion. of cholesterol to, primarily, pregnenolone and progesterone. And that was demonstrated by pumping blood into an ovary and measuring the amount of cholesterol going in and the amount of progesterone coming out. If they decreased the cholesterol in the blood, the ovary produced less progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** Could you provide a brief breakdown of how thyroid hormone controls cholesterol levels?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it does tend to increase serotonin and serotonin like histamine can increase nitric oxide and set those inflammatory processes in motion. So, 5-HTP is not a good thing to take. It is not? It's not, no.
**CONTEXT:** Is 5-HTP safe to take as a supplement?
