**RAY PEAT:** Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a hundred years ago Hashimoto described it as an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by infiltration of white blood cells. And some people actually stick a needle into the gland of the thyroid gland to diagnose on the basis of how he described it that long ago. But the general principle is that it's an enlarged gland that doesn't produce enough hormone. And so you can make a guess as to its cause by looking at the blood if you see that there seems to be a deficiency of the hormone in the blood and maybe some evidence of inflammation such as proteins and antibodies to the proteins from the thyroid gland. Then they don't bother doing the needle biopsy.

**CONTEXT:** What constitutes Hashimoto's disease in your mind and its characteristic lab findings and the symptoms and the treatment of it?

**RAY PEAT:** Simultaneously, a little before Hashimoto's study, people were seeing various reasons for the enlargement of the thyroid gland. Various poisonings or iodine deficiency was recognized as the main cause of enlargement. And being in Japan, I suppose, was why Hashimoto saw the peculiar inflammation of the thyroid rather than blame it on an iodine deficiency because many people in Japan eat so much iodine that they get thyroiditis from blocking the functions of the gland. And that classically results in increasing the TSH to overcome the blockage by excess iodine. But exactly the same TSH excess is produced by a deficiency of iodine. So what you see typically is a rising TSH driving the gland to work harder as the organism shows signs of decreasing that rate function.

**CONTEXT:** How does the traditional medical diagnosis then differ?

**RAY PEAT:** The identity of an antibody isn't really as clear as a lot of people assume. They've found that there's a great cross-reaction between thyroid antibodies and joint antibodies. And that explains why people with thyroiditis and hypothyroidism so often have arthritis and joint problems. And the whole issue of explaining disease as blaming it on the immune system attacking the body. If you wrench your knee and sort of damage the cartilage, they've done experiments in rabbits, taking a piece of foreign cartilage like from a cow, it will produce very few antibodies in the rabbit, but if you twist it a little bit, structurally damage it, then it produces a terrific immune reaction. Any organ that gets strained or overworked tends to leak some of its proteins. And the immune system's function largely is to clean up any mess. In fact, there is an alternative interpretation of what the immune system is doing, rather than looking for foreign invading pathogens. This theory says it's primarily cleaning up messes caused by anything which is pathogenic. So, in one of the so-called autoimmune brain conditions, people have demonstrated that the presence of the antibody to the brain tissue accelerates the recovery. So, cleaning up the mess is really constructive, rather than always being the cause of deterioration.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned before that, for example, in Hepatitis C, the antibodies that are generally measured to show a degree of severity are actually a bad way of looking at it, because actually the antibodies to it are very important in mopping up the damage.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's Duisburg's basic objection to the whole AIDS-HIV theory, but it applies to the hepatitis C at least as much as to HIV. Right, and that the initial insult perhaps to the liver, whether it be through PUFA or radiation, or any other external stresses, are in its own right. Decades ago the Egyptian government had a campaign to give a very toxic drug to the whole population because of a parasite that they were eliminating. And that poison causes liver damage, and now a tremendous proportion, roughly half of the Egyptian population, I think it was, showed evidence of Hepatitis C. I think it's just the after-effect of that poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** You always look at the necessity to get the TSH down, the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, which is normally quite elevated in Hashimoto's.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, it's well-established lately, the last several years, that TSH itself causes many of the symptoms blamed on hypothyroidism. It acts on the bone marrow and many other tissues, the liver, producing increasing inflammatory cytokine chemicals. And so in itself, it's a basic problem of hypothyroidism, I think. Right, because you've always said that TSH, in its own right, is a chaperone for other immune or inflammatory molecules. And so in a normal healthy person, it's a good idea to try and get the TSH as close to zero as possible.

**CONTEXT:** Does it have any benefits, I mean apart from stimulating the production or release of thyroid hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** My newsletter on osteoporosis a couple years ago went over the arguments that they were using to say that it prevents osteoporosis, but I think the references that I give in there show that basically it's just increasing the load of inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** In terms of the standard medical treatment for Hashimoto's, I think it's probably true enough to say that thyroxine is the main compound that they will give to a person to treat it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, if they give enough. There have been some studies in which the antibodies tend to disappear after about six months of keeping the TSH under control.

**CONTEXT:** So, in your opinion, because I know we've seen quite a few people that have been previously treated with thyroxine that were not getting a lot of symptom relief. I mean, in terms of the compound, what do you think of its efficacy or its ability to do its job?

**RAY PEAT:** It, in itself, in almost every situation, will suppress the TSH. Even though T3 can do it, and sometimes maybe two or three percent of the people need T3 to work on the pituitary to suppress the TSH, but women in particular have five or ten times as much thyroid disease as men, and the reason is that estrogen interferes with the liver's ability to convert thyroxine to the active T3 hormone. And if your liver isn't producing some T3, your gland, which produces a ratio of about three parts of thyroxine to one part of the active hormone, if you give that person big doses of thyroxine, you're going to turn off that little bit of active hormone coming out of their thyroid gland when you suppress the TSH, and they'll go into an increasingly hypothyroid state. And that has caused a lot of doctors to think of people being simultaneously hypothyroid and hyperthyroid, which doesn't make sense unless you see that they're interfering with the liver's ability to activate the hormone. And some people have argued that one of the needs for TSH is to induce the local enzymes in the various tissues, such as the liver, which do the conversion. But there have been several studies showing that you don't absolutely need the TSH to do that activation of the deiodinase enzymes in the various tissues. That other signals from other glands will maintain the activating enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** So, in terms of someone presenting with Hashimoto's, you're saying that it is reasonable to assume that thyroxine in its own right would be the treatment of choice.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah, especially in men, but since women are the main people who have Hashimoto's, it's very likely to bring on symptoms. It's very reasonable to try it, but as soon as they start getting symptoms of worse hypothyroidism, then it is time to give them the complete thyroid hormone. And that's, like you said, it's because of the estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Your most recent newsletter, the Cataract newsletter, has a lot to deal with estrogen being a pro-inflammatory stress-mediating chemical that attenuates the effects of other things in the body.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the industry is periodically creating new myths about estrogen. And one of the things they're currently pushing. Several years ago they went through a wave of claiming that estrogen was an antioxidant, and even though it's primarily an oxygen-wasting, pro-oxidative mediator, now they're pushing the idea that estrogen is anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** My entire medical history is in that book [Brota Barnes' Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Illness]. I am having a little bit of trouble. I know how to follow instructions. He suggests that we put the thermometer under our arm for ten minutes before we get out of bed in the morning. When I did that, I averaged over an 18-day period 96.4. But that's not what I'm... My goal in telling you this, I started to get creative after I did that, and maybe that's my mistake, I don't know. I started to put the thermometer under my arm again for 10 minutes, you know, subsequent 10-minute increments, and I found that it was... my temperature was continuing... the mercury was continuing to rise. Now, even though, you know, like 97, for example, is still low... but it's higher than 96.4, or sometimes it's 95.8 or something. I guess what I'm wondering is, I really want to find a way of accurately gauging my temperature and hopefully thereby my, you know, metabolic rate, so that I don't, when I start to treat myself, flip over into Graves' disease. Have I just, you know, wasted time? Should I just revert to Dr. Barnes's temperature test and go back to the 10 minutes? Or should I experiment with this a little bit?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it would be good if you could do it for half an hour or whatever it takes to stabilize. But the trouble is that hypothyroid people have low tissue metabolism. And that often goes with a high adrenaline which cuts off circulation to your skin, fingers, toes, keeps the circulation going primarily to your brain, heart, lungs. And so especially if you are overweight, the skin and subcutaneous fat can take a couple of hours to reach core temperature if you're bundled, thoroughly insulated. It's good to check your eardrum temperature, mouth temperature, as well as your armpit temperature while noticing the temperature of your fingers and toes and tip of your nose.

**CONTEXT:** Is there a significant difference in a basal temperature thermometer? I mean, they have these separate thermometers called basal thermometers. What is that?

**RAY PEAT:** They're just marked off so you can read them more easily and tense, but I don't think the small differences are that important for the thyroid guesswork. If you notice that your oral temperature is at all low and your fingers and toes are colder than other people's, that's a good sign that your metabolic rate is low. If you consider the amount of calories you need per day compared to other people, that's a good indication of your thyroid metabolic rate. And the amount of water that you evaporate is a very good indicator. A person should take in two quarts more fluid than they lose per day in urine. That two quarts would be an average evaporation if your thyroid is good. But many people evaporate less than a quarter day, meaning that we're waterlogged! Yeah, and instead of being evaporated, the low thyroid person tends to retain water. And there are so many indications, other than temperature. I first started playing Barnes' technique one hot, humid summer in Eugene when it was about 95 degrees and even people who could hardly move, they were so hypothyroid, were very close to normal temperature and I realized that a squash sitting on the counter would show a normal metabolic rate if you went just by temperature. And so checking your pulse rate and the temperature of your fingers and toes in a cool room, those are more sensitive indicators.

**CONTEXT:** So if I'm... I remember you writing that if people use an electric blanket at night, you place less value on the basal temperature. Am I remembering correctly?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, same thing as in a hot, humid climate. If you keep the temperature up artificially, even a dead person will be warm.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, this is actually bad news for me because I'm in a heated room when I'm doing this. My temperature may be even lower. I don't want to take up too much of your time. But I think what you're saying is it's more, perhaps, more of an art than a science in some respect. Just because getting the absolute... An absolute gauge on this is going to be very difficult because of there are so many variables. Am I approximating what you're saying?

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. It's the whole function. The best single test would be how much oxygen you breathe in and how much carbon dioxide you exhale. That's actually showing what's going on chemically. And you can't produce a normal amount of carbon dioxide by being overstressed or high in estrogen. Other things will happen other than producing carbon dioxide as you burn your fuel. So the old-fashioned 1930s basal metabolic rate by breathing oxygen and blowing out carbon dioxide, that was the real thyroid test. It's just a very rough approximation of how much fuel you're burning. The pulse rate...

**CONTEXT:** Where can I go to read more about what you just said? Is there something I can do at home?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, my website has several articles about it. And something else you have to do is notice the changes during the day because low thyroid people typically don't know what they're doing during the day. They compensate with stress hormones increasing. Sometimes mainly adrenaline, sometimes mostly cortisol, others including serotonin will increase, especially at night. Histamine often increases at night. And all of the stress hormones make your tissue metabolize, but not in an energy-producing way, but an energy-wasting way. And if you take an overdose of cortisol and adrenaline, the adrenaline will make your skin get cold, the cortisol will make you break down your muscle tissue and glandular tissue to turn to sugar, and that will heat your body up. And some people wake up with a 98 or 99 degree temperature, but then when they eat breakfast by 10 or 11 in the morning, their temperature might have fallen to 94 or 95 degrees. This explains a great deal for me personally, so I thank you very, very much.

**CONTEXT:** If someone has a high starting temperature in the morning when they're in bed before they get out of bed, and then they have breakfast and the temperature falls.

**RAY PEAT:** That was during the time when she tended to be manic and be under the influence of too much adrenaline and other excitatory things. And so I suggested that she take enough thyroid to get her pulse and temperature to be steadier during the day. Within a few days, she had stabilized so that her morning temperature was a couple of degrees lower, but increased after eating, instead of decreasing. And since doing that, she stopped having her annual up and down cycles.

**CONTEXT:** So just on the recap of what you said a little while ago about cold peripheries, so fingers, toes, nose, ears, this kind of person that you just mentioned would have cold extremities, because that would be adrenaline would be driving that. As a vasoconstrictor, but yet their core temperature would be high because of cortisol and the stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** In general, and you have to check your pulse rate at the same time, because if your cortisol is extremely high and destroying things at a terrific rate, then you're making enough heat to keep your hands and feet warm, even. But in that situation, your adrenaline is going to be lower to let out the heat through your skin. And so if you have a very high temperature and the normal pulse rate, and then the temperature falls after you eat, your pulse rate is probably going to get slower still.

**CONTEXT:** So for a low starting temperature in the morning, so someone's in bed, they're taking their temperature and their pulses before they wake and start moving around and generating heat. So if they have a low starting temperature... And that falls after breakfast.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, that's still stress plus hypothyroidism.

**CONTEXT:** And then how about if they have a low starting temperature and it doesn't change after breakfast, it stays the same?

**RAY PEAT:** They probably didn't eat the right things. If you get enough sugar in and protein and the essential catalytic nutrients, B vitamins and such, then if you have any function of your thyroid gland at all, you're going to feed your liver enough that it should, just by feeding it sugar, it should start producing a little bit of T3, which would warm you.

**CONTEXT:** How about the pulses, then? If someone's taking their pulse in bed in the morning, along with the temperature, and they have a low pulse, and then that pulse rises after breakfast.

**RAY PEAT:** That probably means that their T3 is going up from eating some carbohydrate and increasing their general energy, so their blood is circulating more, and that's something that I've seen most often in women when they're premenstrual and having high estrogen blocking their thyroid, they'll get very cold when they get hungry and everything will slow down and then when they eat they'll warm up and the pulse will increase.

**CONTEXT:** Now how about if somebody, again, this is breakfast time and the person's in bed before they wake, before they move around, if they have a high pulse and then this rises after breakfast?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sometimes that happens when they eat eggs without enough carbohydrate. If you're already tending to have hypoglycemia, eating eggs will stimulate insulin secretion, drop your blood sugar more and cause a surge of adrenaline. And it depends on how you feel. If you're really increasing your thyroid and warming your metabolism up, you'll feel good when the pulse goes up. But if you feel like you're about to faint or go into shock, that happens from eating too much protein without carbohydrate.

**CONTEXT:** And that adrenaline makes you shaky then?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And some people wake up cyclically during the night. When I was counseling dieters, there were some very fat people who would wake up. One of them woke up every hour during the night. And the other one, I think, was sleeping an hour and a half or so. And I got them to set an alarm clock to wake themselves up about five or ten minutes before their expected waking and to eat anything with carbohydrate, milk or juice or even a cracker or something. And to do that every hour and within a week they were sleeping through the night and then they were able to start losing weight. Those stress hormones that raise your temperature and pulse rate around dawn, they are also increasing the blood sugar. So in diabetics, they call it the dawn phenomenon. But it's the result of the stress hormones that rise during the night. The darkness itself is causing stress, activating hormones. And so in the winter, people are more likely to have disturbed sleep because of long nights. And getting extra carbohydrate late in the day can help you sleep longer without those episodes of usually it's nightmares waking people up with a pounding heart.

**CONTEXT:** That's the adrenaline, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. One other quick question and then there is a quarter. So... The last example would be perhaps a high pulse that falls after breakfast.

**RAY PEAT:** That's good. That's the carbohydrate lowering the adrenaline. And when the temperature goes up and your pulse goes down, that's what breakfast should do.

**CONTEXT:** The caller is concerned with the approaching Fukushima radiation plume and asks about the effects of radiation, especially concerning the thyroid, and what to do to prevent it as far as iodization of the thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** My first newsletter, 30-some years ago, was on radiation defense. And I read everything that was available at that time, regarding protecting against radiation and repairing the damage. And the research since then has pretty much confirmed what was available then. That keeping your metabolic rate up accelerates the repair process faster than the injury. And progesterone decreases the injury. Thyroid increases the rate of repair. All kinds of stress create signals from the injured cells that travel through the rest of your body. And so no matter if your face is x-rayed by a dentist, your whole body, the gonads, are going to be affected by these substances emitted by the injured cells. So in the 1950s, Russian researchers had noticed that total body irradiation had an estrogenic effect. It would cause animals to go into estrus, and that was blamed generally on causing the pituitary hormones to be activated. People could do it just by irradiating the head, but the Russian researchers irradiated the animal's foot and produced the same whole-body estrogenic effect, showing that estrogen and radiation are producing these toxins that communicate to all cells of the body, and that's why thyroid and progesterone have a basic protective effect against radiation. The whole nutritional support system. Magnesium is the element that's most closely involved in repairing radiation damage after your thyroid is activated. The cells take up magnesium and enzymes are activated that do the repair process when you have adequate magnesium with your thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** And that would be from the green leafy broths that you recommend?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. So whether it's chard or kale, dark green leafy broths, pretty rich in magnesium.

**CONTEXT:** With reference to temperature and pulses, are the morning changes reflective of a similar metabolism seen in the lunchtime temperature and pulses?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if your temperature hasn't stabilized by 10 or 11 in the morning, a low thyroid person will often, especially a woman with high estrogen and low progesterone, the temperature and pulse rate might both fall before lunch, or they might have an adrenaline attack and have a shock sensation with a fast, weak pulse. And so the effect of feeding, you can interpret it the same for lunch or breakfast.

**CONTEXT:** So, and how about if the temperature doesn't reach 98.6 or the pulse never gets over 70 in the mid-afternoon. How do you view that?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, people have their chronic adaptation and some people can stay very well at those average numbers, but on average, people have the greatest ability to resist stress and recuperate from injury if their temperature is a little above average and their pulse rate is a little above average. So your health can be very good for most of your life, but you will have more resilience if your metabolic rate is higher.

**CONTEXT:** If the temperature is higher than 98.6 in the afternoon in the post. It's over a hundred.

**RAY PEAT:** The brain and the immune system, for example, the optimum temperature seems to be around 101, maybe even a little higher. And I've also mentioned you, I've also remember you mentioning that the immune system is less than, if you want to say the immune system as an organism functioning at a hundred percent being optimal, if your temperature doesn't reach 98.6 you are not running at a hundred percent of your immune ability?

**RAY PEAT:** Probably. Usually you can see some evidence in your blood tests that is unnecessarily high TSH or other pituitary hormones indicating that you are driving your endocrine system and immune system unnecessarily hard. When things are running very smoothly on the cellular level, endocrine system and immune system don't have to do very much. The tissue cells take care of things all by themselves.

**CONTEXT:** My brother who also has had problems falling asleep and staying asleep has been taking it [Valerian] with me and we're really, you know, it's definitely improving our sleeping patterns and I was just wondering if... Do you know of any possibility of developing a dependence on Valerian or if it's counter indicated for any other medications or if you know anything about that being a problem in practice?

**RAY PEAT:** No, well I'll put it this way. I know Valerian works on GABA channels. But I think that using a drug of that sort, it's protective, but it is potentially habit-forming. Right. And besides my own experience when I took thyroid, being able to relax and sleep soundly. On one of my trips, talking to doctors and such, I ran into a doctor who looked horrible, said he hadn't slept for three nights. And I mentioned my experience with thyroid and gave him 10 micrograms of Cytomel. And the next night at my talk, he pulled me aside. Before introducing me, and said that stuff's better than morphine.
