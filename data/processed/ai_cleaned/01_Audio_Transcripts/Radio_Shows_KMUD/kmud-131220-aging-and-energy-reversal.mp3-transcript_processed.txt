**RAY PEAT:** "In the 60s I had been working in linguistics but on my own studying I was very interested in general questions of aging and the brain in particular and how the brain makes consciousness and language possible and how that changes during maturation and aging and so I enrolled at the University of Oregon thinking I would study brain biology in 1968 and found that the brain biology people were extremely dogmatic thinking in terms only of genetic control, membrane functions, and nothing much in between. And I looked around the department and found that the reproductive biologists seemed to be more scientific and actually looking for an explanation rather than trying to explain things in terms of what they believed they knew. So I worked on reproductive aging and our lab specialized in the female aging, and I concentrated on the energy, oxidative metabolism, and the changes occurring in the uterus with aging. I found that all kinds of stress converge with the changes that you see during aging, especially in the reproductive system. It was like the lining of the uterus was a very good model for things that happen in the brain and the whole organism. And all types of stress, from radiation to bad diet, vitamin E deficiency, deficiency of oxygen, all of these things, mimicked the changes that you see in aging, and basically that's the area that I've been thinking about a lot ever since."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to provide an outline of his academic and professional background.

**RAY PEAT:** "Luther Burbank was a person who explored the influence of the environment. Many biologists from the time of Blumark down through Barbara McClintock was ignored until just about 20 years ago they sort of pulled her out of obscurity before she died. These people had demonstrated that the need for a function could elicit the function in an organism so that a stressful environment would cause changes in the chromosomes. Barbara McClintock referred to jumping genes but these things were actual movement of DNA elicited by stress in the environment and all of these people for almost 200 years were excluded from science by a very dogmatic view of genetics. All of these dogmatic view of the geneticists of the 20th century are now defunct completely but they live on in practice in medicine."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to explain epigenetic modification and how environmental factors can influence gene expression, contrasting this with the modern view of genetics being fixed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and constantly, like they put 40 mice, I think, was in a stimulating environment. And found that just by the choices they made in their daily life, they became very different in personality and behavior. Just by where they happened to go in the environment, influencing what they learned, and over their lifetime, they became very recognizable individuals. And that would really upset medicine, you see. We had to consider everyone as a unique individual, all the way down to the way their genes worked. Because there would be no... It would be too considerate. Yeah, no exact definition of a disease would be your disease this month."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about what might cause individual mice in a study to have different outcomes based on their environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The genes are being used constantly. Everything you do is using your genes in a certain way that varies according to whether you're awake or asleep, for example. But if you're starving day after day, this is going to pull up an accumulation of changes, not just a quick on-and-off effect of day and night or incidental experiences, but it will accumulate sort of an inertia, and layer after layer will be laid down in the stuff around your genes, attaching carbon atoms to the DNA itself and attaching a great variety of molecules to the proteins that handle the genes, the histones that surround the chromosomes and move the genes to make them accessible for copying and functioning. These are relatively easy to change. The methylation is a little more sluggish. And when you're in an extremely stressful situation, a lot of your genes get turned off, methylated especially, and those can be identified in the chromosomes that you inherit from your father or mother specifically. So that if your father had a very hard life, you can identify the highly methylated genes in your chromosomes that came from that hard life. So that's inheritable then. Yeah. And in animal experiments it takes several generations for a very bad generations experience to be removed when they're put into a normal environment. But if you put them into a super environment like the... An enriched environment. Enriched, yeah. Very stimulating. You can repair the previous generation's damage very quickly, and some nutrients and drugs can do that. Remove methyl groups from the DNA and attach more of the opening groups to the histones."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how stress and environmental factors lead to methylation of DNA and histones, which can be inherited.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, it was definite about 70 years ago a researcher named Clive McCabe, I think it was, showed that restricting the food supply made animals live longer, but later people restricted the type of food, kept down the heavy metals in their diet alone and let them eat all the fat, protein and carbohydrate they wanted, and they lived longer."

**CONTEXT:** The host questions the idea that fasting or caloric restriction is beneficial for longevity, and Dr. Peat clarifies the research on food restriction.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, the main aromatase inhibitor that I'm familiar with is from nettle root and that's really used as a kind of prosthetic agent in men to treat benign prosthetic hypertrophy by blocking that enzyme. In terms of your condition and what you said about the weight gain and your age, it's not uncommon. At all for what you're saying to occur as it happens. I think it happens fairly fairly commonly."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about aromatase inhibitors to reduce estrogen and mentions early menopause, weight gain, and Hashimoto's. Dr. Peat discusses nettle root as an aromatase inhibitor.

**RAY PEAT:** "Almost everyone around the age of 40, that's when the highest ratio of estrogen to progesterone exists, but the trouble is, estrogen seems to drop when you measure it in the serum, even though it was at its very highest lifetime level around the age of 40. When progesterone falls, the estrogen can't be released from the cell and so it doesn't appear in the serum until progesterone affects the cells to release it so that it can be measured, but that means that even without taking something to increase your progesterone, the aromatase inhibitors are very practical and logical, two fruits that contain effective aromatase inhibitors are oranges and guavas, and apigenin, so this is narinjanin, yeah and oranges and then in guavas I think there's one called apigenin, apigenin, okay, apigenin, okay, and aspirin. By blocking the production of inflammatory prostaglandins, aspirin helps. And the supplement, pregnenolone, is indirectly able to increase your progesterone and lower the estrogen production."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the estrogen-progesterone ratio around age 40, the measurement of estrogen, and suggests oranges, guavas, and aspirin as aromatase inhibitors. He also mentions pregnenolone.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, when your estrogen is not being controlled, it likely over-activates your adrenals. The DHA tends to go up with cortisol, and cortisol is a major activator of aromatase, and the function of pregnenolone is to lower the excess cortisol and prevent the overstimulation of aromatase."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if taking pregnenolone would increase already high DHEA levels. Dr. Peat explains how pregnenolone can help regulate cortisol and aromatase.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sometimes the pregnenolone in itself can do that by lowering the stress hormones which drive the adrenal glands too hard. And the diet to correct your low thyroid function is probably the basic thing. Estrogen causes basically inflammation of the thyroid gland, it inhibits the ability to secrete thyroid hormone while allowing it to synthesize it and respond to thyroid stimulating hormone. And progesterone is needed for the gland to secrete, so you want to do things that lower order. The stress on your thyroid and polyunsaturated fats are probably the most important factor in blocking the thyroid other than estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how pregnenolone can help by lowering stress hormones and discusses the impact of estrogen and polyunsaturated fats on thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Two quarts of low-fat milk will provide a pretty ideal amount of calcium."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about calcium intake. Dr. Peat recommends two quarts of low-fat milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, with one percent milk, there's enough to slow the absorption of the sugar and protein slightly, but not enough fat to upset your gallbladder."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if low stomach acid and lack of a gallbladder would affect calcium absorption from milk. Dr. Peat explains the effect of low-fat milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "The fillers definitely aren't good. If you have access to nothing but the pills, I think you should dissolve them in hot water to let the junk settle out and then just drink the sour water."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about the purity of aspirin and the use of willow bark as an alternative. Dr. Peat advises dissolving aspirin pills in hot water to remove fillers.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, and it costs maybe a quarter a day or something."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if aspirin is a controlled substance. Dr. Peat confirms it is not.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, no. There were experiments in the 1940s in which rats were fed stuff out of cans. The usual vegetables, beans, corn, all the standard vegetables, and others were fed the same vegetables, fresh and raw, and the animals eating canned vegetables thrived. The others didn't."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about the nutritional impact of pressure cooking and canning food. Dr. Peat cites 1940s experiments showing canned vegetables were beneficial.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the well-cooked green leaves are extremely good nutritionally, especially to balance meat, because the greens contain very little phosphate and the meat contains much. Too much phosphate and too little calcium, so you've got to balance when you have greens with meat."

**CONTEXT:** The caller discusses a recipe for canned potatoes, kale, garlic, onion, and lamb, and Dr. Peat comments on the nutritional balance of greens with meat.

**RAY PEAT:** "A lot of people are sensitive either to magnesium chloride or calcium chloride. So it's good to be cautious with it. It can cause headaches and bowel symptoms of various types."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about calcium chloride as an additive in pickles. Dr. Peat advises caution due to potential sensitivities.

**RAY PEAT:** "The color mentioned the importance of light, and even light. Can help to reverse the toxic methylation that happens from stress. Okay, to switch off that excitotoxicity. Yes."

**CONTEXT:** The host refers to the BBC article mentioning NAD and asks Dr. Peat for his thoughts on compounds like curcumin, resveratrol, genistein, and diazine, and the role of light. Dr. Peat confirms light's role in reversing stress-induced methylation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of the people who have been told that they have mutated genes are being told by their doctors that they need to eat lots of methyl groups, choline and methionine in particular, to make up for the weak gene enzyme. But the American Medical Genetics College of Medical Genetics recently said that mutation doesn't call for basically any treatment, it's not significant clinically. But they didn't mention that people with that so-called mutation have a lower incidence of cancer. And this probably relates to what we're talking about, the epigenetic. Methylation of the genes of the people who have a slightly weaker methylation system are better off for cancer risk."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about counteracting methylation in genetics, and Dr. Peat discusses the misconception of needing to supplement methyl groups for "mutated" genes and how a weaker methylation system can be protective against cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, these are being studied in several types of cancer prostate, breast, pancreas, lung and melanoma are the ones I've seen and its effects are just dramatic for reversing those changes that are characteristic of the cancer so it's being considered as a important new approach to cancer treatment, but it's so cheap that no one is very enthusiastic about applying to the FDA."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about lidocaine and procaine having demethylation activity and their use in cancer therapy. Dr. Peat confirms their dramatic effects in reversing cancer-related genetic changes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, women in particular are very susceptible to too much tryptophan. I mean, they used to be the victims of pellagra much more often than men. That's because estrogen redirects the metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin rather than niacin or niacinamide. And when corn is treated with alkali to make hominy or tortillas the chemistry shifts it over in that pathway, makes niacin out of it, and doesn't let so much serotonin be formed."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions NAD synthesis from tryptophan and asks about the potential negative effects of excess tryptophan, particularly in women. Dr. Peat explains tryptophan metabolism and its relation to estrogen and niacin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, it's fine. And another amino acid that's being promoted a lot in the internet world is either arginine or citrulline. To increase your nitric oxide, that's going exactly in the wrong direction, epigenetically. And the vitamin B6 is needed to prevent tryptophan being turned into too much serotonin and to help turn it into niacinamide. And simply supplementing niacinamide is a very direct way to help reverse these epigenetic problems."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about asparagus juice as a source of NAD synthesis and mentions arginine and citrulline. Dr. Peat clarifies that asparagus juice is fine, warns against arginine/citrulline for nitric oxide, and highlights the benefits of vitamin B6 and niacinamide.

**RAY PEAT:** "But I think now they've changed their story and the facts, even at that time, five years ago, it was very clear that niacinamide greatly extended cell life, just a tremendous increase in human cell longevity in vitro, and it's very safe so it can be used in all of these epigenetic problems. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, various types of cancer and so on. And it's interesting that all of these substances that have been known for some of them for thousands of years as anti-inflammatory drugs, they all turn out to work in the same direction, protecting us from over-methylation....over removal of the acetyl groups from the histones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the interaction between niacinamide and resveratrol, and Dr. Peat explains the benefits of niacinamide for cell longevity and its role in addressing epigenetic problems.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, that particular one was just novocaine, pro-caine."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks to clarify the substance used with alcohol on the shin to treat eczema. Dr. Peat identifies it as novocaine (procaine).

**RAY PEAT:** "It's about ten or fifteen years ago the FDA was attacking the laxatives of that class such as aloe and cascara as potential causes of cancer but as soon as they took it off the market they did. Cancer industry started getting interested in it and it relieves or cures many kinds of cancer and it turns out not to have any of the harmful effects that the FDA was claiming and its mechanism seems to involve not only the usual anti-inflammatory things but a real basic reprogramming. Demethylation and inhibiting the histone deacetylase enzymes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about emodin, an anthraquinone found in Pau de Arco, and its use in cancer therapy. Dr. Peat discusses its history, FDA actions, and its mechanism involving demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibition.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and I think the nervous system is probably involved in that. Helping, okay, helping with the memory and there is... All the skin doctors can say is we can replace the skin there. There is a little known branch of medicine, I think it was a German who originated, I think it was called neural therapy or something like that, but it involved finding key points and injecting procaine or other local anesthetic to change the nervous system, and I've seen a great variety of good results from applying any of the local anesthetics topically. It apparently helps to retrain the memory of the tissue so that it stops producing the recurrent problem. Such as an ingrown toenail or recurring boils in a certain location."

**CONTEXT:** A caller describes recurrent blistering and skin issues after a burn. Dr. Peat suggests neural therapy and topical application of local anesthetics to retrain tissue memory.

**RAY PEAT:** "You could definitely try that, because it does sound like there's some kind of imprinted memory in what happened for that to come back."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises the caller with recurrent skin issues to try an anesthetic cream.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, these are being studied in several types of cancer prostate, breast, pancreas, lung and melanoma are the ones I've seen and its effects are just dramatic for reversing those changes that are characteristic of the cancer so it's being considered as a important new approach to cancer treatment, but it's so cheap that no one is very enthusiastic about applying to the FDA."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the use of lidocaine for suppressing bladder cancer cell growth. Dr. Peat confirms its dramatic effects in reversing cancer-related genetic changes and its low cost hindering FDA application.

**RAY PEAT:** "It works by itself or with any of the other protective inhibitors. Caffeine has some of the same effects and aspirin and caffeine have been used together in a lot of products, so a combination. All of these seem to work synergistically, rather than interfering with each other."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the co-administration of aspirin with deacetylase inhibitors. Dr. Peat states they work synergistically, including with caffeine.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you look at the molecule for Pau de Arco, is that the same as Lapacho? Yeah. If you put vitamin K and Emodin and Lapachon in a row and tetracycline, the antibiotic which is an anti-inflammatory, they're essentially the same structure with a different number of rings, but it's like each one is an analog of the other and each one has properties overlapping with those of the other, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-stress."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the structural similarity between Pau de Arco and Lapacho, and Dr. Peat explains their analogous structures and overlapping properties with vitamin K, emodin, and tetracycline.
