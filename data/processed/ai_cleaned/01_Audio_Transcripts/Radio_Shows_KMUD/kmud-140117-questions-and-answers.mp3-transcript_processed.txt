**RAY PEAT:** I taught in several areas, my first teaching job happened to be biology oriented towards physics majors but I also taught literature and painting and then I decided to concentrate on biology, physiology intending to concentrate on the brain because of my interest in language but because of the doctrinaire nature of the nerve biology people I went into the reproductive physiology and aging happened to be a specialty of the Soderwall in particular several of the physiology people were interested in the age related changes so that's what I did my dissertation on 1972.

**CONTEXT:** Could you give us a resume of your professional and academic background?

**RAY PEAT:** When I first was interested in biology, I saw that pre-eclampsia was one of the most dogmatic areas of medicine and until fairly recently about 30 years ago, almost all doctors were were taught that it is a genetic related disease, sort of intended to kill off poor people because poor people had a very high incidence of preeclampsia and other pregnancy related problems. And the idea was that the mother's nutrition had nothing to do with the development of the baby. Bad genes in the baby were possibly poisoning the mother was a theory, but Tom Brewer, a medical doctor who happened to actually study nutrition, was instrumental in gradually over a period of 30 years changing that medical dogma. It still isn't very clearly understood, but two people influenced by him were Douglas Shanklin and Jay Hodin, who wrote a book about, I guess, 40 years ago now, called Maternal Nutrition and Child Health. And Tom Brewer had found that just having the women salt their food to taste and drink at least a quart, maybe two quarts of milk a day, but to definitely get 80 grams or more of protein per day. And he said that what was currently popular at that time for controlling the blood pressure of eclampsia, related to the idea that blood pressure in anyone with hypertension could be controlled by restricting salt. And that idea was promoted by the drug industry when they came out with diuretics that were supposed to lower pure blood pressure by causing you to lose salt in the urine. So that was applied unscientifically to the high blood pressure of preeclampsia and it was killing and causing defects in the babies by starving their brains by reducing the blood volume. Tom Brewer observed that a farmer who restricted the sodium for his pregnant pigs would soon go out of business. But it took a long time to stop that sort of barbaric pharmaceutical instigated practice. The book by Shanklin and Hodin cited some studies in which the only intervention was to supplement sodium several grams extra a day. And those studies showed that in some cases just increasing the amount of salt in the diet was enough to correct the blood pressure by increasing the volume of fluid and blood so that there was enough blood in circulation to properly oxygenate the fetus. And with proper oxygenation, then the kidney could regulate things so that the production of aldosterone decreased. Salt intake is directly related to the suppression of aldosterone, which increases blood pressure. So when you restrict salt, you increase aldosterone, which increases blood pressure. So in Tom Brewer's approach, since he recommended milk, a couple quarts of milk, and fruit vegetables, he was also increasing on average their calcium and vitamin D intake. And those happen to be very protective for blood pressure in general and especially in preeclampsia. So the almost exact opposite of what the current recommendations are, they're normally salt restriction and the dietary advice is definitely not in keeping with what you just mentioned.

**CONTEXT:** What's your general impression of pre-eclampsia and the best approach to its treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** The basic idea is to increase the protein content of the mother's diet and increase the salt intake and the calcium and calcium and vitamin D.

**CONTEXT:** So the basic idea is to increase the protein content of the mother's diet and increase the salt intake and the calcium and calcium and vitamin D?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. The best source of protein includes gelatin, milk, cheese, eggs, and among the vegetables, potatoes.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think is your best the best source of protein?

**RAY PEAT:** The fibrous tissue replaces the normal elastic tissue with aging in general. But inflammation can accelerate it. Stress and inflammation in a particular area will stimulate the production of too much collagen, overgrowth of fibrous tissue. And that happens in the heart when it's being overworked or undernourished. And the valve happens to just be an area which is constantly being stretched and stressed by the amount of work it does. And one of the mediators of inflammation that can be triggered just by stretching is serotonin. And people who have an intestinal disease that overproduces serotonin very often have that particular problem of valve fibrosis and narrowing of the blood vessels. And so looking at the general diet, avoiding intestinal irritation will, in many cases, lower the exposure to serotonin in all of the tissues and will especially protect the heart. Some of the drugs that increase both serotonin and dopamine, both of those happen to intensify the production of fibrous tissue. So the SSRIs, you'll be talking about here? Yeah, in particular. Those are the worst. Commonly, currently very common medications. Yeah. And the things that cause inflammation generally, so aspirin is very protective against almost any kind of degenerative and fibrotic disease, you know, radiation exposure.

**CONTEXT:** You said that the valve, the valvular tissue, that is subject to this fibrosis and causing eventual stenosis, as they call it, of the valve. Is this serotonin actually produced within the cells of the valve or is this something that is more of a systemic circulating component?

**RAY PEAT:** Nearly all the body's serotonin is produced in the intestine. It just happens to, it is rich in the type of cell that can produce it. And with a bad diet, those cells multiply and can even form tumors. But in the average person, about 95% of our serotonin comes from the intestine. And then it's carried in the platelets in the bloodstream. And the lung is where it's detoxified. The platelets should not give up their serotonin until they reach the lungs. But with overwork or various things that produce inflammation, the whole lining of the circulatory system can be overexposed to serotonin and the valve happens to get both the stretching and the chemical exposure. And hormonal situations that, for example, cause you to hyperventilate and not retain enough carbon dioxide will cause the platelets to dump out their serotonin and cause increased inflammation. So any systemic stress that causes a loss of carbon dioxide will increase that. And diabetes happens to be a failure to oxidize sugar properly and instead it turns sugar to lactic acid and the lactic acid displaces the carbon dioxide and the loss of carbon dioxide causes serotonin exposure.

**CONTEXT:** Do you think that you could measure the serotonin on the breath as a marker of how stressed somebody is?

**RAY PEAT:** You can measure almost anything in the breath with the right apparatus. But since serotonin acts partly through the stimulation of nitric oxide in any cell that it's irritating, the process of forming inflammation and fibrosis under the influence of serotonin involves the local increase of nitric oxide. And being a gas, nitric oxide is easy to see in the breath. And so they're analyzing a person's health just by measuring the amount of nitric oxide in the breath. Sounds like a pretty good way to get a measurement on it.

**CONTEXT:** I've been seeing lots of advertisements for arginine supplements and related amino acids with the deliberate intention of increasing nitric oxide that has derived from the pharmaceutical promotion of the idea that increased nitric oxide lowers blood pressure, restores youth and virility and so on. Viagra for example is supposed to increase your nitric oxide.

**RAY PEAT:** Since nitric oxide is the mediator of inflammation and degeneration, it's very good to avoid any of those supplements intended to increase it.

**CONTEXT:** Now, am I right in thinking of this misguided when I think about nitric oxide as a vasodilator and that's maybe why they are looking at it as a blood pressure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but they're missing the point that the whole inflammatory cascade caused by nitric oxide is far worse than any perceived benefit of vasodilation. I mean, yeah, there are other ways to dilate the blood vessels safely. Keeping your carbon dioxide up, for example, suppresses free radical damage and relaxes the blood vessels in a safe way in proportion to the amount of circulation needed. So when your tissue is burning a lot of oxygen and sugar, it produces a lot of carbon dioxide, relaxes the blood vessels and opens them up. But nitric oxide is produced under irritation and things that produce inflammation. So when you get that kind of vasodilation, for example, scratching your skin, some people are very sensitive to getting a flare that turns red when you scratch the skin. That's largely nitric oxide release.

**CONTEXT:** So that's nitric oxide release from the mast cells or from dermal cells?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think it's largely the mast cells which also produce serotonin and histamine which in turn activates nitric oxide. But the same thing happens invisibly when your intestine is irritated or when your heart valves are overstretched.

**CONTEXT:** You talk about that whole stretching as being an irritation, inflammation, stroke, serotonin releasing or inducing type situation. The intestines that their prime function is to squeeze and move the food contents along from start to finish and so that that area you would imagine comes under a lot of stretching activity. So that again I wonder whether or not that is in part responsible for the serotonin production that you said it happens principally in the gut.

**RAY PEAT:** When I've an experimenter is just looking at a piece of exposed intestine, they find that just gentle rubbing finger across it causes a serotonin release.

**CONTEXT:** In the 1950s the seed oil industry knew that there was an inverse relation between eating a lot of unsaturated oil and cholesterol level and they on the basis of that to sell their oil even though they were arguing that it was a natural food because of the idea that it contains essential fatty acids which at that time the essential fatty acid was linoleic acid and it's animal extension arachidonic acid but even though no one claimed that even if they were essential that anyone would need more than a few hundred milligrams per day they started selling the idea that since it lowers cholesterol that it must be good for you. If you eat an ounce or so a day and that much does lower cholesterol but it is probably something like a toxic effect on the liver. The liver, when the body senses a need for defense, a sense of stress, the liver and intestine will increase their production of cholesterol, because cholesterol as the precursor for the protective hormones, DHEA, Pregnenolone and Progesterone, as you increase the circulating cholesterol, you increase the production of these defensive hormones. So if you are poisoned, your body produces more cholesterol. And thus more pregnenol and progesterone and DHEA. And for 70 or 80 years now, it's been demonstrated over and over that any poison you can think of, if you inject intravenously cholesterol, it's an antidote for everything from arsenic to cobra venom, it protects red cells against breaking down and so on, but it protects every cell in the body and practically at every imaginable level from the stability of chromosomes and DNA to the stability of the mitotic cell division apparatus to the so-called membrane or cytoarchitecture that holds the cell together. It's a stabilizing factor at every imaginable level of the cell.

**CONTEXT:** What do you see with atherosclerosis, for example, and why is lowering cholesterol artificially a bad idea?

**RAY PEAT:** You can increase your cholesterol by optimizing your nutrition. Orange juice is a very practical way to increase your cholesterol, which many people are surprised at. There were experiments in which people, medical students, ate as many as 20 eggs a day or egg yolks and couldn't raise their cholesterol. But if you have low cholesterol, some sugars, such as orange juice, will usually bring it up to normal.

**CONTEXT:** Responding to what Dr. P just said, where would one get injectable cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1960s I was reading on the subject and I was so interested in a Russian researcher's work, Yuri Holodov, had demonstrated that the gonads and the brain are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields and since those were the tissues that I was most interested in investigating, I went to Russia to talk to him. He said the politicians weren't very encouraging for giving foreigners their latest information, but he gave me just an amazingly complete bibliography, which when I got back to the U.S., I found a lot of those sources. I learned that there was a really good foundation for being able to sense magnetic fields and for them to have effects on the brain and the gonads in particular. And a scientific reason. Madeleine Barnacy and her husband, that was one of the books he referred me to. And Salco Tromp, a Dutchman, who invented the whole field of medical bio-meteorology, practically, in the 1930s and 40s. He was aware of the biological sensitivity of organisms to magnetic fields and his work on the nervous system probably gave the computer people the idea of how to use liquid crystals in display systems and such. He was like 30, 40 years ahead of most technologists.

**CONTEXT:** Can magnets be used for bioregeneration? And if your answer is yes, how could we use them effectively?

**RAY PEAT:** My website has two or three articles that touch on points of the history of serotonin. And I think a lot of it came when they in the 1960s realized that it was an antagonist to LSD in many ways and the government demonized LSD, took it out of use as a drug or medication and turned it into a danger that was driving people crazy. And so the drug industry, knowing that serotonin antagonizes LSD, I think they took advantage of that and said that if LSD makes you crazy, then serotonin is the good guy. And before that, people who studied the intestinal tumor that overproduces serotonin, psychosis and aggression and anxiety were outstanding features of their psychotic state from being flooded with huge amounts of serotonin. So I think it had to be the reverse psychology of being an LSD antagonist that led to the idea that it's a happy drug.

**CONTEXT:** Could you just explain the part about the serotonin not being a beneficial thing because it seems like we get a lot of how beneficial serotonin is for just thinking happy thoughts and stuff and now I'm hearing from you that it's not really good to have serotonin so I'm a little confused about that if you could just simplify something for me in that way.

**RAY PEAT:** Those drugs, besides in many cases are increasing the exposure to serotonin, their beneficial effects seem to be from many other things that they do. For example, typically they will increase several of the so-called transmitter substances, but their beneficial effect corresponds to the increasing brain progesterone and other steroids. The irritation in the brain increases the production of these steroids, and the mood lift comes when your brain progesterone and pregnenolone are increasing.

**CONTEXT:** So why do so many people that like take Prozac for example think that they're not depressed anymore when they...?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, each of these things has its local effect. We seem to have inherited them from very simple life stages. Everyone, even plants and single-celled organisms. Usually respond to most of these things, but for example in the intestine, if you eat something really dangerous, the inflammation causes a surge of serotonin which causes spasms and secretion and creates diarrhea to get rid of it. So it's very functional in the acute sense over a matter of hours, it will save you from absorbing too much of a poisonous food. But if it becomes chronic, things like irritable bowel syndrome involve a chronic overproduction of serotonin. And it stimulates cell division, so when the blood vessels are constantly being, if you spill it out of your platelets and expose the blood vessels to it, it stimulates growth so it thickens the walls of the blood vessels, as well as makes them leaky, so that anything like circulating proteins in the blood can leak into the tissues. The barrier between the blood and the brain, for example, is broken down by serotonin and nitric oxide.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that serotonin itself is an inflammatory mediator, an anti-life, kind of an oxidant-type molecule in terms of its inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it sounds like he's adapted very well to the opiates. Have you had thorough hormone tests, blood tests, for things that might be related?

**CONTEXT:** I've had numerous blood tests done. In fact, for years now, because of missed medical management with the VA, which I left, and I'm now with local Redwood World Health Center, they were always taking six, eight vials of blood out of me every two months or so. And I went through cycles of having to go in for saline solution to bring up my hydration level four or five times during the summer. Now for the last year and a half since this FPN physician's assistant has been listening to me because I've had Crohn's disease for almost 30 years now. And consequently I know more about Crohn's and the side effects of this disease. And what drugs do to my body than most medical people do, even gastrointestinalogists that I've talked with. And so this FDA is the thing to me as far as absorbing information from me, feedback from a patient. And we've tried this and so far this seems to be working quite well, so I've been wanting to stick with it. When I see a regular MD he maybe wants to take me off it and put me on some cyclamine and of course that does nothing for my osteoporosis or arthritis pain and it does nothing for a night cough that I have from emphysema from laying down. So I'm actually attacking three different symptoms of old body disease with just one drug so to speak. And all of my blood levels seem to be fairly in balance. I try to take any amendments I can as much in liquid forms. I take a liquid B complex and then I take a couple thousand units of D a day and I take some E and I use black strap molasses as a source of minerals. About two tablespoons of that a day seems to really mineralize my body fairly well.

**CONTEXT:** I've been listening to you for a few years. Randomly, I hear the show, and I'm usually only listening halfway, I apologize, and it seems like I need to listen fully to comprehend what you're talking about. I just... I don't think you can fully explain all of it to me right now because it's... seems a lot of it is contradictory to the mainstream health propaganda version is. But could you just explain the part about the serotonin not being a beneficial thing because it seems like we get a lot of how beneficial serotonin is for just thinking happy thoughts and stuff and now I'm hearing from you that it's not really good to have serotonin so I'm a little confused about that if you could just simplify something for me in that way.

**RAY PEAT:** All the minerals we've been talking about, the fruit juice, very well cooked, green leaves, cheese and milk. Orange juice is a good source of things besides the minerals, but vitamin D and vitamin K help to regulate all of the minerals really, but especially calcium and magnesium. And a big dose of vitamin K, it's now available in oily form without any harmful excipients so that you can get a milligram per drop. And big doses have been able to correct osteoporosis, not just slow its progress, but reverse it. And at the same time, it takes calcium out of the blood vessels and tends to correct hypertension. And by regulating your energy metabolism, it might even help to prevent episodes of low blood pressure. It works with coenzyme Q10 to maintain oxidative metabolism in mitochondria. So it's not the simple clotting vitamin that it's medically known as. It's a brain repair, blood vessel repair, bone repair and actually can prevent excess clotting.

**CONTEXT:** What kind of tea for calcium was recommended and also if there was anything for blood pressure that goes up and down, it goes high and then it goes low and is there something to regulate that?

**RAY PEAT:** They will say it's going to increase your clotting and they they get very concerned especially if they're patients using warfarin or other blood thinning drugs. But the blood clot system is incredibly complicated and two of the essential factors are called protein C and protein S and they happen to prevent abnormal coagulation and you can't make them without vitamin K and they're involved not just in preventing clots but in many other cell functions.

**CONTEXT:** You said that a big dose of vitamin K, what would that be for a daily use?

**RAY PEAT:** I know several people who used around 50 milligrams per day. For one person who had a chronic steady blood pressure of 220 over 70, a tremendous gap between the top and bottom numbers, in two or three weeks it was down to 140 over 70. One person who was taking a drug to prevent hypertension started on similar doses and within a couple weeks his blood pressure was getting too low so he had to stop his drug.

**CONTEXT:** I'm taking Kodaxa right now as a blood thinner because I have a situation with atrial fibrillation, and, um... I was taking a calcium that had vitamin K in it, and other things that helped you absorb the calcium, but the lady at the health food store said that vitamin K thins the blood, so if you're taking a blood thinner already, it might be too much. You know, it might be too much of a blood thinner to take the vitamin K. What do you think about that?

**RAY PEAT:** It helps regulate calcium in all the systems. I'm not sure about the absorption in your intestine, but it puts it into your bones and keeps it from going into your arteries.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, that's good. Now, the other thing I wanted to ask is I heard on, oh, it was probably Dr. Oz or something on TV about that we all know that inflammation is bad, causes a lot of problems, and he was saying that sugar causes inflammation, that it's best to not eat sugar or simple carbohydrates because that exacerbates inflammation. What do you say to that?

**RAY PEAT:** There are a couple of articles on my website about sugar. And since sugar involves insulin to handle it, it's hard to tell which is responsible, but the combination of sugar and insulin is definitely anti-inflammatory. It's traditionally in Africa, for example, when antibiotics weren't available and in some war situations they found that packing just plain white sugar into an injury facilitates healing, not only prevents infection but it prevents scar formation and that's a very basic illustration.

**CONTEXT:** Well that's topical, but what about in your body if you eat a lot of sugar, it doesn't cause inflammation which would aggravate things like arthritis and other things?

**RAY PEAT:** No, the combination of insulin and sugar, it suppresses some of the inflammatory things such as nitric oxide. Hypoglycemia, a diabetic is unable to oxidize sugar and so diabetes and hypoglycemia have in common the promotion of inflammatory mediators, cytokines of various sorts including nitric oxide. And so you can either do something to lower your blood sugar too much or block its use as in diabetes. Both of those situations turn on inflammation and the normal use of sugar is definitely anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** Well how much would you say is a normal use? There's so much controversy around sugar. I happen to like to drink fruit juice without added sugar but there's a lot of natural sugar in fruit juice and people are always telling me I drink too much juice and it's got too much sugar in it and that that's not good.

**RAY PEAT:** In the form of juice, since the juices will always have minerals, especially potassium, there were experiments in which sugar disposition was followed and they looked at the factors that were causing cells to be able to use the glucose effectively and it turned out that potassium was more involved in the handling glucose than insulin was. And since fruit juice always has a lot of potassium, you don't need nearly as much insulin secretion to handle the sugar. So the story that it's going to disturb your blood sugar is very inaccurate. Eating a piece of bread is much more disturbing to your insulin and blood sugar system than drinking a similar number of calories as fruit juice.

**CONTEXT:** If I wanted to limit my calories it would be better to limit carbohydrates and keep up with the juice and not eliminate the juice?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the juices are basically more nutritious than the starches, even if they're cooked.

**CONTEXT:** You mean pasteurized?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** You know I drink the good juice like Newton and Santa Cruz organic which you know suppose don't have any added sugar but they you know I think they are pasteurized something like arduara is fresh frozen so it has a little maybe a little bit more closer to a raw juice I don't juice my own juices.

**RAY PEAT:** It's good to have your blood clotting system checked periodically, though, if you're taking a warfarin type dinner.

**CONTEXT:** I'm talking Projaxa. I didn't notice that there was a problem. Like, you know, a couple times I've cut myself and, you know, my blood seemed to coagulate just fine, I think, even while I was taking the... the calcium with the vitamin K, but I ran out of it and I was going to get some newer and the lady was warning me about it, but you think it's all right because it does help you absorb calcium, doesn't it?
