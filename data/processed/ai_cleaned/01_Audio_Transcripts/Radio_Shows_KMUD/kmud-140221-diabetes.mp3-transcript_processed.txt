**RAY PEAT:** The medical understanding has changed very little in the last 200 years. It was called the sugar disease. In ancient times it was named because of the excess urination and the urine contained a lot of glucose and people craved sugar and then they discovered the blood was loaded with glucose and so it began the medical concept that it was the glucose or the sugar disease. And the standard cure was to make them unable to eat sugar, imprison them as necessary and they would just die anyway but they kept them from satisfying their sugar hunger. And then insulin was discovered which would for the people who were wasting away with... What later was called type 1 diabetes insulin would allow them to build muscle and and put on fat instead of breaking tissues down and excreting it in the urine But the sugar disease concept stayed with the medical profession even though insulin deficiency came to be the... the idea of its cause. But then, as they looked for more ways to sell insulin, they noticed that lots of people who weren't wasting away and dying at a young age also had very high blood sugar. Some of them had sugar in their urine. Yet, when they tested their blood, they found it had a normal amount of insulin in it. But anyway, they were good candidates for... treatment. So it came to be called type 2 diabetes, even though the original concept was that diabetes was a wasting disease in which you quickly died of tissue wasting. But now fat people became something like 95% of the patients for treatment of their high blood glucose. So it definitely isn't a problem of insulin deficiency for the great majority of people who are diagnosed with diabetes.

**CONTEXT:** How does the current medical model of diabetes differ from the research perspective on the cause of diabetes?

**RAY PEAT:** In the late 19th century, two doctors doubted......the theory that it was from eating too much sugar, because they died even faster when they made them not eat any sugar, so they began feeding first one patient with each doctor, they let them eat all the sugar they wanted, which was something like three quarters of a pound a day of pure sugar added, and they very quickly recovered from the wasting disease....were able to go back to work after a few weeks of this super high sugar diet, and that gradually, their followers eventually saw that fructose was part of the sucrose standard sugar molecule, which got in the cells and was metabolized without needing insulin, so for... 50 or 60 years, many diabetics were able to eat a normal amount of sweetener in the form of fructose, but that never became the dominant treatment for diabetes, even though it is more or less as effective as the simply very high sucrose diet. But experiments looking for what was the cause of, in the case of young kids, the type 1 diabetes that was more common in girls than boys, it turned out to be sort of an autoimmune problem, inflammation killing off the beta cells. And as it happens that in vitro... And in animal experiments you can stimulate the growth of stem cells in the pancreas with glucose. So it isn't glucose that's responsible for killing those cells. It's an inflammation reaction. And the inflammation causes breakdown of fatty acids which cause pre-radical injury to the tissue. Because of that observation of the inflammation involving prostaglandins and fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, a few experimenters put lab animals on a totally fat-free diet, giving them only saturated fats or no fat at all, just carbohydrates and protein, vitamins and minerals. And then tried to give them diabetes by all of the standard methods of poisoning the beta cells of the pancreas in various ways so they couldn't make insulin. And these fat-free animals didn't develop the experimental diabetes the way all other animals do. So experimentally, it's been pretty well demonstrated that... Unsaturated fatty acids breaking down produce inflammation, which activate many of the processes seen in diabetes. The degenerative processes in the retina and nerves, for example, are where the damage starts, very often before the blood sugar increases at all. So if you're getting... retinal degeneration and have normal blood sugar, or if you're getting numb and tingly, hands and feet, and have normal blood sugar, it's clearly not the sugar which is responsible for the degenerative changes.

**CONTEXT:** You're pointing the finger of blame at the free fatty acid liberation and the oxidative damage that occurs from that.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah and the unsaturated fatty acids happen to create a vicious circle because they create stress and the stress activates the stress hormones which provide in the normal process of providing fat from the tissues as emergency fuel they liberate more of the unstable polyunsaturated fats creating more free radical damage creating more stress liberating more fats and so on or the purely saturated fats when liberated tend to turn off those stress hormones okay so another another good reason yet again to avoid the liquid oils and avoid the the free fatty the fish oils and all the other oils that basically are very unsaturated because they're unstable promote oxidation and all the stress response and tissue damage they're in yeah

**CONTEXT:** What are the beneficial effects of sugar from a diabetic perspective?

**RAY PEAT:** I looked up what current journals and doctors are saying are the mechanisms that cause nerve damage in diabetes and they have a standard four or five of chemical. Or functional changes of nerve cells that they say are caused by excess glucose. They occur in the presence of excess glucose in the diabetic but they also occur before or without the presence of glucose. And the deficiency of glucose is one of the things that can induce the same... defensive reactions that are blamed on sugar. And so you have to look at the evidence regarding the deficiency of glucose and compare it experiment by experiment with the kind of evidence they propose to explain glucose as the cause. And when you look at all of the......events associated with diabetes and the symptoms, you see that hormone changes typically go with it. Stress induces aromatase that increases estrogen production and also directly increases some of the pituitary hormones besides ACTH that drives the adrenals. Stress increases growth hormone which provides fuel in an emergency by increasing free fatty acids in circulation and the increased estrogen also increases the ACTH and prolactin, several of the stress hormones in the pituitary but especially growth hormone is very closely connected with. Estrogen, females have higher not only estrogen but growth hormone and free fatty acids and circulation and it happens that females have much more often problems with the nerve degenerative symptoms of diabetes as well as being the ones that have the majority of type 1 diabetes during childhood. The effect of the free fatty acids on stress and glucose or any sugars protection against those stress reactions is one of the basic things to look at in avoiding hypoglycemic stress long before the problem reaches the stage of producing hyperglycemia. And in hyperglycemia what you have is the body's adjustment to the inability of cells to get enough energy because they can't oxidize glucose because the fats are blocking it. Right. That's been known since the 60s called the Randall Cycle in which free fatty acids block the use of glucose. So the body tries to overcome that. Poisonous effect of the free fatty acids by increasing glucose production and and so it can kind of Get around the block just by stuffing more glucose into the blood So to a great extent The rising blood sugar shouldn't be fought in itself the cause that interferes with the use of glucose Should be concentrated on And when cells can't get enough glucose it not only turns on the stress hormones it turns off the production of thyroid hormone and so all diabetics if the cell isn't able to take up and use glucose the liver becomes unable to activate the pre thyroid hormone by rocks and turning it into the active. T3, so supplementing the active T3 thyroid hormone will cure lots of the so-called effects of diabetes. I had an old friend whose toes were basically rotting because of what was diagnosed as diabetes. Degenerative nerve and circulation problems in the legs and feet and two weeks after he had started using armor thyroid, his feet recovered completely. His toes had been black with ulcerated sores going right into the bones but they completely healed up on thyroid. We went through three cycles in which his doctor said the Armour Thyroid was going to increase his blood sugar and make his diabetes worse. So you would tell him to stop it, his feet would start rotting again. Oh my goodness. So it wasn't just a coincidence, we did it three times. Yeah, well.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding carbon monoxide poisoning and potential brain damage, what nutritional ideas can help?

**RAY PEAT:** CO2 is one of the things that helps restore the cells that are damaged by carbon monoxide. Good vitamin nutrition is helpful. The diabetic or hypothyroid person is not producing enough energy from oxygen and glucose, and so they very easily, or even at rest, turn some of the glucose into lactic acid. And lactic acid displaces... carbon dioxide from the blood, and that has a stress-producing effect throughout the body. And by simply breathing less rapidly or breathing in a bag occasionally to re-breathe and save your carbon dioxide, you can increase the CO2 in tissues, which activates the Krebs cycle, stabilizes cells, and... cuts down production of lactic acid, so it has a direct connection to the things that go wrong in diabetes, as well as hypothyroidism, to simply increase your CO2, and living at a very high altitude, the body naturally does that, because it isn't being overwhelmed with high-pressure oxygen, like at sea level.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned starch molecules that can block capillaries if they get into the bloodstream. Can you elaborate on that and any related research?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it was something discovered 100 years ago, but... In the 70s, a German immunologist, Gerhard Fulkheimer, wrote some papers on it, it's called Persorption. I think there's an article of his on the internet called Persorption, and it has illustrations of some of the junk that can simply get squeezed right through the lining of the intestine. It isn't being squeezed between cells, necessarily. It can go right into the cytoplasm on one side and out the cytoplasm on the other side. Cells are much more flexible than people imagine. Particles as big as 100 microns, potato starch particles, for example. If you eat a slurry of... cornstarch or potato starch or whatever on an empty stomach, a few minutes later you can draw blood and find these particles which some of them are just the size of a red blood cell but others are as much as 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell and red blood cells are very flexible so they can squeeze through capillaries with an opening that's only maybe five. microns across and their diameter is ten microns and so even a ten micron particle of starch will plug up an arterial and shut down circulation to a whole block of capillaries fed by that arterial and the bigger the particle the bigger the small artery is that gets plugged up. And Volkheimer would feed mice a high content of free starch in their diet and he found that they aged prematurely and when he sliced them up he found that all of their organs contained little nests of dead deteriorating cells downstream from the plug of one of these starch molecules.

**CONTEXT:** Do these starch materials resist digestion or stay in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** The body can produce the enzymes pretty much anywhere it needs to. They can break down starch, it isn't just saliva and intestine that has those enzymes but they can stay. In place long enough as he demonstrated for the tissue to die, the bigger they are I suppose the longer they stay put killing tissue.

**CONTEXT:** When eating a potato with saturated fat like coconut oil or butter, does that help the starch slide through the intestine rather than entering the bloodstream?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if it's very well cooked, it makes the starch particle easier to break down in the intestine and the fat delays the absorption so it has time to break down more before it's absorbed.

**CONTEXT:** Are other food additives like silicates or chemically modified cellulose also considered "junk" that can lodge in the body's vessels?

**RAY PEAT:** And I think the chemically modified cellulose molecules that are in practically everything, some of those are... toxic in themselves, seem to have a catalytic effect, and so they might be degrading the supplement right in the tablet. That has hardly been studied. One or two papers on it. And the silica particles not only get into the tissue, but they have a toxic and allergenic or immunological effect. Gerhard Folkheimer, being an immunologist, was especially concerned about their role in degenerative and immune diseases. But people specializing in the silica or silicone reactions, they found that supposedly amorphous silica. Glass-like particles that they in themselves have some of the silicone-like effects and even overlap with the crystalline effects that produce cancer in diabetes, in silicosis from asbestos crystals, but it seems to be an activation of......inflammation reactions. The inflammasome particle responds to a certain shape of particle. So if it has a given shape, it doesn't matter too much whether it's asbestos or carbon or silicon or wood. I think Paul Keimer mentioned feathers. And wood particles, sawdust, can get through the intestine. And he showed that not only plugging up the blood vessels, about 15 minutes after they can be detected in the blood, they can be found in the liver, in the bile, having crossed another set of cell barriers, and in the cerebrospinal fluid. Right into the brain, and eventually some of them show up in the urine.

**CONTEXT:** Could these particles lodging in surface capillaries contribute to skin disorders like psoriasis?

**RAY PEAT:** It's especially theorized, at least, to contribute to the various... things like scleroderma. Silicone from breast implants has been connected to the generalized scleroderma, but even the silica particles used as food additives are suspected as activating the inflammatory skin hardening diseases.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that for pregnant women, keeping them unstressed is essential for the baby's development. Is the craving for sugar during pregnancy a good thing?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the glucose is essential for the baby's brain development and many older gynecologists and obstetricians knew that women......diabetic women had the brightest babies, even hugely fat women who had diabetes and were not in good health themselves often produced extremely healthy babies.

**CONTEXT:** You were diagnosed with hypoglycemia and bad acne as a teenager. Could this be tied to unsaturated fat consumption blocking glucose processing, leading to hyperglycemic symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** Uh, yeah. A man named Demke Wicks, about 30 or 40 years ago, showed that... Lowering blood sugar activates the inflammatory process. And doubling the blood sugar will stop allergies to almost everything. So every episode of hypoglycemia is stressing your immune system, as well as activating the stress hormones that compensate by turning protein into sugar.

**CONTEXT:** Was your intense craving for sugar during those years, like donuts and chilled cola, related to this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's the natural thing, like in pregnancy when a woman needs sugar or premenstrually, same thing happens. When your blood sugar falls, you crave sugar, and if your thyroid is just temporarily depressed by stress......eating a pound of sugar over a period of three days will sometimes replenish the glycogen stores in all of your tissues, including the liver, where the liver uses it to activate the thyroid hormone.

**CONTEXT:** Does stress, besides adolescence, contribute to acne, and is unsaturated fat the most common cause?

**RAY PEAT:** That's probably the most common reason for it, but many kinds of stress can bring it on. But I think that's the most common cause currently. And there's a really great book by Broda Barnes called Hypoglycemia, It's Your Liver, Not Your Mind. And he was... One of the first people to point out that the liver provides three quarters of our active thyroid hormone. And to do that it needs glucose. And without the active thyroid hormone you tend to get hypoglycemia.

**CONTEXT:** Does alcohol also negatively impact this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it interferes with the provision of glucose.

**CONTEXT:** You have ovarian cysts that are growing. Do you have them removed, and what are your thoughts on progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** I think you should have your blood hormones measured. The cysts could be producing a lot of estrogen. Have you had ultrasounds? Yes, I have an ultrasound every six months. Yes. And are they enlarging? Yes. Slowly. A blood test might show what's needed to break them. Sometimes just one dose of progesterone is all that's needed for the cyst to break in the way it should during a normal menstrual cycle. So, my real question is... Do I do this at my age? I mean, is there a chance that I may not come out of it? Oh, oh, sure. Surgery is... If you're underweight, especially, and over 70, then any surgery tends, in the six months following the surgery... it increases all kinds of risk of dying. Well, gosh, it's a hard thing to decide to do. Progesterone is a very safe compound and it's certainly far safer than surgery so that would be a very good start. And progesterone should be something that would easily be prescribed by your doctor. I have an appointment, so I'll certainly bring this up. There are, of course, other sources of progesterone that you can purchase also, just so that the doctor, if they refuse to do that, it is always possible to go elsewhere. What would I... Can you get it over the counter? Several... In California here, there's several health stores. I mean, I think there's very many health stores, but I don't get around the country too much, but I've seen it, certainly....in health stores, so there's a product called Progeste, which is a natural progesterone, and there's several other types of product that contain progesterone, and that would be the thing that Dr. Pete's mentioning would be useful for you.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a doctor who said cysts over 8cm must be removed. Is that accurate, or could progesterone help them break down naturally?

**RAY PEAT:** I've known quite a few younger women with big cysts that were causing pain at least, and they were with just one or two doses of progesterone, and their cysts simply broke and they had no more problem. So is that the same as twisting, if it twists itself? No. I think it's probably getting confused with two different things. Number one is a kind of natural and spontaneous dissolution or breaking down. And the other thing I think you might be confusing with twisted ovaries, but I'm not too sure. But yeah, pregnenolone is one of those things you should definitely first ask your doctor for. And if you can't get them... From your doctor, you can always find them online, so progesterone is the thing you want to try.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned in an article that niacinamide can cause tumor cells to mature or disintegrate but prolongs the replicative life of cultured cells. Can you explain this?

**RAY PEAT:** It's needed to produce energy efficiently, and it lowers stress, so the increased energy and reduced stress simply stops... the processes that tend to promote cancer, but its main effect is protective for nerve cells, for example. Almost anything that injures a nerve cell is protected against by niacinamide.

**CONTEXT:** You also mentioned using a suppository with a high dose of vitamin A and a little vitamin E in cocoa butter for extreme vaginal dryness. What would be a safe dosage?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, to make a suppository, it depends on whether you're using pure cocoa butter, with that you can get probably a thousand milligrams of vitamin E and maybe twenty thousand international units of vitamin A to dissolve in one.

**CONTEXT:** If taking vitamin A internally for other issues, what is a safe dose, especially with Hashimoto's and taking thyroid hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it depends on the status of your thyroid, exactly, because the thyroid hormone and vitamin A... are carried on the same protein in the blood and if you take too much vitamin A it can act as an antagonist to thyroid. It acts like a polyunsaturated fat in competing against the thyroid hormone and it can also block the production of adrenal and ovarian steroids if you get too much. At 10,000 units a day, if your thyroid is okay, people with very high thyroid activity sometimes need more like 50,000 international units of vitamin A because the increased thyroid raises your requirement for vitamin A, so it's important to adjust the dose to the thyroid function. I see. I have Hashimoto's, so I am actually taking thyroid hormones. So would 10,000 be too much for someone like me? Yeah, unless you're sure that your metabolic rate is up, it's good to limit it to about 10,000 units a day.

**CONTEXT:** For someone with diabetes who has been advised to avoid sugar, what would you recommend as a starting point to see benefits and potentially embrace more sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, fruit is the best way to get your sugar. Orange juice in the United States is the most reliable way to get sugar with every meal. Milk is very important for several reasons. As a source of protein, the high calcium has an anti-stress effect, so emphasizing every day milk, cheese, protein, and some eggs, and other fruits, avoiding the starchy fruits like bananas, and then if you actually have a problem with high blood sugar, which if it's only a... like 130 milligrams per cent, that wouldn't be a reason for working on the blood sugar, but supplementing brewer's yeast and aspirin are things that can help to actually lower the blood sugar and a thyroid supplement sometimes will help.
