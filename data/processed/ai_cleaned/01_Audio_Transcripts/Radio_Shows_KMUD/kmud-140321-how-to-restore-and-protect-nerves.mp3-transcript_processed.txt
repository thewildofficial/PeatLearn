**RAY PEAT:** Relative to nerve biology, that was my intended major when I went to the University of Oregon as a graduate student in 1968 because I had been interested in linguistics and psychology. But as soon as I got there, I was... Two or three months I had decided to switch to aging and reproductive physiology because of the great dogmatism in the nerve biology field. And so I spent the three, four years working on reproductive aging, female reproductive aging in particular. So I concentrated on the effects of... estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, oxygen and antioxidants on the age-related changes in metabolism.

**CONTEXT:** Would you outline your academic and professional background before we get started on tonight's show?

**RAY PEAT:** My father happened to be an example of the traditional, original type of diabetes. He wasted away to... I think it was under 100 pounds and it was just a few years after insulin had come into medical use and he didn't want to. He had become dependent on it so he and my mother looked through the old naturopathic medical literature and found that brewer's yeast had sometimes cured people and so he went on a brewer's yeast diet for several weeks and recovered his weight and lived the rest of his life with no sign of diabetes.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned your father's experience with diabetes. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** That was his only food. Basically for several weeks.

**CONTEXT:** Do you know how much brewer's yeast he was using?

**RAY PEAT:** And there are steroids in it, and potassium, a lot of potassium, and phosphate, which is not for general health. You can very easily get phosphate poisoning, but probably it's one of the factors that... could be involved in that effect, maybe by having something to do with interfering with stress hormones.

**CONTEXT:** What about the other components of brewer's yeast, like B vitamins, steroids, and potassium?

**RAY PEAT:** I think there are probably many causes of the traditional wasting form of diabetes, but a virus is one of the plausible theories that can cause inflammation and killing off temporarily of the insulin-producing cells. But just very intense stress. There were experiments in which... If part of the dog's pancreas was removed, so it had just a smaller reserve of insulin-producing cells, then a single injection of a large dose of cortisol was enough to make the dog permanently diabetic. So that extreme stress caused by cortisol itself as an inflammatory mediator... Yeah, and then once the tissues are unable to get glucose just from... That one episode of stress-induced lack of insulin, the cells are basically dying because they can't get the glucose they need, so they call on fatty acids from stores, and the fatty acid in turn kills the remaining or regenerating insulin-producing cells. So it starts a vicious circle.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned stress and cortisol as potential causes of diabetes. Can you explain that further?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a fat such as butter or lard or corn oil, most of them consist of about 18 carbon atoms in a chain with oxygens. On one end making it acidic and the rest of it either just plain carbon and hydrogen or occasionally with the hydrogens removed that's called an unsaturated fatty acid with a carbon chain interrupted by pure hydrogens and those chains are attached to a glycerin....molecule, three carbons, technically an alcohol that forms an ester with these pre-fatty acids blocking the acid group which makes the pre-fatty acid water soluble to some extent and when the glycerin which is also very water soluble is combined with three fatty acids it becomes very water insoluble.... And that is the form in which it's stored in the fat cells because you just form a drop of pure fat in the cell and it's very reluctant to diffuse away because of its insolubility. So when you need energy you have to activate enzymes that break the free fatty acids loose. When that happens from stress or hunger or fasting these free fatty acids get into the blood stream and enter cells and are available as energy production in the absence of glucose. The problem is that that process also tends to keep the stress going if the free fatty acids are unsaturated. Those are more water soluble and when they're polyunsaturated, like from corn oil, safflower oil and so on, those have a further stress inducing action that tends to keep the breakdown of fat going and the stress reproducing itself.

**CONTEXT:** Could you explain what free fatty acids are and how they are used in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you store a very saturated fat, like the Indians make ghee by removing the water-soluble material, a pure fat oil, or coconut oil, which is 98% saturated, those things keep for years without breaking down. But if you leave a bottle of safflower, or corn oil, or linseed oil......open within hours or days, you can detect spontaneous oxidation of it in the air. And that happens at body temperature with the high oxygen content of your blood. It happens very quickly with the polyunsaturated fats. But interestingly, the biological oxidation is pretty much the opposite. Because if you have two......types of fat circulating in your bloodstream, one saturated fatty acid and one polyunsaturated, your muscles will be able to oxidize the saturated fat preferentially. The polyunsaturated fat tends to go into storage if you ate more than you can oxidize. So you...it tends to be fattening if you... eat a little extra of the polyunsaturated because it stores more easily. Okay, can... Your fat cells can also oxidize saturated fat. And so they live on the saturated fat that they haveחס stored. And so over the years, stress is more likely to release the polyunsaturated fats, making stress an increasing problem with age.

**CONTEXT:** You advocate for saturated fats and are against liquid oils and fish oil. Can you explain why saturated fats are better when stored and liberated?

**RAY PEAT:** That's right. Yeah, so don't mind me but getting back to the classic description of diabetes as being a wasting disease which actually we... see very little of as opposed to what now is generically termed as diabetes and is very largely linked to obesity in the general population That that obesity was probably directly linked to the polyunsaturated thyroid suppressive diets that people consume.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that obesity is linked to polyunsaturated fatty acid diets. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's now increasingly seen as a fat inflammation condition, a mild chronic inflammation and a major... The thing that causes that is the continual spontaneous release of small amounts of arachidonic acid, which is a highly unsaturated fatty acid that even if you don't eat it, linoleic acid, for example, will be turned into it by enzymes in the body. So it becomes one of the... most toxic stored fats, both in phospholipids and in the triglyceride storage, and when that's released, that allows it to be turned into various things, but especially prostaglandins, which are probably our biggest inflammatory problem.

**CONTEXT:** You've described inflammation as a fat inflammation condition. What is the role of arachidonic acid in this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're why aspirin is so great.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned prostaglandins are inflammatory. Is that why aspirin is effective?

**RAY PEAT:** If your vitamin k is okay I think it's fine to take two or three hundred milligrams every day and if it's to correct a problem such as diabetes or some chronic inflammatory problem then up to I know people who have temporarily. I take them six or seven thousand milligrams a day, like 20 standard aspirin tablets, for example.

**CONTEXT:** What would you suggest as a dose for aspirin, and what about vitamin K?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there was a study that the government, I think, cancelled it when it looked like it was going to be too successful, because it would be terrible for the... And very cheap.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a study about aspirin and HIV. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** When anything is stressed in the cell, for example, just... Hypothyroidism lowers the energy production of a cell, makes it tend to take up water, and when it takes up water, it becomes somewhat porous, and its natural enzymes leak out into the bloodstream. And just by looking at the type of enzyme, you can't be sure whether it's coming from a leg muscle that you strained or overstressed. Or a heart muscle that is being stressed. Or the liver. The liver is usually the place that you look for enzymes that are concentrated in the liver. And so ALT is one of those.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding liver enzymes like ALT, what causes them to be elevated?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the cooked greens. If you eat it by the cups and the quarts, it's an adequate source of protein. But if you aren't eating it as your main food for protein, then half a cup to a cup a day will provide your vitamin K and a generous amount of magnesium and calcium. Those are the nutrients that......quickly cook out of it into the broth and so if you drink only the water that you cooked a cup or so of leaves in, then you get a little supplement of magnesium and calcium.

**CONTEXT:** For someone who can't digest vegetables, but can have cooked greens in broth, how much should they consume for their nutritional needs?

**RAY PEAT:** It's pretty irritating to the intestine. Plants put their most intense... defensive toxins into their seeds, but their next most intense irritants and toxins are in the leaves because they don't want to be grazed. So they put chemicals in that tend to block your digestive enzymes. And cooking destroys most of those toxins or reduces them. And so if you eat them raw and if you aren't a ruminant. That has evolved the stomach to handle raw leaves, then you're most likely to have some digestive problems.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned raw juicing can be irritating. Can you explain why?

**RAY PEAT:** It has diuretic effects. And some anti-inflammatory effects from the carbon dioxide itself and the caffeine acts on some of the same enzymes that aspirin does with an anti-inflammatory effect. And they both increase your cell respiration and they both suppress nitric oxide which is one of our central......risky pro-inflammatory mediators which happens to poison the mitochondrial respiration, blocking it directly. So caffeine and aspirin have multi-levels of defense of the mitochondria.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned baking soda and caffeine in relation to aspirin. How do they work together?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, inflammation and respiratory defect is the motor for cancer growth. And it happens that if you... restore energy production in the mitochondria, you're also lowering the inflammatory stimulants that activate cell division and spreading.

**CONTEXT:** Does the mechanism you described for aspirin and caffeine also apply to reducing tumor growth?

**RAY PEAT:** Actually, the uncouplers, when it's a mild degree of uncoupling, it prevents some of the stray free radical products that happens in the... more relaxed, lower intensity mitochondria, so they know that you reduce free radical damage a little by increasing uncoupling. But another substance which uncouples mitochondria also lowers ATP a little bit and greatly protects the... the mitochondrion from free radicals, that's fructose. Fructose absorbs excess phosphate ions. Probably that's related to why it lowers the ATP. But the absorption of the phosphate ions by fructose is in a way a direct defensive... system of the oxidative system because the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme which is suppressed in cancer, it's why dichloroacetate is gaining so much interest because it's a chemical that reactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase and improves the cancer metabolism in a great variety of tumors. But simply lowering the free phosphate in the cell tends to reactivate this crucial enzyme at the top of the energy producing chain. And when you are supplied with aspirin, caffeine, and fructose, for example, you are not... calling on free fatty acids. If you load up the cell with excess free fatty acids, for example, from some stress, the free fatty acids reverse all of those processes. They block pyruvate dehydrogenase by making more phosphate ions available....where the sugars bind them and lower the free phosphates as the acids increase them and tend to poison the crucial enzyme.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding mitochondrial uncoupling, is reduced ATP production harmful, and how does fructose fit into this?

**RAY PEAT:** It increases heat, among other things. And keeping your body temperature up to an efficient high level makes all of your tissues more stable.

**CONTEXT:** Does this process of uncoupling, which generates heat, negatively affect the thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh no, the thyroid is very compatible with that. Keeping yourself slightly hyperthyroid doesn't stress anything. In fact, it keeps down those stress signals.

**CONTEXT:** So, uncoupling doesn't harm the thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** I've seen really great results from something in the range of 150 to 300 milligrams per day divided into three smaller doses, but... I also know people who have taken over 1,000, 1,500 milligrams for a very long time and haven't had problems, but mainly because all of the manufactured supplements are going to have trace allergenic impurities. I think it's best to find the smallest amount that works for you.

**CONTEXT:** What is a recommended dosage range for niacinamide?

**RAY PEAT:** With either form of vitamin B6, it's possible to overdose. And I think people are finding that the... active form is easier to overdose with. It used to take several hundred milligrams several months to produce toxic effects on the nerves. But some people are seeing it with as little as 50 milligrams over a prolonged time with the active form. And I think it's good to start with 10 milligrams, which is far beyond... The normal day's requirement, 10 to 20 milligrams, is almost always all a person needs therapeutically of B6.

**CONTEXT:** Are there any indicators to determine if someone needs the active form of B6 (P5P or PLP) versus the typical form?

**RAY PEAT:** That happens to be a pretty toxic antibiotic, so I think it's good to try a lot of other things first. There are some bacterial products that are more actively germicidal in the intestine. There's one that comes from Ukraine called biosporin that has very germicidal bacteria in it. I think there are some intestinal detoxifying or disinfecting. Antibiotics that are a lot safer than metronidazole.

**CONTEXT:** If someone has SIBO and hasn't found relief with the carrot salad, would an antibiotic like Metronidazole (Flagyl) be a safe option?

**RAY PEAT:** It's very interesting. Well, they were using a whole eggnog. I don't think it was just the white. Oh, yes, the yolk primarily. Yeah, and the fresh egg lecithin itself has been shown to have antiviral activities, antibacterial, too. But I think the white is the egg. It's peculiar for its ability to bind minerals. And the combination of the lecithin and raw egg white probably has some special germicidal effect.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned anecdotally that people with leukemia were treating it with raw eggnog. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** The two types of yeast, there are actually many strains and they taste different. The brewer's yeast that actually comes from a brewery generally has a hops flavor in it and so it's very bitter. And the yeasts have been grown specially for making nutritional supplements and so some of them have added chemical substances such as I think selenium is one that they commonly add. And basically the yeast chemistry in itself is always rich in B vitamins.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the difference between nutritional yeast and brewer's yeast?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your cell energy up, I think, is the basic thing. You want to keep the cell water under control, and neither too hydrated nor too dehydrated. The regulating minerals, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, is part of that, keeping the balance....between intracellular water and extracellular water. But the thing about drinking extra water when you're not thirsty, I think thirst is almost always a good indicator of how much you need. If you're drinking, for example, milk and fruit juice, that can provide all the water you need. Try to add extra water. It can disturb your mineral balance and hormone balance. For example, too much water in relation to the minerals tends to increase your prolactin because prolactin is a water and salt regulating hormone among other things. So, it's probably more important to emphasize not to push excess water rather than to remind people to drink because......usually thirst tells them when.

**CONTEXT:** What are the body's water requirements, and how does hydration relate to mineral balance?

**RAY PEAT:** Depends on what what they're made of. Sometimes high estrogen or high polyunsaturated fats can cause a fairly sudden appearance of age spots at an area that's irritated or sun-exposed and changing your diet away from the polyunsaturated fats and adding a little vitamin E. Rubbing some vitamin E into those spots can help to remove them. There are enzymes that can break down even fairly old, long-standing lipofuscin pigment and vitamin E is an activator of that. If it's a largely a sun-induced spot, you might try rubbing some niacinamide to dissolve. A high potency niacinamide tablet in just a tiny amount of water and apply that to the spot every day for a week or two and it fades a lot of the pigments.

**CONTEXT:** What can be applied to the face to get rid of age spots?

**RAY PEAT:** I think a pure, high-potency vitamin E is good. 100 or 200 milligrams orally is probably enough, but you can put a little on the spot, and sometimes that helps the enzymes to clear it out.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding vitamin E for age spots, is soy-derived vitamin E okay, or should one go for a purer form?

**RAY PEAT:** The changes in the nerves include everything that is failing because of lack of energy. And when the cells are known to be living on fatty acids......and the fatty acids are intrinsically disturbing the metabolism of phosphate, turning off glucose energy production, slowing down and even activating nitric oxide, the respiratory inhibitor, you know that the energy of the cell being reduced is going to slow all kinds of......repairing processes and incidentally in the pancreas glucose stimulates regeneration of new insulin producing cells and it's the bad balance, too much free fatty acids and not enough glucose to defend the cells that causes them to die and anywhere that a cell is being deprived of the energy......and forced to eat fatty acids instead, that's now well recognized in heart failure that a simple treatment such as niacinamide can restore great amounts of heart energy production and improve the failure, drugs are being developed to do the same as aspirin and nitrate and niacinamide......but in nerves, one of the effects of failing energy is the inability to make cholesterol and to convert cholesterol into the neurosteroids......when a nerve or its supporting cells, the glial cells, when they're injured by anything including......a lack of glucose or a lack of oxygen, they not only stop producing the defensive steroids from cholesterol, but they begin producing estrogen and the diabetic brain and nerves and all of the diabetic tissues have more aromatase than a normal person of the same age. More of the enzymes which convert androgens to estrogens and the estrogen in a healthy person when the nerve is stressed, the activation of this enzyme which is normally inactive in the nerve, stress activates the production of a little estrogen which sends out signals to the surrounding cells to cause them to produce... pregnenolone, progesterone, allopregnenolone, and a whole range of protective nerve steroids. But if you don't have the energy, you get stuck in producing just the estrogen which keeps things excited and stressed.

**CONTEXT:** Even with supplemented insulin, diabetics experience nerve damage. How does excess sugar contribute to this, and what is the mechanism behind the harm?

**RAY PEAT:** If your vitamin k is okay I think it's fine to take two or three hundred milligrams every day and if it's to correct a problem such as diabetes or some chronic inflammatory problem then up to I know people who have temporarily. I take them six or seven thousand milligrams a day, like 20 standard aspirin tablets, for example.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned niacinamide and aspirin as modifiers of free fatty acid expression. How do they address nerve damage in diabetics, even with insulin?

**RAY PEAT:** If your vitamin k is okay I think it's fine to take two or three hundred milligrams every day and if it's to correct a problem such as diabetes or some chronic inflammatory problem then up to I know people who have temporarily. I take them six or seven thousand milligrams a day, like 20 standard aspirin tablets, for example.
