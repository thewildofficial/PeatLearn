**RAY PEAT:** Throughout the body, for example, skin cells from different parts of the body are different from skin cells in a different part of the body. Each cell knows where it belongs in terms of the whole organism, as if each part is sort of a microcosm. And that researcher in 1969 showed evidence that the immune system works that way, that each cell is kind of a microcosm. And as the clonal selection theory was developing, it really was trying to justify the vaccination practice and theory. The practice of vaccination was entirely empirical. People didn't know anything about what was going on. They didn't even know there were cells at the time they were practicing vaccination. So that was just a trial and error thing. No theory at all. And early in this century, Paul Ehrlich developed the approach to immunity that led to the clonal selection theory, which is currently pretty much the dominant theory, except it has been modified recently, the last four or five years, by recognition that the innate immune system, what we share with primitive animals and plants. That the innate immune system really is involved in the adaptive immune system, but from Paul Ehrlich's view and mainline immunology, the adaptive system was the only part that was of interest. In 1969, I talked to some of my professors about the innate immunity. In the year that Paul Ehrlich got his Nobel Prize, Ilya Metchnikov also shared the Nobel Prize. But Metchnikov presented information about the innate immune system. And that was really pretty much ignored until just the last four or five years. But that's where I think the really interesting stuff happens. And in 1969, when I talked to my professors, they were completely uninterested in the innate immune system. But I had been reading William F. Koch, who was early in the century, almost simultaneously with Ilya Metchnikov's work. And I was like, ouch, Koch. Koch developed evidence that oxidative cell metabolism is responsible for innate resistance and immunity. And it was, in effect, the biochemical explanation for the innate immunity that Ilya Metchnikov had showed as a developmental process. Metchnikov was an embryologist, and he saw immunity as a process of maintaining the integrity of the organism, but in a developmental, almost embryological manner. And Koch's work, at the same time, was showing that it was the energy of cells, the oxidative metabolism, that made this innate immunity work, and people ignored or disparaged W.F. Koch because an essential part of his theory of oxidative metabolism was based on pre-radical reactions that would break down allergens and viruses and toxins. Using pre-radical chemistry, but biologists didn't know that there was such a thing as pre-radical chemistry until the 1950s. So pretty much Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi was the only biologist who took W.F. Koch seriously, and he didn't really concentrate on immunity. So it's now just barely coming into scientific awareness that the innate immune system and metabolic processes do have something to do with why some people don't get disease and others do.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to explain his scientific and professional background.

**RAY PEAT:** Although I concentrated on physiology, reproductive aging, and biochemistry during my four years at the University of Oregon, it happened that in a seminar of developmental biology that I took, I think it was in the fall of 1969, the professor was sponsoring an international conference on immunology, and so I got to hear the latest big-shot research explaining the clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity, and they would give their presentation and then disappear. And in between, younger professors would give their current research. And the most memorable thing about the conference for me was a professor describing his in vitro experiments with white blood cells that had been clonally deleted, but when the concentration was proper, they could reconstitute themselves in the original as if each one had knowledge of what the whole organism was.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, current experiments show that simply diet and sanitation, good light exposure and avoidance of pollution and toxins will make a tremendous difference. And I assume that in a pre-industrial society, there was a lot less heavy metal exposure. I don't think Egypt was big on iron industry and refining and such. I think the seed oils have been a major contribution to bad health. Along with heavy metals, and those two things interact, destroying our innate immune system. Types of experiments that prevent animals from getting the usual polyunsaturated fats show that they're extremely resistant to all kinds of injury, including infections. One of the most interesting things relative to the classical instruction theory of adaptive immunity is that organs, for example kidneys, can be transplanted from an animal that has been deprived of polyunsaturated fat into another animal, as if they were genetically related. The antigenicity of the tissues is extremely low, simply by avoiding the polyunsaturated fats. And you see similar things in liver transplants among humans.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the reduced antigenicity of organs from animals deprived of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so even though their genes and proteins are theoretically antigenic, they should be antigenic, but because of being free of the associated free radical breakdown products of the oxidized fats, those proteins aren't recognized as foreign.

**CONTEXT:** The host expresses surprise at the finding that organs from genetically disparate animals are not rejected when the donor is deprived of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** True. If you look at the age and gender of liver donors, females have a higher level of circulating polyunsaturated fats in the blood and tissues, and those increase with age, and the least successful, the most antigenic and likely to fail liver comes from older donors and female donors, corresponding to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on the relationship between age, gender, and liver transplant success, linking it to polyunsaturated fat levels.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the hormone balance is what makes the difference. If you get your defensive anti-inflammatory hormones including thyroid up and as the anti-inflammatory T3 part of the thyroid increases, the TSH which is pro-inflammatory decreases. And high estrogen goes with low thyroid function and an inflammatory state which resembles autoimmunity. Animals treated with estrogen are very susceptible to autoimmune diseases, and so I think the gluten reaction is in effect a type of autoimmune reaction, and that you have to shift the whole organism so that it's acting properly rather than overreacting to inflammatory signals.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about gluten sensitivity and how long one should avoid gluten.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. I've talked previously about the intestine as a source of serotonin and nitric oxide and histamine which promote inflammation, and those things are increased by any stressor, but they're intrinsic parts of the immune system and they tend to change with aging as well as stress. Very recently there's been research showing that nitric oxide turns off all of the steroids starting with pregnenolone in the white blood cells which should turn off autoimmune reactions. And that since nitric oxide turns off steroid synthesis right at the first step, you want to do things that will minimize your exposure to serotonin, histamine, and nitric oxide, and increase things that will promote the anti-inflammatory, anti-autoimmune processes.

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if it's possible to eventually eat gluten without problems if hormone balance is restored.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, thyroid. Sometimes aspirin helps by keeping down the prostaglandins and polyunsaturated reactive oxygen species, so vitamin E, thyroid, aspirin, pregnenolone and progesterone are all protective.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks for practical advice for age-related macular degeneration.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. The cells are tending to regenerate constantly in the brain, retina, pancreas, and so on. Even in sick people, there are new stem cells being born. The problem is to keep them from dying because of the stressful situation in the tissue. And caffeine is another generally protective thing that blocks the toxic effects of nitric oxide and other things that kill cells and deprive them of energy.

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if restoring energy production can lead to cell regeneration in the eye.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think that can be contested and I think that's the point of this evening's show, was to bring out some of the scientific evidence behind that contest.

**CONTEXT:** A caller questions the assertion that diseases like whooping cough and tetanus have been wiped out by vaccines, citing personal and historical examples of the severity of these diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, people die a lot from the kind of diseases that are ravaging the world right now, like the cancers, the massive increase in cancers. People are tragically, mentally dying from dementia and Alzheimer's right in front of their families. Autism is becoming pretty rife amongst children and goodness knows what it's predisposing them to be like in the years to come. So I think whilst you're very true and correct that these diseases have certainly brought around deadly consequences for some of the victims in the world, I think a lot of them, yeah, the purpose of tonight's show was to bring out where we've come from and where we're at now, and why it is that we're here. That there is this supposed need for this massive vaccination.

**CONTEXT:** The host responds to the caller's concern about the historical severity of diseases that vaccines supposedly eradicated.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the point of tonight's show is to bring out the reasons for and against it, and that's I guess where we're going to go with the show. So perhaps if you wait a little while and we get further through the questions that I have for Dr. Peat. Like I said at the very beginning of the show, his philosophy and approach to this is very different and does seem very shocking at first.

**CONTEXT:** The host addresses the caller's question about whether children should be vaccinated against deadly diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think what Dr. Peat said that hit the nail on the head really is that good hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition has done more than vaccination has done for reducing disease, and it's the health of the organism that's really the important factor. So whilst we're not saying carte blanche that vaccinations are deadly and shouldn't be used, what we're trying to get over, and hopefully we'll, as the show goes on, otherwise we'll carry on next month, is that the nutrition state of people in terms of how they live, the drugs that they maybe have they're on, medications, the kind of quality of food that's in the food supply these days, the water they're drinking, the air they're breathing, the sunlight they're not getting, all of these things are degrading.

**CONTEXT:** The host elaborates on Dr. Peat's perspective regarding the importance of overall health and environmental factors in disease prevention.

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly. It's going to help you ward off all diseases. If we get that opportunity later on here, we're going to discuss the immune system and how experiments have conclusively proved that in groups of animals that have been treated and tested, they're significantly better in their outcomes when faced with the same infection that other animals die from.

**CONTEXT:** The host agrees that a stronger immune system is key to warding off diseases and mentions a future discussion on the immune system and animal experiments.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think that's the whole point of our shows. They're pretty groundbreaking in terms of getting people to think differently about a subject that's so long and so often we get brainwashed with only one way, and actually we don't hear the full truth, and so that's the whole point.

**CONTEXT:** The host emphasizes the show's goal of encouraging critical thinking and presenting alternative perspectives on health topics.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you know, my great-granddaughter has had 40,000, and the granddaughter believes in herd immunity, and I'm horrified with so much cancer in the family.

**CONTEXT:** A caller, identifying as a homeopath, mentions a book by Richard Moskowitz and expresses concerns about specific vaccines like pertussis and the rationale behind vaccinating newborns for Hepatitis B, while also sharing a personal family history related to smallpox.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, one of the newer adjuvants of interest is phytol, which is a plant, oily material, and heavy metals have been used as adjuvants for a long time, and they are pathogens in themselves when they're in the diet and the environment, but since even the conventional immunologists realize that the simple foreignness of a protein isn't enough to make it reactive, isn't enough to make it function as an antigen, even though it's completely foreign, so they need to make the body treat it as something dangerous, and that's what activates the immune system and effectively keeps the viruses or bacteria from multiplying, but following the trend that Eli Metzenhoff sketched out at the beginning of the century, a few people 25 and 30 years ago brought that innate immunity back theoretically to look at the evidence of vaccination and how an adjuvant makes the immune system react. And it's now recognized as the danger or damage theory of immunity where it used to be the otherness, the foreignness of an antigen that was recognized. Now it's increasingly seen that it's injury that triggers the immune system, and so it's not at all just the foreignness, and the originators of this danger or damage theory of immunity are Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger, and they showed that the implications of thinking of the immune system as a developmental process rather than as an immune process seeking out foreign organisms as the pathogen, that anything pathogenic which could be radiation, heavy metals, toxic fats, and so on, these are the real agents of damage. That's why they have to be used with the bacterium or virus.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to discuss the adjuvant side of vaccinations and their toxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** The thing that I remember was the thimerosal that was I think they say now that it's been banned since 2002, but I don't know how true that is. And that obviously was causing a lot of damage in people that were receiving it. And I think this is when a lot of the attention came out for vaccinations. And the products that were used as adjuvants in vaccines were then starting to be questioned. Some people think that they're talking about the amount of mercury as a toxin, but it's really the way that the tiny amount of toxin or mercury or adjuvant is presented that causes the problem. It isn't the mercury itself. For example, kids whose mother ate lots of seafood turn out to have above average IQs along with a high body load of mercury. So in a healthy body, even mercury isn't necessarily toxic, but presented in the wrong way, activating these adaptive defensive reactions, it's that that can lead to things like autoimmunity that really cause the damage. So when they substitute phytol for aluminum or mercury, for example, I think the effects are going to be just as bad, if not worse.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of adjuvants and the potential toxicity of substances like thimerosal.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yes, the potentiating, the disturbing properties.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the issue is about potentiation.

**RAY PEAT:** Besides being good nutrition and extremely low in iron, incidentally. Iron is one of the factors in the environment that accumulates and progressively leads to oxidative injury of all of the tissues. So, milk provides extremely good nutrition including a relative absence of the harmful iron. It also provides various immune protective materials, antibodies and things such as transferrin or lactoferrin that help to manipulate the body load of iron besides being deficient in iron as a food. The lactoferrin helps the body keep its iron in the right place, prevents stress from letting the iron react with polyunsaturated fats and so on. So breastfeeding provides undamaged proteins that are really part of the baby's immune system and even RNA. From the mother's body, I think even DNA has been demonstrated to pass from the mother's milk into the baby's genetic makeup. If you are brought up on cow's milk or goat's milk, you get many of the immunological protective factors, but you're probably also incorporating some of the go to recount genetic material.

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks about the effects of breastfeeding on a child's immune health and its relationship to vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the mother's immunity does show up in the baby if the baby is breast fed for a couple of years. Part of that transfer is by microvesicles, they're called, little particles, about maybe less than a thousandth the size of a cell, but they contain proteins and RNA. Possibly some DNA, and these microvesicles can pass through the intestine wall and circulate as sort of immune cells, even though they're extremely small, they can be taken up specifically by cells that they're appropriate for. So they're kind of like miniature stem cell repair kits that the milk is providing.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if antibodies in breast milk can serve as an alternative to specific vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they probably should supplement some iron because usually a baby is born with an overload of iron. The heavier the overload, I think the higher the risk of disease is in the newborn baby. But by the time a baby is about two years old, it has grown into that excess of iron and around that time it might be needing some food containing iron such as eggs, but the protective immunity is still being passed along up to three or four years.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if longer duration of breastfeeding leads to more active immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** I think part of the picture that people should keep in mind is that in just the last 20 years, the image of the organism has become more like a continuing stream of developmental changes like we're the last stage of embryonic development, we're still just a big slowly developing embryo really with all of our parts being in play, interacting with the environment and what happens during gestation and in the first two or three years of life when there are fewer cells involved, each of those cells has a longer history of descendants and the more you disturb the organism early in life, the greater the distortion is going to be in adulthood, but we're still in process even after middle age. Stem cells are still being educated and responding, trying to optimize conditions and so it's never too late to correct damage that was done at an early stage. But it's, when possible, the early environment should be optimized by avoiding stresses as far as they can be avoided.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to comment on the long-term effects of early life insults, such as vaccines, on the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** Germ-free animals, even though they're susceptible to infection because they've never been exposed to infections, they happen to be very tough and adaptive. resistant to other kinds of stress. In middle age, their mortality rate is much lower than germ-infested animals. For example, they're very resistant to obesity. They can be fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet and they just don't get fat even though they come from a strain of obese animals. The absence of germs and inflammation makes them resistant to such things as obesity and diabetes. And the other line of experimentation is giving them a diet completely lacking in the so-called essential fatty acids. Those animals are extremely resistant not only to trauma and chemical poisoning, biological toxins and so on, they have an extremely strong immune system. They are hard to infect, takes a huge dose of injected cancer cells or bacteria for example to produce a viable infection.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there's a point at which an organism is fully protected from insults like vaccines, or if it's a continuous process.
