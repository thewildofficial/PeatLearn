**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s and 60s I was mostly a student and teacher in the humanities, English lit and painting for example. and other subjects. Then I decided to go to graduate school in biology and biochemistry, University of Oregon for a PhD because I had been interested in that for many years but I considered that the academic approach to it was pretty futile and misleading in the 1950s and 60s. and since graduating in 1972, I've continued studying, trying to find what I consider the main line of science in biology, which is very opposed to, in many ways, the mainstream medical thinking, and the biology which is influenced by our corporate financing. And this mainstream or main line of biological and chemical thinking that I've been following is more holistic and developmental, time-oriented way of looking at organisms than the reductionist abstract molecular approach that... has become dominant, and that particularly relates to how the immune system works, but that isn't an area that I've specialized in. I did teach a short course in immunology at the medical students in Mexico 1979, but since then, things have radically changed.
**CONTEXT:** Would you just outline your academic and scientific background so that people can understand where you've come from and where you are now?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the medical attitude has been developed for more than 100 years my parents and grandparents were born really before the medical indoctrination got underway in the United States and Europe. But the vaccine history, there were people teaching doctors to vaccinate and indoctrinating the medical community with the idea. But in my parents' generation... They were pretty immune to it. They were forced to be vaccinated in the schools. But it was only a somewhat later generation, I think, more or less coinciding with the American Medical Association taking over medicine. And abolishing, for about 60 or 70 years, the natural approaches to medicine. It was naturopathy and the drug treatment approach rather than the improving general health approach was part of that takeover of medicine. Several people fairly recently have pointed out that vaccines are really... just a cheap way of controlling some infections when it's too expensive to give people good food and a clean environment. It's recognized that that will prevent the infectious diseases but that's too expensive.
**CONTEXT:** Why do you think the vaccines have become what they are now in people's minds and that I believe is that we can't do without them when in fact it was all virtually disappearing due to improved health and sanitary conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** Last month I mentioned the World Health Organization study in Central America that showed that giving a little tiny bit of economic support such as clean water and a nutritious porridge supplement for pregnant women and children that that improved the health of the study village relative to one that had no intervention and the one that had the intervention with doctors and vaccines and standard medicine health went down during the study period that that actually said medicine is bad for you but even the cleaning up of the environment which the Rockefeller Foundation was leader in trying to prevent hookworm infection for example and improving nutrition in schools that was done because it was realized that sick undernourished mentally undeveloped people didn't make good workers so there is a way of looking at cleaning up the environment and feeding people that it's good for the corporate economy too but it happens that it's even cheaper to use vaccines and more profitable even if it wasn't necessary if the environment got clean enough and people were well fed it would still be very profitable to sell the chemical and vaccination approach to health.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned last month about a World Health Organization study in Central America. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** The 1908 Nobel Prize was divided between two proponents of theories of immunity Paul Ehrlich and Haley Metchnikoff. Metchnikoff was an embryologist who emphasized the role of phagocytes in destroying or isolating invading material and reconstituting a healthy organism. Ehrlich was interested in the staining properties of cells and this made him of interest to the chemical companies who he showed that the chemicals which could stain organisms specifically could also react with equal specificity to pathogens and the idea of a magic bullet came from his approach to chemical specificity of mercury and arsenic. There were early examples, later sulfa drugs, that had some specificity to killing the pathogens. But it was the context for almost all thinking about adaptive immunity and how that specificity could be evoked by vaccines. And meanwhile... The developmental innate resistance that Metchnikoff talked about was ignored until Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger in the 90s revived the idea around the concept that danger or damage to the tissue analogous to when Metchnikoff stuck a splinter into a jellyfish. And showed that it was engulfed by phagocytes, wandering cells that could eat invading material and turn it to nutritious use. That was a complete rethinking of the specific chemical orientation of the adaptive immunity people who had... through the, especially in the 60s and 70s, with the idea of the clonal selection of randomly varied molecules in the immune system. The genes were simply churning out random possibilities and the exposure to molecules... of the host organism or of invading organisms, these would govern the selection or destruction of these randomly generated molecules. Linus Pauling had proposed an instruction theory of the antibodies in which the protein or RNA would... wrap itself around, in a sense, the invading material and then compose a protein antibody that would represent the exposure to the shape so it didn't require either an infinite number of genes or this specific rapid mutation that could generate a......almost an infinite number of variable molecules. Since the 1990s, the danger theory has been incorporated into the mainstream of adaptive antibody-centered immunity. But it pretty much limits itself to... Thinking of the innate system as first a barrier and second an amplifier of inflammation which then simply shifts over to making the adaptive system run faster. So they've accepted the innate immunity but in a very subordinate way which is just kind of a... first a screen and then a booster to the system that they've been working out over the last century.
**CONTEXT:** Could you describe the basic immune system, the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, and how vaccination relates to this?

**RAY PEAT:** It's been known for generations that junk added to an antigen makes it produce more active antibodies. Following that accidental learning, it was found that alum, an aluminum compound, is a good kind of junk that makes the... the peptide or the protein of the antigen here to be vaccinated with to make it more effective at forming antibodies and that was just an observed fact without any theory at all to justify it. One theory was that the aluminum condensed the protein, sort of clotted them. And made a little ball of them that, for some reason, the immune system could deal with better than free-floating proteins. But I think the last five or ten years, the tendency is now to see aluminum as an activator of the innate inflammatory process. So there's this growing awareness that......it is creating a general inflammation which then makes the specific response of the adaptive system more energetic. So in the background it's recognized that the adjuvant is there probably for the purpose of creating a generalized inflammation in the organism. And that's where the long range view of doing no harm is being neglected because the embryological approach to the organism sees that what happens early in development is going to have permanent lifelong effects on how the organism turns out.
**CONTEXT:** How do you feel about the introduction to the adaptive system of fragments of, I don't know, core proteins or RNA, and the use of adjuvants like aluminum?

**RAY PEAT:** So if you introduce an inflammatory state early in the life of a person, it's really a matter of waiting 20 or 30 or 40 years to see what the effects of that are going to be. Right. That hasn't been done in any sense because they were so... intent on their simplified molecular view. They talked about the antigen presenting cells which for many years were simply macrophages that caught the germ and then presented it to cells which could then direct the response of the B cells, bone derived cells....to make antibodies, but now with the new emphasis on the innate immune system as an inflammation amplifier, it's recognized that throughout our skin and mucous membranes, there are cells called dendritic cells, which are... really the major antigen-presenting cells. Many other cell types can do this, not just macrophages, but the massively present dendritic cells in the skin and mucous membranes are what will, in the normal exposure to germs, our skin or our mouth. Our nose, lungs, these are where the germ exposure happens. So it's the dendritic cells mainly which capture the antigen and then present them to mostly the thymus cells which then activate and instruct the production of antibodies and so on. In the process of capturing and transferring the reaction to the abnormal or pathogenic protein, it only works if some of the organisms own cell material, the compatibility factors. The MHCs, eh? Yeah. These are broken down and digested. The antigens are broken down and attached in fragments to the organisms' own surface protein groups, compatibility groups. And it's a combination. of the invading peptides with the organism's own normal cell surface that the immunity is developed to. And this, in the extreme form of the danger or damage theory of Jamie Cunliffe, this is the real essence of the whole immune system, that it's there to restore. And maintain the structure of the organism, it's not primarily designed to attack invaders.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned last month about the stream of consciousness, right? And how the innate system functions. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it should be pretty much limited to what's available in proteins of the diet. Partly because when an amino acid is manufactured in a pure chemical form, it's always going to have risky contaminants that aren't present in the whole natural protein. And secondly, a lot of people have talked about the glucose dependency of cancer cells, but actually glutamine is a favorite food. For promoting cancer cell growth, and an excess of any single amino acid can be harmful for various reasons, including simply overloading you with ammonia as they break down. But it's one of the least harmful, so if you had a clean source of it, it would......in some cases be beneficial, but I still think it's risky.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on L-glutamine for healing stomach ulcers and restoring intestinal integrity?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't really know the underlying cause but they become very common when a person approaches the age of 40 or 45 and that suggests that there might be a deficiency of the protective stabilizing hormones and since the skin is a major hormone synthesizing organ, making sure that you have enough cholesterol and thyroid in your diet so that you can make a... A generous amount of protective steroids, I think, would be helpful. Some people have used topical DHEAs dissolved in oil, or progesterone dissolved in oil, or even just pulverized, micropulverized, pregnenolone on the skin. Sometimes that will clear up a variety of growths on the skin. Including skin tags.
**CONTEXT:** What's the underlying cause of skin tags and is there anything topically or otherwise that you could do to get rid of them?

**RAY PEAT:** Some people are allergic to those. Even though the research looks very good especially for turmeric you want to be very careful with any of those herbal things because they have many other components which can trigger strong allergic reactions.
**CONTEXT:** How do you feel about turmeric or ginger or any other kind of like herbal thing that's supposed to reduce inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Having an adequate amount of protein in your diet is an essential first thing. For the average sized person between the ages of 20 and 60 anyway, around 100 grams of good protein per day optimizes. Everything else being equal optimizes your mental functioning. But there was a study of pilots done by the Pentagon in which high-fat diet was the best for their attention and avoidance of accidents in interpreting information. And thiamine... Vitamin B1 is used to produce energy from glucose, and it can make a tremendous difference if you've been at all deficient in it. It's just spectacular what a supplement of 10 milligrams or more of B1 can do for your mental focus and clarity. If it isn't strictly a simple nutritional problem, it's often low temperature of the brain. If your brain is only 94 or 95 degrees Fahrenheit, it just isn't going to function very well in any sense. There were studies in which the brain temperature was raised. Just by heating the head on the outside and they found that memory, quickness of response, clarity of reasoning, all increased as the temperature went up even over 99 degrees. I think it was around 101 where the mental capacity was still increasing.
**CONTEXT:** Can you speak a bit to poor memory, focus, and ADHD?

**RAY PEAT:** It can help. People who have a low body temperature in general. Sometimes have insomnia because of the stress it causes and they find they can sleep better just putting on warm socks and a warm cap. I think wearing a warm cap if your head tends to run at a low temperature is likely to help. But things in the diet that keep your brain temperature up besides protein. Include salt and sugar, and the steroids, pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone, all help to maintain your proper body temperature.
**CONTEXT:** I'm not sure how one would know if their brain is at an optimum temperature. The eardrum thermometers are the closest way to judge your brain temperature. The immediate way. The type of mental activity you're doing can affect the eardrum temperature. Different sides, differently. And to correct that, I mean, even wearing a bean, would that help raise the temperature or is that a little too exterior? How would one go about that?

**RAY PEAT:** A hundred grams of protein per day for even smallish to medium sized people in a military study. Optimizing their ability to work mentally. So I can actually look around and kind of tease out what that would actually equal to as far as portions.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned supplements. I often wonder how well they're being assimilated. I know one would prefer to get them through food, but you don't see too much of a problem. Of buying supplements, I don't know if they can be overdone as well, but an example is protein I have in the past, for example, had taken amino acid and protein supplements, but how much you said, I believe, 100 milligrams of protein, what would that be equal to? For half an egg or a beef or chicken, quickly.

**RAY PEAT:** An example of how to get 100 grams of protein would be just three quarts of milk. All by itself would provide just about the right amount, but you could also get it from 15 eggs, or a combination of a quart and a half of milk and a few eggs and some cheese. But you can't depend on the protein in... Nuts and beans, for example, because of their digestibility and quality isn't equal to the animal proteins such as milk, cheese and eggs.

**RAY PEAT:** It is the precursor to two very important substances, one is the energy reserve that backs up ATP, creatine phosphate, but the other one is nitric oxide and very often if you simply supplement arginine you are going to boost. Nitric oxide which turns off your ability to produce energy.
**CONTEXT:** I'd like to, I've heard a lot about L-arginine. Is that good for you? Can you quickly tell me what that does and if it is good for you?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's currently believed to be correct for the average person in the northern. So it's not too much? I've never heard of it being too much.
**CONTEXT:** And the other thing is vitamin D3. I'm not sure what the difference is between vitamin D3 or any other number, but that's what I was advised to take because I had low vitamin D. Is 5000 units a day a proper dose?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, many people are doing that. And I think the most informed people on the subject say that it's perfectly harmless and will usually be an adequate amount for the officially recommended a few hundred units per day. It definitely is inadequate for most people.
**CONTEXT:** Because on the ball it says to take it every other day. And I found that a little odd. So you think it's better to take it every day?

**RAY PEAT:** Occasionally, if the rest of your diet is good, refined sugar can be very helpful. Honey, for example, provides a lot of sugar. Basically, the same as refined sugar with a few extra chemicals that can be helpful.
**CONTEXT:** You say sugar is good for you, but haven't I heard you say before that you mean sugar from fruit and not refined sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you eat too much and you're not getting generally good backup nutrition. I recommend it only for therapeutic specific uses generally. Getting your sugar from fruit is the best because of the minerals and other nutrients with it.
**CONTEXT:** Why is sugar helpful? I heard that too much can overact your insulin and cause you to gain too much weight.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the innate system really is a repair system and the signals that it sends out which can become inflammatory I think are calling in repair cells to repair the damage and that its ideal function shouldn't reach the... the stage of inflammation, and it shouldn't activate the adaptive system strongly. That's what I see as the proper line of development, thinking of the organism in the long-range, lifelong pattern of development. You don't want to overburden your system and misdirect it by causing repeated......inflammation and an example of why I think it is not primarily a system of producing inflammation is that Pregnenolone has been discovered to turn off the immune cells that are activated by, for example, an injury or parasite or bacteria getting into your skin or mucous membrane. And the cells should produce their reaction and call in repair processes and then they should switch over to producing Pregnenolone to stabilize cells and stop the inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** I was talking about the Seeing the innate immune system as a source of inflammation and the barrier function and something to simply turn on the adaptive immune system that the medical world is thinking about. But I think the inflammatory function is, to some extent, a malfunction of the innate immune system. And it's when the irritation or damage has not been repaired quickly enough. that you see a noticeable inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think it activates the stress system if you're having to produce the ketones yourself.
**CONTEXT:** I was doing my question about the ketosis concept. Um, I was curious about ketosis. And if it's actually the best idea to eat mostly fat. And a little bit of green, but no grains and no sugar, I've heard.

**RAY PEAT:** You're supposed to eat grains? If you have them in your diet, precursors that are partly formed are already ketones. Those are great and are equivalent to sugar, only better.
**CONTEXT:** I'm not following here.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if you have to turn on the process of making them, it means you aren't getting enough sugar in your diet, enough glucose or...
**CONTEXT:** Where do I find this information? Because everywhere I look it's the opposite.

**RAY PEAT:** You turn on cortisol production when you don't have enough sugar. And the cortisol has chronic, harmful effects, developmental effects that... So you need sugar, huh? Like fruit or from honey?
**CONTEXT:** So you need sugar, huh? Like fruit or from honey?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a fraction of the diet. Like milk, milk has a fraction of sugar about equal to the amount of protein.
**CONTEXT:** So you need sugar, huh? Like fruit or from honey?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are articles on my website.
**CONTEXT:** Is there any literature that can back up what you're saying?
