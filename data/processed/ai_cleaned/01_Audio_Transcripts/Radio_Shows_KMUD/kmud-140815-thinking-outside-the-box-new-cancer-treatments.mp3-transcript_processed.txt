**RAY PEAT:** "I saw an increase of reductive activity with aging. For example, you can put dye in young tissue and old tissue, and reductive enzymes are fueled byâ€¦ The energy-producing system and the internal antioxidant system is part of it. The older tissue reduced the dye much more energetically, looking like it was more alive. For example, you can test the vitality of any tissue by the intensity of staining this tetrazoleum. I found that an overdose of estrogen or deficiency of vitamin E or any serious injury such as x-rays will increase the ability of the tissue to stain this dye. So aging and these various injuries all increased the reductive. Activity of the tissue which involves what are called the anti-oxidative enzyme defense systems. And that was what got me interested in the fact that cancer is very rich in anti-oxidative defenses. Not only the enzymes with a lot of specific chemicals that will... act as antioxidants, at that time people were trying to identify the specific chemicals that cancers used to defend themselves against oxidative poisons, the chemotherapy and radiation oxidative damage, but over the last 40 years it has developed that it isn't just... a simple chemical that they produce defensively, but the very basic life processes are shifted in that direction, which increases the reductive or anti-oxidative staining of this tetrazoleum and just as an indicator, that's easy to see."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his early research into aging and oxidative changes, and how this led him to observe a connection between cancer and anti-oxidative defenses.

**RAY PEAT:** "The rigid doctrine of the organism that governs current cancer therapy, it really was imposed on a more basic biological view that started... around 1830 with Johannes Mueller in Germany, who described tumors as a problem of organization, not of defective cells. And that approach continued through embryology right through the 1930s and 1940s, in which people could dissociate an embryo. or a primitive organism and show that the cells themselves could reconstruct the organism after they had been entirely separated. So the environment that they live in is constantly being constructed to meet their needs. The cells have particular needs and they will change. The environment to meet those needs, if they have the energy and the resources. If for some reason a cell or an organ becomes idle, it loses its sense of direction. If there's no stimulation and no energy flowing through the system, the cell doesn't have any particular... occupation or knowledge of what it should be doing, but ordinary cells, everything else being ideal, will, if they see a defect in their environment, they will reach out and correct the defect. The extracellular matrix, the main components are collagen for stiffness, rigid. Linear molecules that twist around each other and in between those stiff collagen molecules there are carbohydrate chains, polysaccharides and some with proteins attached, some just simple polysaccharides with amino groups on them that retain water. Create an elastic or springy environment against the pure hard environment of the pure collagen system. And cells prefer a certain rigidity of environment when you take an isolated cell and put it on a surface that varies in stiffness. The cells will creep towards the stiffer......firmer footing. They don't like squishy things to sit on, and if you inject broken down collagen fibers into an organism or a developing embryo, the cells will rearrange the disorganized collagen that you have given them....sort of like brick layers, if they will align it in the direction they want, and tug on it, and communicate partly just by the way they tug, and the other cells sense the tugging and pull back. Because they have an inherent knowledge of the structure in which they should be in. Yeah, and they like it fairly solid, but they can create... more of the polysaccharide, so that it holds more water, and is open and able to diffuse things to feed them. So it has to be just right, and there are various specific proteins that they secrete to attach themselves to do that pulling and pushing. But there are some......proteins at the surface which happen to be chemically connected and interactive with the very structure of the cell all the way through in a very coherent, unifying way. The sulfur and sulfhydryl system of the cell is what gives it much of its toughness. And it has to be constantly broken down and reformed because the cell inside is constantly in motion. So you're saying that there's a constant connection of sulfhydryl from the outside of the cell to the center of the cell? Yeah. About 40 years ago, some experimenters found that if they blocked those surface sulfur groups, the cell couldn't......to its environment. So the degree of reduction and oxidation of the surface sulfur groups is a very big part of how it sticks to its environment and gets where it has to be and helps to shape its environment. And that degree of oxidation is governed by what... has been called the anti-oxidant defense system."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the historical understanding of tumors and the role of the extracellular matrix, emphasizing how cells actively shape their environment and the importance of the sulfhydryl system for cell adhesion and communication.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you look at the balance between oxydants and antioxidants or reductants in the cell... Many people think of it as a reducing environment or an anti-oxidative environment, but when you look at specific components, such as the molecule that transfers electrons from glucose, for example, to the mitochondrion to be oxidized, NAD is the coenzyme and it becomes reduced to NADH, which is the source of the anti-oxidant electrons, and if you look at the healthy cell, the ratio of the oxidized form is hundreds of times the reduced form is about 500 or more times the the oxidized form is 500 times greater than the reduced form, so that's the governing antioxidant in a highly oxidized state. And that is in balance with ascorbic acid and coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E and the sulfur system, glutathione. And glutathione disulfide, these are all energized by the electron from NADH, which comes from glucose normally. And so the cell normally is in this really highly oxidized state, as determined by the ratio of NAD to NADH. And if the cell is thick... For example, a cancer cell, the ratio approaches 1 to 1, it's almost 50% in the reduced antioxidant state. And if you injure a cell, you turn on this signaling system that James Watson talked about as one of the problems that he says people are looking for. Some way to turn that off so you don't keep pushing the cell in the direction of too much reduction. But in fact, anything that irritates the cell is likely to turn on more of the reducing system and push it in that direction of stress or cancer. A high ratio of NADH to NAD approaching one to one."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the critical NAD/NADH ratio in cellular health, highlighting that a healthy cell is highly oxidized, while cancer cells exhibit a significantly reduced state.

**RAY PEAT:** "You're saying that you want it in a oxidized form, you want the cell not to have access to antioxidant activity. Yeah, the healthy active cell has about 500 times more oxidized NAD. Okay. And when the people who are selling their... very powerful antioxidants, a lot of the advertisements say it's many times more powerful than vitamin C or than vitamin E. But what they're doing is testing the antioxidants in vitro, in a test tube, and they will attack and destroy the oxidizing fragments, free radicals. It happens that just like the NAD, NADH couple, which is highly oxidized, the things in balance with that ascorbic acid, vitamin E for example, inside the cell they become oxidized. Dehydroascorbic acid is an oxidant and it's eight times more concentrated in the cell than outside. It's relatively hydrophobic and it goes to the oily parts of the cell. So that will itself break down the antioxidant on the outside of the cell? Yeah, when you're irritating the cell and turning on the defensive antioxidant reductive systems and producing a lot of the fragments....that reduce glutathione, one of the sulfur molecules that exchanges throughout the system. When the cell is irritated, that and the associated ascorbic acid, which becomes reduced, and the vitamin E, which becomes reduced, these will stop up the toxic fragments. But the trouble is that the... The system which normally should be oxidized all the way through the ascorbic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, and so on. These, the whole system gets stuck in an over-reduced, over-electrified form, not enough oxidation going on to pull it back where it should be. And since the 1930s. People have seen that any cell which is dividing goes into this highly reduced state in which everything shifts to the sulfhydryl rather than the disulfide form. Okay and this includes the cancer cells then? Yeah and normal cells go into this phase very quickly divide and then return to their oxidized state. Right. Vitamin E and vitamin C go back to becoming oxidants and keeping the system tightened up, helping to squeeze water out of the system and the balance where the membrane potential of the cell is normally around 100 millivolts difference when you measure it with an electrode stuck into it. Redox difference is in a range of about 15 millivolts, a very small fraction of the energy which is available for induction. If you measure the voltage between glucose and oxygen, it's over a volt, so it's about 100 times more than the difference....of 15 millivolts which governs practically all of the reactions in the cell. The enzymes which produce energy, synthesize protein, which govern the economy of the cell, these are sensitive to being reduced or oxidized, and so this 15 millivolt difference... can shift the whole economy of the cell. That's a pretty tight range within which normality exists. And when you measure the products, such as pyruvic acid versus lactic acid, these are an excreted or easily extracted index of the oxidative or reductive state of the cell. And so when the cell is in trouble, it turns... pyruvic acid into lactic acid by reducing it. So that's a reflection of the highly reduced antioxidant state when the cell is distressed and making lactic acid. When oxygen is working properly, it's not producing lactic acid. It's using, consuming the pyruvic acid, turning it into carbon dioxide. So the ratio between not only pyruvic acid and lactic acid......overall it would be between lactic acid versus carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an acid and so in a sense it's an oxidant. It causes retraction of electrons. Because the fundamental here is basically mopping up electrons. Yeah."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that while antioxidants are beneficial, the *overuse* of potent, non-specific antioxidants can disrupt the cell's natural oxidative balance. He explains how vitamin C and E, when functioning correctly, become oxidized within the cell, contributing to a healthy, oxidized state. He contrasts this with the highly reduced state seen in dividing and cancerous cells, which leads to lactic acid production.

**RAY PEAT:** "The antioxidant system is doing good stuff defending against toxic free radicals. But the oxidative normal functions involving ascorbic acid or dehydroascorbate and vitamin E. And the sulfhydryl balancing system, those are able to control the system that he suggests the toxic free radicals would be doing. So you can get both the good defensive process against free radicals and the limiting... of the production of more free radicals without resorting to one of the toxic chemicals that he's suggesting."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat addresses the role of free radicals, stating that while the antioxidant system defends against toxic free radicals, the normal oxidative functions of substances like vitamin C and E are crucial for controlling the system and limiting further free radical production.

**RAY PEAT:** "So the good antioxidants are working. With the mitochondria, and the faster that system runs, the fewer electrons get away to cause the dangerous pre-radicals. So this is a bit like the aerobic versus anaerobic glycolysis and its effects. Yeah, when the cell gets out of control, oxygen is no longer able to... suck up the electrons, and so the cell has to expel the electrons in the form of lactic acid. And that's a survival mechanism, but it happens that when you do that, the desperate production of lactic acid to draw off excess electrons, it happens to raise the pH inside the cell and lower the pH outside the cell. I think it was the embryologist Holt Freighter who demonstrated that if you put an embryo in a slightly acidified solution, the cells simply leave the embryo and float off and do their own thing. So the cancer or the stress metabolism acidifying outside the cell is tending to destroy the cell's connection to its environment. And at the same time raising the pH inside the cell makes it swell up, take up water and shifts the self-hydral balance into the reduced state and tends to turn on constant cell diffusion."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how efficient mitochondrial function, supported by proper antioxidants, prevents electrons from escaping and forming harmful free radicals. He links uncontrolled cellular processes, like anaerobic glycolysis and lactic acid production, to a shift towards a reduced state, intracellular alkalinization, and extracellular acidification, which can disrupt cellular integrity and function.

**RAY PEAT:** "The exercise......idea is very relevant to breast cancer. You've probably heard the statistics that women who are constantly having babies and nursing through their whole fertile years have a very low risk of breast cancer. And so what is working keeps working. And the cells which have a load, a job to do......are keeping their extracellular matrix organized to support what they're doing."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat connects the protective effect of frequent pregnancies and nursing against breast cancer to the concept of cells maintaining an organized extracellular matrix when actively engaged in a function.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's the main thing. It erases... For example, looking at connective tissue like the tendons, which are almost pure connective tissue, if you expose a rabbit, for example, to estrogen, the connective tissue, such as the tendon, becomes stiff and hardened. And every time it becomes pregnant and the estrogen goes up, you see a shift. Momentarily towards hardening, but after each pregnancy, it's less hardened than before. And it's the progesterone which reverses those changes, even in the connective tissue, the extracellular matrix. And it's also erasing the intracellular estrogen functions. The synthesis of estrogen, the......failure to detoxify it, tendency to bind it, all of these are regulated by progesterone as an anti-estrogen."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how progesterone, particularly during pregnancy, plays a crucial role in maintaining the flexibility and health of connective tissue and the extracellular matrix, counteracting the stiffening effects of estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "The other thing I thought about in line with the almost visualizations of how this works is... Through the years, I've heard of different healers and people that are more new-agey kind of things, where they try to get people to imagine certain things and then try to heal it. But then I started thinking, if you were really seeing this like you're seeing it, you really could, in a way, be a part of the healing process in that you're seeing what's wrong and you're seeing what you need to do to fix it. You know what I mean? The different theories of what a cancer is, the new theory, it's called Toft Tissue Organization Field Theory, and I think that needs another adjective, organismic. It isn't just the local tissue organization, but it's also the way that tissue fits into the whole organism. And how the activity of the organism keeps everything working, loading all of its parts so that they know what they're doing. It's very much the, and I don't want to make a quip here, but it's very much the holistic way of looking at it. And that's what I found was so interesting with, even though it may not have been totally accurate, Dr. Watson's comments. That we made earlier and also this kind of novel approach to cancer treatment through the looking at the extracellular matrix is very much a holistic environment upon which every cell is in communication with every other cell. Stem cells are arising all the time and actually nothing is fixed. Everything is very fluid and dynamic and very much very much able to change very quickly. Individual cells, for example, pigment cells. You can sometimes see them migrating through the tissue and they move at the same rate that cells have been found to be able to crawl on a glass slide. At body temperature, that can be something like a centimeter and a half per day. A very tiny cell really zips along through the solid tissue. Far out."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the importance of a holistic, organismic view of health, emphasizing that cellular function is deeply interconnected with the entire organism and its environment. He highlights the dynamic and fluid nature of tissues and the potential for cellular change.

**RAY PEAT:** "You don't produce the ketones unless you're raising your cortisol enough to activate the conversion of protein into the ketones, to activate the conversion of protein into glucose at the same time you're turning some of the fat into ketones. So it's a pretty stressful work. Yeah, and I think the problem occurs over a few years of exposure to that increased breakdown of protein. The cortisol is affecting your connective tissues and the explorer, I don't remember his name at the moment, Arctic Explorer, who advocated the meat diet. He noticed that the Eskimos were very prematurely aged in appearance, their skin became very wrinkled. And I think that's what you would expect from being exposed to very high cortisol constantly. So the ketone diet is a pretty stressful way to do anything like lose weight and losing weight in general is not a very Good idea unless it's done slowly Especially in people that have lots of stored polyunsaturates in their fat makeup Which is most people unless they're really watching what they eat and avoiding polyunsaturates and making sure they consume lots of saturated fats Actually, it's a very yeah, I want to make a very quick point here I was back in England three weeks ago for a couple of weeks and on my way out of the airport I grabbed a couple of periodicals to read while I was on the plane. I got a New Scientific and I got the Daily Telegraph and on the cover of the New Scientist it had a picture of a frying pan and the word F-A-C-T, the C was a piece of carbonized bacon and the F and the A and the T of the word fact were still intact and it so what you saw was fat with a carbonized piece of... bacon forming the sea but it was blackened against the black background of the frying pan and it said have we really got 40 years of dietary advice wrong and it was actually a good breath of fresh another one of the breaths that hopefully wake people up enough when they get enough these fresh breaths coming in that to say that they were very much behind especially dairy saturated fat and that all saturated fat in general was very good for you and that the polyunsaturates and the margarines and the fish oils are actually being shown now to be turned on their head and they were actually saying yep we think we've got 40 years of dietary advice wrong so that was good to see and then the other sad point i did see in the daily telegraph was that in england they're now running gm crops and i when i left england in 2001 they were actually europe was all gmo free uh so now in england they're actually making a gm crop to express omega-3 oils so that they can feed this crop to gm salmon that are grown in the environment that doesn't allow them to pick up the the polyunsaturate from the algae and the microorganisms that they eat so they're now going to feed them a gm crop expressing omega-3s i can't believe it uh so not too sure what's happening folks but i know california's still on the cutting edge i think of uh trying to see sideways here with our uh food and environment and everything else that's going on so hopefully uh between the west coast and the east coast of the states we can keep this kind of thing going and alive"
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat critiques the ketogenic diet, explaining that it's a stressful metabolic state that increases cortisol and protein breakdown, leading to premature aging. He also notes the recent shift in dietary advice, with scientific publications now acknowledging the benefits of saturated fats and the potential harms of polyunsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the first world war it was used as an emergency treatment to stimulate healing in wounds hold down infections and around the time 1920s I think it was often used for inoperable cancer to pack it with urea to uh it actually was not only keeping down infection but I think it was actually having a healing influence and the effect of forming lactic acid that I mentioned which causes the pH of the cell to become more alkaline inside that causes swelling and swelling promotes replication, proliferation and simply an osmotic environment which could be very concentrated Sodium chloride or urea happens to be a very innocuous substance It doesn't exactly have an osmotic effect like sodium chloride because the sodium is kept out of the cell but the urea acts somewhat like an osmotic dehydrator It helps to prevent... excess swelling and water retention."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the historical use of urea as a wound healing agent and in cancer treatment, suggesting its osmotic properties help prevent excess swelling and water retention in cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so. Huh. OK. And the dehydrated cell becomes more oxidatively active and catabolic, burning fuel faster, where the swollen cell is anabolic and simply growing and dividing. So... Many things can help to reduce that water retention. I think urea would work well with a good thyroid program, which helps you to retain the normal amount of sodium chloride. Hypothyroid people not only produce the matrix, which is over-hydrated. It shifts the cells so that they produce molecules that hold water outside of cells. But the low thyroid function lets your kidneys lose sodium while retaining water. And so any of the osmotic therapies, such as urea, I think would work nicely with that....supplementing thyroid to normalize the sodium retention."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on how urea, by dehydrating cells, promotes oxidative activity and catabolism, contrasting this with the anabolic state of swollen cells. He suggests that urea, combined with thyroid support, can help normalize sodium retention and reduce cellular water retention.

**RAY PEAT:** "I see little models. Not that I've seen anything exactly like it, but I have mental models, for example, of the extension of the sulfhydryl groups onto the surface of a cell. I have very concrete pictures of how that works. It helps me when I'm looking for information to check against the published research facts to have a concrete mental image. And the reason I'm asking that question is you were explaining like the collagen lining up and a lot of times when I'm reading your work, I find myself trying to imagine these things and then I'm thinking that's got to be an important part of your process in trying to imagine. Since you're a painter, visual images of how this actually might look, is that true? Oh sure, yeah, I've always been aware of having a map of where I'm going and I was surprised in graduate school when a psychology professor was surprised at my description and I asked him how he had found his way from his home to his office. He said, go out the front door, turn left, turn left again, turn right. It was all a set of rules. I think some professorial types actually think in terms of words and rules."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes his process of forming mental models and visualizations to understand complex biological processes, contrasting this with a purely word-based or rule-based approach to thinking.
