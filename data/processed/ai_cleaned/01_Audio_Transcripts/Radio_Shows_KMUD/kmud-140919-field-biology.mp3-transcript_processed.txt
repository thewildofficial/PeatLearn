**RAY PEAT:** Ascorbic acid functions primarily I think in the cell as an oxidant maintaining cell structure and regulating synthetic processes largely by its oxidative form dehydroascorbic acid. And so you don't want an excess of the reduced form and vitamin E had a history really starting as an anti-estrogen regulator of the sex hormones and after it was discovered that the unsaturated fatty acids were causing sexual derangement sterility especially in males. And a brain decomposition then was when vitamin E shifted over to be described as an antioxidant rather than as an anti-estrogen and still it's gradually being recognized as an anti-inflammatory agent but it's still stuck in that mold of being called an antioxidant.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the rationale behind suppressing reactive oxygen species as an antioxidant, particularly in relation to cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're thinking that there are several interpretations but one group thinks that if you intensify the reactive oxygen species you'll be able to kill the cancer cells because they are defending themselves by their excess antioxidant capacity. But others recognize that it's the reactive oxygen species that are causing the de-differentiation and aggressive destructive processes in the cancer cells. So reducing the formation of them metabolically is the safe biological organized way to go about preventing cancer.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the rationale behind suppressing reactive oxygen species as an antioxidant in cancer prevention.

**RAY PEAT:** Preventing it really is part of curing the disease. Some people have said that you can never tell when a cancer is malignant until the patient is dead. Because the organism always has the capacity for spontaneous recovery from any kind of tumor. It's very... Most often seen in melanomas, because you can clip off a few bits of the tumor and see that it's definitely cancerous, but there's spontaneous regression seen so often in melanomas, simply because they're near the surface and visible. But I think that spontaneous regression is probably going on all the time with many kinds of cancer.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the concept of spontaneous cancer regression.

**RAY PEAT:** Definitely not, because so many things will disturb your defensive reactions against them and just annoy them and make them try to survive more intensely rather than more intelligently.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat advocates topical treatment of melanomas.

**RAY PEAT:** I think systemic is better because everything contains impurities and just a little bit of the wrong impurity can irritate and possibly direct cells in the wrong direction, but I Haven't experimented at all with any of those Older traditional things, but I did experiment on my own things a couple of doctors at different times We're convinced that I had things that were melanomas from their shape and behavior Probably a total of 15 or 20 times altogether I've had things popping up that were black and blue and growing quickly and changing shape and just by increasing my thyroid systemically and putting some DHEA and or progesterone on the skin adjacent to maybe an inch away from the developing spot Within two or three days, you would see very intense changes happening, and for example, the color would change from blue and white to maybe an even brown color, and then simply the whole thing would melt away, so it's kind of like giving the cells what they need to differentiate properly, otherwise they go off exploring what they want to be to deal with the deficiency that they have, and I think the body, the particular areas they choose seem to be areas that the body is able to provide something that sustains their growth, and if you can let the body provide more of that, increasing its energy. Then those cells can go ahead and differentiate and the reducing or antioxidant direction of a cell is interfering with differentiation. There are several chemicals known as differentiating agents that some doctors are treating cancer with and what they have in common is a shift towards. The oxidative balance of the cell.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's view on topical treatments for skin tumors like those treated with bloodroot, and Dr. Peat shares his personal experience with systemic thyroid, DHEA, and progesterone for suspected melanomas.

**RAY PEAT:** Well those people who were insisting on a kind of straight line causality. Gregor Mendel, for example, wanted traits to be eternal rather than occasional or accidental or changing. So he did his experiments to show that even though the pea plants were changing, they had traits which were eternal. And that got adopted by the gene people at the beginning of this century and that led to people like Watson identifying this eternal gene except with the qualification that although it's like Mendel's eternal gene it can be changed but only by chance not by anything intentionally useful to the individual organism and all of it. At the same time that was going on, other people were showing evidence that the whole organism is influencing what happens to those traits. That the traits actually can be blended and changed rather than being discrete, absolute, causal units. And the... The other kind of causality is recognizing that at every level you have a new kind of causality working. Aristotle had a complex view of causality, the substance and the intention and so on, and with the development of cybernetics. This Aristotelian view of causality, rather than Plato's fixed rigid view of the nature of things, the cybernetics people saw that each level of organization has its own laws and causal processes. And there were particular ulterior motives at driving. Each of these greater views of causality and of biology and it happened that there were business interests that promoted the idea of genetic based medicine. Each drug could identify a causal action on one of these causal genes. All through the 20th century there were these profit motives of selling drugs for diseases supporting that idea of genetic causality. But then the cloning and stem cell businesses started to be seen as viable. And those were things that the reductionists had......that absolutely couldn't exist. You can't have stem cells. You can't clone an animal from a body cell. So now that they saw that those could be good business, they changed the history. And Barbara McClintock, who in the 40s and 50s had been treated rudely when she would deliver a paper... In the 80s and 90s, she was pulled out of obscurity while she was still alive and given the MacArthur Grant and Nobel Prize to create a new history that would justify cloning and genetic engineering, changing the genes, as something like a natural process. Science is really being driven not by what's plausible or really ultimately helpful, but by what these powerful institutions see as something in their interest. Profit driven, turned into a business that can be used to generate income to further the business. I think that's a fairly common world. A game that's played in most businesses.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how science can move in the right direction to allow a paradigm shift in our understanding of disease towards constructive and regenerative processes, referencing James Watson's shift towards a more open-minded view of biological interactions.

**RAY PEAT:** The classic embryology is where the field thinking really had its practical influence and there were great implications for health. In their experiments, for example, someone demonstrated that knowing that you could take a part of an early embryo out of the embryo and the embryo would replace it, the cells weren't fixed, they could fill in for each other, and you could move a cell from one place to another and its fate would be changed by where you put it. So that it could be developing along the line to become a foot and putting into another place, it could become a face. And knowing that kind of field effect, one researcher took a tumor and cut off a tadpole's tail and grafted the tumor on where the tail had been. And the tumor was converted by the developmental field of the tadpole. Into a new tail. So it's potentially a very useful way of looking at the organism that cells are shaped by the environment as well as modifying the environment.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the practical influence of field thinking in classic embryology and its implications for health.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, light has been, there's quite a bit of evidence that light produced by the dividing cells and metabolizing cells is a signal. He's arguing for infrared as a very important signal. The curvatures in the 1930s provided good evidence that there's ultraviolet frequency. They demonstrated that it could transmit mitogenic signals through a quartz glass, but not through ordinary glass that would filter out ultraviolet. But still, that's just something that's hardly been scratched. Albert Buehler is currently probably... One of the leading people, Fritz Pope in Germany, has been another more recent one.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Gunther Albrecht Buehler's work on "Cell Intelligence" and cells displaying intelligence, specifically their gravitation towards infrared light.

**RAY PEAT:** Albrecht Buehler sees fields as working both inside and outside the cell, so the cell has to have a very organized......meaning interpretation system for knowing which set of genes to turn on and off in certain environments and cells have to sort of reach out and manipulate the environment around them, conditioning their surroundings to fit their needs and so any change in the surroundings that they can manage. will help them follow the course that is best for the organism. The organism as a whole running into stresses and problems can change that territory around the individual cells as well as the metabolism available to that cell. And so you're changing the... the surrounding structure and the metabolism, and those function as a single system. The metabolism is creating the, for example, collagen to restore and renew its environment, is produced under, more of it is produced under stress when lactic acid is present because there's not enough oxygen. And lactic acid turns on many of these reactive defensive processes that as a signal to the organism will tell the organism to deliver more oxygen, more sugar, more nutrients to the cells. But if the cell doesn't get that, what it needs from the rest of the organism. Or if the field disrupting it is too intense, for example, just a very intense electromagnetic field, for example. Almost any kind of disruptive field, ultraviolet, ionizing radiation or intense radio frequency can shift the cell or hold it, keep it from maturing properly. But if the organism can get the necessary materials to the cell, the cell can recover. And in this recovery condition, part of the recovery will allow it to communicate so that if it's in the wrong place, it might simply allow itself to collapse and be used as material for adjoining cells. In the apoptosis process, but ordinarily even very deranged cells can begin functioning and participating constructively if they get the right materials. But lactic acid is one of the basic disrupting signals if it continues too long. And it turns out that one of the basic features of diabetes......is that they can't oxidize sugar all the way to carbon dioxide and instead they produce lactic acid. And if that continues too long, lactic acidosis is very often what diabetics used to die from. But any of these stresses will interfere with the ability to oxidize glucose in the brain. Blood vessels in the organ that's under too much stress and not getting repair materials will shift over to producing lactic acid and the lactic acid is a stress signal, an immune signal for the rest of the organism.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how field theory can be applied to conditions like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, referencing Albrecht Buehler's work.

**RAY PEAT:** A very well developed athlete will not produce lactic acid too easily. A sedentary person who is forced to exercise. Will be flooded with lactic acid because they haven't developed the system for delivering oxygen and fuel to the tissues. So a really good athlete is resistant to producing lactic acid and carbon dioxide produced by healthy metabolism directly participates in suppressing lactic acid and in maintaining. And promoting oxidative energy production. And a place where you can see this is people who live at high altitudes. The balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide leaves their bodies having a higher residual carbon dioxide level. They can work very intensely without producing lactic acid. That's called the... lactate paradox sometimes, because ordinarily oxygen deficiency is what turns on lactic acid. But once you get adapted and are able to produce a lot of carbon dioxide or hold it in your tissues, then that in itself prevents this toxic formation of lactic acid.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the relationship between lactic acid, exercise, and adaptation, referencing the "lactate paradox" at high altitudes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's part of it. The tissues in themselves, they develop more mitochondria and the enzymes that regulate carbon dioxide shift and the red blood cell itself doesn't deliver all of its carbon dioxide when it gets to the lungs. It picks up as much oxygen as it can but at a lower oxygen pressure that means the blood is still retaining a slightly higher amount of CO2.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the adaptation to high altitudes regarding lactic acid is different from the adaptation involving increased red blood cells.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably the time that you're feeling the stress would be the best time. To measure it, if you do it when you're fasting, you're going to get a different measurement. You just have to know what time of day and what the circumstances are. It's increasingly being used, for example, to diagnose cancer and monitor the progress when the cancer is being regressed. The lactic acid in the serum goes down.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the feasibility of lactate testing to ascertain stress levels and the best way to perform it.

**RAY PEAT:** It starts showing up in the blood at a very early stage. At a certain point, I don't remember the exact concentration, but it in itself causes... an inactivation of the immune system that should be helping to correct the cancer. But even before that, it couldn't be seen as a product of the cancer. I expect somebody would probably have to have not just one spot check. But several over a period of weeks just to see whether or not the level of lactic acid in the body was holding fairly stable, it was stably high or whether a high reading may be just an aberration due to something. Since everyone over the age of 50 has cells that can be diagnosed as cancer, it's a good idea not to be panicked by any measurement that could indicate cancer. It's simply a... a sign, for example, if you ate something very disagreeable, your lactic acid would go up just from the general inflammation. And so you want to take everything in context. And even if it's being produced by a cancer, most cancers don't kill people. Since in adults, cancer, if you... Look carefully enough, you can find cancer-like cells everywhere in everyone of middle age or more. So it's something that's naturally being cured spontaneously.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks at what stage of tumor development lactic acid would be increased.

**RAY PEAT:** Everything that keeps your free fatty acids from being released. And those are released by too much adrenaline, for example. Many of the pituitary hormones in general, help to increase the toxic free fatty acids. And everything you can do to lower the stress hormones. Aspirin, for example, is a good anti-inflammatory, anti-stress agent. Vitamin E is another protective. Ascorbic acid in ordinary foods provide abundant amounts of ascorbic acid so I don't recommend that as a supplement.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for the best method to raise carbon dioxide levels, which Dr. Peat has indicated is analogous to an anti-lactate.

**RAY PEAT:** This is why you're so big on orange juice. Yeah and meat, eggs, milk, everything. Vegetables of all sorts contain ascorbic acid but meat. It contains it in the dehydroascorbate form where people measuring the reduced form overlook it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the source of ascorbic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** Um, there definitely is......something to the principle, but I've never seen evidence that it is as specific as many of the people claim it to be. I know people who use apparatus of that sort, and I think it's acting probably as a stimulus rather than having that specific action that the Rifeans claim for it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the viability of Rife machines for killing pathogens.

**RAY PEAT:** I think ozone is too toxic in itself. The superoxide radical which is produced by ionized air and some ionized water. That can be beneficial as part of a detox system in the lungs, for example, from ionized air. But I would be very careful with either ozone or peroxide containing water.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on ozonated water for health benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, there's a lot on the Internet suggesting that it's a lifetime project. There's also quite a bit of information that says that two or three weeks with the right combination of antibiotics almost always cures it. So I think it's good to look widely, get a second, third and fourth opinion before you commit yourself to a very, very prolonged protocol.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's view on Lyme disease protocols.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, the class of bacteria, the spirochetes in general, some of them can be very harmful.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Dr. Peat's view on the pathogen itself, the spirochete, that causes Lyme disease.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, sometimes it disappears in just two or three weeks. I know a lot of people on disease and I've never seen that work ever that quickly. Is there some special protocol you're speaking of? You can find several articles on PubMed that are very good. And I think part of the problem that makes it seem so incurable is that it often is... misdiagnosed. They recognize evidence of an infection, but they don't recognize any clear signs of improvement because in many cases the person just isn't eating right or has other pathogens in their environment.
**CONTEXT:** The caller questions Dr. Peat's statement about Lyme disease being cured in two to three weeks with antibiotics.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the other thing just to interject caller is that more often than not when people may well test positive I think a lot of the population would actually test positive on an ELISA test for Borrelia antibodies etc or whatever is now used to currently diagnose Lyme's. They have a lot of other metabolic defects and I think that in particular is what causes people to be so sick as it were and especially with the protocols that are used for not just antibiotics but other fairly heavy drugs, I think these can really play into someone's downfall and like we spoke about earlier Dr. Pete mentioned, the kind of energetics in the body that gets Once someone's exposed to so many drugs and so many chemicals to try and supposedly cure something, it's very difficult for the organism to respond appropriately and it's more of a kind of a failure of the organism under the barrage of drugs and chemicals to treat that, that's the problem.
**CONTEXT:** The host and Dr. Peat discuss the potential for misdiagnosis and underlying metabolic issues contributing to Lyme disease symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, breastfeeding naturally but with the mother well fed and happy and unstressed because when the mother is......under stress or not properly nourished, the composition of the milk shows it and the milk, good milk contains a lot of blood sugar converted into the lactose of the milk and hormones, some thyroid and progesterone and a lot of immune factors so even if a baby......has an endocrine problem, as long as it's getting good milk, something like hypothyroidism often doesn't show up just because the milk is so rich in these protective factors.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for the best possible nutritional start for a newborn, referencing the World Health Organization's recommendation for breastfeeding.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's probably analogous. The right antibiotic is needed to treat tertiary syphilis, something that gets into the brain and nervous system will do it.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the analogy between primary, secondary, and tertiary syphilis and the stages of Lyme disease (Borrelia).

**RAY PEAT:** You're a very strong advocate of antibiotics and I understand the rationale behind it completely. So, again, it's unfortunate a lot of people associate antibiotics with something that's bad and they shouldn't take, but it's actually a very... very valid part of part of medicine.
**CONTEXT:** The host comments on Dr. Peat's advocacy for antibiotics.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, Blake saw things in a very holistic, cosmic way, as well as very biologically, soundly based in the organism.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions William Blake in relation to other authors discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, various translations of that, some of them are easier to understand than others, about the essential meaningfulness of experience and reality.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions Dostoevsky's "Diary of a Strange Fellow."

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that was an antecedent for cybernetics. He was a colleague and student of Pavlov and he devised this cybernetic interpretation of reflexes. Which sees the model of the world that we have in our consciousness as determining how the reflex works. And it's our purpose reflex actually. So it's a very interesting concept but it makes a very simple way of interpreting other fields such as uncellular stress....process, if you see it in terms of PK and Okun's acceptor of action, and how the meaning of a particular stress, and how the body is responding, governs the field all the way down to the cell, and the chemistry of the cell is responsive to the meaning of the stress.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about P.K. Anokhin's work on CO2 and the "acceptor of action."
