**RAY PEAT:** I started getting... interested in aging, I guess, in childhood, but through the 1950s, when I would mention it to people, a few of the very old people, like a biology professor who studied around the turn of the century, had some interesting ideas about the actual cause of aging, and that suggested possibilities for... actually preventing it, but most people in the 1950s weren't at all interested in the idea of curing aging. It just was inconceivable that anything could be done about it. But finally, when I decided to go to graduate school in biology, 1968 to 72 at the University of Oregon, I intended to study brain biology, but it happened that there were some good people working on reproductive aging. So I did my dissertation on female reproductive aging. And that helped to answer some questions that I had been accumulating for 20 years. But it really just opened up a lot of basic biological questions. The whole nature of what an organism is and how it develops through time, growing up from an egg to an adult, the whole process is something that used to be explained as sort of reading out from a pre-established blueprint in the genes. And that led to the idea that there must be genes causing aging and death. And rethinking that whole developmental scheme is necessary. And if you see development as epigenetic or open to interaction with environment, then aging obviously is another epigenetic....environmentally dependent process.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, can you explain your background and how you became interested in aging?

**RAY PEAT:** I think there is a parallel between what the bacteria are doing and what happens to humans exposed to stresses like radiation. But as the... Single celled organisms are essentially different in how they respond to stress because 20 generations of bacteria would be just a few days and so they couldn't possibly be evolving new DNA sequences to make new functional proteins in such a short time. The radiation... It degrades proteins, so it tends to simply knock out functions when it's damaging the DNA. The bacteria that died had their DNA so damaged that they had lost function, and the ones that survived simply didn't lose the function, but their defense processes were activated. And so what they were getting with each generation was an intensification of the defense reactions that ordinary bacteria have and things like bacteria, yeast, and protozoa, when they're under stress they can either decide to reproduce faster, live more intensely, and divide more quickly. If their genes are still working, or they can go in the direction of sort of dehydration for radiation, forming a spore and eliminating a lot of water, makes the DNA very resistant to radiation, because water is part of the hydroxyl radical, is what destroys the DNA, and so without... any water tied to the DNA, it's very resistant. So that's why spores can live for so long then, in the desert, or... Yeah, and so if humans tried to do that, the cells under stress would either multiply very rapidly, and that would be a cancer, or they would go into something worse than hibernation and simply dry up and were like a... suspended mummy-like existence so it just doesn't work for humans the same idea is that we have ways of handling damaged genes or threats to the genes and what people do or animals is to uh kill the whole cell when the... when the organism senses that the DNA has been damaged beyond the capacity to repair it so it's happening very fast, the cells will turn over quickly but to not form a cancer they have to let the damaged ones sort of a triage beyond a certain degree of damage, they have to let the cell die and the quicker it can die, the more material is available for stimulating stem cells to replace it. I think a major factor in aging is that things interfere with that whole process of either repairing or letting the cells die quickly to be replaced. And in old age, the process of cell death is retarded. Interestingly, the cells become old, but they can't decide what to do. And so they slow down. The whole organism metabolically slows down. And in that slowing down process, they have some... undesirable products like lactic acid that cause problems for the whole organism instead of just dying and getting it over with.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding DNA repair and longevity, what are your thoughts on the mechanisms observed in E. coli exposed to radiation, and how do these relate to human aging and cell death?

**RAY PEAT:** Our cells are constantly in the process of oxidizing. And things like sugar, the electrons go to the oxidizing NAD plus and reduce it so that it becomes NADH. And NADH can then pass those electrons on eventually to oxygen. So there's a streaming through NAD plus, NADH to the mitochondria and oxygen. And... That's in the normal metabolism, you should have three to five hundred times as much NAD plus as NADH because it's in a rapidly oxidizing state and stresses that interfere with oxygen or that subtract the... NAD plus and NADH, the lower the supply of the total NAD and NADH is, the more easily a stress causes a failure of the balance, so it shifts more easily to a very reduced NADH dominant state and... so stress depletes NAD, NAD plus. Well, it depletes both of them. One of the things that depletes both of them is damage to the DNA, such as radiation. And in repairing the DNA breaks, there are enzymes that build up a chain of repetitive bases. So it's a meaningless chain, but it plugs up. The hole, basically, in the DNA. And to do that, to repair the chain, the ADT is attached. ADT comes from the supply of NADH. And so when you get a nick in the DNA, you have this huge amount of NAD plus NADH available, and you draw it down. to repair the damage. If you draw it down in repairing too many broken DNAs, then that interferes with the energy production of the cell. And if you have ways to block those enzymes and stop the DNA repair, then the cell can make the decision. The die ends stop wasting energy for organisms and instead it becomes raw materials for the stem cells.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned NAD+ and NADH in cellular energy transfer. How does DNA damage, like from radiation, affect these compounds, and what is the role of DNA repair enzymes in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** There are several drugs that will block that enzyme. Its initials are PARP. P-A-R-P. And so PARP inhibiting enzymes can save cells from dying unnecessarily. If you inhibit that process, you can give the cell a chance to rest, or you can inhibit it and let it go ahead and die.

**CONTEXT:** Are there ways to preempt the destructive apoptotic phase rather than wasting energy trying to repair damage, and what are the enzymes involved?

**RAY PEAT:** Niacinamide happens to be a very safe way to inhibit that enzyme. At the same time, it is the precursor for making NAD+, NADH. So you're plugging the drain and filling up the pool at the same time when you have a good source of niacinamide. And we can normally make that from proteins, from the tryptophan, converting it to niacin. But if we're deficient in protein or have something blocking, like a vitamin deficiency, that blocks the conversion of tryptophan to niacin, then we can't keep the NAD supply. The chronic extreme state was known as pellagra. It occasionally turns up with a rough skin condition when a person reaches a great deficiency, but there are earlier signs such as mood disturbances. There is energy related and many, many variations on symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** How does niacinamide relate to NAD+ production and DNA repair, and what are the signs of deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** The sirtuins are not necessarily positive, are they? They're more for hibernation, or...? Yeah, in calorie restriction, the organism has to do something to survive, and so it starts shutting down, turning off the genes. And the initials stand for silent information regulators. Silent information? Yes, they are, and in... Yeast starvation or stress will turn those on and turn off genes, and in animal cells they do the same thing, but how they got to be so interesting is that a group at Harvard was arguing that longevity in yeast corresponded to......long life in humans, but in single-celled organisms, what they were saying was rapid and continued cell division, the equivalent would be cancer in a human, rather than long life, and from the ability to stimulate rapid and prolonged cell division in yeast, they argued that......resveratrol, which is related chemically, very closely to DES, diethylstilbestrol, a simple synthetic estrogen, resveratrol is a natural stilbene type substance found in grapes, it does have estrogenic activity and... Yeasts are especially sensitive. Yeast produce estradiol just like humans and so yeast is being given basically an overdose of estrogen so it's more fertile. But in humans that so sort of overdose isn't desirable. In the process of turning off genes... When you do it in a human, you are moving towards the spore-like or hibernating state of not producing proteins and two of the very important proteins that get turned off by the sirtuins include clatho, the phosphate regulating protein that when it's turned off, you get very rapid aging. A degeneration of all of the tissues and another protein or enzyme, a p53 protein, is a tumor suppressor protein and so you definitely don't want to just blindly turn off proteins in defense. So you don't want to just shut down and turn your anti-tumor proteins off? Yes, and your anti-aging clathoprotein.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on calorie restriction as a way of activating sirtuins, and are sirtuins always beneficial for longevity?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, several years ago the Harvard Group. Someone in that group said that we shouldn't supplement niacin or niacinamide because it suppresses sirtuins and they said the sirtuins are the long life proteins, niacinamide will accelerate aging but someone simply put human cells in a dish and gave them a supplement of niacinamide and they lived 60% longer so there are various treatments that can do the same thing, vitamin E for example and adjusting amino acid balance and fats and so on but simply the adequate or enriched supply of niacinamide is enough to greatly extend the growth ability of human cells.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the age-related decrease in NAD+ and its effect on energy and gene functions, can mitochondrial dysfunction be reversed or merely protected, and what is the effect of niacinamide on cell longevity?

**RAY PEAT:** Normal functioning kidneys aren't stressed by a high-protein diet, but when something is impairing kidney function such as hypothyroidism or other sickness, then with low kidney function and a lot of bacteria......in your intestine breaking down amino acids, you can get accumulated ammonia and that's where R.L. Veitch, an NIH, I think it was, researcher proposed using ketone, keto acids, equivalent to the essential amino acids which will absorb... The ammonia, even when a person has no functioning kidney ability to secrete ammonia, so just by feeding keto acids, if they're the equivalent of the essential amino acids, you create them in your body by absorbing the ammonia and then making your own protein. And that was where I got the idea that some foods would contain... natural keto acid equivalent and we did chromatography on potato juice and found that they are rich in the keto acids which will function as amino acids even though they contain no ammonia because they can absorb ammonia from your blood. Call it. Thereby, so the kidneys will not be as stressed? That was for use in people who were having essentially no kidney function. Veatch's research showed that these ketones or ketoacids are very helpful for failing kidneys. But ordinarily, there are many other things you......need to do when you have kidney disease. You want to correctly......all of the hormones that are involved in regulating kidney physiology......especially thyroid, progesterone, estrogen, cortisol......and some of the pituitary stress-related hormones.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that any amino acid will contribute to ammonia production, potentially stressing the kidneys. Can you elaborate on this, and what are keto acids and their role in kidney health?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that does help with the bacterial... some on your production.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding kidney health and ammonia reduction, is eating raw carrot daily helpful?

**RAY PEAT:** A certain small amount of fat helps to stimulate the intestine and activate absorption of... the oily vitamins, vitamin K, D, A, and E. And about 30 or 40 years ago, I was looking at the association of various fats with the cancer, spontaneous cancer incidents, and I saw that coconut oil had the lowest of the natural oils, but someone found that... hydrogenated coconut oil containing zero polyunsaturated or essential fatty acids had the lowest incidence of spontaneous cancer of all, essentially like a completely fat-free diet. And so the fact that the even two or three percent of polyunsaturated fats in butter and coconut oil, the fact that that accumulates... Because our muscles, for example, quickly oxidize the saturated fats and preferentially we store the more water soluble polyunsaturated fats. And so over time, even eating a moderate amount of butter and coconut oil, our tissues will become increasingly saturated with the polyunsaturated. And the fat cells, which store little droplets of fat, they, for their own energy, prefer, like the muscles, they prefer to oxidize the safe saturated fats. So our fat tissues with age become more and more concentrated with a relatively pure polyunsaturated store of fat. And under stress, fat is released and especially the polyunsaturated which is more accessible to the stress activation. So with age, stress becomes more harmful because you've stored up more of the polyunsaturated fat. So since we can make all of the saturated fats palmitate improved. Steerate and we can desaturate stearic acid to make oleic acid and our own series of polyunsaturates. I think it's best to get as much sugar and starch in your diet preferably sugars from fruit and milk and minimize the exposure to the unstable. N minus six and N minus three fatty acids.

**CONTEXT:** In terms of longevity, how important is it to keep fats on the low side and focus more on sugars, or is there still a minimum of saturated fat that's important?

**RAY PEAT:** There are several publications showing that high serotonin is probably the major thing in tooth grinding and probably also in restless leg. syndrome where the legs churn during the night. So to lower high serotonin what would be the most straightforward way of lowering serotonin in someone? Reducing intestinal inflammation is the quickest way. Low thyroid is probably a factor in high serotonin, but simply avoiding......slowly digested foods like resistant starches or undercooked vegetables. Salads are very bad for irritating the intestine and producing...

**CONTEXT:** What are the possible causes and short-term solutions for teeth grinding at night?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, basically the same stress syndrome, low thyroid, excess production of lactic acid, and all of the stress mediators, the serotonin and histamine are usually high with prolactin, which shows up generally. Very closely associated with chronic fatigue and prolactin rises generally when your thyroid goes down and serotonin goes up.

**CONTEXT:** What are your insights on dealing with chronic fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction?

**RAY PEAT:** Things that are quickly digested and raw carrot is......contains anti-inflammatory chemicals as well as some antibiotics and they suppress......irritating bacteria as well as binding some of the toxins. So they have an anti-inflammatory effect that can seriously adjust your hormones in a good direction......just having a raw carrot every day.

**CONTEXT:** My wife finds raw carrots hard to digest. What are your thoughts on this, and how effective are they for chronic fatigue?

**RAY PEAT:** The point of eating a carrot is that they can't be digested. And so they release some of the antiseptic chemicals that help to stimulate the intestine and carry out material because they don't break down and produce bacterial growth the way other starchy vegetables do. So you can think of the raw carrot material, grated raw carrot as a kind of bottle brush effectively I think within the lumen of the gut. And if you shred them with a fine food processor so that they're almost like hair that's the most effective kind of fiber because you get a lot of surface to find irritant.

**CONTEXT:** Can you further explain the mechanism by which raw carrots help the gut?

**RAY PEAT:** The highly unsaturated fats are probably what set up that inability to oxidize sugar efficiently and it keeps the pre-fatty acids in circulation. And pre-fatty acids block your metabolism in general, so you can break the cycle in various ways, but probably an active form of thyroid containing T3 is the basic way to get the metabolism going so that you can oxidize glucose and......turn off the free fatty acids. The important thing is to keep track of your metabolic rate. How many calories you need, how much water you're able to evaporate. Low thyroid people find that a lot of the water they... they drink comes back as urine, or you should be able to evaporate a couple of quarts of water a day, that means that if you drink three quarts, you get one quart of urine back per day, and other indicators of metabolic rate are heart rate at rest and temperature cycle. Temperature should rise to around 98.6. Right after breakfast and stay there until close to sunset.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary approaches would you suggest for metabolic syndrome and difficulty losing belly fat?

**RAY PEAT:** A good diet. Includes liver once in a while, milk regularly, and or cheese, eggs regularly, seafood or meat fairly regularly, at least once a week for some kind of seafood is good for the trace minerals that you might not get in. In some of the land foods, given that it's water soluble, do you think, how realistic do you think it is for people actually to be low in B vitamins, B vitamins that may otherwise make a difference? Because I know you've mentioned B1 and B3 as being something that has been intrinsically important in people's memory, their retention of information, and how quickly it can make a difference just by supplementing with it. And if they're supplementing the... I would presume that they were low in it, and so taking a supplement raised their B levels, their 1 and their 3, and corrected their mental state, I think. B vitamins act very quickly, so you can usually see an effect. Sometimes, like with vitamin B1, you can often feel an effect in the first hour. With vitamin B6, you generally feel an effect in the first day. And with vitamin B6, sometimes 10 milligrams is all it needs and one dose will often take care of a problem that has lingered for a long time. And it's good if you can use a few doses of the supplements because most of the supplements have impurities and excipients that aren't good in the long run.

**CONTEXT:** What is a good strategy to ensure adequate levels of B vitamins, and how quickly can supplementation show effects?

**RAY PEAT:** If a person has diabetes or cancer or something and has very high lactic acid production, 300 milligrams in divided doses. It can help to normalize sugar metabolism and lactic acid, but ordinarily 10 or 20 milligrams is plenty.

**CONTEXT:** What dosage of B1 (thiamine) would you recommend for conditions like diabetes or cancer with high lactic acid production?

**RAY PEAT:** B3 for major problems including diabetes, probably arthritis, a lot of degenerative problems. Taking 50 or 100 milligrams several times a day of myosinamide can control the symptoms of reduce inflammation, protect the nerves and accelerate glucose oxidation and so on. And I should mention that for some reason... I think doctors liked nicotinic acid because it had such visible effects of making you turn red. But people generally don't like the feeling of flushing and it isn't good for your health because it releases serotonin, histamine and toxic prostaglandins. So it's actually causing damage when it flushes you. And... In recent years, the market has been flooded with something they call no-flush niacin. But if you look at the label, you'll see that it's inositol hexanicotinate. And that means that each molecule has six nicotinic acids, and it's a little slower to release. That's why it doesn't cause the sudden... intense blushing, but it's the same substance that's releasing those inflammatory toxic substances. So it has to be either niacinamide or the new niacinamide or nicotinamide riboside, which is just a variation on niacinamide, and it's a lot more expensive. If you have an allergic reaction to one, you can try the other.

**CONTEXT:** What are your recommendations for niacin (B3) supplementation, and what are the issues with nicotinic acid and "no-flush" niacin?

**RAY PEAT:** Lowering... Lactic acid. Lowering lactic acid, yeah. Stimulating the oxidation of it and so you produce more carbon dioxide and less lactic acid. That shifts away from inflammation. Lactic acid is keeping the cancer developing by creating inflammation and disturbing the pH balance.

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of taking 200-300 milligrams of B1 (thiamine) in divided doses, particularly for lowering lactic acid?

**RAY PEAT:** No. So, what are some things like hot food, ginger, what are some things? Well, no, not particularly, because it does cause peripheral vasodilation, which might give you a feeling of warmth, but might actually cool you down even, but Dr. Pete, when he mentions temperature impulses as a measure or a good gauge for assessing thyroid function, that you should reach 98.6 during the daytime and preferably after breakfast in the morning and you should stay at that kind of temperature pretty much all through the day until the evening. If you have consistently low body temperatures that do not seem to rise after food, then that would be fairly suggestive of metabolic deficiency, and particularly that you'd benefit from using thyroid hormone. And protein deficiency is a possible cause of low body temperature. We've seen people who couldn't respond to thyroid or other metabolic activators. It turned out they were eating something like 20 grams of protein a day where the requirement is closer to 80.

**CONTEXT:** I've always had a low body temperature, around 97.4°F. Is this normal, and what are some ways to raise it, especially in relation to thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Good foods will safely activate the process of mobilizing heavy metals from the tissues and passing them out through the kidneys. Coffee drinkers are known to have a lower load of most of the heavy metals such as cadmium and lead.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on chelation and heavy metal cleansing, and can a healthy diet naturally address heavy metal accumulation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, one of the advantages of having orange juice built in your diet constantly is that they provide materials that help to inactivate the toxic effect of heavy metals while mobilizing them and washing them out through the kidneys.

**CONTEXT:** How does orange juice specifically help with heavy metal detoxification?

**RAY PEAT:** The effects of it are basically like flu and many other viral or even bacterial infections that activate the inflammatory processes and inactivate our immune defenses. And if you look at the research, the... The first thing that happens is the inhibition of interferon, the antiviral, one of the defenses, and activation of nitric oxide production, which opens up blood vessels, makes them leaky, and lowers energy production. And so, whether it's flu or Ebola, or poisoning by chemicals. The method of defending yourself is pretty much the same to lower anything irritating that you're doing, such as eating foods that are hard to digest, and doing anything you can to lower inflammation and nitric oxide production. Aspirin? Aspirin and coffee, and niacinamide are all. Defenses against nitric oxide, and I think nitric oxide is central to all of those when they get to the point of causing degenerative bleeding processes.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts and suggestions on protecting yourself from viruses like Ebola?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think that will take care of itself if you just keep your energy up. Hold the inflammatory things such as nitric oxide as low as you can.

**CONTEXT:** Is there anything that can be done to raise interferon or prevent its blockage?
