**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1980s, everyone knew nitric oxide primarily as a toxic component of smog. And so when people started discovering that it was being produced in small amounts in the body, immediately they started looking for the parallels with smog poisoning, a lung injury circulatory disease and so on. And one of the first things they found was that it kills the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. And so in the early 1940s there was this flurry of papers demonstrating that our internal smog is just as toxic as Los Angeles smog. But then the Viagra patent and publicity came out in the later 1990s. And right then, suddenly the medical publications all found that it was a glorious, protective, natural protecting just about every function you can think of making you smarter, have more endurance, and all kinds of good things. But then, after a few years because the investment in publicity started wearing off, and people started coming back to the diabetes-producing effects and looking at what it's actually doing biochemically, the basic way it causes harm probably is that it is kind of parallel to the effects of carbon monoxide or cyanide in being a competitor for oxygen in the mitochondria, the enzymes that produce most of our energy. It, in several ways, knocks out not only the key final respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, but it poisons the previous electron-transporting parts of the mitochondrion, too. So, simply turning off the energy supply can account for a lot of its problems. But it also, when you're stopping the oxidative run through the mitochondrion, the mitochondrion starts leaking, in effect, electrons that have no place to go. And the whole cell shifts over to a reduced chemical state. The electrons aren't being constantly drawn down. And so the balance, if you imagine a stream of electrons falling steadily towards oxygen, when you cut off that, they accumulate and float back and literally the reducing environment shifts the whole balance of the self-reduced sulfur compounds and it's expressed all the way out to the surface and the surface properties of the cell change. And there are some enzymes right across the surface so that this reducing energy from inside the cell is available to reduce oxygen outside the cell since mitochondria aren't using it productively. In fact, this cloud of excess electrons flows through the enzyme called NADPH oxidase and directly reduces oxygen on the surface. And that produces super oxide, possibly toxic free radical, which then produces hydrogen peroxide. And in the immune cells that are under stress, that's considered productive because it helps to break down bacteria or whatever is exciting, disturbing the white blood cell. So this toxic oxidative burst has its useful aspects, but probably it's one of the better outcomes rather than just using the hydrogen peroxide directly or producing nitric oxide. There's hundreds of Hydrogen peroxide can be used to oxidize chloride that is always present into hypochlorite which becomes one of the very strong germ-digesting chemicals that when the tigocite has eaten something then it's basically it's like Clorox. It helps break down the particle. Okay, so in general the nitric oxide forms a pretty energy wasteful mechanism and also damaging in its free radical producing effects. Yeah, this shift of the whole cell away from oxidation starts that whole process. People are still just starting to put together the whole picture of how it fits into physiology. It has its effects on the nervous system that people are now seeing that Parkinson's disease for example has the signs that nitric oxide is one of the central damaging components of the dopamine system."

**CONTEXT:** What is your take on nitric oxide, especially considering its association with "poppers" and its potential dangers?

**RAY PEAT:** "The body has its various natural ways of keeping it under control. For example, progesterone inhibits the enzyme that makes nitric oxide, while estrogen excites and activates that enzyme. And so when the cell is stabilized by a generous amount of progesterone and related neuro steroids, the stabilizing things, including pregnenolone, those hold down the production. Anything that irritates the cell and excites it, the endotoxin from the intestine is probably the biggest single constant promoter of the production of nitric oxide, and sometimes serotonin and histamine, which are produced in reaction to endotoxin and other irritating things, these can increase the risk of endotoxin. in various tissues, serotonin and histamine can increase the formation of nitric oxide. In some situations, caffeine and similar drugs that are known to have a variety of protective anti-toxic effects are acting by locally in the a certain type of tissue turning down the nitric oxide production but in recent years the old dye or it was used as a treatment for malaria a hundred years ago called methylene blue it's a common lab chemical used for showing the presence of reducing compound for example vitamin C turns it white Lots of people use it to demonstrate Chemistry in a visible form It's being used for a tremendous variety of therapeutic purposes and simply by turning down nitric oxide which causes so many bad effects. Methylene blue is is having very positive effects in this great variety of things including herpes and other viral chronic viral diseases."

**CONTEXT:** What are the most reasonable ways of blocking nitric oxide synthesis in the body or at least managing its production and providing a buffer to it so that you can maintain the little nitric oxide that is beneficial whilst keeping in check any excess?

**RAY PEAT:** "The excitotoxic thing was one, preventing excess polymerization of the microtubules. Another, the probably increasing progesterone production, inhibiting estrogen production. But probably the most important thing people should do is to start being critical about the tremendous amount of propaganda selling the idea that people should eat more arginine to increase their nitric oxide production."

**CONTEXT:** Do you want to share some of the ways methylene blue stops or blocks the production of nitric oxide?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it one of the known mechanisms is that it can receive electrons from the mediator that receives them from glucose and NADH for example can be oxidized and then the methylene blue can pass those electrons on to the part of the mitochondrion that is still working bypassing damaged parts of the mitochondrion so it can act like the missing enzyme simply restoring mitochondrial function in subtler ways it for example the receptor that causes excitotoxic damage from overdoses of glutamic acid for example anything that is depleting the brain of energy while stimulating it activates these glutamate receptors and there are two sulfur groups in those proteins that respond to excitotoxins that methylene blue oxidizes those and turns off the receptor and stops the excitotoxic process and that's one of the ways the excitotoxic process is one of the things that turns on nitric oxide production going ahead and killing the cell that's why the excited state is toxic largely because of the production of of nitric oxide."

**CONTEXT:** Do you think the effects of methylene blue are there's probably multiple effects but I wonder if any of the electron quenching or electrical stabilizing activity of methylene blue might be responsible for interacting with different proteins and and that kind of that kind of activity?

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it is mainly a thyroid deficiency."

**CONTEXT:** Was there a nutrient or is that a much more complex matter to address regarding the earlobe crease?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the main thing causing hypothyroidism in so many people is an excess of the polyunsaturated fatty acids because they're able to block the production of thyroid, its transport and its action. So they're very capable of antagonizing thyroid function. So to avoid all the nuts and seeds that contain liquid oils in them, so nuts and seeds are principally the kind of polyunsaturated sources, and obviously there are other polyunsaturates yet commonly available in food that you should definitely avoid. So any of the liquid oils, obviously."

**CONTEXT:** What about, like, coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** "Coconut oil is saturated, so that's good. Dr. Pete's always recommending coconut oil and butter as being the two saturated sources of fat that should be the most consumed, and then to avoid all the liquids, liquid polyunsaturates, obviously fish oil being the worst."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete's always recommending coconut oil and butter as being the two saturated sources of fat that should be the most consumed, and then to avoid all the liquids, liquid polyunsaturates, obviously fish oil being the worst. What about, like, cod liver oil?

**RAY PEAT:** "That too, but I think, Dr. Pete, don't you say that the vitamin content in cod liver oil... Oh yeah, if you don't have any better source, cod liver oil is a great source of vitamin D. Yeah. It's better to get sunlight."

**CONTEXT:** Okay. Can I ask one quick other question?

**RAY PEAT:** "Now, I think Dr. Pete's always mentioned that grated carrots to increase the surface area. It's the mechanism that's preferred, and that's basically as a antiseptic, if you like, for the gut, removing excess estrogen and other waste products, and it's undigested, so it has a pretty good action in the gut without physically being changed."

**CONTEXT:** There was something that came up about eating carrots and... I don't know what the term would be, but I want to feel like an astringent, or a cleaning, or a purifying, or helpful aspect of eating carrots. It was recommended that carrots be cut diagonally, and as a juicer and a cook, I guess, of my own food, I thought that was a bit peculiar, and I wondered if that could be elaborated upon.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, not the same, because ultimately, when you grate the product in a grater, it doesn't have the same effect. Then you obviously have a big surface area then, and whatever you chew that up from, then it's going to increase it still. The juice does contain a lot of good things, but if you throw away the fiber, you're losing the most important thing for stimulating and cleaning the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** All right, well, thanks for your help. Thanks for your call. I've got a couple more callers here, so let's take the next caller.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the internet is just swamped with advertisements for ways to supplement Arginine. L-arginine is just the natural amino acid. But if you get more than you need, it will increase your tendency to overproduce nitric oxide. And too much tryptophan happens to boost that, possibly by increasing serotonin. It's very important to keep your amino acids in a good balance, especially avoiding too much cysteine, tryptophan, methionine, and arginine."

**CONTEXT:** First, did you say that L-arginine was bad? I've heard that that was supposed to be good for you, but I'm not sure what it's supposed to do.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I think it's very dangerous."

**CONTEXT:** So you don't recommend taking an L-arginine supplement?

**RAY PEAT:** "It inhibits an enzyme that is supposed to inactivate a substance made by the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide starts a chain reaction, and Viagra keeps that chain reaction going. And in the process, it ends up systemically increasing not only the effect of nitric oxide, but even in some situations the level of nitric oxide. So it probably is increasing the aging process basically in brain, heart, pancreas, everywhere you get an excess of nitric oxide."

**CONTEXT:** Now, did you say that Viagra is a... bad for you because it's made out of this nitric oxide stuff?

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, it's one of the essential amino acids and so if you eat any good high quality protein, even potatoes, milk, cheese, you're going to get all of the arginine you need."

**CONTEXT:** Well, I'm talking about Viagra now.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it would be better to work on the actual physiological problem, improving natural circulation. And, for example, restoring good thyroid function will often increase libido and potency."

**CONTEXT:** I mean, is that like totally bad or is it okay, you know, to have some of it? Because I'm saying if that improves the sexual function, you know, of an older man then sexual function is supposed to be a good thing. I mean, is there a balance there? Do you think it's totally bad?

**RAY PEAT:** "Aging men have decreased amounts of testosterone and progesterone. And increasing amounts of estrogen. And that increased estrogen and the decreased amounts of the protective steroids, I think, will increase the tendency to have erectile problems. And one of the really odd side effects of increased nitric oxide is that it decreases the ability to make testosterone. And at least in women it lowers the progesterone synthesis but those are synthesized very similarly so I think in both men and women nitric oxide is opposing and lowering those protective steroids while increasing estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** Now, Dr. P, I remember now some time ago you also mentioning pregnenolone and or progesterone as being very positive. I mean, in the past it always talked about progesterone potentially being slightly sedative and maybe... Decreasing, I think now you have said this, let me quote you, I think you said decreasing penis size, but it does not block the vasodilatory ability and so therefore actually does promote and enable erection and actually is a reasonably safe way of doing that in males. What about testosterone?

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's one of the central factors in keeping cancer going and so turning it off. You don't necessarily think it's a promoter then? Oh yeah, it is a definite promoter of cancer growth and metastasis. Many publications are now recognizing that breast cancer, prostate cancer and probably every cancer will probably eventually be discovered to respond badly to nitric oxide. The function of anything interfering with respiration, that's where the Warburg hypothesis was that simply shifting away from oxygen as the energy source to being able to produce too much lactic acid even when there's oxygen because the cell has lost its mitochondrial function. Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide are both able to knock out the mitochondrial function and imitate the cancer metabolism and there are several recent publications showing that the the Warburg cancer metabolism is created by nitric oxide excess and it's turned off by methylene blue simply by turning off the production of nitric oxide."

**CONTEXT:** Okay, okay, you're listening to ask your doctor on KMD, Garberville 91.1 FM. From now till the end of the show, 8 o'clock, we're pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us on the show. The number here is 923-3911. If you live outside the area, there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KM-UD-RAD. So Dr. Peat, again, I had a question on my mind during this week, that reading different research on different diseases and apart from that, knowing that some individuals are just inherently... more able to enjoy good health, seemingly against all odds. Have you any understanding of why some individuals, for example, are immune to HIV? Some individuals mount a successful response against hepatitis. Some individuals just have an innate immunity which enables them to overcome. what it is they come into contact with and they don't suffer from it. Do you think there's any connection between anything that you've read that you know about that you might be able to explain that from?

**RAY PEAT:** "There are new ideas about the whole functioning of the immune system that have been coming up in the last 20 years. Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Mattsing are the leading figures in that view of the immune system and I see it as imagining the body as an ecosystem which is simply so strong in some people at maintaining its own organization and stability that when something extraneous like a bacterium or a virus or a cancer cell happens to invade it the situation is so tightly organized in favor of maintaining the host organism that the invader can't find a place it's the niches are all occupied doing business with the the owner of the property no place to camp out like the strong man in the house no one can invade it yeah and I don't see it as as a killing of the invader but simply as using up all of the electron space productively so that keeping the door shut can't do strange things with it like turning sugar into lactic acid."

**CONTEXT:** Okay, I I'd love to be able to get into the subject uh that I saw uh posted last thing today uh and that was uh to quote what I've said before many times and I think it's been repeated through generations that you are what you eat um I think I'd love to get into that subject with you next month I think we have another caller on here anyway but I'd love to get into that subject next month and uh just show that what we hear sometimes really does mean a lot more than we take for granted and that actually a lot of the uh things that are passed down from old generations to now really have their roots in fundamental science and that science now is at last being able to bear that out. So let me just get this other caller on the air and then we'll carry on.

**RAY PEAT:** "I'm very cautious about it. The dimethyl sulfide. I think has its uses, but I'm not sure that there's anything really fully safe with MSM."

**CONTEXT:** First one is MSM and does it have an influence on male or female libido?

**RAY PEAT:** "That happens to be very similar to methylene blue in the way it is essentially non-toxic in moderate amounts. People are now getting... as much as 10 or 12 grams of it per day intravenously and feeling great. But what it does is restore the productive oxidation of glucose, getting the electrons to go all the way from glucose to form carbon dioxide, pretty much what methylene blue is doing in different situations. The DCA is reversing... the cancer metabolism, or the so-called Warburg metabolism, the same way that methylene blue does. So I see it as a very important way of making up for the toxic effects of nitric oxide, endotoxin, free radical, fat oxidation, and so on."

**CONTEXT:** And what about DCA or dichloroacetate for cancers?

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin E and ascorbic acid in the right proportion and the right situation are very safe and constructive. Lipoic, alpha lipoic acid is pretty safe, but I would be very cautious with the acetyl cysteine. I think large amounts of it can push the balance in the wrong direction."

**CONTEXT:** And you've spoken of... Antioxidants that are too strong, could you maybe give a spectrum of antioxidants and say is ALA too strong or what is the strongest antioxidant you would recommend? And THC in that spectrum as well?

**RAY PEAT:** "Sometimes I think the product has changed. European forms of a thyroid supplement seem to be very unpredictable but if it's for sure the same product then usually a magnesium deficiency. Thank you. It can cause exactly those symptoms because the thyroid makes your cells able to use magnesium and so take it up but a big organ like your skeletal muscles and bones can take up so much from your blood that your brain and heart and such have trouble getting the magnesium they need to respond to the thyroid. And then you get an exaggerated stress and adrenaline reaction. And low cholesterol is another limiting factor. If you have very low cholesterol, you can't respond to increasing your thyroid because one of the basic functions of thyroid is to turn cholesterol into progesterone, pregnenolone and DHEA."

**CONTEXT:** She is currently taking zinc gluconate, vitamin D, vitamin K. She's using 4000 IU of vitamin D. She's using progesterone the second half of her menstrual cycle, aspirin, magnesium and calcium. She also eats liver weekly. What do you think might cause that in a person who previously might have used thyroid and then suddenly becomes what they call sensitive to it and unable to use it?

**RAY PEAT:** "About a hundred milligrams at a time, as you take say one or two micrograms of cytomel or senomel, a hundred micrograms will be plenty for the first two or three hours. of responding to one or two micrograms."

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so what kind of dose of magnesium would you think for that kind of person would be suitable?

**RAY PEAT:** "Of fruit juices and coffee, I think. If you want a really intense source, you can boil leaves like kale or beet greens or something just for two or three minutes and the green water that comes out quickly is very concentrated in magnesium and calcium."

**CONTEXT:** Okay, excellent. That's a very pretty safe supplement. Coffee and fruit juices are practical. something you can do every day okay all right but like i said uh perhaps uh perhaps next month if you're available i'd love to look into that new research well actually i think it was bought out in 19 late mid-1960s by that korean and sounded very interesting about the the third circulatory system in the body and actually that you are what you eat because there is a pretty intimate interaction between uh food products uh and our own dna they can be switched on and off and uh regulated that sounded pretty fascinating."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there's a German group that has been doing this for about 15 years now looking at the dna from our foods getting incorporated into our own dna and some biologists have been theorizing about this for the last hundred years Carl Lindegren was someone who reviewed the topic about 50 years ago showing good evidence that organisms all across the spectrum are sharing nucleic acid pollen for example when you ingest pollen that's blowing in the air some of the dna is probably actually getting incorporated into our chromosomes."

**CONTEXT:** And actually that you are what you eat because there is a pretty intimate interaction between uh food products uh and our own dna they can be switched on and off and uh regulated that sounded pretty fascinating.
