**RAY PEAT:** "My dissertation was on the age-related changes in oxidative metabolism in the hamster uterus and how it affects fertility with aging. That involved hormones and nutrition, among other things, and how the environment affects those factors, especially the efficiency of metabolism using oxygen, and since then, I've been writing and doing consultations and trying to figure things out, still working on some of those same themes, oxidative metabolism and aging, the whole idea of metabolic efficiency is one of my current themes."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked to outline his academic and professional background.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Lindvar, that you just mentioned, his idea of the catabolic diet was to choose foods for their metabolic inefficiency, because people eating to satisfy their appetite tend to get fat on the available foods, and he found that he could get people to lose fat very consistently and quickly by choosing certain foods that increased their metabolic rate so that they could burn calories faster than they were eating them. That was in the 1920s when he did that research, and just by chance, a few years later George Burr, who was studying the effect of fats in the diet, found that if he made his rats deficient in the unsaturated fatty acids, they burned calories at a terrific rate, as much as 50% faster than normal. And he thought that was bad. And he became very popular with the agricultural industry because they found that feeding those polyunsaturated fats to pigs and chickens and such, they would gain weight quickly and cheaply without eating very much food. Just the opposite of what Lindbergh wanted to do was to find foods that would decrease the efficiency of the metabolism so that people would produce heat without gaining weight."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about Victor Lindlahr's catabolic diet and its relation to George Burr's findings on polyunsaturated fats.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think there are many reasons for that and the coconut is a very highly saturated fat and it happens that the unsaturated fats interfere with the mitochondrial use of oxygen in several ways, producing free radicals, inflammation and by interfering in a variety of ways with thyroid hormone function. So all along the line of polyunsaturated fats slow down oxidative metabolism and so if your body is soaked in these conventional seed oils than when you eat coconut oil, especially the shorter, very mobile fatty acids that are only a third or half as long as the standard fats. These move into cells very quickly and oxidize without that anti-thyroid effect that the seed oils mostly have."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about coconut oil being thermogenic and Dr. Peat explains why.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in the 50s and 60s, people were experimenting with what kind of diet is efficient for losing fat and still maintaining your health. And they did experiments in which people would just have pure water for 10 days or 14 days and then they would analyze what happened to their bodies and they found that they lost almost pure fat or pure protein during that time very little fat right right okay and if they ate maybe six to eight hundred calories per day during that same 10 to 14 days they would lose mostly fat and very little protein."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the efficiency of diets for fat loss and maintenance of health.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "And that's why so many women are dieting constantly and getting fatter because if they eat an extremely low calorie diet creating stress the high cortisol and other stress hormones cause them to break down their protein and their big muscles shrink so that a typical dieter will, you can hardly see her calf muscles become so atrophied and the big skeletal muscles even at rest burn fat to maintain themselves. Almost a pure fat diet when they're at rest. And so the more dieting they do, if they do it extremely, the smaller their muscles get and the easier it is to get fat the next time they eat a normal diet."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an explanation of why women dieting constantly get fatter.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Because when you're in the first day on a fast, your body uses up the sugar that's stored is glycogen, and as soon as your blood sugar falls because you've used up your stores, then your cortisol rises. First the adrenaline, then the cortisol. And the cortisol, having no food available, it starts converting your thymus gland and the big skeletal muscles, mostly, are too high. The free amino acids, which then can be, some of them, are converted to glucose to feed your blood cells and brain and eyes and so on. Because those have an absolute requirement for glucose. And so even a plain sugar diet to supply that minimal amount to your brain and blood cells. That will greatly prevent the rising cortisol and loss of good tissue."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about muscle mass loss during fasting and Dr. Peat explains the hormonal and metabolic cascade.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "And it's interesting that both Emodin from Cascara or a Chinese rhubarb and such and tetracycline and related minocycline and doxycycline these are anti-inflammatory as well as antiseptic and Emodin and the tetracyclines have surprising range of good effect anti-inflammatory and probably mood improving minocycline is being found to prevent possibly improve dementia Alzheimer's disease and Emodin has every year it seems like there are half a dozen new functions that are found for Emodin including improving the flora of the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the antibiotic properties of cascara and its relation to tetracycline, and Dr. Peat elaborates on the effects of Emodin and tetracyclines.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, lots of plants. Generally they are laxative plants. But it isn't the typical purging kind of laxative if the Cascara isn't properly aged. It does have an irritating purging effect, but aging makes it insoluble in water, comparatively, and it loses the irritating inflammatory property and becomes anti-inflammatory and sedative, and it actually increases the production of energy while having a nerve-combing sedative effect. And this again is that red compound that you've mentioned in the past that has been energetically favourable in terms of its both electron quenching activity and its anti-inflammatory activity."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Emodin is present in Aloe Vera, and Dr. Peat explains the properties of aged cascara and its relation to red compounds.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, as sort of a sideline to my research in graduate school on what causes oxidative metabolism to go down with aging. I would look for all kinds of animals that were colored and do extracts and look for things that stimulated oxidative metabolism. And I got the interest partly from St. George's work. He found that the color of cells is closely connected to the oxidative process. For example, the deep maroon or purple color of the liver and certain areas of the brain are deeply pigmented. He knew that it didn't have any of the usual functions of pigment and he found that it was related to... Well, he knew that semiconductors are generally black because of a peculiar electronic arrangement that causes them to absorb all the light that hits them and he figured that the life process involves semi-conduction and so pigments are especially relevant to the use of energy in living things."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his research into colored compounds and their relation to oxidative metabolism, referencing St. George's work.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think last month we were talking about methylene blue, an artificial electron transporter and it can, like vitamin C, vitamin C in this normal form isn't a pigment but it has some of the same electronic behaviors. Both of those can pick up electrons from nutrients such as glucose and pass them into the mitochondrion even if the first two units of the mitochondrion are damaged. Methylene blue and vitamin C and probably many other natural pigments can deliver energy electrons down to the third complex of the mitochondrion and allow it to keep functioning even after serious damage and so part of that function is to stop producing free radicals which are mostly produced in the upper part of the electron transport chain as it's being damaged."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of pigments in energy transport, and Dr. Peat discusses methylene blue and vitamin C.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "About 1990, I read an article from a fertility clinic in which a lot of the women were trying to conceive and the fertilized ovum just wouldn't implant and the doctors thought that it might indicate that there was an infection in the uterus so they gave all of their patients a course of antibiotics and besides improving their fertility, a lot of the patients said suddenly that their chronic headaches had disappeared and so they gave them hormone tests to see what was going on and causing both fertility to improve and headaches and other symptoms to disappear. They found that the antibiotics had lowered their cortisol and estrogen production and increased progesterone in their serum, explaining the increased fertility, but a whole range of other symptoms related to stress."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the impact of antibiotics on fertility and other health issues, and Dr. Peat shares a study he read.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "And so I suggested that if they eat a carrot every day to stimulate the intestine, the carrot will bind the bile and lower the serum estrogen level, that's now generally accepted that any fiber tends to lower your absorption of estrogen from the bile and within three or four days these people tested their estrogen, cortisol and progesterone and it was doing the same thing that the synthetic antibiotics had done and knowing about carrots and they can get very tiresome if you eat one a day for years, I looked around for other foods that were antiseptic and might have that same effect and bamboo shoots are something that you don't get you too tired of, they don't have much flavor so you can put them in a lot of different foods and cooking bamboo shoots doesn't destroy the fiber the way a cooked carrot does so you have to eat raw carrots or cooked bamboo shoots."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how carrots can mimic the effects of antibiotics by binding bile and lowering estrogen, and suggests bamboo shoots as an alternative.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, because they grow underground decaying environment, they have to have powerful antibiotics. Interesting. Do you not... OK, you surprise me when you say mushrooms, because I wouldn't have thought that would have been naturally one thing that you would have said to someone, would be OK to eat, but you're... I don't know anything about mushrooms, actually, except that principle. They are antiseptic, and they have a high-value protein, and the protein happens to be pretty low in methionine, which is the most toxic of the amino acids in methionine, are the amino acids that most slow your metabolism. So you're getting two of the metabolic stimulants, lowering the estrogen, disinfecting your intestine."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about other fibers with similar effects, and Dr. Peat suggests mushrooms, explaining their antiseptic properties and low methionine content.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well first things first, how much salt were you using? Quite a bit, I just poured on everything and just throughout the day, I don't, I never measure that or anything, quite a bit. More than I normally did. My guess is maybe three or four thousand milligrams. Is that like almost like two days worth in one day? I did that for... couple, three weeks, then I stopped."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat asks a caller about their salt intake in relation to their high blood pressure.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's like 0.03 or something. It's way low. Um, TSH causes a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, and so a T3 will cause your T4 to go down. And if it goes too low, your TSH might come up. And TSH does a lot of things that go with hypothyroidism, including high blood pressure. It makes your red cells more rigid, your blood and serum. It's more viscous and it tightens up small blood vessels. Everything it does tends to create higher blood pressure. So if your TSH is currently extremely low, then you probably should have your other hormones such as adrenaline checked to see. What might be causing that?"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the relationship between TSH, T3, T4, and blood pressure, and advises checking adrenaline levels if TSH is extremely low.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. So, Corla, your question, have you understood the answer? Well, from what I understand is that my THC, if it gets pretty low, the T3 will make it lower. And if you increase, okay, I think I got mixed up, sorry. So something about the TSH, that extra T3 can cause it to start rising up again, or am I incorrect?"

**CONTEXT:** The caller is confused about the interaction between T3 and TSH levels.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, if you had lowered your TSH by taking fairly large amounts of T4, thyroxine... It was 25 micrograms. Oh, well, that isn't very much. No, but it was still low. It got low under 1. It became... 0.03 or 0.04. It was really low. And then several months later, they incorporated T3 at 25, and I cut it in fours and spread it throughout the day. And I was doing really well, and that went on for a month. And then they increased it another 25, which made it 50, and I split those throughout the day in fours. And then, lo and behold, I started having heart palpitations at night and all these other symptoms, and so I titrated down."

**CONTEXT:** The caller clarifies their thyroid medication history and the onset of symptoms.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It's good to have albumin well above 40. Okay. And, um, blood, glucose... Anywhere from 70 to 110 should be okay, and the potassium and sodium should be around the middle of the scale."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat provides optimal ranges for albumin, blood glucose, potassium, and sodium.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it sounds a lot like an alarm reaction, a stress-related alarm reaction of adrenaline producing that kind of blood pressure, because a thyroid... What do you think about thyroid hormone, Dr. P, and blood pressure? I mean, it's actually a regulator of high blood pressure. When people get high blood pressure, generally, they are subject to adrenaline and that other sympathetic, you know, hormones that drive blood pressure up. Thyroid hormones, specifically. Antagonizes that and brings blood pressure down into it. Yeah, especially when it comes on quickly like that. Yeah. It's adrenaline or maybe serotonin."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the role of adrenaline and thyroid hormone in blood pressure regulation, particularly in cases of rapid onset.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The reason I asked about any irritating food, if you don't dissolve the gelatin thoroughly, sometimes that can cause gas and irritation by feeding bacteria in the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains a potential cause of digestive irritation related to gelatin.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Is your pulse rate about where it was? About where it was prior to all this? Is it in the range of 70 to 90? Yeah, it's always been around that, more towards the 70. It hasn't. My pulse has changed."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat inquires about the caller's pulse rate in relation to their symptoms.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Magnesium and calcium are two nutrients that help to lower blood pressure, but potassium is probably the most powerful. Orange juice is a very good source of potassium, so a quart of orange juice spread out through the day is a good amount of potassium."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recommends magnesium, calcium, and potassium for lowering blood pressure, highlighting orange juice as a good source of potassium.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I'm taking extra magnesium since that helps with the palpitations and I drink lots of milk and orange juice. And one other nutrient that can powerfully lower blood pressure is vitamin K. For example, the drops that deliver one milligram of vitamin K per drop. I know a doctor who, for several months, his blood pressure had been 240 over 70. And, within two or three weeks of using a lot of vitamin K, his pressure came down to 140 over 78."

**CONTEXT:** The caller mentions taking magnesium and drinking milk and orange juice, and Dr. Peat introduces vitamin K as another potent blood pressure-lowering nutrient.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's definitely sounds something more than Anything to do with your thyroid that you've been using because it's definitely very very short And very gory quick to come on, you know, it's a very rapid onset So as Dr. Pete was saying it's much more much more indicative of something hormone or getting a catecholamine based that would have a such a rapid onset."

**CONTEXT:** The host comments on the rapid onset of the caller's blood pressure issue, suggesting a hormonal or catecholamine basis.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, well, you know, just so you know, normally you would be able to hear the radio show when you're waiting on the phone and it's not doing that, so I had to listen to that. Unfortunately, there's some hum here in the studio that I can hear and whenever the light's flashing, I also hear that too, so I think there's some kind of, it's not uncommon, unfortunately."

**CONTEXT:** The host explains technical difficulties with the phone system.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, well, you know, one of the things, does listening to the news cause high blood pressure? Quite probably, if it's bad news. Yeah, that was one of the things you didn't ask her. I quit listening to the news and my blood pressure went down. There you go."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that listening to bad news can contribute to high blood pressure.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think that's true. And the starch without fat would immediately, in 15 or 20 minutes, show up in your bloodstream. But with fat, it didn't show up in the bloodstream, and it probably is because it gives it time to break down a little bit. But I think the most important effect of the fat is that germicidal action. Suppressing the bacteria, that if your digestion is really working right, your whole small intestine should be sterile, free of bacteria. And sluggish digestion, low thyroid people often get bacteria growing all the way up close to their stomach. And in that case, when you eat any starch, it feeds the bacteria. The bacteria produce endotoxin, which causes your intestine to produce nitric oxide and serotonin and histamine. And the nitric oxide is a very powerful poison of oxidative metabolism. So the combination of bacteria especially in the small intestine, and any kind of starch that isn't quickly absorbed in your bloodstream is going to feed the bacteria, increase the nitric oxide, and basically poison your respiratory metabolism all through your body."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how saturated fats help prevent starch from entering the bloodstream prematurely and discusses the role of bacteria in the small intestine, starch, endotoxins, and nitric oxide in impairing oxidative metabolism.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Many years ago, people experimenting with germ-free animals, their whole life, they're isolated from bacteria and they have a very healthy life, low mortality until extreme old age. And they eat about 20 or 30% more calories than the ordinary germ-bearing mice, but they are leaner. Much, much smaller fat deposits, and they don't suffer from anxiety. And how to explain that, it means that the bacteria are producing something that poisons your metabolism. George Burr's research with the polyunsaturated fats, he demonstrated that these fats have a similar poisoning effect on your oxidative metabolism. So that without them, the animals burn 30 to 50 percent more energy without getting fat. So the possibly the polyunsaturated fats are contributing to the nitric oxide production, definitely the bacteria eating starch are a major source of this anti-metabolic material."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the negative impact of bacteria and polyunsaturated fats on metabolism, citing research on germ-free animals.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "No, all of the saturated fats are pretty good anti-fungals and anti-bacterials, but I think the shorter chain Athlete's foot remedy that kills fungus very efficiently is an 11 carbon saturated fat or monounsaturated and the shorter they are the faster they diffuse and apparently they're more active as a toxin or antiseptic if they're a little shorter than the stearic acid of butter."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the antimicrobial properties of saturated fats, noting that shorter-chain fatty acids are more potent.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so, but it's really good to make sure you don't get toxic mushrooms."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat comments on a proposed soup recipe, emphasizing the importance of avoiding toxic mushrooms.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, you know, the only thing I grow is shiitakes, which, is that possibly a good mushroom? I'll have to interject here and tell you that the only thing that I'm allergic to is shiitake mushroom. I came out in a widespread body rash and I couldn't explain it the first time around. I thought it was very strange and I contracted something serious. I was seriously worried about it. It took about four weeks for it to resolve and then again about four years later the same thing happened again and I made a connection. I made a connection to shiitake mushrooms and as you know I'm a I'm a naturopathic doctor and I work with extracts and I make extracts of shiitake mushrooms and the third time around when I was handling shiitake mushroom powder the same thing happened. I got a widespread rash over my face and my hands where I'd been not just handling the product but must have breathed some of it in and got it in contact with my face so I find it a very allergenic product so I would just put that out there that not just because people talk about... I've been growing them for a while and eating them but I've been trying not to you know consume too many but I've never seen a direct relationship to any kind of problems that you know. That's the only thing that I've ever been reactive to."

**CONTEXT:** A caller shares a severe allergic reaction to shiitake mushrooms.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, definitely the flow of electrons is the basic thing that structures water. The... When I talk about energy and structure, I'm thinking about the... primarily, first of all, the fine layers of water adjoining proteins and fat in the cells. And that's created and maintained by the flow of electrons mostly from glucose to oxygen through the various catalysts. And when that interrupted when oxygen isn't able to keep pulling the electrons and it's this flow of electrons that generates the structure just like if you stir a pot of spaghetti all the strings line up in certain direction. That sort of thing is what happens microscopically. The energy flow generates structure. And that has all of the consequences of cell differentiation."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how electron flow structures water within cells, relating it to energy and cell differentiation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, a German researcher, a young guy named Andre Sommer, has been doing extremely interesting research....showing exactly that, that the red light itself organizes the structure of water."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat mentions research by Andre Sommer on red light's effect on water structure.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it desorbs nitric oxide from the cytochrome oxidase."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how red light interacts with cytochrome oxidase.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, sometimes low thyroid or something missing in the diet can be a factor, but most often it's low thyroid. For example, if your thyroid is chronically low, your cholesterol is likely to be chronically high. Above average, as a compensation, the thyroid should turn cholesterol into the steroids progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA, and those should regulate the water and the inside, outside of the cell, a balance of the water."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests low thyroid as a common cause of under-eye puffiness and explains the role of thyroid hormones in cholesterol metabolism and water balance.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well it's potentially very pro-inflammatory and it interferes with the handling of electrons. I think that's why it is so dangerously allergenic for so many people and I've I've had the experience of... sulfated wines that gave me a vertigo and extreme symptoms for several days which I think were from causing inflammation of the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains why sulfites in wine are problematic, citing their pro-inflammatory nature and interference with electron handling.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, red wines contain their own histamine, which can cause symptoms in a lot of people."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat mentions that red wines contain histamine, which can cause adverse reactions.
