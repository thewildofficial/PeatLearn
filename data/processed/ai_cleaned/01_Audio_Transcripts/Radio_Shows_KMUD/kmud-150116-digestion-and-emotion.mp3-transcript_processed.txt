**RAY PEAT:** "After working several years in humanities areas I decided to study biology because of wanting to get a concrete grasp of how the brain works in making language images and so on. So I intended to work on a PhD at University of Oregon starting in 1968 in brain biology. And I quickly found that that was the most dogmatic area in biology, genetics and nerve biology. And so immediately I looked around for... less dogmatic areas, and it turned out that the extreme other end of the organism, the reproductive system, happened to be the most scientific, empirical. So I did my dissertation on oxidative changes in the female reproductive system with aging. And that involves a lot of nutrition. related topics that were of interest to me."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his academic background and shift in focus.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in the 70s I just happened to meet some women who were having hormonal problems. In graduate school I had talked to some girls who were having hormonal problems, and I was like, immediately, when they came to the university and got a cheap basement apartment, started having terrible PMS, and that 1967-68, I got interested in the role of light in brain and hormone functions, and how I called it, winter sickness, from a light deficiency. And... Then, when I started running into women with a slightly older group, 40, 45, and 50, having really serious problems like multiple sclerosis and several other nerve-related conditions, I recognized. The work I had been doing with hamsters and hormones as being directly applicable to them so I started doing nutritional consulting and finally started suggesting that they use progesterone and thyroid supplements because in some cases the diet just wasn't enough to take care of acute problems."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses his early practical experience with hormonal issues and the development of his interest in nutrition and supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's good to uh uh consider at least one other uh digestive peptide the uh gastric inhibitory polypeptide gip okay it's uh my my general picture of the organism for example uh analogous to the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system right the day and the night sides of the nervous system everywhere you look you can see this sort of a polar opposition in two kinds of function one is mobilizing the other is demobilizing and relaxing okay that's the parasympathetic is a relaxing and the mobilizing is a sympathetic and when when the organism is young and healthy that opposition works very nicely for night and day action and rest cycling and in the digestive system when you eat fats and proteins you act you secrete the cholecystokinin when you eat sugar you secrete the GIP which is also called the insulinotropic hormone because it calms down stops your acid digestion You don't need acid to handle sugar but it activates the insulin so that you handle the sugar and when you look at the effect in the brain, CCK activates the corticotropic release hormone which turns on anxiety and stress and the pituitary ACTH which turns on the adrenals to handle stress. The gastrointestinal gastric inhibitory peptide responding to glucose has pretty much the opposite effects and in the hippocampus for example which is a part of the brain that's expanded. By opportunity and learning and shrunken by stress, the insulinotropic hormone responding to sugar also has receptors in the hippocampus that stimulates the birth of new cells. So learning and stimulating the experience and eating sugar have the same effect. Yes, the same effect in your brain. Eating fat and protein surprisingly turn on anxiety and stress. Ah, even protein, huh? Well, that tends to lower your blood sugar because it also stimulates insulin and lowering the blood sugar turns on stress."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the opposing roles of CCK and GIP in digestion and their impact on brain function, stress, and learning.

**RAY PEAT:** "And in the, farther down the intestine. The, if you could be born without bacteria, they've created situations with cesarean birth of rats and dogs and pigs and such and keeping them in a germ free environment. They find that the, everything develops perfectly. In fact. The animals live longer, and are very resistant to obesity, and diabetes, and degenerative diseases. Okay. They have a very high metabolic rate too, don't they? Yeah, they're very much like the calorie-restricted animals, and fat-free diets. Where they don't have the so-called essential fatty acids, those animals have an extremely high metabolic rate, too. And so, the calorie restriction and being free of germs both stimulate your ability to oxidize food, produce energy, and prevent obesity, and be generally healthy and long-lived. So something is happening in the intestine that the bacteria are responsible for. The main thing that it turns out that the bacteria are doing is usually converting starch. Starch is the main bacteria promoting food. Living on on these foods that we don't digest produce endotoxin and the endotoxin everywhere it reaches a human cell stimulates the production of nitric oxide and nitric oxide is it's um on the demobilizing side of the balance it turns off metabolism slows down oxidation okay so it's it's the main reason that having too many bacteria in the intestine creates obesity and lethargy and short life is it all forms of starch that will promote the endotoxin production or no if they're very well cooked right and easy to digest and aren't complexed with fibrous material The difference would be a corn tortilla that had been processed in alkali to open up the starch granules making them easy to digest versus the bean carbohydrates, the type of polysaccharide that human enzymes can't work on hence all the gas yeah it's not good for you folks when they've experimented with rats on this type of valuable indigestible fiber the ones that get the the fiber that supports bacterial growth become anxious and aggressive they're fearful and so they fight too easily all right so there's that there's a definite connection there"
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the role of gut bacteria, endotoxin, and nitric oxide in metabolism, obesity, and disease, highlighting the benefits of germ-free environments and well-cooked starches.

**RAY PEAT:** "Nitric oxide is produced in the body and supposedly has beneficial functions. So what do you think about the beneficial function of nitric oxide in the body and how is that mediated to a point where it's not dangerous as it is if you're looking at being exposed to it or taking arginine to produce it in your body more than your body does? What's its real benefit? It helps cells to de-differentiate by blocking their energy production. If you think of the mitochondrial high-energy oxidative system as being what creates a complex organism that uses energy so efficiently it can have many different types of tissue. If you want to de-differentiate, produce a stem cell. You knock out the energy production and it goes back and becomes amoeba-like or fungus-like. So this is like a stem cell recruitment? Yeah, and when a tissue is injured it secretes a great burst of nitric oxide and that calls up stem cells from the environment, but it also creates them. It de-differentiates. Existence. Tissues, so that they can form whatever new tissue is needed. So de-differentiation is a part of forming the organism in the first place as the embryo develops. Nitric oxide has a constructive role. And then for tissue, wound healing, it's essential. But that very same burst that calls up. Repair cells and de-differentiate cells to make repair cells. If that doesn't have the ability to be turned off, it keeps de-differentiating and stimulating tissue renewal so you get an unhealing wound. The least bad example of that would be a keloid. A scar tissue that just keeps growing and getting bigger. forming the right kind of tissue but in the worst case then it becomes a tumor and a cancer."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the dual role of nitric oxide in cellular de-differentiation for repair and its potential to cause uncontrolled growth and cancer when not regulated.

**RAY PEAT:** "Everything that we have that is involved in producing oxidative energy helps to turn it off so vitamin b1 and niacinamide the anti-inflammatory things like progesterone and a pregnant alone thyroid hormone all of the differentiating mobilizing energy intensifying substances turn it off and everything that interferes with those turns it on and keeps it going thank you so it's the demobilizing for example going into hibernation an animal produces these demobilizing signals with nitric oxide and anything that makes the organism tend to give up and stop struggling demobilizing because of stress or isolation inescapable stress right powerfully turns on nitric oxide and it so in in the brain function when your brain is being turned off it experiences depression once to retreat okay and the things like anxiety and and aggression you aggress if someone doesn't let you retreat"
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies substances that can turn off nitric oxide production, including B1, niacinamide, progesterone, pregnenolone, and thyroid hormone, and links nitric oxide to stress, depression, anxiety, and aggression.

**RAY PEAT:** "The endotoxin from bacteria is a powerful promoter of aromatase and estrogen production. And so taking an antibiotic or eating a kind of fiber that doesn't support bacterial growth or avoiding starches and eating saturated fats, which have a germicidal effect, saturated fatty acids are very much like antiseptics as far as the intestinal bacteria go. So just by making those dietary changes you can make a tremendous impact on your balance between estrogen and cortisol versus the protective progesterone and androgens and so on."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how dietary changes, including avoiding starches and consuming saturated fats, can reduce endotoxin and influence hormone balance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of the shorter chain saturated fats in coconut oil. Have an anti-histamine effect. Coffee is a very effective signal to turn off histamine production. Anything that energizes and restores cell function tends to prevent the production of histamine. Oh, definitely. Yeah, yeah. A person wrote a book about histamine. About 40 years ago, he demonstrated that histamine is produced in every kind of cell in the organism when it's sufficiently stressed. And that was before nitric oxide was known, but histamine turns on nitric oxide. So those are the two probably universal stress injury signals."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the anti-histamine effects of short-chain saturated fats in coconut oil and coffee's role in reducing histamine, linking histamine and nitric oxide as universal stress signals.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the interactions of the intestinal bacteria are too complicated to......divide them neatly into beneficial and harmful. In the germ-free animals, they've done experiments with introducing a single species of lactobacillus, and even the supposedly beneficial bacteria will make the germ-free animal susceptible to injury that it wasn't susceptible to before. So it's the context and interaction of the different bacteria. And generally, the healthier a person is, the more sterile their small intestine is."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat expresses skepticism about categorizing gut bacteria as strictly beneficial or harmful, emphasizing the complexity of their interactions and the inverse relationship between intestinal sterility and health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think there's a little effect there, but I don't think it makes a big nutritional difference. The totally germ-free animals have the extremely efficient digestive systems."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat downplays the significance of bacteria in nutrient absorption, citing the efficiency of germ-free animals' digestive systems.

**RAY PEAT:** "Water absorbs infrared very powerfully. And so real infrared feels warm and it helps to keep your body temperature up. And keeping your body temperature up is very good, essential for the mitochondria. And the stress of cold is enough to turn on nitric oxide. And that can start down the pathway of hibernation and turning off functions. Infrared, as it keeps your body temperature up, helps your mitochondria. The far red visible light, dark red, anywhere from orange to dark red, these aren't very well absorbed by water, and so they go right through your tissue. You can see a red light shining through your whole body if you're in the dark. You can see it through your hand. Put a light behind your hand. That's because it penetrates and is only absorbed by blue copper, is the main thing that absorbs it. Enzymes that contain copper in a blue form that does absorb red. And those happen to be the respiratory enzymes. So the fart red activates the respiratory enzymes and probably a major reason for that is that it bounces the nitric oxide molecule, loosens it and frees it from the respiratory enzymes where it has been blocking it."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how infrared light, by maintaining body temperature, supports mitochondrial function and how far-red light activates respiratory enzymes by dislodging nitric oxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, all seeds, as far as I know, have some toxic effects. Many of them are built in by the plant to protect their offspring, and once the sprouting has begun......the seed detoxifies those intrinsic chemicals, especially if it's very well cooked, then it becomes nutritious."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat states that seeds have inherent toxins that are reduced through sprouting and cooking.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh yes, the men who are in good health have a fair amount of progesterone. It's rarely measured in men but... It prevents abnormal excess clotting and it's a precursor for other hormones but if you have a good amount of progesterone it protects you against fluctuations in the adrenal steroids aldosterone and cortisol so that... progesterone is sort of an all-purpose defensive hormone and it's a very highly concentrated in the brain men as well as women so it's definitely not just a female hormone but if you have too much of it if you take a supplement it opposes testosterone and so and doesn't want to take it regularly and stop his whiskers growing for example but for an emergency a big supplement can be helpful for for example epilepsy or arthritis it's very helpful for men as well as women"
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the benefits of progesterone for men, including its role in preventing clotting, hormone precursor function, and protection against adrenal steroid fluctuations, while noting potential opposition to testosterone with excessive intake.

**RAY PEAT:** "I discovered that by drinking a cup of kefir. Every day I would have a cup of that for lunch. I would get a migraine for several hours afterwards. And so I started reading about what's happening. And for one thing, the type of lactic acid produced by bacteria is racemic. And the kind we make is mostly the one confirmation that......works differently. And the racemic type made by bacteria is more able to produce inflammation and fibrosis if you're chronically overloaded with it."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares his personal experience with kefir-induced migraines and explains how racemic lactic acid produced by bacteria can cause inflammation and fibrosis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that seems to be the implication that it isn't the lactic acid or the metabolism of the lactic acid bacteria that is anti-inflammatory, but just something about the chemistry of the......organism, even if it's dead, and since the inflammation in the intestine is quickly reflected in the physiology of the skin, soothing your intestine will take care of a lot of skin conditions."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect of bacteria, even when dead, may be due to their chemistry rather than their metabolism, and that soothing the gut can improve skin conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The liver to the extent that it's injured will ruin the whole organism. It's the chemist for the whole organism. If you're starving and not getting enough protein especially or not enough B vitamins, your liver loses the ability to detoxify and you get gross hormone imbalances and that can lead to......to progressive inflammation, fibrosis, and as these processes get more serious, the liver becomes a larger source of nitric oxide. And at the point that it's becoming inflamed and cirrhotic, then it starts secreting nitric oxide to the whole system. The lungs, with an acute injury to the liver, the lungs will become acutely inflamed. When they transplant a liver, they've measured the sick person's nitric oxide very high. When they put in a new liver, suddenly the nitric oxide is low and the lungs suddenly begin working more efficiently. The demonstrating that the liver is poisoning the lungs so that the oxygen doesn't get through efficiently. And with the brain the same thing is happening. Edema is produced in the brain by the endotoxin nitric oxide combination and the ammonia produced by the liver which is being injured was the traditional explanation for why the brain has problems in proportion to the liver. Okay. But now it's known that the ammonia is activating the nerves that are excited by the glutamic acid, MSG excitatory amino acids, and those... excitatory amino acids act largely through nitric oxide, and so depression, anxiety, and I assume aggression is a part of this mixture of gradual poisoning to different degrees."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how liver injury leads to systemic inflammation, increased nitric oxide production, and impaired organ function, particularly in the lungs and brain, linking these issues to ammonia, excitatory amino acids, and nitric oxide.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know what labs have available. It's becoming very common in research to look at the whole range of things produced by nitric oxide, but I don't know of any local medical labs that do that."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat states that while nitric oxide markers are common in research, they are not widely available in local medical labs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah gelatin is at least safe. It doesn't stimulate muscle growth the way other proteins such as meat can do but the person's history really has to be taken into account when you're looking at the diet and the exercise program because I've known people who ate gigantic amounts of meat and were producing so much cortisol in response to the meat that they had extremely high levels of amino acids in their urine and their muscles were being damaged by that same high level of cortisol and so ideally like the germ-free animals they can run on On a very little protein and lots of carbohydrate. The carbohydrate gets used for energy and you would assimilate essentially all of the protein that you eat because your cortisol wouldn't be destroying it and excreting it."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests gelatin as a safe protein source, noting that excessive meat intake can lead to high cortisol and muscle damage, and advocates for a diet with ample carbohydrate for energy, allowing for better protein assimilation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Fruits. All right so that's it pretty much then you're saying that the fruit would be a very good source of amino acids as muscle building compounds. Yeah as long as you're getting all of the essential nutrients for example from some seafoods and eggs and fruits and gelatin would be a very safe diet for adults."
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat identifies fruits as a good source of amino acids for muscle building, recommending a diet of seafood, eggs, fruits, and gelatin for adults.
