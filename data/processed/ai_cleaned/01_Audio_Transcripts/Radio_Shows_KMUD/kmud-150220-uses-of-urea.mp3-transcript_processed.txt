**RAY PEAT:** "I don't really have a professional background I guess but academically I studied various things for an MA in Humanities and then 1968 to 72. I've got a PhD in Biology specializing in reproductive physiology and the biochemistry related to it but I've been talking to lots of people about biological ideas for about 50 years and so my education comes in a lot of non-academic ways."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked to discuss his professional and academic background.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think sometimes the truth of trials and research that's done isn't always brought out to the public, certainly not in a timely manner, maybe 20 or 30 years later we begin to see the revelations from that initial research and it comes to the attention of people a bit like the U-turn if you like on the polyunsaturated oils that now are recognized as being negative for a person's health rather than the financially viable, positive health benefits."

**CONTEXT:** The host introduces the topic of research interpretation and mentions the shift in understanding regarding polyunsaturated oils.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "What are your interpretations of the mechanism by which urea... is affecting this anti-cancer activity and then we'll get into some of the outright experiments that were done. I think one of the essential things is that it inhibits nitric oxide formation and nitric oxide formation is probably the main means by which stress of any kind can turn off oxidative energy production. And so anything that will turn off nitric oxide excess will restore energy production and restoring energy production has all kinds of structural ramifications. The constant consumption of oxygen is maintaining and renewing the microscopic structure of a cell. The membrane people about 50 years ago were arguing that the membrane is semi-permeable and it has to have pumps and cell energy has to run those pumps. But in fact there are no demonstrated pumps and the pumps that they postulated would take many times more energy than a cell could ever produce. The cell is doing something with its energy very different from maintaining the osmotic balance. It's maintaining the structure in an atomically fine sense, a structure right down to the electronic relations of atoms to each other. And it's this kind of balance that urea participates in directly. As well as helping to prevent the loss of the oxidative production of energy so that the energy produces this structure which has all of the properties of life. And urea fits into that in a unique way so that the normal amount in the blood is just a few milligrams per hundred. But you can increase that to a thousand milligrams to almost one percent of the blood without disturbing things physiologically. And Danopoulos found that when he got the blood level up to at least 85 milligrams per cent, more than ten times the... the normal amount, the cancers would start disappearing. And so it's a matter of concentration. Even before that concentration, it will have shut down the production and action of nitric oxide. But then it has these structure-stabilizing effects. It fits right into the way water is structured. And it increases the ability of the cell's natural hormones to structure the water and protein system the way the cell wants to structure it. So it's like urea is supporting what the cell wants to do even when it's at these extremely high concentrations."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mechanism of urea's anti-cancer activity, referencing Dr. Danopoulos' work.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "So it's a little bit similar to the electronic. A state structuring water, when we talk about structured water, do you think... Yeah, it's exactly what the oxidative system is doing to the electrons. It's preventing an excess of electrons and toxins and carcinogens and radiation are doing exactly the opposite. They're putting too many loose electrons into the wrong places."

**CONTEXT:** The host draws a parallel between urea's effect and structured water, prompting a clarification from Dr. Peat.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Right. So and this and this by your description of too many loose electrons we can imagine those as being the what they call the damaging free radicals and things like even more extensive than that it's the chemical system of the proteins contains a lot of sulfhydryl compounds glutathione that a lot of doctors are are using intravenously as a anti-stress thing. This is a sulfur compound maintained by energy-rich fuel molecules but it maintains a certain degree of oxidation in balance with sulfhydryl groups attached to the proteins and the proteins are in they're like a reservoir of electrons. At the right energy level and the oxygen metabolism besides providing ATP and other forms of energy is preventing an overflow of loose electrons getting into the structure of the proteins and too many electrons will de-differentiate the cell, move it towards non-oxidated energy production. And the formation of lactic acid which can start vicious circles."

**CONTEXT:** The host elaborates on the concept of "loose electrons" and free radicals, leading Dr. Peat to discuss protein chemistry and electron balance.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I know he worked a lot with people that had liver primaries and or secondaries, but the ocular cancers, the cancers of the eye, the melanomas and the basal cell carcinomas, that was pretty interesting the way urea again was used in the treatment of those ocular cancers. His articles on that have photographs that show very vividly. The correction, the elimination of the cancer and restoration of normal tissue and one of the interesting things about urea is that at these very high concentrations it is so stabilizing to normal tissue that it prevents the formation of deforming scars. In a 1935 publication... Someone was describing its use in treating wounds of all kinds, packing crystals right into the wound or the ulcer or whatever was an open damage to the organism, putting the solid urea into it and leaving it would clear up the infection. Stimulate healing, but it would heal without visible scarring. And I read that it promoted a fairly rapid granulation tissue in the wounds and that was part of its mechanism by which it achieved such good wound healing."

**CONTEXT:** The host brings up Dr. Danopoulos' work on ocular cancers and the scar-preventing properties of urea.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I was seeing a story about an African spiny mouse that can regenerate its tissue very quickly. They mentioned that punching a hole in the skin it could close the wound by almost two-thirds in the first day. In three or four days the wound would be healed without a scar. Now this I think from an energy perspective is quite interesting it's a bit of a sidetrack from the subject but young children and young adults they heal rapidly compared to older older people and that's got to be down to an electronic energy state within the organism correct oh yeah the oxidative metabolism slows down from early in embryonic development down to old age there's a steady decrease of oxidative metabolism hmm it's the it's the downfall of all of us who are gradually gradually aging"

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions the regenerative abilities of the African spiny mouse and connects rapid healing in young individuals to their energetic state.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Okay so in order to very quickly again in order to stave off that kind of electronic degradation and the inability to oxidatively repair what what do you think are some of the best tactics that people can use to maintain the ability to stave off that damage um in the uterus the um the developing embryo also heals without scarring and the I think two factors are involved in that the high carbon dioxide level and the higher urea and related compounds in the amniotic fluid these in the adult also just pure carbon dioxide gas can be blown into an ulcer and stimulate healing. Control other other symptoms reduce pain and so on but I think as soon as an organism is born it starts interacting with the outside environment where in the uterus it was getting its energy filtered through the placenta and making its own fats out of the glucose and fructose that were provided to it. And the organism using carbohydrate for energy produces saturated fats or omega minus nine unsaturated fats. And when we come into the world we're exposed to the fats produced by organisms living at a lower temperature generally. And the colder a plant......is exposed to, the more unsaturated its fats are. And they're of a different type than we would make ourselves. And those interrupt our oxidative metabolism to the extent that we become saturated with them. That happens progressively from the time we're born, in the old age generally."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for tactics to prevent age-related degradation and asks about the role of CO2 and urea in healing, leading Dr. Peat to discuss fetal healing and the impact of external fats.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The medical journals depend on the pharmaceutical industry largely and urea that sells for... A couple of dollars a pound isn't a very good drug, especially a drug that cures isn't a good drug even if it's expensive. A cheap drug that cures just won't work in the medical system."

**CONTEXT:** The host expresses surprise at the lack of mainstream adoption of urea therapy, prompting Dr. Peat to explain the economic disincentive for pharmaceutical companies.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I wanted to bring these out just for those people that are listening. I think we all have free choice. And to find... Information out for ourself is always a good idea rather than just listening to whatever it is that we're being told by whoever it is that's telling us. It's always very good, I think, especially in the age of the Internet where... I know there's lots of bad information on the Internet, it's not to say it's all good, but there's lots of places where you can go and you can read scientific medical information that you know is... been researched and you know it's been pretty well scrutinized and when it's telling you that this kind of thing is being used to Treat a cancer. It's very hard to To ignore it. So I think just for those people that are listening perhaps they Might want to look at dr Dan opulence's work in the late 70s in the early 80s and his approach to the treatment of liver disease with urea as well as cancers of the eye"

**CONTEXT:** The host encourages listeners to research information independently, referencing Dr. Danopoulos' work.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "So I think just for those people that are listening perhaps they Might want to look at dr Dan opulence's work in the late 70s in the early 80s and his approach to the treatment of liver disease with urea as well as cancers of the eye And then I think the other thing wanted to get into was just some of the amounts of the product and as you've already mentioned urea is extremely non-toxic it's kind of odorless and tasteless and and that doesn't really have any anything negative going going for it it's very well tolerated so I know some of the instances where he's quoting case histories here we're using something like 15 I don't know one of the quotes was 15 grams of urea. in a quart of water and this was to be drunk daily so this was just a total amount of urea to be consumed every hour or so you know in the waking hour from i know from nine or ten o'clock uh through till six or seven in the afternoon so so 15 grams of urea and then there were injections that were done with a 15 uh up to 50 between 15 and 50 percent i think the average was kind of a 20 25 percent urea solution uh for skin tumors and that was found to be highly effective and then i know he mentions and this is a little bit different i think here in the states we use blood urea nitrogen but he was quoting blood urea as a level and quoting 75 to 85 milligrams percent um so what do you know roughly what that would what that would equate to 75 to 85 milligrams percent that would be i think it requires uh taking more than quite a bit more than 15 grams per day some of the studies were using up to 120 grams per day divided up in doses of about 15 grams at a time interesting and uh in the 1950s it was probably the main treatment used for brain swelling reducing brain edema because it's A lot of people were thinking of it as an osmotic treatment and it was displaced by various osmotic substances with the idea that you would make the blood hyperosmotic to draw the excess water out of the brain into the blood but urea isn't osmotically active. Because it goes right into the cells and to be osmotically active it has to be like sodium that stays outside the cell or like sucrose or some of the sugars that can't be absorbed. But urea goes into the cell, sort of soothes the cell's excitation, changes its electronic balance and lets the cell excrete, give up the water. But it doesn't need very much the way progesterone and thyroid work, adjusting the electronic state so that the IM exchange system and the electronic affinity for water is downgraded so that it doesn't bind so much water. That's the end. Anti-edema effect is still here and there used for treating congestive heart failure. Okay. I was looking up the Mexican pharmacopoeia and I see that they still list urea to treat the edema of heart failure because it's a diuretic that makes the kidneys work better. Interesting. It also causes the... the muscles and other organs to not retain water so greedily. OK, so you said again, just to quote you again, up to 120 grams a day you're saying? Yeah, for getting rid of excess water, that was the amount they used. OK, and then he also mentioned in conjunction with urea therapy a compound called creatine hydrate. And saying that the two of these compounds together was even more effective at treating these cancers than the urea alone. Do you know much about creatine hydrate? No, I think it's probably having some of the physical effects similar to urea, but it also enters into the energy storage and management system."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the dosages used in urea therapy and mentions creatine hydrate.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The Chinese used it, for example, and one of their... interpretations was that it was the steroids. They concentrated things like the metabolites of progesterone and pregnenolone from the urine and used these to extend the lives of the kings and rich people."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about indigenous use of urine for medicinal purposes, and Dr. Peat shares a Chinese practice involving urine metabolites.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's my orientation on the issue of origins. High altitude, warm climate, lots of fruit, and all foods would be more saturated in a more equatorial environment."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks if humanity evolved in equatorial, high-altitude, warm climates with a diet rich in saturated fats.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I ran across publications in some of the fairly well-known food journals 40, 50 years ago showing that the fats vary with......the climate and that the fats have a definite function. Some of them are functioning to protect the plants against animal predators by poisoning them. So they put lots of the unsaturated fats in their seeds. That was recognized 40 years ago that the seed oils are biological."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if scientists are aware of the climate's influence on fat composition, leading Dr. Peat to discuss early research on plant fats.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and previously, when it was summer in the high latitudes, people were outside farming, herding the sheep or whatever, getting lots of sunlight exposure. And in the last hundred years... People have sort of moved indoors and gotten sicker, I think largely from deficiency of sunlight."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the importance of sunlight exposure, and Dr. Peat elaborates on the shift towards indoor living and its consequences.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The um... majority of the oils that we store are unsaturated ourselves prefer to oxidize saturated fats and so even when we eat a mixed fat diet our tissues with aging tend to load up on the unsaturated and the N-3 fats of the double bonds are farther from the acidic end which is what is uh. handled biologically and the acid end protects against oxidation so the N-3 fats are more unstable in the presence of oxygen and so we don't store so much of those so with aging our bloodstream every time we're slightly stressed our bloodstream gets a fairly high concentration of N-3 fats....6 fatty acids which produce the toxic prostaglandins that produce brain cell damage and inflammation and so on. And so if you take a meal of fish or eat some fish oil, these oxidize very quickly and form compounds that will interfere with the formation of prostaglandins. But in doing that, they're also suppressing the immune system, but you get temporary relief to the extent that you're overloaded with the most toxic N-6 fatty acids. So people experience some relief of inflammation when they take fish oil, but in the long run, that's... doing its own damage, because it's so highly oxidizable. In some experiments, the N-3 fats increased the metastatic spread of cancer cells."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the negative effects of fish oil, and Dr. Peat explains the issues with polyunsaturated fats, particularly N-3 and N-6 fatty acids, and their impact on prostaglandins, the immune system, and cancer.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I know that Dr. Peet definitely espouses the saturated fats as very protective, both stabilizing cell membranes and being cardiovascularly protective, which is not what you'll hear. If you read the newspapers or magazine articles, but in terms of anti-inflammatory effects, the saturated fats are definitely better and for brain function, for stabilizing the membranes in brains, the saturated fats are certainly going to be the protective compounds. So coconut oil, palm oil, butter, animal fat, and I've got to say a caveat to add to the statement animal fat, you need to make sure the animal is certified organic, otherwise most of all the residues of whatever pesticides or hormones or antibiotics they're treated with will wind up in their fat so you don't want to eat the fat of a non-organic animal. And it depends on what fat the animals were being fed. Chickens are highly polyunsaturated. Pork for the last 50 years has been very full of polyunsaturated fats even though lots of science papers are treating lard. As a saturated fat with a 35% or so of PUFA in it is definitely a risky fat."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for alternatives to fish oil for brain function and regeneration, and Dr. Peat recommends saturated fats, emphasizing the importance of organic sourcing and the polyunsaturated content of certain animal fats.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know of any particular... treatments or programs for those with urea but the diet that favors the formation of urea rather than its antithesis nitric oxide. It happens that the amino acid arginine can either form nitric oxide or urea and irritants of... Anything toxic tends to shift it away from forming urea and going to nitric oxide. Avoiding the polyunsaturated fats helps you maintain the proper amount of urea formation."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about urea's benefits for breast health and fibroids.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh definitely. Low thyroid causes the ratio of estrogen to progesterone and androgens to be very high and both endometriosis, uterine fibroids and also a breast fibrocystic disease. All of these go with high estrogen. Low progesterone and low thyroid function."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if estrogen is a contributing factor to fibroids, and Dr. Peat confirms this, linking it to low thyroid function.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Blood sugar is always a problem at night. The effect of daylight is to maintain efficient oxidative metabolism. And just 15 minutes of darkness is enough to lower the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration. And so keeping very bright lights right up until bedtime will......minimize the fall of blood sugar but having a carbohydrate meal late in the afternoon or before bed, a glass of orange juice or milk with honey, sometimes just the dose of sugar is enough to put you to sleep for an hour and a half or two hours, and it takes time for the liver......to start storing glycogen, so it's good to have another glass ready for when you wake up, have another dose of orange juice or milk and sugar, and salty things, salty snacks at bedtime help to stabilize the blood sugar and energy production, so like milk and maybe salty tortilla chips or puffed pork rinds, something......a salty snack as well as a..."

**CONTEXT:** A caller describes severe insomnia and anxiety, and Dr. Peat explains the role of light, blood sugar, and carbohydrate intake in sleep regulation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "But vitamin K is a very important nutrient for regulating blood sugar, blood calcium, and blood pressure. I've known people who in a week or two lowered their blood pressure by 100 points, 240 to 140 systolic pressure. Really? From taking vitamin K? Yeah, so you have to, if you're already at normal blood pressure, you have to be cautious and watch what's happening if you supplement large amounts of vitamin K. How much would I take in milligrams? 5 or 10 milligrams is a pretty safe dose. How about vitamin D? Yeah, that's essential. If you aren't getting regular sunlight or using a D supplement, you probably should have a blood test because low blood vitamin D is out and around. 20 on the scale should be around 50 points between 30 and 100 is the normal range. Okay I'm sorry to interrupt so just get a complete blood panel like? Well you have to ask for a specific vitamin D3 test. Oh vitamin D3 test okay. And it's not you don't want the activated vitamin D. It's the 25-hydroxycholecalciferol that you want to measure. And that's very important. Both vitamin K and vitamin D prevent the excitatory excess. And so it's essential to have your calcium regulated."

**CONTEXT:** The caller mentions having high blood pressure, and Dr. Peat discusses the importance of Vitamin K and Vitamin D for regulating blood sugar, calcium, and blood pressure.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the cancer industry probably has one of the worst track records going for cures. Well, it seems like, I mean, I have a friend that got over cancer with radiation and chemotherapy, and she beat it, and she had a couple of large tumors, so these things do work, maybe not always 100%, but more than they used to."

**CONTEXT:** A caller questions why urea isn't a more popular cancer treatment, and Dr. Peat comments on the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatments.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The five-year mortality for cancers are post-operative, are pretty poor in most cases. There are not many cancers that are that truly resolved."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the success rates of cancer treatments, and Dr. Peat offers a more cautious perspective on long-term outcomes.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "um, I Think you should be very cautious and read some of the actual research articles on PubMed about it And the glucosamine or which was the Glucosamine with MSM The Glucosamine is suspected of being a factor in creating diabetes if you take too much of it for too long. But what about the MSM? What is the problem with that? That it can be toxic in itself. Toxic how? And how much would that be? Because what they told me was that it was something that your cells needed to be healthy. No, cells definitely don't need it, but it's tolerated in fairly large amounts, but it can also be toxic in those amounts."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about glucosamine and MSM for joint flexibility, and Dr. Peat advises caution, mentioning potential risks associated with glucosamine and the toxicity of MSM.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "No, the studies have all ended up pretty negative. What studies are negative? When it's used for a short period, you can do things like lowering cholesterol and lowering blood pressure, but it ends up with the toxic immune suppressive effects. And it also has thyroid suppressive effects very negatively impacting the energy supply and the energy production. So you're saying that the omega-3s... lowers the thyroid function? Yeah, and they're specifically thyro-toxic, so... Really? Yeah, they have... I have to take thyroid. Yeah. Okay, so they produce the byproducts of these polyunsaturated oils. The Lipo-Friskin is one of the main thyroid suppressive compounds. And indeed, as Dr. Peet says, whilst in the short term, somebody who has plaque psoriasis may benefit from it. The actual reason for it is that the immune system itself is being impacted negatively and suppressed, and so therefore there's not such excitation going on with rapid cell turnover in the immune system. But why is it so popular? It's so popular because it's an extremely profitable product. Like margarine? It's a waste product."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about the heart benefits of fish oil, and Dr. Peat refutes this, explaining its negative effects on the immune system and thyroid function, and attributing its popularity to profitability.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The same problem, it's a liquid oil, it's polyunsaturated. People don't get oil out of nuts and seeds, you know, it just doesn't happen. It's very small amounts and so to consume either sesame or brazil nut or peanut or whatever nut oil is consuming a lot of the product that you'd never normally get exposed to and this is the whole rationale behind understanding the negative impacts of these oils is that... So you don't think that sesame seeds have good stuff for you? No, no, none of it. They're very, very rancid, very easily rancified, they're extremely......quickly oxidized and turned into a sticky goo on the top of the jar. Anybody can take the top of a canola jar or a fish oil bottle and you'll see how sticky it is, and that's because your oil's been so quickly oxidized. In your body that same thing happens and that oxidative damage is extremely damaging. Well you can tell if it's rancid by the smell and the taste, it's very obvious. Coconut oil does not go rancid. You could keep coconut oil for years and it will not go rancid because it's so stable."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about sesame tahini, and Dr. Peat explains that all liquid oils from nuts and seeds are polyunsaturated and prone to rancidity, unlike stable coconut oil.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think you would think it's good. Yeah. It works with vitamin K to stabilize energy production."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about CoQ10, and Dr. Peat states it works with Vitamin K to stabilize energy production.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. They both do different things, but they regulate calcium and vitamin K has that extra function of stabilizing energy and brain chemistry."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if Vitamin K helps Vitamin D work better, and Dr. Peat explains their complementary roles in calcium regulation and energy stabilization.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. So, okay, Dr. P, how would you suggest that somebody who was, I don't know that this person is, but if somebody was obese, for example, and they had all this excess body fat which naturally would be pretty highly unsaturated, how would they go about changing the composition of their fat, not only by changing their diet to only include saturated fats, but how would they gently exercise and lose weight to do that safely? I'm having your thyroid. At the right level is one thing, and supplementing vitamin E, because when you're losing stored fat, it's going to travel through your bloodstream, so you want to have a steady supply of vitamin E coming in. Maybe 50 milligrams a day would help. And a lot of fruit, orange juice, for example, has safe... antioxidants besides vitamin C that protect your blood vessels as the fat is being removed. And keeping your temperature steady at 98.6 or close to it during the daytime keeps you burning your energy productively rather than destructively."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about safely changing body fat composition for an obese individual, and Dr. Peat advises on thyroid function, Vitamin E supplementation, fruit intake, and maintaining body temperature.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, when you lose the fat, you're going to expose your tissues to that polyunsaturated fat that is in storage. And if you keep your liver energetic with a good diet, enough protein... 80 to 100 grams a day of good protein and keep your thyroid function up, your liver will be able to dispose of some of that unsaturated fat as a toxin without having to oxidize it. So gentle exercise, keep yourself warm, make sure your thyroid function is working well, consume saturated fats, lots of OJ and other fructose containing fruits and or fruit juices to speed up your metabolism. And then coconut oil obviously as a thermogenic alternative to polyunsaturates as a saturated fat."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about retaining weight and the issue of unsaturated fat cells, and Dr. Peat explains how to manage the release of stored polyunsaturated fats by supporting liver function, protein intake, thyroid function, and metabolism with saturated fats and fructose.
