**RAY PEAT:** The animal studies have been pretty clear for almost a hundred years that it is a matter of an estrogen-like... irritation, if not exactly estrogen in the narrowest sense, but the main carcinogenic substances such as in smoke and tar are estrogen-like in their structure and effect. So the breast is very sensitive to an imbalance of estrogen-like stimulation. So it's susceptible to anything that has an estrogen-like effect including smoke and pollutants of various sorts.

**CONTEXT:** What's your opinion of the causes of breast cancer in the first place and how does this differ from the medical interpretation?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, every cell has estrogen receptors, but the way they interact with other... functions, I think, is more important than the number of receptors, because once you're exposed to estrogen, a cell will produce more and more receptors, and progesterone has a very central function of destroying estrogen receptors. So a breast that's well-balanced and exposed to enough progesterone won't have very many estrogen receptors during the progesterone dominance.

**CONTEXT:** So you said that the actual exposure to estrogen will cause an upregulation in the expression of estrogen receptors.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, pretty much in any cell and irritation in general will do that. A failure of energy combined with stimulation will make estrogen receptors start to appear. So that... Old people, as the energy production decreases, any irritation tends to induce estrogen production as well as sensitivity by the receptors.

**CONTEXT:** So interestingly, you're talking about the... causal link, if you like, or the link between estrogen and irritation and stresses. And I think later on, I just want to bring out some more questions surrounding HRT and that kind of thing, and estrogen replacement therapy. And I know when we've talked about many different subjects, you do bring up estrogen as being a causative factor in a lot of inflammation and irritation, and saying at this point in time that... Estrogen can be directly responsible for cancers.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the animal studies in the 30s and 40s were very clear that it isn't just the normally responsive tissues like the uterus and the breast that will cancerize under the influence of estrogen and similar things, but those are just the most sensitive and... With increased uninterrupted exposure to estrogen, the sequence tends to go first cancer of the uterus, then cancer of the breast, then of the lungs, kidneys, intestine and liver and brain.

**CONTEXT:** Are you talking about primaries now or metastases?

**RAY PEAT:** No, primary.

**CONTEXT:** Any tissue that is de-energized and irritated will develop not only the ability to respond to estrogen but actual ability to make estrogen so that your fat or your skin or your liver can become a source of estrogen in proportion to how much stress you're under, even if you don't have ovaries.

**RAY PEAT:** The irritation, the fat is particularly sensitive to it, it isn't very well supplied with defensive and energetic systems and so it seems to be a major age-related source of estrogen especially if you're overweight.

**CONTEXT:** Interesting, okay so I think that's a subject that should be brought out a little more. So fats in their own right and that. At this point in time, are we talking polyunsaturated fats or fats in general?

**RAY PEAT:** That was just your normal, ordinary fat cells. But since the polyunsaturated fats increase the deposition and storage of fat, and since they break down to form the inflammation promoting prostaglandins, they make the fat cells more likely to produce excess estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** And ultimately, ultimately over three or four years you say that essentially body fat composition could be turned back to a more saturated type fat if you avoid the polyunsaturated fat.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, there is a thing called the saturation index which is just the ratio between a saturated fat like stearic acid and the polyunsaturated such as linoleic acid and people with cancer have a higher polyunsaturation, lower saturation.

**CONTEXT:** But you're saying a saturated fat cell is still capable of producing estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the cell which is more saturated is stabler and less likely to produce estrogen. But the more highly polyunsaturated fats are very closely connected with estrogen. The amount in the tissue and in circulation of say a five or six unsaturated fats such as you find in fish oil, you produce with aging, these are closely associated with the level of estrogen stimulation.

**CONTEXT:** So eating nuts and seeds that are high in those polyunsaturated fats and fried foods that are fried in those corn and......canola oil is going to be more promoting than an estrogenic fat and...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for 80 or 90 years, about every 10 or 15 years, someone has done a study showing that the more polyunsaturated fat in the diet, the higher the cancer incidence, all the way down to extremely rare cancer incidence when there's no... polyunsaturated fats in the diet.

**CONTEXT:** And effect associated with them, and cancer obviously is one of those effects of decreasing energy to promote suitable responses and that, because it's thyroid suppressing effects, that is a direct relationship between low energy and the ability for systems to lose their correct structure and organisation in terms of doing the right thing. One of the... I have factors that shows up repeatedly in association with a low rate of cancer is a high fruit intake and fruit eaters getting the carbohydrate and the sugar produce saturated fats of their own so they keep a relatively high saturation index in their tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I mean, they knew back in the 1800s that the chimney sweeps would die of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Right, testicular cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, testicular cancer from the estrogenic effects of the soot. Yeah, but this was all turned around by these 12 giant companies getting together to promote the idea of the estrogen as the beneficial female hormone. So they came on the market with the idea that, I think it was a Harvard husband and wife pair of doctors that promoted the idea that you should give pregnant women estrogen to prevent miscarriage. That produced the generation of DES babies, two generations actually, their daughters also were susceptible to cancer. And after the news got out by the late 50s that estrogen was not good for preventing miscarriage, they came out with the contraception idea. They knew in the 30s that estrogen causes miscarriages. And abortion, and so they sold it for the opposite as long as they could get away with it, then came out on the market to sell it to prevent or interrupt pregnancies.

**CONTEXT:** So a lot of contraceptive pills allow pregnancy or fertilization to occur but it inhibits implantation, is that correct?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, my thesis advisor... Arnold Soderwal did some very clear research on that, showing that a small amount at the time of, or just before implantation, would prevent implantation. But a slightly larger amount after implantation had occurred would cause it to be ejected. And he made a graph showing that at each stage of......pregnancy, just slightly increasing the dose of estrogen would cause miscarriage. All the way from preventing implantation to aborting it at any stage. It would cause the embryo to die and simply be resorbed.

**CONTEXT:** My dissertation showed that that interaction worked through the availability largely of oxygen. Estrogen cuts off the availability of oxygen to the embryo, making the uterus short-circuit burn up and affect the oxygen before the embryo gets it, and progesterone and vitamin E both improve the delivery or preservation of oxygen for the...

**RAY PEAT:** Arnold Soderwald. S-O-D-E-R-W-A-L-L.

**CONTEXT:** And didn't... And didn't you say A-L-L? Okay, well... Didn't you say, Dr. Pete, that they didn't promote progesterone for all these 200 different diseases because it's so expensive to manufacture and estrogen is so cheap to manufacture and they wanted to make more money off the estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** More than that, it was that they knew in the 30s, someone simply put a glass plate in the smoke of the candle and then extracted the soot and found that they had a whole variety of chemical substances, soot essences, which were estrogenic as well as carcinogenic. And so they understood that... There was an infinite opportunity for having a patentable specific estrogen that you could market as your own product, but anytime you change the molecule of progesterone, you decrease or destroy its effect. And so all those synthetic progestins actually have an estrogenic effect.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, because progesterone, part of its effect is......what it turns into, and the additives attached to the progesterone molecule specifically block its conversion into that natural range of other steroids. And since the brain is a major source and user of progesterone, probably the worst effect of the synthetic progesterones is. that they interfere with brain brain function

**RAY PEAT:** Marian Diamond, a professor. University of California did studies on animals showing that estrogen in pregnancy stops the growth of the brain, especially the cortex, makes it thinner and smaller. The testosterone increases the growth, especially of the cortex of the brain, making it bigger, more intelligent, less psychopathic. And Catherine Dalton, working in England with her human patients, found accidentally the same thing turning out, that the women who were having pregnancy difficulties before treatment, and their older kids averaged below 100 IQ once she treated them and prevented their toxemia of pregnancy. The kids averaged over 130 IQ.

**CONTEXT:** And isn't it quite expensive for companies to manufacture pure bioidentical progesterone?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, not compared to what drugs generally cost. I mean, the raw material, if you compared raw material for estrogen, if it's just soot. Yeah, you can get a thousand doses of estrogen for a dollar. Only a few doses of progesterone for a dollar. So that it just all comes down to the dollar, the money.

**CONTEXT:** So, Dr. Pate, let's quickly look at a strategy, a strategy, a lifelong strategy, if you like. It's never too late to change. Some people leave it till the last minute, some people get on board fairly quickly, but in terms of the strategy to prevent that likelihood of occurring, given that you're saying it's very much stress-related and the effects of stress. Probably bringing in things like nitric oxide and estrogen directly increased in stress. How would you look at best avoiding that?

**RAY PEAT:** When you look at stress, the falling blood sugar and rising lactic acid are universal features of stress. And it happens that lactic acid is the main signal. We're producing the endorphins, the endogenous opiates, and if you look at the effects of stress, they're very closely all down the line associated with an excess and a prolonged production of the endogenous opiates and everything that is uncomfortable will increase your tendency to overproduce lactic acid hyperventilating for example from anxiety when your carbon dioxide goes down your lactic acid goes up and strangely the endorphins didn't get any of of the bad connotations of morphine

**CONTEXT:** Why no, I mean you hear the word endorphin and you think gosh, it's good. Yeah a study at University of California in San Diego In the I think it was dermatology department they were experimentally giving people massages and Measuring their various stress hormones. They saw that massaging lowered the beta endorphin and Everything pain or over exertion anything that interferes with the energy supply will increase the opiates or endorphins. So you would think that having a massage would increase your endorphins when in reality of course it's the opposite of what you're told. Because the endorphins are not good, okay all right can I move on to the aromatase inhibitors that are I think I've become. Well I think what Dr. Pete was trying to get to there is that the low dose naltrexone is being used therapeutically by a lot of doctors and it's very useful because it lowers those endorphins that are so harmful. All those endogenous opiates, opiates your body produces naturally that can be harmful in times of stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah and everything you do that's good, pleasure such as the massage will... have that same effect of protecting you against the endorphins and nitric oxide so the naloxone or naltrexone low dose treatment has a wide range of anti-stress effects including protection against a promotion of cancer.

**CONTEXT:** And the happy factor too, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, well... Serotonin and endorphins are often called the happy hormones, but actually they are the most important mediators of stress. Downstream, even though estrogen turns on lactic acid and endorphins and nitric oxide, the endorphins in turn activate estrogen receptors. Aromatase, prolactin, which acts as an amplifier of estrogen's effect, you get this back and forth action increasing inflammation, estrogenicity, and lowering energy production.

**CONTEXT:** Wow, so what can we do, Dr. Pete, to lower this estrogen with our diet?

**RAY PEAT:** The foods that... naturally contain anti-aromatases, I think are very important. I always mention orange juice and guavas, but there are lots of fruits and vegetables that contain similar chemicals. So the naringenin is found in orange juice, but also in higher levels in the...

**CONTEXT:** In the skins? Is that what you were saying, Dr. Pete?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, the...

**CONTEXT:** Of the oranges? The skin?

**RAY PEAT:** Both the juice and the feeling contain the protective things. So marmalade is another source of protective substances. Anti-estrogen breast cancer preventative compound.

**CONTEXT:** And then what about apigenin? That's another aromatase inhibitor that you were mentioning.

**RAY PEAT:** Um, yeah, I think guavas. And celery and parsley are the highest sources of that.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, and COX-2 inhibitors were another rationale for blocking aromatase.

**RAY PEAT:** Um, yeah, aspirin for about 20 years. I've been mentioning aspirin as probably the safest first thing that anyone who worries about breast cancer should start. It is a very effective way to turn off estrogen production and response to estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** And how much a day would you recommend?

**RAY PEAT:** People with aggressive cancer probably should take four to six grams and in that case they also need to take......vitamin K to prevent a bleeding problem. Yeah, up until the... I had a patient who was taking six grams of aspirin a day and they just started to get the ear ringing, so up until that point where you get the ear ringing then you know you're at the maximum and you want to back off just slightly till you don't get that ear ringing. But you have to use a milligram, not a microgram, but a milligram of vitamin K for every normal standard aspirin tablet which is 325 milligrams.

**CONTEXT:** I just wanted to bring out a couple of plant-based aromatase inhibitors that I know we were taught about when we were studying. Mistletoe. Mistletoe has been shown to be an aromatase inhibitor and I know work was done with cancer probably for that same reason or maybe inadvertently they figured that it was helpful probably through a estrogen blocking activity. Well do you know much about mistletoe? Physiologically how you would rationalize it?

**RAY PEAT:** About 50 years ago I ran into some Anthroposophy people who got me interested in it and so I've followed the research on it but I don't think anything......very new has turned up.

**CONTEXT:** Because the other things they mentioned were, and you did mention this last month, white button mushrooms. I think the brown button mushrooms are just the same kind of compounds but there are aromatase inhibitors in white button mushrooms. And I know you mentioned a dose last month that would be a realistic dose as an aromatase inhibitor.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the Chinese study found that the women who had at least 10 grams a day on average......had extremely low cancer mortality, and especially if they had green tea too, like 88% lower.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, and then I think the last two things were coffee and...

**RAY PEAT:** And green tea. Coffee and green tea, yeah. And normal black tea too, I mean they would all have the same compound.

**CONTEXT:** And I did, there was a caller who called in about black cohosh and that is an estrogenic herb and I would not recommend that for treatment or use with patients with breast cancer. Or I would not recommend it to prevent breast cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, there is a website that I am not sure what is available on it but he has written some very good articles on the issue of when and whether to treat certain types of cancer his name is Gershom Zajicek and his accent, now that he has YouTube videos, it's... Hard to understand, so if you can find his written articles, they're quicker to get through. But from the time of Hippocrates, I think Hippocrates said that for internal cancer, patients who are not treated will last a long time, but those who are treated die quickly. Gershom Zajicek makes a similar point and 50 years ago, a Berkeley professor... Arden Jones did a study and clearly showed that the longer a person waits before treating a cancer, the longer they live.

**CONTEXT:** Well and also there was a study that showed 95% of people over the age of 50 had some form of abdominal cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, an autopsy if they died before. Yeah, if they died like in a car crash or for some other unrelated to cancer reason. And 95% of people do not die of cancer, so.

**CONTEXT:** Another person said that looking at all of the organs, 100% of people by the age of 50 have diagnosable cancer somewhere.

**RAY PEAT:** They certainly contain lots of sulfur compounds. Dr. Pete, I think there is a... They're so thyroid-suppressive that they allow estrogen to build up. Naturally in men and women, because men actually usually have a lot higher levels of estrogen than women.

**CONTEXT:** But are they directly estrogenic, Dr. Pete?

**RAY PEAT:** There are some studies in animals showing a direct estrogenic effect of DIM and its metabolite.

**CONTEXT:** IP3?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Those are commonly touted as breast cancer-preventative, endometrial cancer-preventative....compounds, and Dr. Pete just said that there's lots of studies showing that they can have estrogenic effects in and of themselves. So I would say that sometimes they probably do have good effects, but I would wait for more research on them.

**RAY PEAT:** If you're still listening caller, you can cook your your kale, which is the most nutritious out of all of them, very very well and cook it with lots of coconut oil and you will reduce some of the thyroid suppressive effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, on the topic of stress and cancer, about 15 or 20 years ago Carl Simonton was in the news. Recommending emotional therapy or changing your attitude, visualizing, trying to have anything to reduce stress as a way to improve survival. He noticed that he was a radiation treater of cancer and he noticed that... With the same treatment, his patients who were curier lived longer and later a group at Stanford and UC Berkeley did a study in which one group of women with advanced breast cancer were given some kind of emotional counseling and a similar number was just... treated in a standard way. The ones with the counseling lived twice as long.

**CONTEXT:** Yes, hello? Hi. Yeah, I'm from Guyreville. I'd like to... you mentioned the cabbage and the... And you should turn the radio down, Carla, because your radio's on. Or something's on. Oh. Okay, well, I want to... is it okay now? Yeah, it's just the same. Oh, okay, hold on. I'll put it down. Well, while we're waiting for... Hello, is that better? Yeah, that's better, thank you. Okay, yeah, I always heard that I think they call it cruciferous vegetables. Right, that's the brassicas. Broccoli and cauliflower and cabbage were very anti-cancer and were good for you and especially the colon. Now, I tend to like to eat a lot of raw cabbage in salad. Is it any better if you don't cook it or you do cook it? You say that it suppresses thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, it suppresses your basic energy currency of your body, your body's ability to use oxygen. And if it's raw, it's particularly harmful to your energy metabolism of your body. But leaves in general can stimulate the intestines so it has a speedier transit and a... That reduces the recycling of estrogen. The liver excretes estrogen in the bile and if you have slow transit tend to be constipated then much of that estrogen is reabsorbed and circulates again in the body.

**CONTEXT:** So in other words if you do eat like something like cabbage it can make everything move through your intestines more quickly.

**RAY PEAT:** Right but there's safer things you can eat to move get your intestines moving like raw grated carrot. And you could eat spinach or chard that you cook with a little bit of baking soda and that will get your intestines moving.

**CONTEXT:** What about raw foods? I heard that they have good enzymes in them. They help digest the cooked food. Like if you have salad with raw carrots and cabbage and lettuce and that sort of thing that's good for you. Dr. Pete?

**RAY PEAT:** There is always the risk that since humans can't digest... cellulose at all, but bacteria can. The uncooked food is great for bacterial replication, but very poor for human nutrition. And so it's a risk and can cause...

**CONTEXT:** Well, what about fresh fruit?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, fresh fruit doesn't have such high cellulose content. Yeah, the low fiber fruits are very good.

**CONTEXT:** So, but you wouldn't, you don't think raw vegetables are good? I mean, I always thought...

**RAY PEAT:** Only raw carrot because the bacteria can't digest the raw carrot fiber like they can...

**CONTEXT:** But if everything, if it helps move through your intestines quickly...

**RAY PEAT:** Well, then that's why you choose the things that are safer to help your intestines move more quickly.

**CONTEXT:** Well, then why do we keep hearing that one of the best things to eat to prevent cancer is the cruciferous vegetables?

**RAY PEAT:** Unfortunate misinformation.

**CONTEXT:** Why do we keep hearing that HRT is supposed to be protective for your bones? Why do we keep hearing that estrogen is good for you? Why do we keep hearing that sugar is bad for you?

**RAY PEAT:** It's unfortunate. I think we have to call that the evening. But thank you so much for callers who called in and thank you Dr. Pete for your time. I'll just let people know how to get hold of you. Um, yeah I think I just want to sum this show up by saying that what you've heard this evening have a have a rethink about it because You probably never really heard it before and what you have heard is not the truth and it's so easy it's so easy to get brainwashed by media and by companies producing product that it's very important that you do your own research because you will find the truth out there and people like Dr Pete has spent in most of his life researching either directly or looking at peer-reviewed papers and looking at the scientific evidence. So it's unfortunate we get bombarded, but we do have the ability to Turn on the turn on the computer and do our own research.

**RAY PEAT:** So, the falling blood sugar and rising lactic acid are universal features of stress. And it happens that lactic acid is the main signal. We're producing the endorphins, the endogenous opiates, and if you look at the effects of stress, they're very closely all down the line associated with an excess and a prolonged production of the endogenous opiates and everything that is uncomfortable will increase your tendency to overproduce lactic acid hyperventilating for example from anxiety when your carbon dioxide goes down your lactic acid goes up and strangely the endorphins didn't get any of of the bad connotations of morphine.

**RAY PEAT:** The genetic problems almost always develop after the cancer is in progress. The overstimulation and undersupply of energy to the cell keeps the DNA from being repaired. So the stress causes the mutation rather than the mutation causing the cancer. But the inherited genes such as, what's it called, BRCA. Right. Yeah, BRAC1 and 2. Yeah. That is simply an indication that the person is more sensitive to stress and estrogen toxic effects. So, the anti-estrogen programs are... more important, more effective for protecting them.

**RAY PEAT:** The Greek doctor Danopoulos was using Using urea in various forms injecting it right into tumors for example also giving it intravenously and it can be applied in crystal or solid form to an open superficial tumor. It's a very strange material because it doesn't destroy tissue when even in a pure crystalline concentrated form and the injecting of urea into the urethra. Of 50% solution or a concentrated solution, it is possible if it goes in slowly, but people are used to thinking of an osmotic effect from a concentrated crystalline material, but urea isn't an osmolyte. It has a very strange interaction with water. It can go into cells freely just like the water. So what it's doing to remove excess water from cells isn't osmotically drawing out the water, it's doing something, adjusting the structure of the cell so that it doesn't have that excited need to retain water. And the typical intravenous dose would use a 30 percent solution. Giving maybe 20 grams at a time, but up to a total of 120 grams per day, which could be either for using it as a diuretic for heart failure or for inflammation of the brain when the brain is holding too much water because of a disturbance of the antidiuretic hormone or vasopressin. Or in treating cancer, so 20 or 30 grams at a time can also be given orally and is well absorbed and circulates systemically, so it doesn't have to be intravenous. And if it is used intravenously, it has to be added to a physiological solution of sodium chloride or glucose. 5 or 10 percent solution of glucose can have 30 percent, not necessarily that amount, but it can have a full load of urea added to it.

**RAY PEAT:** The people recommending it for treating heart failure, they've had patients staying on it for years where the other diuretics were disturbing their mineral metabolism. They were very stable on using urea. And they recommended... using about 20 grams at a time in a glass of fruit juice and doing that several times a day. So that's probably like two-thirds of an ounce.

**RAY PEAT:** Within about five minutes of an exposure to estrogen cells begin to take up a lot of water and that excess water stimulates cell division and growth and that's part of the process of promoting cancer growth is to keep them in an excited inflammatory state of too much water which keeps them from differentiating and functioning but makes them able to keep dividing and so one of the principles of cancer treatment should be Looking at the body's water economy.
