**RAY PEAT:** My PhD is from the University of Oregon in biology in 1972. I've taught in a few different institutions: State University of Mexico, Veracruz University, and two or three schools in the United States. I taught a variety of science courses, including immunology at the University of Veracruz. So, even though I didn't specialize or study it, I learned somewhat what's going on in the immune system, and that teaching got me interested in following the development.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, could you please start by letting people know your scientific and academic background for those who perhaps have never heard of you?

**RAY PEAT:** The World Health Organization, around 1970, took three villages in Guatemala. They left one as a control population. The other they sent the regular public health team with vaccination and chlorinated water for the drinking supply, just the usual minimal public health things. The third village, they provided a nutritional supplement to all of the pregnant women, during their breastfeeding time, and to the children. Relative to the control village that didn't have any doctors or help sent in, the medically treated village, the health got worse by several measurements. And the health in the village that simply got the nutritional supplement was generally better, as well as the kids being bigger, healthier, and more intelligent.

**CONTEXT:** The World Health Organization then came up with the conclusion that actually the far cheaper and easier thing to do was to use vaccination as a standard of care.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, but that isn't a popular thing with the world pharmaceutical industry because they want to sell drugs rather than food.

**CONTEXT:** The introduction of vaccinations is a very easy way to deploy material to Third World and other developing countries as a supposed way of increasing people's health.

**RAY PEAT:** The history of looking at the relation of vaccination to disease, specific disease incidents and mortality, goes back more than a hundred years. Ivan Illich was one of the first people to do a survey of the research that had been gathered over the years. Suzanne Humphrey's website is a good introduction to that perspective. She also has some information on the actual effect of the vaccine material on the baby's immune system and the need for taking a completely new look at what the immune system is, how it relates to the development of the person, rather than to fighting disease. This is a relatively new approach to looking at immunity called the danger theory, in which the body is really reacting to disruption of its tissues, and the immune system is there to repair and compensate for the injury. It just, from this point of view, happens that the infectious agent gets in the way of that repair process, and it's incidental, really, to what the immune system is doing.

**CONTEXT:** So they could just be injecting mercury and aluminum and other immune system irritants and get the same effect?

**RAY PEAT:** To a great extent. But one of the interesting things that Suzanne Humphreys mentions is that in one study in which they used an actual placebo control rather than a different vaccine, so they saw the difference between injecting just water or the vaccine, they didn't see any difference in the specific infection rate to the disease that the vaccine was aimed at, but they saw six or seven times greater incidents of other infections in the vaccinated kids.

**CONTEXT:** Well, there are a lot of organizations that are now saying that vaccinated children are less healthy than unvaccinated children.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, and there's not likely to be any funding to do that kind of study.

**CONTEXT:** And the whole, from a perspective of good health, or from a perspective of practicing medicine and the Hippocratic Oath, that statement, "First, do no harm," I think, continually sounds in my ear. And the definite and litigated damages claims that are being pursued in the courts against damaged children from drug companies is rather obvious. For anybody who wants to take a look at it, there's plenty of groups that have emerged as parents of damaged children, etc., campaigning for better access to litigation, because in fact, all of the companies that produce vaccines are indemnified by the government against any and all damage arising out of the use of vaccines.

**RAY PEAT:** So how does that sound to you? "First, do no harm," but you can produce a product, and as and when it damages somebody, you cannot be held liable for it. That sounds like a very serious contravention of the American constitution in terms of the population and its right and access to everything that is good and to be protected from those things that are not good, or are fast becoming massive control of both food and the drug industry in this country and in most economized world populations.

**CONTEXT:** So, yeah, "first, do no harm," it's obvious that vaccines have caused harm, the companies are indemnified against all and every claim, so they unfortunately don't have too many places to go to get any kind of recourse for what's happened.

**RAY PEAT:** Are unvaccinated children at risk of socializing with vaccinated children? There are cases in which a vaccinated child has spread the vaccine organism. They used a live polio virus, and the vaccinated kid has infected unvaccinated people. But the senators proposing or getting that bill passed were claiming that the unvaccinated children are putting everyone at risk.

**CONTEXT:** He said, but if most of the kids are vaccinated, aren't they protected? What are they going to catch? The reasoning just seems absolutely crazy. You can't put them at risk if they're protected.

**RAY PEAT:** So apparently the senator didn't believe that the vaccines are protecting anyone. How would they be at risk?

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, let's make the link between degraded food and ill health, declining health, etc., etc., and how a lot of this can tie in with the option to just make it simple and vaccinate everybody because out of that first study that we first talked about, that was the conclusion that was drawn.

**RAY PEAT:** So the cheapness is the main factor. Even dieticians are taught to promote a certain amount of starch in the diet. Starting in the 1930s, the US government designed and taught dieticians to promote three levels of nutrition: one, simply prevents starvation, emphasizing beans and cereals; another, middle-class, more health-oriented diet; and then the rich person's diet with plenty of animal protein. That emphasis, originally, it was relatively meaningful, valuable to hungry people to know how to get by on a diet of just a few cents a day for beans and grains, balancing things for minimal survival purposes. But for economic reasons, like the breakfast cereal industry, subsidized nutrition journals and diabetics journals, and taught dieticians to say that these things are healthful. The foods that were originally promoted just to survive, now they're called health foods: whole cereals, legumes, and so on. It's gone full circle.

**CONTEXT:** So the rich people now are indoctrinated so that they're eating whole grain bread and so on.

**RAY PEAT:** He rediscovered work that had been done 70 or 80 years earlier, and it's called "per-absorption of particles." It refers to the fact that even though ordinary digestion theory says that even proteins are broken down in the intestine and absorbed as small molecule particles of amino acids, he and his predecessors showed that if you feed starch consisting of the naturally formed starch grains, which can range from half the diameter of a red blood cell to about ten times the diameter of a red blood cell, in other words, much, much too big to even pass through the smallest arterioles, definitely, a lot of them will plug up capillaries and many of them block arterioles. He demonstrated both with people and with mice that feeding starch, like a cup of a slurry of corn starch, for example, and then drawing blood about 15 minutes later, he could find the type of starch particles that they had drunk in the bloodstream. And then 15 minutes later, he would start finding it in other body compartments. It would show up in the urine, passing through the kidney barrier. And ultimately, he found it was in the cerebrospinal fluid. And every compartment of the body, he could find these starch grains plugging arteries. With experimental animals, he would slice them up at different stages, having been fed starch chronically, and he found that it caused mice to age prematurely. And when he sliced them up, he found that every place that one of these starch grains lodged in an arterial or capillary, the surrounding cells would be starved of nutrients and would die. So that these animals, it was like having a shotgun working internally, killing little pockets of cells. And he was an immunologist. That was what got him interested in it, thinking about how your food can affect the immune system. If it's broken down into small particles before it gets into the body, the immune system simply isn't going to see anything allergenic. But if these big particles get into the bloodstream, they're going to come in contact with all the parts of the immune system. So the simple fact that big particles are in the body means that our immune system is constantly being exposed to antigens. And he demonstrated that the circulatory damage was very clear. But as an immunologist, he believed that those particles were contributing to diseases that corresponded to the type of antigen in the food.

**CONTEXT:** So the foods we should avoid that contain high starch granules, or high starch percent, would be grains and...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, any starchy food. And if the starch is very, very well cooked, like boiling it for 40 to 60 minutes and then eating it with fat, the fat slows down the absorption and allows the digestive enzymes to soften it up so that it doesn't get through the barrier of the intestine without being further broken down.

**CONTEXT:** Presumably, most people's intestines, for want of a better word, would be inflamed from poor diets, from poor food, dietary insults, we'll call them, and in that case, then they are probably more at risk and more subject to that passage of starch granules through the intestinal barrier, what would normally be a barrier, or perceived to be a barrier, but...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that inflammation, besides weakening the barrier function, that is increased by the immune reactions. It increases the production of inflammatory materials, and it becomes a vicious circle. Two nutrients that are very important in stopping that vicious circle are magnesium and vitamin A. And both of those are dependent on having adequate protein in the diet.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so fats, fats taken with starches, and I think you have mentioned this before that does ring a bell with me anyway, you said that fats when mixed with starches slow the absorption and or passage, if you like, of these starch granules through into the bloodstream, and that's why you advocate plenty of butter with potatoes, for example.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the having the digestive enzymes being produced abundantly requires total good nutrition, good thyroid function, and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, because if you have low thyroid function, then don't you have low hydrochloric acid, and it's hard for you to start breaking down the food?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the little glands in the digestive system slow down, don't produce as many enzymes. And your liver won't produce the same amount of bile.

**CONTEXT:** And also, you know, soaking of grains and, you know, in Mexico they are, you know, for thousands of years, corn has been...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, even in my parents' and grandparents' generation, the way bread was made was completely different. Letting it rise for eight or ten hours, wetting the dough, adding sugar, letting the yeast grow. The slow leavening process of using wheat or other grains activated enzymes that broke down the starches, turned them to sugar, let the yeast grow, and activated enzymes that broke down the gluten. And the combination of the carbohydrate, the sugar as energy, and the amino acids liberated from breaking down the gluten, produce new proteins. So the slow leavening actually can increase the protein by 100 or 200 percent. And the same with the corn, because it increases the absorption of the nutrients when corn is mixed with, boiled with lime. It decreases toxins and increases the nutrients.

**CONTEXT:** So it's modern-day food that's killing us.

**RAY PEAT:** The grain. People thousands of years ago discovered that both the slow leavening and boiling the grains with lye or lime would break down the toxins and make them more nutritious. It's just since about 1940 when the bread industry discovered that they could make instant bread by adding chemicals to blow it up.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, some of the ingredients that are not listed... I know we are probably going to be looking quite a bit at the starches because there's something that you talked about quite a bit, and I know that you're not particularly an advocate of starch, although you do recommend things like tortillas as a good alternative when they've been made with lye to make them far more digestible. You're not totally opposed to sourdough bread either, are you?

**RAY PEAT:** No, it's very safe compared to the standard bread.

**CONTEXT:** So not only have we talked about GMO, and one of the three main GMO products that are certainly flooding the food chain here are potatoes, corn, and then I know there's some rice to some extent is becoming GMO, and then potatoes. I heard some potatoes also have now been grown fairly widely as a genetically modified product.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, when I was visiting a food safety scientist at the USDA labs in Berkeley, he told me that they were working on adding a new fiber to breads, and Dow Chemical was paying the USDA to test the food safety of adding this wood pulp, sawdust, into the bread. It was not a grain fiber; it was from wood. It was a wood pulp, and they were making bread with wood pulp and they were going to advertise it as "increased fiber." Bread has increased fiber. I think the Germans discovered that method during a famine. They extended, at least they gave it to their war prisoners. And when they almost entirely omitted the cereal and made the bread of sawdust, the purpose was to kill off the war prisoners faster.

**CONTEXT:** Caller, you're on the air, where are you from? I have laryngitis. When some antibiotic that you tried didn't work on an ear infection at four years old, and possibly they never gave that immunization out as a regular basis, at least I wasn't even aware of it until my child contracted spinal meningitis, and I believe that is a dangerous disease.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, well, thank God for antibiotics when your child gets spinal meningitis.

**CONTEXT:** Yes, but also not thank God for the parents that I've known who've had children vaccinated for pertussis and ended up permanently paralyzed. You might want to read the book, "The Poisoned Needle," and investigate a little bit deeper into the subject. Also, one of the polio vaccines that I have heard about, there were two forms of them, and one of them can be quite dangerous, as well as the pertussis. Now, I am a believer in tetanus vaccination, especially here in the hills, and that isn't actually caused by rust; it's caused by horse manure.

**CONTEXT:** We're trying not to get into too much specifics because we don't have time on this show, so... Thank you for your call. Okay, alright, if you live in the area, the code, the number's 923-2513 or 1-800-KME-D-RAD. If you're outside the area, the toll-free number's 1-800-568-3723, which is KME-D-RAD. Okay, I think you have another, yeah, we have another caller on the air. Where are you from, caller?

**RAY PEAT:** Missouri.

**CONTEXT:** Oh, hey, how you doing? Good, how are you? Oh, pretty good, carry on. Uh, so, you know, I... I guess one thing I wanted to find out is on starches, Dr. Pete, is there any differences from, say, like the starch in white rice and the starch in potato and any other starches that come to mind? And then the other thing I was wondering, I know you've commented several times that potatoes have a really high-quality protein. I think I've even heard you say that it's actually maybe even better than eggs. Um... And I'm wondering, eating something like potatoes that are well cooked with butter or coconut oil or even some kind of meat, you know, like a ruminant, versus eating white rice or even whole rice or whole wheat bread, does the body, because it's gearing up to digest protein, possibly secrete more enzymes that would be effective in breaking down those starch molecules in the potato? I guess I'm trying to defend the potato in my own mind to a certain degree, because I've really enjoyed cooking them many ways, such as, you know, hash browns cooked in coconut oil and then putting it out of the broiler and kind of browning them, and then putting eggs on top and putting it back in the broiler. And I just love these different foods with potatoes. I also grow potatoes. I realize... That the philosophy or the, you know, a lot of people will say, well, people have been eating potatoes for thousands of years or the study, they've been eating bread for thousands of years. I realize it may be all they had and that's why they're eating it, but...

**RAY PEAT:** Norman Currier wrote a good book many years ago on the quality of plant proteins, and he rated rice at six percent value, for an egg yolk was a hundred percent value, and leaf protein, if it's extracted from the fiber and the fats, leaf protein is about seventy percent value on his scale. Where the protein in potato, I think, was about 105 percent, slightly better than egg yolk in quality. So it's roughly fifteen or twenty times better than rice or bean protein by Currier's scale. And the starch grain in potato is one of the biggest; it's about a hundred microns in diameter. Rice starch grains, I think, are down around ten microns in diameter.

**CONTEXT:** So Dr. Peat, do you think that eating a protein with your potato would increase the enzymatic digestion of the starch?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if the protein, if the potato is very well cooked, it has such high-quality protein that people subsist very well on a pure potato diet, basically. In New Guinea, some of the people on the traditional diet would eat basically just potatoes for fifty weeks out of the year. Then for one or two weeks, they would have a regional feast, for several days they would eat pork, just one or two weeks out of the year. But because of that very high potato diet for fifty weeks of the year, they were studied in detail and found to be well-muscled, generally very healthy, as if they had been eating a perfectly balanced diet all year. And that was what got people interested in the high quality of potato protein.

**CONTEXT:** It'd be interesting to know if people that are eating a food like that over a long period of time, if they've kind of developed different strategies, like, you know, really chewing it well and making sure that they're breaking the starch down somehow, or they've either adapted. Maybe to, I don't know, is that possible for a stomach to secrete specific types of enzymes that are breaking down starch molecules better because generation after generation they're eating that type of food, I wonder?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just in a few months, a person's digestive system will adapt considerably. In animal experiments, if they feed a highly nutritious diet, the size, the length, and the weight of the intestine is very small. If they eat a very poor, high-starch diet, high-fiber, the intestine grows in length and mass. So it's almost like they're producing an organ specifically for the type of food they're eating. And a good way to get the protein out of the...

**CONTEXT:** I know we have a caller, but a good way to get the protein out of the potato is to juice it. Dr. Peat, you've taught me that, and you juice a raw potato and then you let the starch granules fall to the bottom of the liquid and then you strain, or you just pour off the clear liquid and don't use the starch at the bottom. It stinks. It's almost like a corn starch you see sunk to the bottom of the cup, and then you can cook that very, very slowly in a double boiler with butter or just very slowly, and it's like, it is like scrambled eggs, and so for a vegetarian, right, high-quality protein, that's a great, great thing to do. I actually made a soup last week where I juiced potatoes and then put that just in a pan and got it boiling, and then I put in bamboo shoots and shiitake mushrooms, and man was it good.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you can find information on nixtamalizing even beans. I've never tried it, but...

**CONTEXT:** So that's processing, boiling the beans with a lye or lime?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** Oh. So it would work with the beans as well as with the corn? That's what some people are saying on the internet. Would it negate the phytates that are present in the beans?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it does liberate the minerals, at least, from the phytic acid.

**CONTEXT:** And are they saying that they're not thyroid-suppressive as a result of that?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it still probably has the... No, I don't know that. Well, soaking beans is a very traditional way to repair them. Soaking for three days, you're activating a lot of enzymes that help break down the toxins. That increases the protein value, too, greatly. So anyone who eats beans should soak them for three days, rinsing the water. As they approach sprouting, the storage protein turns to growth protein, which is less toxic and more nutritious.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you for your call. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Okay. So getting back to the starches in, just in case anybody else is listening and they want to call in, it's 1-800-KMUD-RAD is this whole free number, all the local areas, 923-2513. No, 923-3911. 3911. What am I saying? Okay. Too excited. Oh, you're reading the other number. Dr. P, okay, so we're talking about starches and it's not being particularly healthy, unless in some of the instances that we've covered, you can make them more digestible and more manageable for your gut to process them. But just so people understand how big an industry the whole starch industry is, especially with the GMO patentable, own the seed type of approach to mass-producing starch, folks. And that's what the majority of children eat and crave, is starches, so no wonder they need the vaccines. And if you looked at your packaging and your labeling, you would see all these different numbers would be on there, and there are things like acid-treated starch, alkaline-treated, bleached starch, oxidized starch, modified starch, dyed starch, phosphated starch, acetylated, hydroxy-propylized, the list goes on and on, it's huge. And most of what we're talking about here is not healthy and it's not, I know it would not pass any kind of scientific rigor for the true definition of good healthy food. And that's just the beginning, that's the tip of the iceberg. There is actually a grain processing corporation, folks, okay, it's called the Grain Processing Corporation. If you'd like to look it up online, they produce things like B700 pure corn starch, oxidized starch, stabilized starch, binding coating starch, and the list goes on there too, and it's all about putting this into the food, the food stream, and it's in most of the foods that you will have previously never had these things in anyway.

**CONTEXT:** We have another caller on the air to take this next call. Call away.

**RAY PEAT:** Each variety of potato varies in the quantity of starch relative to protein, but the whole family has high-quality protein, and it's just the digestibility that is the main difference. The high carotene content can make them hard to digest for some people.

**CONTEXT:** That's what we would call a waxy potato, one that doesn't start falling apart in the pan as easily, right, Dr. Peat?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the yellow color is carotene.

**CONTEXT:** And when the skins turn green, isn't that a toxin? Yes. Yeah, nightshade? A solanine. Poisonous. Yeah, it's bitter. If the FDA had that come into... It was just discovered right now, potatoes would be outlawed. A ban in case they turn green.

**RAY PEAT:** A solanine, yeah, it's pretty toxic.

**CONTEXT:** They peel potatoes, but I like to eat the peels unless they're, you know, green.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, if your potato is non-organic, you need to stay away from the peels because they put so many chemicals on non-organic potatoes. That is why I like that other gentleman. I'm planning on growing my own this year. And of course, when you genetically modify potatoes, you can drench them in pesticides and herbicides. That's the whole point of...

**CONTEXT:** Oh, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, it gets worse and worse. Okay, so there is another caller on the air. Thank you. Thank you for your call. Bye. And let's see here. Caller, you're on the air and where are you from?

**RAY PEAT:** The main function of acid in the stomach is digesting proteins, and it is responsive to the type of food you eat. And so the starch doesn't necessarily stimulate acid production, but it might be irritating to the stomach in some other ways, like the quality of the starch. If it's hard to digest, it's likely to be more irritating. And if it's so hard to digest, it passes along your intestine without breaking down significantly, then it can support bacterial growth or fungal growth that can cause digestive problems.

**CONTEXT:** So high acid, I mean, high protein is hard. Would it make it less accessible for the acid? Just high protein?

**RAY PEAT:** Usually the stomach can judge how much acid to secrete in proportion to the amount of protein that it senses.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, can I ask you a little bit about xanthan and carrageenan gums? I know we have covered them in the past. I know you're opposed to them.

**RAY PEAT:** I think they're gradually getting away from carrageenan, which is a very powerful allergen and inflammation promoter. And this is because of the literature against it, right? The evidence is just tremendous. It degrades under the influence of bacteria in the intestine, and degraded carrageenan is generally widely recognized as a carcinogen.

**CONTEXT:** Well, it's found in organic whipping cream.

**RAY PEAT:** The industry to promote these manufactured cheap artificial gums to use in food processing, extending shelf life, reducing the need for nutrients in the food. The industry has promoted the idea that resistant starches are health foods, that by feeding bacteria, which break them down and produce some short molecules such as butyric acid and lactic acid, that this will supposedly prevent bowel cancer. But in fact, it's causing changes in your brain and general nervous system to absorb these broken down products of the resistant starches.

**CONTEXT:** So the whole point about the dairy is that dairy does contain saturated fat, but it's not a bad thing. It's the liquid oils. I don't know actually if there is another caller on there, but I know we're getting pretty close.

**RAY PEAT:** If it comes from eggs produced by well-fed chickens, it's okay. But now it all comes from soybeans. Soybeans are a highly unsaturated fat, and so it's simply a way of getting too much PUFA into your system if you eat very much of them. But if it's just a trace of it, like to emulsify a chocolate bar or something, that small amount is harmless.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so Dr. Peat, what do you think of lecithin? Do you have any...

**RAY PEAT:** Well, phosphates and aluminum phosphate in particular, sodium aluminum sulfate, are used as stabilizers in this. Obviously, the artificial colors, things like propyl gallate and butylated hydroxy toluene, propyl paraben for keeping tortillas, muffins, and those kind of products fluffy, and food dyes, not to mention the food dyes that get put in. And then things like potassium bromate, used to strengthen bread and cracker dough and help it rise. I mean, crying out loud, what's wrong with just good, good old-fashioned food? It's almost too simple. And I think that's what actually happens with time and life in time is that the simple things just suddenly seem to be unbelievable because they're too simple. And unfortunately, technology wants to cover our eyes with the wool of its science, which is not rooted in real science, but is rooted in pseudoscience supported by big industry.

**CONTEXT:** And it's very much what we've said before, in keeping with Dr. Peat recommending a very simple diet of good quality foods, that you are what you eat.

**RAY PEAT:** So for those people that have listened to the show and have enjoyed it and or want to know more about Dr. Peat, his website is www.raypeat.com. He's got plenty of articles there. They're all downloadable, printable, shareable, etc. They're all fully referenced, and he's been doing this for at least 45 years now. So he's extremely intelligent and he knows what he's talking about, and he's done a lot of research on it. And you can find the references that he gives. You can find all these people on the internet who unfortunately are just shining their tiny little light in the darkness here, but fortunately, they are visible if you look for them. So I'd encourage people to go to his website, read the articles, hear what he has to say. It's good old-fashioned wisdom that's free.

**CONTEXT:** Well, he's a genius of the highest order. He certainly is.

**RAY PEAT:** And for those people that have called in, thanks so much for your calls, and we'll do this again next month on the third Friday of the month.

**CONTEXT:** And if you need to contact us, our telephone number is 707-986-9506 or toll-free 1-888-WBM-HERB.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, all right. So thanks so much for joining us, folks. We do appreciate you calling in. And thanks so much KMUD Garberville for hosting us and allowing this free speech, which is what America's all about, isn't it? If there's anything wrong with it, people will find it out. And you've got to have access to free speech because the truth will shine out. And anything that's inherently bad or evil will be discovered. And the truth is there for people that have ears. So let them let them hear. Good night. So let them let them hear. Good night. All right. What a good show.
