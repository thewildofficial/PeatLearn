**RAY PEAT:** "So Duffy, can you tell us what urea is? Its name chemically is carbamide. That's right. It's just a combination of ammonia with carbon dioxide and so it's the body's way of detoxifying ammonia and it requires oxidative production of carbon dioxide to combine with the ammonia to get rid of it and so it regulates cell pH which regulates water metabolism and everything else in cell function."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a basic definition of urea.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the dimensions of thinking about water and cells is that it comes up against some of the basic dogmas of what life is and how cells work and so on and I think the reason that Denopolis amazing results in curing cancer with simply injecting or giving intravenous urea I think the reason it's been ignored and dismissed is that it involves some ideas that don't fit with these mechanical dogmas of 20th century biology such as the membrane theory, the idea that there are pumps in cell surface membranes that regulate the amount of water and minerals in cells by somehow grabbing the molecules and pushing them in or out of the cell. It's really a silly, impossible concept, but it's what everything officially is based on. So when you actually look at the facts of what's happening with water, if you think in terms of things such as what happens when a gelatin gets wet, and swells up, and if you put acid or or alkali on what happens to its relation to water and so on, acid makes it shrink, alkali makes it swell up, and simple physical ideas like that are very useful for thinking about what happens in all of the diseases."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how excess water accumulation in cells, a feature of degenerative diseases, can be explained and prevented, referencing the work of Danopoulos.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and swelling has an anabolic effect and turns on cell division and uncontrollable cell division can produce everything from cancer to various skin diseases of dandruff for example psoriasis. Overgrowth of fibrous tissue, the control of cell growth is very deeply controlled by water and pH. And so the membrane pump people blame everything in life on this magical pump that regulates the water and the pH. If you just think about the basic metabolic processes in which you turn sugar or fat or protein into energy and carbon dioxide, this constant streaming of substance, the carbon dioxide is an acid and you're making it inside cells and so when you're alive you're making cells acidic. And as it leaves it takes minerals out of the cell with it in the form of carbonic acid and the alkaline minerals associated with it."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on the relationship between acidity, alkalinity, and cell swelling.

**RAY PEAT:** "This is the better state than the alkaline state though, right? Yeah, the alkaline acidic state produced by carbon dioxide causes a shift in the whole balance of electrons in the protein fat. Nucleic acid system and that shift of electrons accounts for the preference of the cell for potassium normally over sodium. If the cell is disturbed then it shifts and loses potassium and takes up calcium and sodium. This is what Gilbert Ling has devoted his life....to for the last 60-some years."

**CONTEXT:** The host seeks to clarify the preferred internal cellular pH state.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's true when you apply it to the blood and the fluid. Outside the cell, right? But the reason the fluid outside of cells is alkaline is that the protons the electrons are being retracted into an acidic state inside the cell and that shifts the balance. and makes it alkaline outside."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on the common understanding of acidity and alkalinity in relation to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "So what you're saying is when the cell inside and then when the inside of the cell becomes alkaline that's when it becomes swollen and boggy and that's what can contribute to heart disease, cancer, psoriasis, all these degenerative diseases we've mentioned. And that goes with a shift towards acidity in the blood and the outside fluid. So that's where people are thinking about you don't want to be acidic metabolically. That refers to the fluids outside of cells and it's only since the nuclear magnetic resonance apparatuses have been used the last 40 years mostly that people have started to recognize that inside cells should be slightly acidic."

**CONTEXT:** The host summarizes the discussion on internal cellular pH and its relation to disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Keeping the energy flowing, producing carbon dioxide constantly by consuming oxygen. So we need our cells to be consuming oxygen properly."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how to achieve the desired internal cellular acidity and extracellular alkalinity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and just suffocating, just turning off the oxygen supply so you stop making a steady supply of carbon dioxide. The metabolism shifts over. To making lactic acid and the lactic acid takes acid out of the cell as it's leaving and acidifies the environment but leaves the cell more alkaline. Right, and that's a negative, that's a negative acidic situation that most people commonly refer to when they talk about acid versus alkaline blood. Yeah, it's a local. Inflammatory situation. Anytime a tissue is injured, it tends to produce excess lactic acid and become inflamed and inefficient."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the consequences of insufficient oxygen supply.

**RAY PEAT:** "The cell holds its structure by... The way proteins are folded, which requires an interaction with the... Everything in the cell has to participate in that slightly acidic state, making carbon dioxide, keeping the ATP level at a high energy state, keeping the water participating in the way proteins are folded so that... There's a lot of internal surface area exposed in the cell. You know how the surface of a glass of water has a sort of rubbery film on the top that you can float a piece of steel or such on the surface tension. Inside the cell when the proteins are energized, the ATP is holding them in this state exposing their surface. Keeping the cell's water in that energized tough state that helps to hold the cell together. When it's de-energized, the structure collapses in various ways. For example, spherical proteins that were exposing all of their surface polymerize into stalk-like proteins that have less surface exposure. And the water becomes... more like plain bulk water under the tough surface. And this water then behaves very differently. And that's the kind of water that is involved in cell swelling, growth, uncontrolled cell diffusion and so on. It's also the pH inside the cell also regulates the protein's folding ability to a large degree. Proteins don't conformationally fold properly in the wrong pH."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how urea helps cells use oxygen better or maintain internal acidity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it's in the case of any protein, jelly, even some synthetic plastics, the alkalinity has the same effect of making the jelly swell up and get watery and soft. So again, another... Another reason why the alkaline internal environment would not be helpful. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good. Well, inside the cell. Inside the cell, yeah, yeah."

**CONTEXT:** The host reiterates the negative impact of alkalinity on cellular structure.

**RAY PEAT:** "The urea happens to be a strange kind of solvent that is pretty much equally at home inside and outside the cell, but it's slightly more at home in a healthy, stable cell. So that just by solubility, if you immerse cells in a solution with a certain amount of urea, the urea is going to come to rest at a higher concentration in cells. No pumping is involved, it's simply that it's soluble in the cell at a slightly higher degree than in plain water. And inside the cell, it participates with the... relaxed or energized state of the cell in which surfaces is exposed. So the urea helps the proteins to expose the energized surface that keeps cells in the functioning high-energy state. And that's how Denopolis helped with cancer was by injecting the urea into the cells and that helped them maintain their shape and function to a better degree. And to keep it towards the... slightly acidic metabolizing state, in which it doesn't tend to proliferate, a relatively slightly dehydrated effect. So it's like you have now a new solvent, solute substance when it has the right amount of urea mixed in with the proteins and fats and water. It creates a new state of matter that has its own solubility properties for other things including the preference for potassium over sodium and for magnesium over calcium and so on."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about urea's mechanism of action in stabilizing cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, that's been known for over a hundred years. People simply use the semi-permeable membrane setup and found that it doesn't behave like sodium or potassium or other things that are known to be osmolytes. And to... pull water across the semi-permeable membrane and so on. In 1914, I think it was, the first one, but around the First World War, someone was demonstrating that you could make it five or six times more concentrated than it should be osmotically and it would be in balance and not cause cells to lose water."

**CONTEXT:** The host mentions that urea is not an osmolyte and does not affect pH.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hold the cell in the proper state, or if you had five or six times the concentration of sugar or salt you would dry up. You'd be in trouble. When you put salt on the slug it drinks it. Yeah right, it takes all the water out of it. Presumably a slug wouldn't find concentrated urea. Interesting, and I think you've also mentioned that that concentration five to six times is nothing as much as... I'd say a hundred times which is still compatible with life, it doesn't actually, it's not, has a very very low toxicity, it's not at all toxic, is it? No, and the sea organisms, sharks for example, have a very very high level of urea imbalance. Is that right? And the experiments have shown that even more than a hundred times what we normally have, doesn't cause any... damage that can be seen in cells. And therapeutically, Danopoulos and others have found that maybe a hundred times our normal urea level in the serum is actually therapeutic for certain things, cancer and brain function, for example."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the toxicity of urea and its presence in other organisms.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sickle cell anemia, for example, was being treated successfully with urea and... Normal cells under stress tend to be hardened the way sickle cells become stiff and won't go through capillaries. Just during heart surgery, the stress causes ordinary round blood cells to become stiffened and malfunction, tending to kill the patient, and with a supplement of urea, that hardening of the red cells....by stress is prevented, and it was therapeutic for the sickle cell patients, but because of the myth of urea being an osmolyte, someone used plain urea at a certain concentration without the normal sodium and other minerals in the solution and found that it broke. It immediately caused red blood cells to break down so they said that can't be good. They stopped using it and shifted over to very toxic carcinogenic hydroxy urea which is still in use."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about urea's use in sickle cell anemia and the reasons for its discontinuation.

**RAY PEAT:** "It would take about six times as much urea as normal to not break down the rib cells. Interesting. So I'm not too sure what it is, but for example just for people that are listening to understand the concept that I'm trying to... describe to you and that you're describing to me is that if you have for example a one millimolar concentration of urea in your blood normally then if you were to inject a five or six millimolar concentration of urea into the capillary or into the arteria or whatever it wouldn't have a negative effect it would be acceptable but if it was injected as a one millimolar solution which you'd find naturally in the blood it would have a you'd have a problem with that. Yeah assuming that the other... Things like sodium and calcium and potassium aren't compensating for the difference in urea."

**CONTEXT:** The host seeks to clarify the concentration of urea needed to avoid negative effects on red blood cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "And one person reported on... I think he said he had had heart failure patients doing well on... oral urea for as long as nine years. And this is because it's a diuretic and it's... Yeah, that was the argument that they were using it, because it did relieve the swollen legs and such that occur in congestive heart failure. But I think since you also see it bringing people back from brain damage... traumatic head injury and strokes and such, it I think has much deeper therapeutic effects, stabilizing cells in many ways, not just reducing the swelling by causing diuresis."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the oral use of urea, specifically for heart failure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I have opinions but I haven't finished thinking about the subject you remember mercury was a traditional diuretic and it's apparently worked just by sort of killing the tubes of the kidney and letting the water kind of fall out of the body. Not to be recommended. Well and like you know radiation was useful for treating a psoriasis, x-rays were useful for treating psoriasis and arthritis right? Yeah and I think some of the chemical diuretics are about as well founded as mercury as diuretics. Chemicals that made the kidneys give up. More water don't necessarily really improve the person's health. The cells could be still holding on to the water and not."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a comparison between urea and traditional diuretics.

**RAY PEAT:** "But any stress involves a series of reactions all of which relate to the way cells handle water nitric oxide is a universally produced thing by injury and stress and it causes de-energizing and swelling of cells and so on. Estrogen is a physiological producer of swelling imitating a stress reaction and being produced by stress and one of the brain or pituitary hormones, antidiuretic hormone, is another stress induced producer of water retention and edema and old people as well as traumatized. People who are hospitalized fairly often develop a state of water retention with sodium loss. They call it hyponatremia or the syndrome of inappropriate adiabatic hormone secretion. But estrogen happens to produce the same effect and so they say estrogen activates... the receptors of the antidiuretic hormone when you can't find the actual hormone but the same conditions they say it's because the receptors are acting independently and nitric oxide estrogen and antidiuretic hormone produce the state of getting waterlogged while losing of sodium into the urine and producing......fairly concentrated urine, but keeping over-hydrated cells and the blood supply. And the normal basic thing that regulates the ability to release water through the kidneys while retaining sodium is the particular energized electronic state of the cells. Governing the way the tube of the kidney electrically relates to its surroundings, the production of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid, the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, is one of the targets of some of the diuretics, such as acetazolamide, so that the body retains more carbon dioxide. And thus lose so much sodium. And the normal regulator of carbon dioxide, and so of sodium-water balance, is the thyroid hormone. And hypothyroid people always tend towards this syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion or the appearance of......simply hyponatremia being waterlogged, having enough water, not enough sodium. So the sodium itself, sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate can cure a lot of these stress conditions."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mechanisms of water retention and the role of various hormones and substances.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the intestine is especially exposed to things such as endotoxin which release nitric oxide, which has this de-energizing cell swelling effect, waterlogging effect. So bicarbonate of soda you mentioned just before I interrupted there was......would be another good way of liberating CO2 and I could take an internally would have a local topical activity too."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a "boggy intestine" or swollen intestine could be related to the same waterlogging phenomenon.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I know people who have taken a teaspoon two or three times a day with water for many years. Athletes sometimes take a tablespoon with water before an endurance race. And I think part of the effect on endurance is more basic than just preventing getting waterlogged. I think it's actually helping to prevent excess nitric oxide production."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the dosage of baking soda for internal use.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think that's probably the most common reason for endurance runners collapsing and dying."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the cause of collapse in endurance runners.

**RAY PEAT:** "The cell water content decreases pretty steadily with aging until an old cell which is still very functional, no disease. Evident is pretty dried up relative to the 92% water of fertilized ovum that gets down to something like 65% water in old cells as a steady progression without any particular disease happening. And as that happens, cell division is slowed so that in your skin, the Over time, you see fewer cells in the skin, meaning that it's thinner. There just isn't as much living skin there in old people. The column of growing cells in the surface layer, the squamous epithelium of skin and the mucous membranes. There's a column of eight or ten growing cells in the young skin and only maybe two or three cells that are still actively growing in old skin. And that's partly just because they're slowing down. But they're also the piling up collapsed cornified or keratinized cells accumulate. In the old skin, the maturing process comes on prematurely with aging or with some types of stress. For example, a vitamin A deficiency will cause premature keratinizing or hardening of the skin. And the skin will become... thinner and tougher, lower water content. Estrogen does this normally cyclically in the mucous membranes, causing at first a faster growth because there's a greater water uptake under the influence of estrogen, rapid thickening and growing. But then... An increased formation of keratin fibers and hardening of the surface. So, some of the effects of estrogen are just like vitamin A deficiency. And you can offset some of the effects both of aging and estrogen by simply supplementing some vitamin A and vitamin E directly into the skin. And urea, old skin. Has much less urea in it than young skin and that's probably both what the cause and effect of the lower water content with aging."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the appearance of skin with aging and youth, and the role of water content.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's very tasteless, a little maybe on the salty side, so it's usually taken with orange juice or grapefruit juice just so you don't taste it. A small amount, anywhere from a fourth of a teaspoon to a glass up to maybe a teaspoon per glass."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the taste of oral urea and how to take it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um, I don't think it interferes with the diuretics, but it just makes them unnecessary."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if oral urea can be taken with prescribed diuretics.

**RAY PEAT:** "Getting adequate protein in your diet is probably the......thing that most people could make the biggest difference with."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks what to ingest to make cells more acidic internally and blood more alkaline externally.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, you can measure the increased output of urea in the urine in proportion to the amount of protein you're eating if your digestion is good and if your thyroid function is good. So, like eating red meat is good for that?"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if eating protein increases urea.

**RAY PEAT:** "Um... It shouldn't be too high in phosphate. Meat is very high in phosphate and so gelatin is good as a supplement. If you make soup with the collagenous joint tissue, for example. Like oxtail or shank? Oxtail, yes."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the suitability of red meat for protein intake.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think it's better to get... a big part of your protein from other foods such as milk and cheese and some of the high quality vegetables like potatoes and mushrooms. Eggs, milk and cheese, potatoes, mushrooms, those are some high protein. Are eggs good? Yes. Eggs very good."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the quantity of meat to consume.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in people who are under stress, for example. Women with toxemia of pregnancy. Well, what about just in general, just normal? You know, aging and wanting to keep as healthy as you can when you're getting older? Yeah, I've known many young women and a few old people who have been put on a low-sodium diet because of various problems. And using the studies on pregnant toxemia people... I suggested that they try the same thing."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the general benefits of salt for aging and health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, they've disproven that, and they only started saying you shouldn't eat salt when they wanted to sell their diuretics, so it's just been one big scam."

**CONTEXT:** The host expresses skepticism about the common advice to avoid salt.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the blood volume gets oxygen and nutrients to the kidneys and keeps them working. So hydration is very important. Yeah."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of salt in blood volume and kidney function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, that was the protein. That's why he suggested the protein, because that will keep the urea up."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on how to ensure internal cellular acidity.

**RAY PEAT:** "So we want to have urea but not uric crystals? Yeah, urea is protective uric acid."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the distinction between urea and uric acid crystals in relation to gout.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Okay, thank you very much."

**CONTEXT:** The host acknowledges the explanation about protein and urea.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, so I've had it all these years and my mom had it and so did my grandmother. For quite a while it's been known that estrogen interferes with the conversion of levothyroxine into the active hormone and that accounts for why women have about five times as much thyroid problems as men do because of the interference of estrogen with activating it. So illogically doctors prescribe. Thyroxine the women without measuring the liver function of producing the active hormone T3. Yeah I don't think I've ever had a test for that. It sounds like you're not using the right kind of hormone so the liver thyroxine that you're on is probably being blocked. The conversion of it to the active hormone is more than likely getting blocked because of high estrogen so you'd be better off using a T3 supplement which does not need you to perform the conversion. So you basically are still you're probably still a low thyroid even though you're taking thyroid hormone because you're not converting it. Yeah well according to their tests I'm normal now. Yeah there's a lot of controversy about the thyroid test the TSH that's used as a measurement is very... poor science and whilst the TSH may be in the range you probably find it's on the higher end and naturally your temperature impulses would be much more indicative of your thyroid performance. Oh what do you mean by temperature? High or low? Probably low temperature and falling temperatures. I tend to have a low temperature. And then obviously things like stubborn, weight gain, lack of energy, insomnia. Very lack of energy, very, it's gotten worse this year, really, really bad. And I went to the doctors for it and they said they can't find any problem. Well it's probably just that you're not turning the thyroid you're taking into an active form that your body can use. So it's probably, that's probably the base problem and that's very common to occur after pregnancy."

**CONTEXT:** The host describes a long-standing water retention problem and an underactive thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** "I know quite a few people who have done it and seem to be very healthy, and it's been practiced for about three or four thousand years, but I don't know how... I think most people would prefer to use the purified chemical rather than their own urine. There's a funny video of a man in India who is preparing products from cow urine. It's a very common folk remedy around the world. so there you go if you were if you don't fancy the idea of consuming your own urine you can use urea as a purified form did you okay I'm not too sure if the call is still there anyway that was the answer thank you for your question call I don't know if you can hear us still but I appreciate you calling in"

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if drinking one's own urine is a good way to get urea.

**RAY PEAT:** "The science shows that urea actually blocks, sorry, I was thinking about tumor necrosis factor, that was it, and curcuma, so in turmeric, it blocks the active compound curcumin blocks tumor necrosis factor and that is implicated in a lot of inflammatory conditions of which skin disorders and inflammatory bowel disease could be exacerbated or even caused by."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about urea's role in psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, mentioning curcumin's effect on TNF.

**RAY PEAT:** "One thing to consider when you have both bowel and skin symptoms is that the bowel is actually causing or contributing to the skin problem and eliminating gluten, for example. Sometimes there's both the bowel and skin problem because some of the enzymes are activated by inflammation that... cause the premature hardening and flakiness of the skin in psoriasis. That same process is activated by gluten and other inflammation-producing agents in the intestine. The process of psoriasis is an accelerated cell division which is probably caused by the over-hydration... and possibly a lack of the right balance of estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid and maybe a deficiency of vitamin A which is a restraining influence. Or vitamin D, right? Yeah, both vitamin D and A can restrain the rate of multiplication. And besides having a very fast cell division in psoriasis, it divides... quickly a few times and then prematurely ages and collapses into the flaky, horny, dry condition. And urea has been demonstrated to delay or prevent that premature hardening process by governing the expression of the genes so that the senility......producing proteins aren't produced so early and keeping the cell in a vital state longer and delaying both the replication and the premature aging."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on the connection between bowel and skin issues, and the mechanisms of psoriasis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, there are creams available on the internet, drugstores and so on, containing anything from 5% to 40% urea. So 40% is almost a concentrated solution and it's very effective for treating several... ichthyosis and psoriasis, various skin conditions and some doctors and pharmacists might tell you that it's used to remove toenails or to remove dead tissue and so on and so they all scare you and say that because you can remove calluses with it, it must be dangerous to good skin but... The 40% solutions are very soothing and therapeutic. It is now widely used for treating the skin inflammation of breast cancer patients who have been exposed to so much x-ray. The skin has been damaged and it prevents the inflammation and fibrosis produced by x-rays. And it's also... the topical skin creams are of urea are also very similar in action to how comfrey works with the allantoin."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the various ways urea can be administered, including topically.
