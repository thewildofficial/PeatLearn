**RAY PEAT:** My professors were teaching that he and others had shown to be profoundly wrong 20 years previously. And he answered, he said, you just don't understand what science is. Science is all about prestige and money.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes his early academic experiences and a pivotal correspondence.

**RAY PEAT:** I quickly realized that biology was exactly as unscientific as linguistics, philosophy, literature and so on. Ideology was right at the center of nerve biology.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his disillusionment with the scientific establishment during his PhD studies.

**RAY PEAT:** The whole thrust of tonight's show is not only to Bring out these scientists and their various different aspects of what they're looking at in science but to let people know that they can find out more about this movie that's being created by going to www.perceivethinkact so perceive think act is the main link dot com dot com of course you can just put that perceive think act in a google search term and google search bar it'll take you straight to their website and you'll be able to see what they're the work that they're doing.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat introduces the documentary project and its website.

**RAY PEAT:** May Wan Ho is, to a great degree, an extension of some of Albert St. George's ideas.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat connects May Wan Ho's work to Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi's concepts.

**RAY PEAT:** The rainbow and the worm. Oh, and the worm. Okay. Got it. Okay. And that also, those findings to her that connected with criticisms against neo-Darwinism as well. If the organism is not fundamentally so mechanistic and much more fluidic and subtle, then it would support, lay support to the theories more, you know, in line with Sidney Fox and others.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses May Wan Ho's book and its implications for challenging neo-Darwinism.

**RAY PEAT:** The crux of his work is his criticisms of traditional microscopy as well as the use of the electron microscope, in that most of the structures we see... when we're looking through them are artifacts and this is because of the processing that the what was once living material has to go through and and you know it would make your head spin hearing him list all of the things that you know the dehydration dying smashing and what you're left with is something that that bears almost no resemblance to an actual living cell so then how can you learn about the living cell when what you're looking at is basically artifacts.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains Harold Hillman's critique of microscopy techniques.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, he made a film go ahead sorry on youtube there's a old films of his that you can watch and it's still it's pretty pertinent today it's really simple which is what i think makes his criticisms so inflammatory is he just shows the side by side of it cell being prepared for microscope slide and you've got the living cell on one side looking like a transparent blob and then after it goes through all of the steps of being you know washed in alcohol and various other compounds it's like about the third the size and all squashed and squiggly looking.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on Harold Hillman's visual demonstrations of microscopy artifacts.

**RAY PEAT:** There was a famous Swedish electron microscopy expert named Fritjof Sjostrand who did a lot of very clear explanation using different fixatives showing how profound the artifacts are in the standard preparations and he was a mainstream researcher but the mainstream simply overlooked his work on the artifacts.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat references Fritjof Sjostrand's work on microscopy artifacts.

**RAY PEAT:** Everything he's been doing in recent years is just extremely interesting he has Developed some theories on how light energy infrared is used in In a building structure in water And there's a young German named Andre Sommer, S-O-M-M-E-R, who is working with red light structuring water. Very similar and very concrete demonstration of what, on a bigger scale, Patterson, Gerald is working on.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses Gerald Pollack's work on structured water and its connection to infrared light and Andre Sommer's research.

**RAY PEAT:** So is that. Some of the reason why red light is so anti-inflammatory because of its effects on the water of the cell.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat speculates on the anti-inflammatory effects of red light through its influence on cellular water.

**RAY PEAT:** Gilbert Ling showed that even if you turn off the energy supply, the cell is stable for many hours. The sodium keeps going in and going out, but the cell retains the life-like imbalance between sodium and potassium and all of the... life-like properties don't require energy, they simply require the structure of the water and the whole living system.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains Gilbert Ling's findings on cellular stability without continuous energy input, emphasizing the role of water structure.

**RAY PEAT:** And there are just apparently an infinite number of ways of looking at that that confirm Gilbert Ling's view, but the absurd... the need to see things in this......mechanical way makes people overlook the facts and believe absurd things.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat criticizes the prevailing mechanistic view in biology that leads to the dismissal of Gilbert Ling's work.

**RAY PEAT:** In an electron microscope course that I took, I decided to try different fixatives. I had read Shostrins, some of his publications, and simply by using a different fixative, my cells were nothing but membranes. Membranes all the way through, so I looked at the origin of how they got the first membrane and in an old medical book, 19th century ideas, I saw that doctors treated ulcers and burns with osmic acid, osmic tetroxide, to create what they called the false membrane. And that was a standard medical term, so it was in the consciousness of the people who were working on cells. And the first preparations for electron microscopy of cells showed no membranes at all. But they believed that there had to be membranes. And apparently someone recalled that old medical concept of creating a false membrane to seal up a wound. And they applied osmic acid to living cells and created, in fact, a membrane which was about ten times thicker than they eventually decided they needed. So they refined the technique. Now they have approximately the right thickness of membrane. And just how they've never been able to find one of their hundreds of pumps that they've... invented. And anytime there's a new thing that goes in and out of the cell, they have to create a new pump, add a new pump to the list?
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat recounts his personal experiments with fixatives and the historical development of the cell membrane concept, linking it to the idea of a "false membrane" created with osmic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** If you wash all of the ions out of hair and dip hair in the serum, it picks up the proper ions and excludes sodium. So apparently dead hair has all of the necessary pumps. The working pumps.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat uses the example of hair to illustrate the concept of cellular ion transport without active pumps.

**RAY PEAT:** My interest in fields I went way back my brother was a radio ham and had a lot of electronic equipment that I from I guess the age of nine or so I had the opportunity to play with and and so the uh electrical properties of all of my acquaintances seeing how aging affected the conductivity and so on kept me constantly aware of the electrical magnetic properties of organisms.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains his early fascination with the electrical and magnetic properties of living organisms.

**RAY PEAT:** And in 1968 I went to Russia largely to talk to a man working in what he called magnetobiology okay as opposed to bio magnetics he concentrated on the effects of fields on organisms rather than the fields produced by the organisms and one of my very first experiments at the university after I got back was with a strong magnet that my brother made for me and looking at its effect on a crab nerve and I could see that just the presence of a strong magnetic field apparently affected I interpreted it as affecting the structure of the water the latent period there was a delay between stimulation and reaction in the presence of a magnetic field.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes his trip to Russia to study magnetobiology and his early experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on crab nerves.

**RAY PEAT:** I also I interpreted it as affecting the structure of the water paid attention to the fields that I produced electrical fields that would some of the things like a millivolt meter I couldn't operate because my field would from about a foot away they would go off scale so my lab partner had to handle the knobs on those things So it's all very interesting actually practical experimentation showing that fields do not just subtly but grossly affect nerve impulses and or electric activity in the body.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat details his observations of how his own electrical fields interfered with sensitive measuring equipment, demonstrating the significant impact of fields on biological systems.

**RAY PEAT:** That's been a lot of the basis for your outcry against radiation and x-rays and all the other visualization techniques that are used in medicine as being very harmful. Very subtle fields have a very big effect Organisms.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat connects his understanding of fields to his concerns about the harmful effects of medical radiation and imaging techniques.

**RAY PEAT:** The Trans fats normally occur in butter as an intermediate stage and the The conjugated linoleic acid is the next step in shifting the unsaturation and the very beneficial effects of conjugated linoleic acid I think are because they block some of the toxic effects of the normal linoleic acid and other polyunsaturated fats. So, even though cow's milk and butter contain some chance... fats, they also contain the beneficial next step to the conjugated form of unsaturated fat.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the natural occurrence of trans fats in butter and the beneficial role of conjugated linoleic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** Dr. Kumaro's criticism is more about the artificially created trans fats. Yeah. Rather than the naturally growing in dairy another one. He's got nothing against butter. Yeah, he likes butter. Yeah. It's all about the wholesale production then of trans fats and pumping those into the food chain.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies that Dr. Kummerow's objections are to industrially produced trans fats, not those naturally found in dairy.

**RAY PEAT:** Danny Roddy, his main focus is on hair loss, specifically. But he's, I think, probably read almost anything that is available that Ray has written, ever.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat describes Danny Roddy's expertise and extensive knowledge of his work.

**RAY PEAT:** Ray's work, it kind of puts all of these people into a paradigm that all make sense together into a much more holistic view. And really, what is the worth of all of this scientific inquiry if you can't apply it practically to people's health and nutrition? And I think that's where nearly everyone we've interviewed somewhat misses the mark in that they don't think about it that way. They don't think, well, how does this apply to me? They're looking down the microscope.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how his work integrates the findings of various scientists into a holistic and practically applicable framework for health.

**RAY PEAT:** And I also think that Dr. Pete helps people take their health into their own hands and he encourages them and gets them to start looking at what do you feel like after you eat that food or what do you feel like after you do that and that is so important because we can we are the ones that know ourselves the best and a doctor teaching a patient to do that is... very, very contrary to the authoritarian medical system we have today.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat highlights his approach of empowering individuals to understand their own bodies and health responses, contrasting it with the authoritarian medical system.

**RAY PEAT:** Well the bits that I've seen it's very much fun to watch those people um I had seen I spoke briefly to Gilbert Ling in 1971. But it's good to see the newer stuff about him and the others.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat comments on the documentary footage, expressing enjoyment and noting the value of seeing updated information on the scientists he knows.
