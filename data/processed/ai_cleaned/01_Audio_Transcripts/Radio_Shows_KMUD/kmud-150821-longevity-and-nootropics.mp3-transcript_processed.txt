**RAY PEAT:** Well, birds have a very high body temperature. And so, probably have extremely fast digestion and ability to extract everything good from the food, taking it away from potential bacteria. So, it's just so fast that bacteria don't have much of a chance at multiplying. And, incidentally, besides being very long-lived, those birds are extremely intelligent, can solve extremely complex problems very quickly. There's a lot of stuff on the internet, videos about birds solving problems. So I think cognition and longevity go closely together. When you cause animals to live, to grow up their whole life free of bacteria, they have some advantage in stress resistance and have a somewhat increased average life span. A high metabolic rate, a lot of the stuff produced by the bacteria ends up simply slowing metabolism and the aging process itself right from earliest life is a process of slowing the metabolic rate, so things that retard that slowing should extend life span as well as good cognition.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the observation that parrots and ravens, known for their longevity, have a less diverse intestinal bacterial population, what is the metabolic explanation for this correlation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, puberty especially. It gradually slows down. When a calf is born, for example, it's fats. All through its body, including its brain, are highly saturated because the mother has been saturating the fats from the food. And so it's protected from the environment. And as its tissues absorb the polyunsaturated fats, its metabolism slows down. And you can see it in the ruminants because they start life extremely free of polyunsaturates, but human babies are, according to some fat experts, everyone is born deficient in the essential fatty acids and so they advocate putting more of them in baby formula. But actually those are major things in slowing the metabolic rate and they tend to accumulate in the brain with aging, slowing metabolism, especially the ability to metabolize glucose all the way to carbon dioxide so that the old or demented brain has a chronically high level of lactic acid because it has progressively lost the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide. And a lot of polyunsaturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that a baby's metabolism slows as it absorbs polyunsaturated fats. Can you elaborate on how these fats affect metabolism and the brain, and why babies might be considered "deficient" in them?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's why babies are born with a so-called fatty acid deficiency, but that's a natural thing. The baby makes its brain fats out of the glucose or fructose that it's getting from the mother.

**CONTEXT:** The placenta seems to filter out polyunsaturated fats. Is this a natural process, and what are the implications for infant nutrition?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, what about bloodletting? Bloodletting? Aren't blood donors have an increased, don't blood donors have an increased lifespan? Well, they have a lower iron, don't they? Yeah, at least a healthy lifespan. I'm not sure about the maximum, but they are relatively free of the degenerative diseases. And animal experiments have been done now for 75 years as one of the simple dilution experiments where they took out a dog's blood, centrifuged it, threw away the liquid part, put a saline solution back in to replace the red blood cells, and did that repeatedly so that there were enough washings that the whole animal's body fluids had been turned over and exchanged. A decrepit old dog of, I think, something close to 20 years became frisky and really effectively rejuvenated.

**CONTEXT:** Considering the idea of diluting blood serum or lymph to remove toxins and potentially increase lifespan, what is the scientific basis for this, and have there been any experimental validations?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the bowel toxins are always entering the blood and having to be removed by the kidneys, but they poison not only the kidneys, but the heart and the brain and the liver and the intestine in the process of of being filtered out and so the blood contains some of these toxins, including the normal lactic acid and phosphate simply in excess, as well as the specific bacterial toxins, but also as these toxins affect the various tissues and organs, the body produces defensive reactions and these defensive reactions including the pituitary hormones become part of the toxic environment circulating in the fluids and so the shift away from circulating renewal signals produced by the animal becomes gradually with the age circulating of stress signals rather than the renewal signals and and so if you put young blood into an old animal you're causing a slight shift back towards some of the renewal signals but you aren't necessarily decreasing the age and stress signals so and that's very much like a bystander effect as well.

**CONTEXT:** How do circulating toxins, including excess lactic acid and phosphate, contribute to the aging process and the shift from renewal signals to stress signals in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah, definitely. It's the same process that happens in the bystander effect when you injure a cell or a particular region for example with a beam of focused ionizing radiation x-raying your your foot or hand or tooth or whatever that tissue emits the signals which are the same as the aging and stress signals and so the radiation damage is very similar to the process of aging and the intrinsic regulatory processes instead of being increasing your ability to adapt they start narrowing the way you're adapting and it creates a vicious circle, for example, in which something interferes with your oxidation and in reaction that leads to lactic acid production instead of carbon dioxide. And the lactic acid is one of the toxins that turns on the production of nitric oxide, which spreads inflammatory signals and blocks the ability to use oxygen. So you get a in that case it's a very quick feedback process in which it just gets worse and worse. Unless something intervenes to either stop the production of lactic acid or nitric oxide.

**CONTEXT:** You've drawn a parallel between radiation damage and aging. Can you explain how this "bystander effect" and the resulting vicious cycle of impaired oxidation, lactic acid, and nitric oxide production contribute to accelerated aging?

**RAY PEAT:** The September issue of Life Extension magazine has an article I've mentioned on their cover how to increase your nitric oxide, and it gives a several page article describing their product that contains some very nice flavonoid compounds extracted from oranges or something. But the theory that they use to sell them is that they will increase your nitric oxide. And they give two references saying that. And so I looked up that subject, what Hesperidin does to nitric oxide. And I found, I don't know, I think it was probably 30 or 40 articles saying that these are anti-inflammatory because they block nitric oxide. So they got it. So people will feel better using them, but they're selling them. It's an increasing nitric oxide when you find it's in the opposite.

**CONTEXT:** There's a common misconception about nitric oxide's role in health. Can you clarify its actual function and address the misinformation being spread by some publications regarding its enhancement?

**RAY PEAT:** The current and the last 20 years popular medical approach to treating Alzheimer's disease is to try to increase the level of production or persistence of acetylcholine by blocking the enzyme that breaks it down and they've demonstrated basically that it doesn't work and so they need a new fundamental theory but their theory is so mistaken that it's hard for them to get off onto a new line of drug treatment because the acetylcholine it's essential and part of our conscious regulating it's needed for memory all kinds of biological processes require just the right amount of acetylcholine but it activates the enzyme that produces nitric oxide and nitric oxide blocks energy production and so the process of excitotoxicity which it made monosodium glutamate notorious because a little too much of that activates the production of a little too much acetylcholine and that makes too much nitric oxide. Nitric oxide poisons the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide. So it increases lactic acid and the cell has less energy and is more excited by the acetylcholine. So basically it becomes susceptible to dying in proportion to the overstimulation of acetylcholine.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the popular approach to Alzheimer's treatment focusing on acetylcholine, what is the fundamental flaw in this strategy, and how does acetylcholine's interaction with nitric oxide contribute to neurotoxicity?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, sure. The amino acids all have to get into the brain to provide brain proteins and such. And it's just one of our normal amino acids, but too much of it becomes toxic or too little of the other amino acids and a relative disproportion of glutamic acid. So aspartic acid and cysteine are the other potential nerve toxins. Again, by increasing acetylcholine, which increases nitric oxide, blocks oxygen metabolism of glucose.

**CONTEXT:** Can monosodium glutamate (MSG) cross the blood-brain barrier, and how does its interaction with acetylcholine and nitric oxide lead to excitotoxicity and impaired glucose metabolism in the brain?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, actually, I think the tendency with ageing is to have too much. The shock reaction is, for over a hundred years now, there's been evidence that overactivity of the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nerve system produces shock, that it's the essential factor in shock. And this is the system that acts primarily through acetylcholine, producing nitric oxide. Nitric oxide blocks oxygen metabolism, so in shock your blood stays red and full of oxygen, which if you can't use it. And that happens with aging, heart failure, kidney failure, dementia. All the tissues relatively have a shock-like metabolism that progresses with aging.

**CONTEXT:** Is it possible that aging is associated with an overactivity of acetylcholine and the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to a shock-like metabolic state?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there are lots of therapeutic uses of things that block the overactivity of acetylcholine and accelerate its turnover. A rich environment increases the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.

**CONTEXT:** Are there therapeutic benefits to increasing the breakdown of acetylcholine, and does an enriched environment play a role in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, having a good life. Protects you against too much. Protects you against lots of aging problems, right? Well, you have to clarify the term good life. We don't mean that. We don't mean drinking and partying and No, no. Having lots of fun, reading interesting things, talking to interesting people. Yeah, and having an interesting job to do and interesting work and liking your job. Not because it pays you well, but because you're fundamentally interested in it, which is what you should always pursue in your life, don't you?

**CONTEXT:** You suggest that "having a good life" can protect against aging problems. How do you define a "good life" in this context, and how does it relate to physiological well-being?

**RAY PEAT:** Learned helplessness is a matter of imprinting, turning off the genes that should enliven you, increase your adaptability. Too much methylation shuts things down, makes you helpless and that process happens progressively with aging. Too much methylation turns off the themes of renewal. And there are lots of products pushing the idea that we need more methylation. One of the main methyl donors is methionine, the amino acid. And if you deprive animals of a major part, I forget the exact percentage, but half or less of their normal methionine, they live 30 or 40 percent longer than they would otherwise.

**CONTEXT:** How does learned helplessness relate to methylation and gene expression, and what is the impact of methionine restriction on lifespan?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the high protein foods like meat.

**CONTEXT:** What are common food sources that are high in methionine?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, gelatin is unique in being free of the pro-aging amino acids. And another bad thing about meat is it's very high ratio of phosphates and calcium.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that gelatin is free of pro-aging amino acids and that meat has a high ratio of phosphates to calcium. How do these factors contribute to the overall health impact of consuming meat versus gelatin?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what Environmental enrichment. An enriched environment gives you the opportunity to have adventure every day. Allows your brain to grow and to seek new opportunities and limitless potentials, that's what life should be all about.

**CONTEXT:** How does environmental enrichment foster "adventuresomeness" and contribute to brain growth and the pursuit of new opportunities?

**RAY PEAT:** Heart rate corresponding with academic standing in elderly patients improved when their pacemaker was turned up. They noticed that people with a faster heart rate had higher academic records and they thought maybe it was just a better brain circulation. People with a very slow heart rate weren't getting enough oxygen to their brain so they had patients with the adjustable pacemakers and so they gave them mental tests when it was set at 70 beats per minute. And then they turned up the rate to 85 beats per minute, gave them the same tests and they scored better in all types of brain function, memory, reasoning. Low heart rate corresponds with longevity because it's the opposite. It's the bodybuilders that live a long time, not the long distance runners.

**CONTEXT:** Is there a correlation between heart rate and cognitive function, particularly in elderly individuals, and what do studies on pacemakers suggest about the benefits of increased heart rate?

**RAY PEAT:** Sage has um i'm not sure how it relates to other drug effects but that that is one of its components actions is to shift the balance to increased acetylcholine action. But two of its major terpene type chemicals are inhibitors of nitric oxide, salveonolic acid I think one is called and the other a Chinese or Japanese name cashia known something like that. These are are very effective inhibitors of nitric oxide so they're anti-inflammatory and pro respiratory.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that sage has a choline esterase inhibiting property. How does this affect acetylcholine levels, and what are the roles of its terpene compounds, salveonolic acid and cashia, in inhibiting nitric oxide?

**RAY PEAT:** So is this why um it probably has an action with reducing menopausal hot flashes if it's reducing nitric oxide and nitric oxide does cause flushing and it's connected with hot flashes so I think the probably the dominant effect is to lower nitric oxide for the cholinesterase inhibitors will tend to increase nitric oxide by stimulating the acetylcholine nerves.

**CONTEXT:** Given that nitric oxide can cause flushing and is linked to menopausal hot flashes, could sage's ability to lower nitric oxide explain its effectiveness in reducing these symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** Ginkgo apparently decreases monoamine oxidase and that increases dopamine. Now I know they treat well unscientifically perhaps you might treat Alzheimer's patients with L-DOPA and dopamine might be touted as a precursor here as a as a product to do that with. It definitely makes you feel good it's sort of an upper to do anything that increases your your dopamine tends to increase adrenaline usually and certain types of mao inhibitors will increase serotonin too. It's not good those don't necessarily go with well-being the brain circulation for example is decreased by serotonin it tightens up the blood vessels especially the veins leaving the brain so if you have too much serotonin you can get brain congestion and a migraine for example with the arteries opening up the veins closing down so there might be serotonin inhibitors in ginkgo, but I think the most important benefit of ginkgo is that it's a very good nitric oxide inhibitor and also blocks platelet aggregating factor.

**CONTEXT:** What is Ginkgo Biloba's effect on monoamine oxidase and dopamine, and how does serotonin influence brain circulation and potentially contribute to conditions like migraines?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, okay. We're on the third Friday of each month and so until the third Friday of next month I'll say good night. Good night. Yes and good night and good evening and this is Carrie and I just wanted to jump in here at the end of your show to say a few thank yous that just came in. Thank you to this anonymous who said herb doctor info on the show is priceless. So thank you very much. Thank you for that. Yes and another thank you. People who listen to KMUD need to pledge. That's what Karen from Branscombe says. Thank you so much, Karen. That's the only thing that keeps the show going, right, is pledges. There's no state funding. The whole station is an independent station. It's a community radio station. I believe we get some funding, outside funding, but it's all from the I'm not sure. It's mostly, it's mostly just community support, absolutely. Which allows the radio show to be as unique as it is because perhaps there'd be more outside control. Right, we're completely independent that way. I mean like federal money to support the community radio station.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion touches on the importance of community support for independent radio. How does this model of funding contribute to the unique nature and independence of the programming?

**RAY PEAT:** Caffeine, if it's used properly, but a lot of people are thinking of caffeine as a legal version of crack cocaine. It shouldn't be used as speed, it should be used as a food. It should decrease nitric oxide exposure and so it should have anti-aging. But if you take it on an empty stomach, it will drop your blood sugar, turn on nitric oxide and cause aging stress. So have caffeine after you've had a big meal.

**CONTEXT:** How should caffeine be consumed to maximize its potential anti-aging benefits and avoid negative effects like blood sugar drops and increased nitric oxide production?

**RAY PEAT:** Korean ginseng, Panax ginseng is one of those things obviously that I think of along with Eleutherococcus and several other ginseng species.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned adaptogens, a term coined by Russian researchers. What are some examples of adaptogenic herbs, and what is their primary function in relation to stress resistance?
