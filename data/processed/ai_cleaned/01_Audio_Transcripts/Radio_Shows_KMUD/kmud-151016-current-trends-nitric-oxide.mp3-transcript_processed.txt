**RAY PEAT:** My dissertation in 1972 focused on estrogen, but I saw that the effects of estrogen were indistinguishable from the effects of x-rays and aging and oxygen deprivation. And how that works is that it changes the mitochondrial oxidative enzyme function, cytochrome oxidase. And it was known that smog produces nitric oxide. It wasn't known that it occurred naturally in the body until the late 80s. But the effects of nitric oxide in smog were known to inhibit or damage that same respiratory enzyme. And at the time I was studying estrogen, it was known that carbon monoxide and cyanide also blocked the effect of oxygen in the cell. And so no one really thought about what nitric oxide was doing to the cell except when they were exposed to a lot of smog. But as soon as it was discovered that it was produced in the body, a series of publications over the next six or seven years, up until the late 90s, identified the harm that it did in the various tissues. For example, several papers clearly showed how inflammation or stress increasing nitric oxide damages the insulin producing cells in the pancreas, and so it's a major cause of diabetes regardless of the particular person's history leading to the diabetes. So not only damaging the cells in the pancreas, but they were seeing similar damage to every tissue they looked at, which seems logical since it was a free radical analogous to cyanide and carbon monoxide in its function in the cell. But then someone noticed that nitric oxide causes vasodilation during arousal and erection, and Viagra came on the scene with tremendous amount of funding for research. This is about 15 years ago now. And suddenly all of the bad stuff was forgotten, and everyone wanted to find out the wonder curative effects of the drug that could improve virility. Similarly, and very soon after it came out, I started hearing from people who were suffering things such as diabetes from taking out of the virility pills. And that got me interested in it very, very early after the Viagra came on the market. But it was fitting right into the things that I was already interested in.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, given that we produce nitric oxide naturally, what useful effect does it have, and why do so many people believe it has negative effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Nitric oxide decreases the function of the tissue by blocking the energy production. So it creates a vicious circle in the same way too much estrogen can, or stress of any sort can start a cycle of energy loss, increased production of the stress mediators, including nitric oxide, exciting the tissue, blocking the energy of the tissue, and leading the cell to die.

**CONTEXT:** Of the things nitric oxide is touted for, is there any thread of truth to these statements?

**RAY PEAT:** Of the things you mentioned, it actually does one of those things, which is to make muscles grow. But that's one of the things that Santergi and Otto Warburg understood 50 years ago. Is that because of his inflammation? In the absence of oxygen, life can't do anything but grow and divide. And so anything that blocks the cytochrome c oxidase, blocking oxidative metabolism, tends to stimulate cell diffusion because that's all life can do on the lactic acid producing cycle. And experiments, both with nitric oxide supplement or creating the conditions such as cutting off the blood supply to cause muscle tissue to produce its own excess nitric oxide, they found that it stimulated the multiplication of cells in the muscle, the satellite cells surrounding the muscle fiber itself, multiply under the influence of nitric oxide or simply hypoxia leading to lactic acid production. So it's a very inflammatory process even though they're describing it as something that is wonderful. You'll increase your muscles if you take supplements that are precursors for nitric oxide production. Yeah, they found that you could cause muscle enlargement and growth just by putting a tourniquet on if you combined mild exercise with a tourniquet occasionally. Because of the oxygen deprivation? Yeah, really big muscle growth from injuring it. But that's the basic thing that cells divide like cancer when they don't have the energy to do what they should do. So it's a kind of negative response to that stimulation then? Yeah, so anytime you injure a tissue, whether it's in the brain or heart or blood vessel, pancreas, whatever, there are stem cells. The satellite cells and muscles are probably just the local stem cell which might be replenished from bone marrow, for example, but anyway they function as stem cells. So anytime a tissue is injured, the lack of oxygen temporarily stimulates multiplication of stem-like cells which have the potential of regenerating the tissue. So it's a natural process that that would happen to stimulate cell growth, but they're twisting it and saying that it's something good that it increases muscle growth. Well, it's always a local, more or less microscopic process when it's natural, but if you flood the system hoping to grow all of your muscles bigger, then you're also providing it to your brain, immune system, gonads, everything is being in effect deprived of oxygen.

**CONTEXT:** So drugs that increase nitric oxide would be classed as carcinogens then?

**RAY PEAT:** In fact, yeah, that's starting to be recognized. It's a very basic factor in promoting cancer development, growth, and spreading.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the vasodilatory effects that supposedly help people with blood pressure, is that completely erroneous science?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, no, it does that. Nitroglycerin was used for a long time to open up a heart artery, and you do increase the flow of blood by relaxing the arterioles. And the trouble is that if you increase it beyond a temporary dilation, it's going to start the damaging process of increasing collagen formation and cell multiplication and so on. So you can get a momentary effect from sniffing nitroglycerin, for example, as a chronic thing or a systemic thing, it's not at all good. In fact, it ages in a chronic situation, for example, for your intestine, if it's being irritated, irritable bowel syndrome, for example, or just mild digestive problems, you absorb both nitric oxide and endotoxin. And these, the endotoxin increases the production of nitric oxide everywhere, and in the blood vessels, the increased and chronic effect of nitric oxide is to promote thickening and atherosclerosis and hardening of the arteries.

**CONTEXT:** So, in fact, it's actually going to be worsening the condition you're taking it for, if you're taking it for blood pressure?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the momentary effect over minutes or hours can be helpful. Like, if you have a constricted area, the relaxation locally in that particular artery opens up, lets the blood flow. But if you do that systemically, all you're doing is adding to the chronic inflammation, stress, and degeneration of the arteries, heart, and all the other organs.

**CONTEXT:** The body should be producing a little bit of nitric oxide in that constricted artery, is what you're saying?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. When you have a local, like a pinch of an artery, the cells sense that they aren't getting enough oxygen, and in reaction to the stress, if nitric oxide is produced locally, it opens it up, lets the blood through the stress point. So it's like a local regulatory process, and it shouldn't ever be a systemic, generalized process for treating high blood pressure, for example. It's like when someone takes nitroglycerin. Um, yeah, all it's doing is releasing a momentary pinch in the heart, which could be good, I guess, for the heart, but systemically, it's, for example, one of the things that it does is to increase aldosterone, the adrenal salt regulating steroid that produces inflammation and fibrosis as a side effect.

**CONTEXT:** Aldosterone is also implicated for blood pressure regulation, isn't it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, too much aldosterone and you get high blood pressure. So the side effect of chronic nitric oxide can be exactly the opposite of what they're promoting.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned that anything that starts inflammation tends to spread nitric oxide, which not only breaks the strands of DNA but also changes the methylation. So the whole control system for expressing DNA in your chromosomes is altered under chronic excess of nitric oxide.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, just several years ago, radiation biologists were seeing that cells which were irradiated by x-rays or gamma rays emitted something which would cause apparent radiation damage in the neighborhood. So you could take the irradiated cells out of the culture dish, put new cells in, and they acted as if they had been irradiated. And nitric oxide has turned out to be a major transmitter of that effect. So it's like you're being irradiated, you do produce a lot of nitric oxide, and it spreads to adjoining cells. So anything that starts the inflammation tends to spread the nitric oxide, which not only breaks the strands of DNA but also changes the methylation. So the whole control system for expressing DNA in your chromosomes is altered under chronic excess of nitric oxide.

**CONTEXT:** What alternative to blood pressure medicines do you suggest?

**RAY PEAT:** If you look at the symptoms of chronic hypothyroidism, hypertension is one of the prominent things. A very large proportion of the people who think they have a high blood pressure problem are simply hypothyroid. The TSH itself, which rises when you're hypothyroid, even within the normal range, it's increasing your various stress hormones and increasing your blood pressure. So TSH is a pro-inflammatory factor and one of the factors causing hypertension. So you want to keep that low just for general health. So caller, you could ask your doctor for a test of TSH, and if it's above 0.4, then perhaps you can think about taking a thyroid supplement.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), what is your view on its etiology or treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** I've known several people who had it. One of my friends who was in his 80s when I visited him in Taluca, 8,500 feet altitude, he was blue in the face and just panting sitting down and didn't recognize me, his brain wasn't getting enough oxygen. And I gave his daughter some pregnenolone, progesterone, and thyroid to give to him a little bit every day. When I came back two weeks later, he was back at work up in his upper floor office without an elevator and took me around the city, making me pant. Just a dramatic improvement in oxygen absorption in his lungs.

**CONTEXT:** Is that how you would see that plausibly being a mechanism by which someone could regain their breath again?

**RAY PEAT:** High estrogen and nitric oxide are two things that can cause a leakage of fluid into the air sacs and a thickening of the pathway between the air and the capillary so that the air just has to, the oxygen has to pass through such a thick layer, it just isn't getting to the blood at a high enough concentration. And so that can. Pregnenolone alone seems to sometimes very quickly improve oxygenation.

**CONTEXT:** What would be a good recommended starting dose for pregnenolone, progesterone, and thyroid for someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?

**RAY PEAT:** With thyroid, you want to start very slowly because it increases your need for oxygen as well as improving the lung function. So it's good to start with pregnenolone, I think, which doesn't have any hormonal effect. It does help to prevent edema and swelling of the membranes. And the dose of pregnenolone doesn't really matter, you just don't want to take such a big dose that you're getting additives and contaminants. So 15, 20, 30 milligrams is often a therapeutic dose, but it's okay to take 100 or 300 milligrams if you know the stuff is clean. Right. Okay. With progesterone, same thing, 10 to 30 milligrams can make a big difference.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think about minocycline, which has been shown to lower the inducible form of nitric oxide and cytokines?

**RAY PEAT:** For several years, it's been recognized as a helpful factor for Alzheimer's disease and other brain problems. Is that just because it's blocking the endotoxin production? It blocks the nitric oxide production.

**CONTEXT:** Directly blocking the nitric oxide production?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, directly blocks the enzyme the way niacinamide does.

**CONTEXT:** What do you know about tetracycline?

**RAY PEAT:** It's in the same family, doxycycline, tetracycline, and minocycline. And tetracycline. The only problem with it is that it's too cheap, so doctors are not educated to...

**CONTEXT:** What do you have to say to somebody who's using growth hormone for muscle building?

**RAY PEAT:** You have the same problems that you get from nitric oxide or estrogen. Women, surprisingly, chronically, during the reproductive years, have a high growth hormone chronically. And the growth hormone causes a breakdown of fat and the free fatty acids. So women, under the influence of estrogen, typically have a chronic exposure to free fatty acids, which is, if they're unsaturated, increases oxidative damage. And that's just a standard function of growth hormone, is to raise your free fatty acids. And that's probably why they see an increased thickness in the wall of blood vessels in the kidneys, which is causing a progressive loss of kidney function from overexposure or chronic high exposure to growth hormone, and a suspicion that it increases the risk of diabetes, which free fatty acids aren't known to cause. So it's very inflammatory.

**RAY PEAT:** And also the supplements that are touted to increase nitric oxide, people want to avoid those, like arginine and citrulline.

**RAY PEAT:** The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has lowered it to 0.3 to 3.0. And a population of healthy people without thyroid cancer or other thyroid problems, they averaged 0.4 TSH or less without taking a high-range supplement, meaning that if you're anything over one or one and a half or getting anywhere closer to two, you definitely seem like you would benefit from using the hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the stress hormones will lower it too. So you can't really diagnose anything by TSH alone, even though that's how most doctors do it. Especially when someone who's low thyroid, they're usually running on excess adrenaline, and if excess adrenaline will lower the TSH and give you a false positive, then or false negative. And high cortisol lowers it, and also at the same time causes the liver to turn thyroxin into reverse T3, which interferes even more than thyroxin with the active T3 function. It blocks the real T3 from actually doing anything.

**RAY PEAT:** One of the effects of good thyroid function is to lower nitric oxide. Nitric oxide, contrary to the advertising, can increase pressure inside your eye. And so hypothyroidism can create enough nitric oxide to cause symptoms such as hardening of the eye, increasing the pressure.

**RAY PEAT:** Cortisol increases the pressure in the eye. So it's possible that you were still producing too much cortisol relative to the protective pregnenolone, progesterone, and such.

**RAY PEAT:** Niacinamide does just about everything protective. It protects nerve cells against nitric oxide's damaging effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Aspirin, if you take vitamin K, is safe up to several grams a day, but usually with two doses of 500 milligrams you get pretty good systemic protection. And vitamin K, incidentally, is in several ways helping to hold down nitric oxide production.

**RAY PEAT:** It's probably safe up to a thousand milligrams a day, but I've only had experience seeing people take about three or four doses of 125 milligrams each dose, so a total of two to five hundred milligrams a day can do really dramatic things for curing nerve degeneration and such.

**RAY PEAT:** Methylene blue would certainly be a reasonable approach. If somebody had chronic inflammation, that would most likely be due to excessive nitric oxide production in that tissue. Yeah, at first I would try it. Aspirin, niacinamide, and progesterone as the most physiological.

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping your body temperature up does help you oxidize fat safely. And when you said that about the cold pigs having much worse fat stores, it reminds me of have you heard of this brown fat and these guys that they go into freezers and take cold showers and things and they try to increase their stores of brown fat and what the reason they do that is it burns off all of their white fat. I think keeping your thyroid function up is better because the cold activates a variety of stress hormones that cause some side effects besides just getting rid of the fat. To oxidize your fats while at rest by having a good resting metabolic rate and high body temperature is the safest way to handle them rather than increase the stress to increase the fat burning.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the main problem is that doctors are taught that the TSH normal range is something like 0.4 to 5.0, but that number has been decreasing. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has lowered it to 0.3 to 3.0. And a population of healthy people without thyroid cancer or other thyroid problems, they averaged 0.4 TSH or less without taking a high-range supplement, meaning that if you're anything over one or one and a half or getting anywhere closer to two, you definitely seem like you would benefit from using the hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think most of the, it's unfortunate, but it's like another cult, and unfortunately males are a little bit seduced by the potential of growing bigger muscles using anabolic steroids and other compounds, and so obviously growth hormone again is advertised very widely in bodybuilding magazines.

**RAY PEAT:** It's unfortunate. And also the supplements that are touted to increase nitric oxide, people want to avoid those, like arginine and citrulline.
