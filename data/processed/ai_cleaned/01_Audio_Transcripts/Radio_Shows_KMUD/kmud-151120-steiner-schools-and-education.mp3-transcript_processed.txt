**RAY PEAT:** I studied humanities as an undergraduate and eventually went to graduate school in biology. Although linguistics and painting had been most of my previous study and since graduating with a PhD in biology I've done a lot of counselling in nutrition and general health issues.
**CONTEXT:** Would you just give an out-ground of your academic and professional background before I ask you the first question here?

**RAY PEAT:** It was very directly related to everything I did before and after. I had been a critical consumer of education right from the first grade. I knew how to read when I went to school and so I didn't take it very seriously when they went through their routines. My third, fourth and fifth grade experience was exceptional. In a one-room country school where there were eight grades in one room, so that made it more interesting and it was completely unregimented. And I think that gave me the idea that maybe kids would do better in a freer learning environment. My college experience, I found that there were only like two or three professors that knew anything that I wanted to learn. And my first teaching experience confirmed me in the belief that the institution tended to be an impediment to learning. The trustees had their idea of what the students should do with their lives, and the students and teachers' interests really were antagonistic to the trustees and as a result of that I got the idea of starting a school in Mexico where we could be somewhat beyond the reach of the trustees and government types who wanted to tell us what we couldn't study and talk about.
**CONTEXT:** In terms of your work, your life's work in education and academics, would you want to mention anything about a college that you were part of at one time?

**RAY PEAT:** 1961. I had been reading and studying William Blake's work, and so I named the school Blake College. And the idea was that we would incorporate it, but the students and teachers would be the only trustees. And so there would be no curriculum. Students could bring up topics they wanted to study. Instructors could offer courses. Students didn't have to attend. Just complete independence. But everyone was interested in something. And we had the idea that since the students would use their bachelor's degree to go on for a master's or PhD, that the requirement for getting the degree should be passing the graduate record exam that students normally have to take to qualify for graduate school.
**CONTEXT:** What year was this?

**RAY PEAT:** It's a very standardized system. At that time they had both advanced tests in specialized fields and a general area test. And we said that if a student would be able to pass at the 87th percentile of American college graduates level on that test, that they could have their degree because practically any graduate school in the country would be willing to have someone who scored in the upper 12 percentile. As it turned out, students generally chose to take that exam after being there only a few months, six or seven or eight months, and their average was over the 90th percentile. No one flunked the test. You could see the process happening, people would come thinking that they needed to be structured somehow. But what they learned was that they were full of knowledge and what their business would be to structure reality for themselves to make sense of what they already knew and use that orientation to then ask questions about what they really wanted to learn. And so they could use any resources that we had. They could ask anyone of the teachers to help them find the resources or figure out the problems. And you could just see a very quick change in their sense of confidence.
**CONTEXT:** As opposed to what they learned while they were in that place for that amount of time, that enabled them to then score highly?

**RAY PEAT:** No, some of them had been flunkouts at the state universities and such. A couple of them had even scored poorly on standardized tests and thought they were idiots. And when they had the opportunity not to be imposed upon and to be able to talk to other students and teachers, they realized how much they knew and could think about what they knew and who they were. And you could see the change from someone who felt helpless, coming around to seeing themselves as a responsible citizen, having all the abilities that anyone has.
**CONTEXT:** And then they went on to score 90% in the college entrance exams?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they varied from around 90th percentile up to about 98th percentile.
**CONTEXT:** And did they get accepted into...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some of the state schools simply having that high score wasn't enough, so some of them had to go to private graduate schools, but all of the good schools let them in on the basis of their scores.
**CONTEXT:** Without having had their previous bachelor's or master's.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, you see that the theory of what an organism is is related to the theory of education. And what they're doing is based on an authoritarian social system that's based on the mechanical conception of what the person is. And the progress of biological knowledge in the last 50 years has illuminated some of the problems with the theory of education that the brain is the body's energy organizing system. And if you have education that conflicts with the body's own processes, you're going to impair the body's energy system, lead to a reduction of ability, create a tendency to lack adaptability in biological as well as mental processes.
**CONTEXT:** Are you speaking about, like, children being forced to sit for eight hours a day? Energetic children?

**RAY PEAT:** There have been studies, for example, in New York City, kids were given an IQ test every year that they were in grade school. And they saw these slum kids coming in with an average IQ. And each year their scores would get lower as they spent the year sitting in school. And with our students at Blake, just the opposite happened very quickly. They would come out of their oppression and realize that they were creative minds, not just passive learners. And that same process was discovered 50 years ago in rat studies. The rat that was given an entertaining free environment became more intelligent, grew a bigger brain with a thicker cortex, and their offspring would have a bigger brain and be more intelligent.
**CONTEXT:** So it could be inherited, passed on to the...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and so the students who are being impaired by bad public schools are actually probably passing it on to generations of oppressed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, we called it a student-centered education, following on Carl Rogers' client-centered therapy. He used a non-directive approach of empathy with the client. And in our non-curriculum, the sense of empathy was really the guiding principle. The teachers and students tried to understand each other, and they together created questions that none of them had thought about before. So the empathy tried to listen to the character or personality of the other person, which would, if you had them categorized according to humors and such, that would be a way of organizing that process. With our small group, it was truly individual, adaptive, empathetic approach.
**CONTEXT:** What do you think about that?

**RAY PEAT:** The students were taught to observe and depict the scientific concepts in their own words and drawings rather than encountering these ideas first through textbooks and that the students that came out of Steiner schools were shown to be, well the Steiner schools were shown to have an above average number of students that became doctors, engineers, scholars of the humanities and scientists because they were able to investigate the world about them in a far more objective and scientific manner than school taught students perhaps who would have been rote taught by rote or um you know to repeat repetition without or memory or memory yeah without truly applying their own basis for understanding a concept in their own terms.
**CONTEXT:** The um typical professor has his understanding of how a student's brain works and they think they have to impose their abstractions on such the science textbook idea that the professor has assimilated they think they have to impose that on the student's brain but the actuality of a student's brain and personality is analogous to any organism a simple mammal, for example, understands physics very well birds, crows in particular, are very intelligent and can figure out physical processes and make predictions many graduate students in physics wouldn't understand they can predict that if you left me out on that rock the day before it might be there the next day at the same time okay so uh then the other the other notable point then about um steiner education i'll ask you the question about some of the previous history of uh how state education came into being because i don't want i'm not sitting here making an argument against state education and purely illuminating the alternatives as always and looking at the holistic side of all sorts of things and education is one of them but um from uh from a steiner perspective the uh they were looking at the the main thing was the method of inquiry and how this strengthened the interest in the ability to observe and that was the main The main fundamental guide that every student being very different an individual would have unique ideas and unique talents That they could bring to bear on the science because it was a very it wouldn't say was is It's a very science-based rational education.

**RAY PEAT:** I think perhaps when I first heard the word Steiner I kind of thought well, there was a pretty loose kind of hippie education where you could just sit around and I don't know bake cakes and play games and perhaps, I don't know, play music and it wasn't particularly intelligent, but it's actually the opposite, it's very true, that given the individual's creative ability in an environment where they're not stressed, they're not forced to perform and they're not forced to, you know, compete, which I think does lead to a lot of suppression of expression and certainly in individuals that are not naturally competitive, because we're not all naturally competitive, but everyone's so very different that these people, given the sense to inquire and find the natural world wonderful, which I think is an excellent, excellent example of how to teach people to show that the natural world is an excellent tutor in its own right, and that's how I think it plays into biodynamic cultivation and that whole philosophy of giving back to the earth for want of a better phrase but to not just take away but to give back and to build up and support and sustain and and all these kind of cool hip terms that we hear now as a just a part of being hip is just a very real part of being a conscious human being so in terms of getting them to cultivate this sense of meaningful wholeness of nature. Where the person wasn't separated from it or alienated from it, that would enable them to get a better grasp of concepts that them individually as free-thinking people could bring to the table that perhaps would not be thought of or borne out in regular teaching environments.
**CONTEXT:** So what do you think about the whole thing about from the ages of three to seven there's no... There is no pressure whatsoever to learn ABCs and to learn you know facts and figures and rudimentary education but that the child is to be immersed in that environment of nature where they're to look at nature with awe and to you know get into gardening and you know learn about animals and create that whole side of their you know their being before they do anything structured with math and science.

**RAY PEAT:** I think as well they don't read till they're ten. On average I think that's when they start to teach them to read. In my experience I saw people reading and talking about things they saw in the newspapers and so I just spontaneously wanted to see what they were doing and had nothing to do with curriculum or being taught. That's what I did. I wanted to find out what was so interesting and at the Summerhill School started by A.S. Neal in England in I think around the late 1920s it started and it was finally recognized in the 1960s by universities and such. Really having achieved something in education, he had no curriculum at all. Students could stay there for 12 years if they wanted and not study. But the ones who did stay there and graduate were superior in their achievement to those who had gone through taking classes every day for 12 years. That's it. They demonstrated that the curriculum is completely unnecessary. If the student is aware that there is something to learn, they can learn it just in a flash compared to what the schools expect of them.
**CONTEXT:** I know, didn't you tell me, Dr. Pete, one time that you learned to read, like you were saying, watching people read the newspaper, and so you learned to read because you wanted to read the comics?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the funnies were the first thing. Alley Oop and Smokey Stover and such were my favorites. But then my parents had a shoebox full of the little blue books, classics that were printed in a very small size. And then the newspapers, I wanted to hear what was going on with the war, so I learned the various types of things that were available.
**CONTEXT:** And what year was that? Or how old were you?

**RAY PEAT:** Four.

**RAY PEAT:** The state schools that educate our children obviously have their own agendas and I think you can see this a lot in some of the subjects that are born out taught in schools and this comparative analysis with homeschooled children and how the actual how the rise of state education came into being to become the kind of totalitarian the totalitarian source of education in many other countries I read that there was at one point in time the concept of education by the government for the children of the people the government was helping or whatever you want to call it supporting was because at one point in time there weren't both of the both of the parents of children didn't work it's typically in the olden days the woman would stay at home and be the homemaker take care of the home take care of the children would then ultimately school them and or get together in groups why the male person was the person who did the physical hard work works on the farm etc whatever and did all those kind of things to bring food in and you know just keep the house keep the household going but that taxation came into play in the early early 40s federal taxation which made it actually very financially unsound to have just one person working and actually caused the cause and need for two people to be working in order to make ends meet and that actually the children were then left as the question well we'll educate the children for you so you just come to work and pay more taxes but without getting too political about it I know there is a true case in point for having that freedom of choice and that actually it's just not even thought about these days do you have any anything to say about that in terms of being an educator or looking at it from a perspective of where it was and where it's come to now in terms of not really having uh well i guess we do have a free choice if home schools do exist here in america um and i think the state can set the uh curriculum to a great extent even in homeschooling okay and the um federal government approves the agencies that accredit high schools and colleges and universities and so the um There are private accrediting agencies which really are responsible to no one. They are kind of an abstract authority that the citizens can't affect directly. The government approves them because they meet the government ideological standards apparently. And the state bureaucracies are set up so that no school can grant degrees or credits or transcripts if they don't conform to those accrediting agencies. So really the power to grant a transcript or a degree is pretty much a matter of mind control unless people realize that there is reality and then there's the official curriculum. My experience in grade school and high school was just not to pay too much attention to them. In high school some of our teachers were openly fascists and and Hitler worshipers, racists and such, and so it was just a matter of getting through it without having to interact too much with them.
**CONTEXT:** I mean I hear this from you a lot when you're either talking to me or on the radio show. In terms of the way that you think, the way that you conceptualize, the way that you bring to life concepts that you won't find in mainstream medical journals, in mainstream government type research that you won't find typically in any abundance unless you're just looking for the independent research that is available and you can find on the web and or the research that you're looking for. that's being done by PhD students when they're writing their papers for submission for peer review etc. do get published in terms of that free thinking that brings about that lack of control that lack of dominance in the direction of the thinking I know that you've had a lot a lot of personal experiences with that you mentioned that when you were studying that most of your professors didn't even really understand what it was you were trying to get across to them that you had read and when you'd studied the papers that were in the libraries that since were withdrawn that you had a very different way of looking at it that they were completely dumbfounded by because it was not typical rote just repeat repetitive kind of yeah not facts but repetitive statements poor science the system not only the explicit accrediting process and agencies and curriculum but the official high high status publications the journals publishing houses because all of all of the major institutions have ulterior motives right and you have to look for people who are motivated by reality. Remember a few years ago someone in the White House said your problem is that you belong to the reality-based community. Problem? Well we're creating a new reality. You're studying the old one. The concept of a reality-based community was officially in the White House at that time of futile outsider business that was being left behind. But I think there is really a possibility still in the reality-based community.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I hope so.

**RAY PEAT:** No. There were good textbooks published periodically many years ago, but in the last 10 or 20 years, even the textbooks that were good have been revised under the name of the good author. Now, most textbooks are created by committees that look for the professors who have the biggest classes, preferably professors who have 400 or 500 students in each class, and they say something nice in the textbook about the work of that professor, and that means that every time they flatter a professor, they sell an extra 500 books at $100 profit each. So the textbooks become really a matter of profit for the publisher rather than information for the student.
**CONTEXT:** Do you have any specific textbook suggestions?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. I'm not sure which one I was referring to, but there are some good ones from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. I have a little handbook of physiology from, I think, 1965 that has the basic information and doesn't have the stuff on membrane pumps and channels and so on, which is misleading a lot of present students.
**CONTEXT:** But Dr. McDonough, didn't you recommend a physiology textbook one time that was published maybe in the... 50s or 60s?

**RAY PEAT:** No, that was biological abstracts, which had references to international journals, all fields related to biology. And when I would compare Index Medicus, which was the paper precursor to PubMed, National Library of Medicine, I found that any interesting discovery of recent years that I found in the journals or in the biological abstracts. It took usually about 10 or 20 years before it would show up in Index Medicus, and then it would be a put-down, as these people are now saying that coenzyme Q10 has biological value. And, uh... would scoff, so it would scoff for a few years, and then 30 years after it was published in the science literature, the medical literature would finally accept it.
**CONTEXT:** I have a little handbook of physiology from, I think, 1965.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I've just been following the issue for more than 50 years. I knew people in the biodynamic Steiner approach and they told me various interesting things about the influence of fields created by the moon cycles and so on. And following up some of that stuff I found that there were fairly mainline researchers continuing ideas that Steiner had proposed doing the interaction between the moon cycles and the botanical processes. From the 20s through the 40s there were several people doing very good research, unrelated apparently to Steiner, but showing a conflict between the space-time and the time-bands. Organisms are biologically coordinated through the earth and moon fields. That's the basis for lunar planting, where entire calendars are devoted to the phases of the moon and the benefits or the adverse effects of doing certain plantings at certain times of the moon are shown. And that again, that's a kind of resonance with the way that the moon affects water through gravitational pull and how that biological effect is exerted on all of us as living water-filled beings. And so not just seeds, but mammals and even bacteria, etc. They all all feel these influences. And so that's a pretty real scientific approach to it. For people who want some other background besides Steiner, Harold Saxton Burr, a book, Fields of Life, he was a Yale professor, I think, who did some of the measurements showing these lunar cycles. A professor named Brown at Indiana University did a whole series of biological cycle studies, day and lunar cycles both. Salfco Tromp or Tromp, T-R-O-M-P, was a Dutch biologist and ecologist who wrote a book called Psychical Physics, how the nervous system interacts with these fields.
**CONTEXT:** Do you want to say anything about the European mistletoe and what it's been used for and how that's come about?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that that also reminds me the some of the points that were brought out about the pathology amongst Steiner School students versus students in the general population of mainstream education is that Steiner students have a significantly or a statistically significant difference, a lower incidence of gastrointestinal distress, as one of the main symptoms of the stress I think that was brought out in the regular school environment as opposed to the free-thinking liberal in the sense of being liberal not the kind of modern sense of the word liberal but the kind of liberating environment that students were in a little bit a little bit like the animal experience you first mentioned when we first started talking about the rats that were given the kind of environmental enrichment having better and greater intelligence and their progeny bearing from that you know benefiting from that also but in terms of the the lack of stress I think probably in the lack of like I said in the beginning lack of competition and that kind of you know all that that competition nurtures all the negative side of the competition this competition is not necessarily a bad thing but I think the way that most people compete with other people is usually in a fairly negative way.
**CONTEXT:** What do you think about the mind-body connection and I think we all agree that it's a real connection both in our nervous system and in our psyches the issue of helplessness learned helplessness or inescapable stress that shows up first in the stomach as ulcers and intestine as bleeding but it's really happening in the brain and if it continues you can see it now with MRI studies of the brain you can see the chronic stress thins the cortex of the brain makes the brain smaller and emptier and the main parts of the brain that relate the digestive damage to the nerve damage. The serotonin system contains components of excitatory, like the toxic excitatory amino acids, glutamic excitation processes that release nitric oxide. Nitric oxide reduces the energy. Producing capacity of the brain leads to atrophy. The intestine releases both serotonin and nitric oxide. The system goes back and forth between the brain and the intestine affecting every other organ in the process. And you can see these same processes even in fruit flies. If a fruit fly has a traumatic brain injury, for example, it develops ulcers and the leaky intestines. They can do that? Really. Fruit flies are just like us. Incredible. Or were just like fruit flies.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, keeping the brain steroids up and the inhibitory GABA transmitters up, this preserves the brain and all of the organs. Keeping the brain energy up keeps the structure up.
**CONTEXT:** When you were saying there's such a link there, it really made me think of lemon balm and chamomile.

**RAY PEAT:** I know he doesn't like seeds, but they always seem to have helped with stomach problems. They're good for making funny fuzzy animals, but not for eating.
**CONTEXT:** I know he doesn't like seeds, but they always seem to have helped with stomach problems. They're good for making funny fuzzy animals, but not for eating. What do you think about intestinal mucilages because I think that's the key component in chia seeds that the lady's talking about a little bit like slippery elm or psyllium husks. Or flax seeds have I know they have the oil too but they're also very mucilaginous.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, as long as they aren't allergenic in themselves. I've known a few people who had a bad reaction to even psyllium seeds.
**CONTEXT:** Oh, but the omega-3s and stuff in them aren't that bad for you?

**RAY PEAT:** There isn't much. I think it's the risk of an allergic reaction to some of the proteins in them that would be the only risk. I mean, you'd have to eat a lot of them to get a really large dose of omega oils.
**CONTEXT:** And the other thing that's helped before is shirataki noodles. Have you ever heard of those before? They're made from a tuber in Japan. That grows in water I believe.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, oh, oh yeah. I think it's all insoluble fiber, like no soluble fiber, just all insoluble fiber.
**CONTEXT:** What's the name of it? Shirataki noodles. No, I don't know. Is it a starchy noodle? I think it's a konjac, something root, konjac root. So it's a starchy tuber?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I read that they were having a problem with people choking on it, I think.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, they don't digest, they just kind of, but they really help with bowel movements, so.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, Cascara does the same thing for bowel movements and it's a lot safer.
**CONTEXT:** Right. Well, if it's anything like Dr. Beat always recommends, carrots. But he doesn't like seeds, so I was just wondering if the chia seeds were not really good to eat?

**RAY PEAT:** I've just not had any experience with them myself.
**CONTEXT:** No, no. Because they do have that mucilage or whatever you want to call it around it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I know psyllium seeds work for many people.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, I think I've tried that before and I've had cramps, so.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that's, then you're, then you're obviously having that allergic reaction then.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, to the psyllium.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**RAY PEAT:** I was just a little surprised to see a big publication in Nature, and this group at the University of California, San Diego, was actually reversing the majority of cataracts, in something like half a dozen or a dozen rabbits and then dogs, are both using eye drops and infecting it directly into the eyeball. But they actually got established cataracts to clear up. And when I wrote a newsletter about cataracts a couple of years ago, I noticed that research in treating and curing cataracts had been suppressed because of the immense amount of money there is in removing the lens during cataract surgery. It's a multi-billion dollar business and that money interest had just wiped out practically all curative research in eye surgery.
**CONTEXT:** So what do you think about lanosterol and eye cataracts?

**RAY PEAT:** It's a precursor to cholesterol.
**CONTEXT:** And you said it was a precursor to cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's preceding between the polymer that cyclises forms lanosterol and that turns into cholesterol.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, again... So boil your mushrooms for 45 minutes to an hour and make a yummy winter soup. And don't think of cholesterol as the bad thing because it's not.

**RAY PEAT:** Mushrooms happen to be a good source of that steroid.
