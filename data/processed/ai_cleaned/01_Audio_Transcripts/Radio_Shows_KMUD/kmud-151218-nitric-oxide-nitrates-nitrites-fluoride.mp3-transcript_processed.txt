**RAY PEAT:** "1968-72. I studied biology, physiology, and biochemistry, especially at the University of Oregon for a PhD. Before that, I was in linguistics, literature, painting, and such. And since then, I've been writing newsletters and doing consulting."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked to outline his academic and professional background.

**RAY PEAT:** "No not at all, my thesis advisor Arnold Soderwall. I had been one of the pioneers in exploring the effects of vitamin E as a fertility nutrient. In the 1930s and 40s actually, vitamin E was recognized as a protection against polyunsaturated fats and against estrogen. Both of those were things that......interfered with oxidative energy production and so vitamin E was preserving the ability of tissues to oxidize properly and it has come to be known as an antioxidant but really it should be thought of as a normalizer of a good oxidative metabolism."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if reproductive physiology was as dogmatic as other branches of science, leading Dr. Peat to discuss his thesis advisor and the early understanding of Vitamin E.

**RAY PEAT:** "I read a few studies in the 1970s in which they had compared villages that had high fluoride or zero fluoride added to the water and it happens that the teeth were healthier in the village without fluoride. Some of the early studies were done in Montana towns where the water was naturally mineralized and they were getting trace minerals natural in the mountain water and they didn't control for that. They blamed the fluoride content for the good dental health but it was probably the magnesium molybdenum. Other trace minerals in the water that help the teeth mature properly and that, because I was interested, I went to hear John Yanis talk and he was very impressive. He was supposedly debating with a dentist who claimed to be an expert on fluoridation and he finally got the dentist to admit that. His preparation consisted of reading a review article and Yama Yannis had worked for the abstracting service, I think it was biological abstracts, and was familiar with 15,000 studies on fluoride and so he could make any opponent look ridiculous and so they avoided debating him. They just said he was a quack and so shouldn't be. Even given serious hearing, Yamilianos and Dean Burke did a study in Los Angeles and found that fluoridation before and after fluoride was added, the cancer incidents increased. Dean Burke really was one of the best cancer researchers in the world. He was a colleague of Otto Warburg, so Dean Burke's reputation was damaged by getting involved with fluoride."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked for his take on fluoride and its purported benefits for teeth.

**RAY PEAT:** "Around 1970 there were studies of these nitrosamines, compounds mostly involving proline or other amino acids....reacting with nitrates in the stomach and it came out that they were very powerful carcinogens and that they are formed in cigarette smoke. They're one of the major carcinogens in cigarette smoke. But the farm industry was forcing greater production by using artificial fertilizers. High nitrate fertilizers. Spinach produced with those fertilizers will grow very quickly, produce a lot of mass, but forcing it with the high nitrate causes it to contain several times as much nitrate as normal vegetables would. And the cooking process alone forms the nitrosamines to well-cooked spinach. Even when you're boiling a vegetable in water, rather than the high heat, they typically associate nitrosamines with like bacon or... Yeah, but even vegetables which have the reputation for being associated with a low cancer incidence because of any......good nutrients they contain. It happens if you choose the vegetables that are industrially over fertilized with nitrate and then cook them thoroughly so that they're digestible, you're producing the same sort of carcinogen that tobacco smoke contains."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about nitrates and nitrites.

**RAY PEAT:** "The argument that the industry is pushing is that brain circulation and nutrition supposedly goes with intelligence. It does in young people. So if you increase the diameter of the blood vessels by increasing your nitric oxide, you're going to reverse the process of brain aging by getting more blood circulating. It does help the brain to function to circulate more blood through it, but the problem is that nitric oxide at the same time is blocking the ability to use the oxygen. So it's imitating a shock state. In which the blood, or in cirrhosis, for example, you get an exaggerated circulation of blood which isn't being used because things are inhibiting the oxidative enzymes. And in the spontaneously age-accelerated rats and mice, they're genetic mutants that age......at about three or four times the normal rate. They're very old when they're six months old. These animals happen to produce tremendous amounts of nitric oxide. And so the people arguing for the sale of nitric oxide products say, well, that's because they're defective and they need more nitric oxide. So they say that the... high concentration of nitric oxide in the prematurely senile animals is there protectively. But when you intervene, for example, exposing to overdoses of ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation, you create changes similar to those of aging, including... gene mutations and so on, and you can extract the liquid from an organism that has been irradiated, and that liquid will produce the same deterioration, mutations and so on. The bystander effect? Yeah, and the bystander effect is largely the result of overproduction of nitric oxide."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains the purported benefits of nitric oxide for brain circulation and contrasts it with its actual metabolic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I was 10 years old, a doctor prescribed it for migraines and I took a glass of the tea every day for about a month. A big bag full of cannabis leaves, and I didn't notice really any effect, so I was never impressed by the claims for its great sedative or painkilling effects or whatever. But I know it does have those useful sedative effects."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked for his views on cannabis.

**RAY PEAT:** "It does have an anti-testosterone effect. I think the worst effects are when it's smoked because the smoke itself has an estrogen action."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the potential estrogenic effects of cannabis, given its relation to hops.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in general. Yeah, good. It activates the immune system in a short-term, an antibody-producing way that is in certain situations useful, but it's why women have very high incidence of autoimmune disorders because it impairs the energy resources at the same time that it's making these short-term emergency changes in the immune system."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat confirms that estrogen is generally considered a pro-inflammatory hormone and explains its impact on women's health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the nitrogen could be in the form of ammonia. That would be the safe way for the plants to get there. And there wouldn't be any problem then, but the more they're forced with an excess of nitrogen, they simply absorb the nitrate or nitrite in a crude chemical form that isn't doing the plant any good. But when you eat it, then it circulates in your body. It is then exposed to many layers of enzymic and non-enzymic interactions. Free radicals as well as reductases will convert nitrate to nitrite, nitrate to nitric oxide. And those increase according to your level of stress. So when you're......eating food that either contains it as preservatives like in processed meats or the industrially produced vegetables, you're creating the conditions for a bad reaction to stress. And then if you're stressed out when you're eating, then that makes it even worse? I would suppose so. It makes all digestion worse, right?"

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the metabolic fate of nitrates and nitrites in the body, particularly in relation to stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the argument that the industry is pushing is that brain circulation and nutrition supposedly goes with intelligence. It does in young people. So if you increase the diameter of the blood vessels by increasing your nitric oxide, you're going to reverse the process of brain aging by getting more blood circulating. It does help the brain to function to circulate more blood through it, but the problem is that nitric oxide at the same time is blocking the ability to use the oxygen.

The bystander effect? Yeah, and the bystander effect is largely the result of overproduction of nitric oxide."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the role of nitric oxide in aging and stress, referencing studies on genetically modified animals and radiation exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are situations where the multivitamins could be useful if you're really in a bad situation for getting good food, but the trouble is that they aren't generally well formulated and and even the... the best formulations are made with somewhat contaminated chemicals. About 40 years ago, I found that I was having migraine headaches every time I took certain vitamins, especially vitamin B2, ascorbic acid, and rutin were the most intense for me, and I found that essentially all of the people that I talked to... with serious allergy problems were taking vitamin supplements and that when they stopped the supplements they recovered from their chronic allergy symptoms. So I'm convinced that unless it's a very special situation that it's better to avoid the supplements and to choose foods for their high nutrient content."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the efficacy and necessity of multivitamins and calcium supplements as people age.

**RAY PEAT:** "I always recommend eggs and liver as the easiest way to get both trace minerals and vitamins, but you can look at... at food charts and find things that are not necessarily as good, but you can put together a diet with a high content of certain vitamins. Vitamin B2 is one that I've seen lots of serious deficiencies. People with red nose, rosacea......nosebleeds, some mood problems, poor memory and such. You can't use oxygen if you're deficient in vitamin B2. But besides the fact that the synthetics are so allergenic for lots of people, if you take a very large amount, some of the pills have 50 or 100 milligrams in each tablet... it can reach the level in your skin and your eyes where it sensitizes you to the sunlight. Even blue light will react with riboflavin in your eyes and skin causing free radical chains."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses specific vitamins that are commonly deficient and recommends food sources, highlighting the issues with synthetic vitamin B2.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 5 or 10."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked for a recommended dosage for vitamin B2.

**RAY PEAT:** "Green leaves, if they're well cooked. are a great source of calcium and magnesium. And grown organically so they don't have a great source of nitric oxide."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests sources for calcium, in addition to dairy products.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, well it's something that you don't want though, so presumably you think that you need it? No, I don't think. I was kind of wondering, based on what you said, that it seemed like it would be a bad thing directly. Absolutely not. Why would you be proclaiming it so directly as a good thing? Well, that's the unfortunate part of the information that most people will receive. There's a pretty big campaign here to promote nitric oxide as healthy. I know the whole Viagra industry, which is pretty much based on nitric oxide as a means to get that vasodilation and engorgement that the pill is so famous for, is actually very... can promote heart attack. Cardiovascular accidents and atrophy of the testicles. And atrophy of the testicles, there you go. So that's not what you want folks. Nitric oxide and Viagra actually very bad news and the people that produce the compound are not going to tell you that. It's just going to feel good and it's going to come with a lot of cost. Until it doesn't."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about products that claim to boost nitric oxide, like Superbeets, and explains why nitric oxide is detrimental.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I think they are. But maybe they're feeding them extra nitrate so they can claim that they're superbeets."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat comments on the potential for beets to be artificially enhanced with nitrates.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, if it's non-GMO doesn't mean to say the farmer doesn't use agricultural agrochemicals on it. It's just the fact that if it is GE or GMO you can be sure they're putting agrochemicals on it. If it's not organic, if it's not organic you can almost surely guarantee that the possibility is high that agrochemicals are being used. The only hopefully sure way you can be sure is to use a certified organic product by certified organic. Vegetables and meat, and according to the USDA, you are not allowed to use any of these chemicals that we're talking about on certified organic products."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies the distinction between Non-GMO Project Verified and certified organic regarding the use of agrochemicals like glyphosate and atrazine.

**RAY PEAT:** "The veterans believed that they had been fed potassium nitrate in their food, and I read old 17th to 18th century things that described it as a treatment for prisoners and soldiers to decrease their libido so that they could attend a war war. and not be interested in romance, and that was, for hundreds of years, that was a popular concept, people seemed to recognize that it actually lowered libido, and the recent experiments with bulls and such show that it does stop the production of testosterone. But if you look on the internet, all of the popular medical sites are saying that's a big myth. The army would never think of doing that, and prison officials would never think of poisoning their prisoners or soldiers. They forget that, for hundreds of years, people were... recognizing the effect, and for it to be such a historically unknown fact that it suppresses libido, it's strange that everyone is so enthusiastic about denying that it has ever happened."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the historical use of potassium nitrate to suppress libido and notes the modern denial of this effect.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's just for an additive. Mainly in meats or is it in other foods? Well, the nitrates I think are used in some other foods. I think it's mainly for making meat red. Okay. For keeping it red, right."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the primary use of potassium nitrate as a food additive.

**RAY PEAT:** "My impression is really that it has been declining rapidly for about 150 years now. And in the 60 years that I've been studying and talking to people about politics and such, the problems that I saw in the late 1940s and 50s, I was one of the few people talking about it at that time, but now probably there are millions of people using the internet to see the same drift of events, which basically is corporate control and using education and the media to make the people think that... against you. Things are progressing. The story that life span has been lengthened, the cancer war is being won, they're simply creating fraudulent statistics. The Romans, the adult life span in ancient Rome was about the same as 20th century America. And we supposedly have all this technology to help us now and the science to... do miraculous things and yet we really haven't advanced much at all. The whole war on cancer is a complete joke."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat offers his perspective on the state of the country, noting a long-term decline driven by corporate control and manipulated statistics.
