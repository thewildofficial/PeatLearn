**RAY PEAT:** From 1968 to 72, I studied at the University of Oregon Biology, specializing in physiology, especially reproductive aging physiology. Before that, it was linguistics and literature mostly. Since then, I've been studying the implications of the research I did for my Ph.D.

**CONTEXT:** Could you please share your educational background and areas of specialization before we delve into tonight's topics?

**RAY PEAT:** Some city water departments have discovered that it's doable to use ultraviolet light or peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, or ozone, various oxidizing methods that don't leave any residue. In fact, they tend to oxidize and detoxify any of the chemical contaminants that are in the water.

**CONTEXT:** What is your view on chlorine in water and how it interacts with organic components, and what are your thoughts on alternative disinfection methods?

**RAY PEAT:** If you have to use city water, I think it's good to at least let it stand in an open container for 12 hours or so, or heat it to drive off as much of the chlorine and organic chlorides as possible.

**CONTEXT:** Do you have any experience or knowledge regarding the effects of chlorine reacting with organic compounds to form toxic byproducts?

**RAY PEAT:** Chlorine just, it's a very powerful oxidizer, so it reacts with anything, any carbon compound that happens to be dissolved in the water.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that chlorine is volatile and that chloramines are now being used. Have you heard of chloramination and its effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Just vaguely, but it's relating to the research that started around 1970 on the nitrosamines. The chloramine largely breaks down to form the nitrosamines, the NDMA, nitrosodimethylamine. And I think there's pressure from the food and agricultural industry to propagandize that the nitrosamines aren't carcinogenic, which they were established to be 40-something years ago. And because it's profitable to fertilize heavily with nitrogen fertilizer, and also to preserve foods with nitrates and nitrites, there's a lot of propagandistic science publication going on saying that rather than being toxic, the nitrites and nitrites, and even the nitrosamines, they're not only supposed to be un-carcinogenic, but they're now saying that they're even beneficial to the health, reducing heart disease and reducing cancer and helping to build muscle and so on. Because these are the very things they've been saying are carcinogenic about nitrates in meat that's kept... you're treated with nitrates and... Yeah, that was a big thing around 1970 when they saw that babies that were fed had... pureed spinach, for example, sometimes turns blue because of the interference of the nitrate with making the hemoglobin unable to carry oxygen. Right, because it binds to hemoglobin, doesn't it? Yeah, and the nitrates do that even when we make them internally from proteins under stress. But because of the food industry concern about selling their products, there has been this reaction saying that it was only a few farms that had nitrate contaminated water that really were causing the baby problems, right? And this would have been from a kind of chemical runoff, fertilizer, or manure runoff. Yeah, and they tried to reduce it to nothing but the blue baby phenomenon and to distract attention from the really universally recognized tumor-promoting potential of all of the nitrates and nitrites and nitrosamines.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the "blue baby phenomenon" related to nitrates. Can you elaborate on that and the broader implications of nitrates and nitrosamines?

**RAY PEAT:** I've also understand that this compound chloramine is extremely toxic to kidney dialysis patients. They can't use water for dialyzing if it's been treated with chloramine, and it's extremely toxic to fish.

**CONTEXT:** Have you heard about the toxicity of chloramine to kidney dialysis patients and fish?

**RAY PEAT:** Chloroform and other chlorinated hydrocarbons are volatile too, so they will gas out.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the discussion about chlorine gas and its byproducts, what is your understanding of volatile compounds like chloroform?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon does absorb and even destroy some of the compounds, but it isn't a complete safety method.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned carbon filters. What is your assessment of their effectiveness in removing contaminants from water?

**RAY PEAT:** Hashimoto's usually just means low thyroid function, which is more common in women because estrogen inhibits the thyroid, and low thyroid then lets estrogen rise. The liver needs available glucose to produce adequate cholesterol, and eating fruits, especially orange juice, will often bring a person's cholesterol up to normal. And if she replaces her starchy carbohydrates with the orange juice and has a cup of grated raw carrot at night before she goes to bed, that should help with the dysbiosis by eliminating the starches and doing the carrot salad.

**CONTEXT:** My girlfriend has low cholesterol and Hashimoto's. Could gelatin help raise her cholesterol, and what is the mechanism for dysbiosis and dyslipidemia?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, gelatin will be anti-inflammatory for the intestine, and in that way, it could help her liver be less irritated and thereby make more cholesterol. So, yeah, it's probably a good thing for everybody to take.

**CONTEXT:** Would gelatin help her appetite, and if it helps her gut, would that then help her cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** Exactly what Sarah said.

**CONTEXT:** Do you have a direct answer regarding gelatin consumption to increase cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** Composting is really a viable source of heat, methane production, but just heat directly from the compost. Because I have read a couple of large municipal landfills are starting to do this with methane as a viable byproduct of composting all of the household refuse. And Straus Creamery makes electricity from the methane from their cows.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding alternative energy sources and waste management, what are your thoughts on composting for heat and methane production?

**RAY PEAT:** I've talked to some of his patients, and I'm sure they aren't getting enough protein.

**CONTEXT:** What is your objective analysis of a starchy carbohydrate-rich diet, like the McDougall program, curing heart disease?
