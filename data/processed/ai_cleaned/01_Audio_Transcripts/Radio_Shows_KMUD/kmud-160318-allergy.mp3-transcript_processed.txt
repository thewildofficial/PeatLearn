**RAY PEAT:** I think one of the reasons that it gets so much attention is that it fit with a hereditary idea of susceptibility to allergy and other diseases. And I think the facts are that it's as much an effect of allergy as it is a cause. For example, it's known that the determination of the B cells, or bone-derived white blood cells, to make the IgE type of antibody. It's determined by the signals in the body and histamine is the immediate, probably the most effective signal in telling the B cells to start making the IgE antibody. So if you don't have inflammation from the stressed cells producing histamine, you won't be likely to have so much IgE. And one of the things that turns on the production of more mast cells or the secretion or leakage of histamine from the mast cells is prostaglandins produced from the polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially prostaglandin E2. And over the last 15 or 20 years, several researchers have seen that allergic women have babies that are born with higher polyunsaturated fatty acid content, and that those babies are more likely to develop allergies at an early age. And the polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease the low density, so-called bad cholesterol. And increase the HDL, high density type of cholesterol. And the HDL is associated with allergy and higher LDL is associated with less likelihood of allergy. PUFA and HDL, the supposedly good things which have been increasingly promoted are believed by quite a few allergists. Now, to be responsible for the great increase in allergy in Europe and America. Because they're signalling for inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** What do you see of IgE as the main cause or do you not even agree with that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they increase the, among other things, the prostaglandins which increase the histamine production.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the prostaglandins when you first started talking about the IgA antibodies, they kind of go through a signalling process. Is that... These free fatty acids, these are the very self-same free fatty acids that you often talk about as being important to keep down because they're both inflammatory and destructive in their inflammatory mechanisms.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, besides making the prostaglandins in themselves, they cause changes in cells that disrupt their functions. In fact, every function of the cell can be disrupted by too much of the polyunsaturated fats. And one of the worst things they do is to interrupt oxidative metabolism. And the energy deficit, I think, is ultimately the thing that leads to the really serious allergy problems.
**CONTEXT:** When you talk about energy production, again, I am automatically thinking of the mitochondrial powerhouse of the cell. Producing energy in thyroid and progesterone being those pro-supportive supplements, nutrients for it, that's the correct way of thinking about it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and babies and very young children can oxidize fatty acids very quickly and get good energy from them. But in proportion to how unsaturated they are, they over the years slow down the ability to oxidize anything. And sugar doesn't do that. Glucose doesn't cause the great problems with metabolism and energy production.
**CONTEXT:** So there's a kind of cumulative effect with free fatty acid buildup in the body that leads to a decrease in energy. And that energy decrease is responsible in part for the arrival on the scene of the inflammatory mediators that usually poorly started. They're triggered by things which normally people wouldn't be susceptible to or allergic to.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, about 40 or 50 years ago, some people associated with Hans Selye in Canada did research on allergy and the shock that can be produced by allergens. And in one of their studies, they graded allergens from the potentially deadly walnut oil allergy down to very mild allergies like pollen that would maybe cause the sniffles, and they gave that range of allergens to animals that had glucose infused into their bloodstream to give them twice to three times the normal concentration of glucose, and even the most deadly allergen didn't do anything worse than maybe give them the sniffles when they had high blood sugar, but if they gave them a little insulin to lower their blood sugar, the mildest allergen could kill them with anaphylactic shock.
**CONTEXT:** Got it. So sugar is a good mediator then. It's almost a stress-reducing substance that prevents that cascade from even occurring then.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, lots of people have been able to give up their EpiPens or their epinephrine dosers just by keeping a Coke on hand if they are stung by a bee that they're allergic to or such. They drink a Coke quickly.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, I know it's a little bit off the subject here, but anyway, sugar is very important, not just in terms of energy production, but for vitalizing the cell, and it's also that same sugar then, they're saying, which is directly responsible for directly reducing the inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when you increase, like in these animals, when you give them extra glucose, it's able to get around the highly unsaturated fatty acid interference with energy production. It can turn off the production of fatty acids and get directly to the mitochondria to produce energy.
**CONTEXT:** I think when most people think about sugar, they've probably been told by mainstream media how bad it is and, you know, what your glucose should be. And hear about all the diabetes that's rampant now as a means or a reason not to consume sugar, but we all know that the cause for diabetes is not nothing to do with sugar. And we've gone over various radio shows talking about the high fructose corn syrup in the industry's food chain and how that along with the polyunsaturates are directly responsible for the rise in diabetes. So sugar itself, in terms of the sugar that would be necessary, I wonder if you remember the work or the articles about the amount of sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, 300 milligrams per cent was the protective, completely protective level.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, interesting. Okay, what you're listening to, ask your doctor, Kami D. Gaborfall, 91.1 FM. From 7.30 till the end of the show, callers are invited to call in with questions about this month's subject of allergy. We've come to that time of year now, March, with the clocks going forward and everything breaking into flower, where people are probably going to start coming down with the things that they recognize as the start of spring. So there's going to be plenty of advice here to understand the mechanisms by which allergy occur and how best to deal with it from a nutrition point of view. I guess the underlying pathophysiology of allergy involves the immunoregulatory dysfunction then, similar to those that's been noted in highly stressed populations, and we'll get into the stress side here in a moment. So the allergies themselves have been considered psychosomatic, and they've worsened outcomes in patients with a high degree of psychosocial stress. How do you see the cause-effect aspect of stress modulating the alert allergy response?

**RAY PEAT:** Remember we were talking about learned helplessness? Yeah, yeah. Stress that you can't escape from, even if it's not a very deadly stress. The forced swimming test of the rats. It becomes deadly and that's because you can't mobilize the anti-stress system. You get stuck in the cholinergic or parasympathetic side of the system, which tends to weaken and slow your heartbeat and weaken other defenses, but it puts you in a predisposed to become inflamed condition, and when they've looked at people with various inflammatory diseases, it turns out that their social economic status is additive to any particular learned helplessness situation so that a person with any bad condition is less likely to survive if they have a low social economic status, but if they have overcome learned helplessness, they can also overcome their social economic status. They're simply additive so that learned helplessness plus low status, low income makes you very susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, dementia and so on.
**CONTEXT:** I wonder how best people could overcome that by, I don't know, either reading stimulating articles or being involved in... I don't know, discussion, dialogue about alternatives that could be helpful. I wonder that most people that have that poor situation where they are very much economically deprived, etc., have a, like you say, a kind of downward spiral mental outlook on things that...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, an enriched environment is how they made the animals overcome it, and in humans, anything that gets you out of the trapped sensation that makes your life interesting. So just about any life enriching experience, meeting new people, going new places, helps break out of those patterns.
**CONTEXT:** Okay, from a direct descriptive term then for allergies, for people that are, for example... Allergic to pollen. I know pollen is just one of many different allergens that can trigger an allergy response. But in terms of some of the best treatment or some of the best approaches to this type of allergy-mediated substance, what do you think would be probably some of the most important advice people could get for combating allergies?

**RAY PEAT:** It turns out that the same things that cure help to escape from learned helplessness also help to stop the or reduce the inflammatory reaction and reduce histamine production. And T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, was one of the early things they discovered would cure learned helplessness. It does several things that prevent overproduction of histamine. It's been known to be anti-inflammatory for a long time but one of its mechanisms is to stabilize mast cells so they don't secrete serotonin, histamine and other inflammatory things.
**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right so how about how about we've talked in the past about you are what you eat and then at this point in time we're talking about ingesting allergens so potentially you can be triggered into inflammation. By what you either purposely or inadvertently ingest so what perhaps is a rationale or your rationale then for the the gut derived link between inhaled allergens and allergy that can be decreased by specifically treating the gut with anti-inflammatories sometimes the inflammation in a particular area like in your nose ears or throat or eyes sometimes that's really something. Irritating your intestine.

**RAY PEAT:** You can develop the IgE antibodies solely in your nasal membranes without having it in your general bloodstream so that you can have a local reaction to pollen or such. But I think usually people who are getting these throat, nose inflammations, it's usually started from something happening in the intestine, triggering mast cells, which are very numerous in the lining of the intestine, triggering the production of histamine, serotonin, nitric oxide and other things, systemically prostaglandins in particular. And those circulate to cause all membranes. They can cause hives of lumps on the skin and other skin conditions. And so avoiding things that feed bacteria so that you don't produce so much endotoxin can help all types of allergy and inflammatory conditions. And the standard theory of allergy is they used to say that only a protein is a potential allergen. Just perfect evidence that many things don't contain proteins are very powerful, potentially deadly allergens. For example, the alginate that dentists use for making molds of the mouth.
**CONTEXT:** Did you say alginate? Alginate?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, right. It's a cousin of carrageenan, which is now in so many foods.
**CONTEXT:** Right. One person died of alginate. Anaphylactic shock, well, having a mold made with alginate, it's a...

**RAY PEAT:** So allergic were they, huh? Yeah, it's a polysaccharide, but lots of gums, like guar and locus gum and xanthan gum and so on, these are all allergens for some people, but they're used just almost indiscriminately in food. Today someone sent me a label for an ice cream substitute that contains seven different gums, one of which is an allergen for some people.
**CONTEXT:** Do you think that this, the food-based dietary involvement of allergic responses could be additive in any way, where people just get worse and worse because their diet doesn't change and the insults just continue to come on in?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think this is probably the worst cause of burned helplessness in the biological sense, your body experiences that inflammatory state which is psychological as much as biological.
**CONTEXT:** It's so insidious too, it's so all pervasive and all so insidious, it's a pretty corporate machine that's being driven I think down the path of destruction for a lot of people in a lot of ways. That's why I know you advocate so many good whole, not the whole foods as in the whole food store, but so many good whole food approaches to diet and I know that your mainstay foods of choice and preference here are things like good quality dairy products whether it's milk or cheese.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the calcium and vitamin D are two of the things that are very strongly anti-allergic. Magnesium is the most famous because of magnesium deficiency they found caused a terrific range of inflammatory diseases in animals and they could cure skin diseases, heart disease, nerve disease, liver disease and so on just by correcting a magnesium deficiency. Vitamin D and calcium are working with magnesium. They are very important so that some people cure their allergies just by supplementing vitamin D or vitamin K which is the other major calcium regulating vitamin.
**CONTEXT:** Okay, let's hold that thought there for a minute because we do actually have a caller on the air. So let's just open up the show to callers and let's see where this first call is going. Caller, you're on the air?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, mucus binds histamine and keeps it away from the cells and binds other toxins and irritants. So it's our first line of defense both against allergens and viruses and such. But I think there is a great similarity between the variety of viruses that like to attack the intestine. Things that we think of as respiratory viruses I think are primarily intestinal viruses. Polio, in one of its manifestations, was really just a gastrointestinal infection. But the famous gastroenterologist Walter Alvarez, about 80 years ago, experimented on dogs when he would give them a respiratory virus. He found that they would get a runny nose and inflammation in their head without any virus at all present in their nose and he found that the virus was growing in their intestine and producing symptoms in their upper respiratory system and then later, if they didn't throw it off, later the virus would show up all through their system including their nose so what seems to be a nose cold I think most often is irritation in the intestine and I've seen dozens of people who learned that at the first sign of a cold coming on such as a sore throat or runny nose if they ate a carrot they could break the pattern not develop the cold.
**CONTEXT:** Is the common cold considered to be a virus or a germ? they're supposed to be a virus right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, yeah. And so I've always thought this is interesting too especially after learning everything I have from you Dr. Pete that you know doctors are prescribing antibiotics even though you know for a long time I was always irritated with family members you know going ahead and going to the doctor when they had a bad cold and getting antibiotics and I would say it's a virus so why are you doing that why is the doctor doing that and they always said that it was because of a secondary infection but in reality based on what you've been what we've been learning from you it actually may be a good thing to do because it's attacking that endotoxin issue in the intestine is that correct.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. And um you usually don't need nearly the dose that is typically prescribed to clear out a bowel infection. If it has just come on, sometimes a third of the standard dose of penicillin or tetracycline or erythromycin will clear it up.
**CONTEXT:** And then antihistamines that are stifling the mucus flow in a way are really kind of disrupting the intelligence of the body getting these allergens out. Is that correct?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, except sometimes they can break the pattern. Like vitamin E has antihistamine effect. For example, it prevents the formation of prostaglandins and as a consequence will prevent the degranulation of mast cells. And so it can prevent the shift to the IgE antibody in the whole thing.
**CONTEXT:** Because you're saying the histamine is creating a vicious cycle, so we do want to break that cycle?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, breaking the cycle. Even various antihistamines and other drugs can help to break that cycle.
**CONTEXT:** And you've said before that like nitric acid is also kind of a vicious loop going between histamine and...

**RAY PEAT:** I think you mean nitric oxide, don't you? Yeah, histamine turns on the production of nitric oxide and nitric oxide signals a bunch of other inflammatory processes, but the worst thing is that it interferes with oxygen energy production.
**CONTEXT:** Okay. So the mucus flowing, though... is probably a good thing, but it may be a part of that vicious cycle, I guess, that we would like to stop.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the mucus itself is fine, it's helpful, but you wouldn't have to produce it if you didn't have the inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** Ah, okay, there we go, that's what I was looking for, okay. Okay, well hey, thank you. Yeah, thank you for your call. Okay, well, we do have two more callers and I just want to let other people that are listening know, from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's topic of allergy.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's because that's when the parasympathetic system kicks in and lowers your blood sugar. And that combination turns on the histamine release and inflammation and I experimented I had that pattern of sleep onset asthma and I found that gymsum weed or atropine the belladonna type chemical breaks the muscarinic part of the parasympathetic reaction and found that that would keep me from going into that very low blood sugar state, but the trouble with relying on the anticholinergic is that it tends to dry your mouth and gives you tooth decay from the absence of saliva flow during the night, so it is an emergency urgency treatment, but you know the real thing I think is to adjust your thyroid and progesterone. Progesterone has a broad variety of anti-histamine effects. Estrogen turns on both the multiplication of mast cells and their tendency to release histamine and serotonin. And so getting your thyroid to a good level will reduce your estrogen and increase your progesterone and shift the balance in histamine production. Aspirin is another antihistamine that works indirectly by reducing prostaglandin production and nitric oxide production and such. You could easily take three, say 325mg tablets in a day, I know some people take considerably more than that and in conjunction with vitamin K one drop per 325mg tablet if it's a 1ml per drop vitamin K2 solution is adequate to offset any potential hemorrhagic or you know hemodynamic effects of blood thinning that some individuals may get, it's relatively rare. But so 900mg a day that would be a fairly for people that were suffering with allergies that would also be quite a quite a good approach to self-treatment.
**CONTEXT:** I think so and sometimes just taking 3 to 500mg before bedtime so that it has time to get absorbed before you actually start falling asleep. Sorry there was another part of your question I think that you...

**RAY PEAT:** Those are actually both of them.
**CONTEXT:** I do have another one but I can let the next person have a chance. Well, what's your next question? Now's your opportunity. My old naturopathic doctor told me that I was getting eczema flare-ups as a result of eating eggs. And surprisingly, although I know that you mentioned Dr. Pete on this show many times that eggs are good for you, Supposedly eczema still comes back when I eat eggs and I get kind of a migraine after I eat eggs. A headache that really hurts. So what do you...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I've had that reaction many times. To liver is the other good food that can cause that reaction. But when you're tending to have the high histamine or parasympathetic dominance, a dose of very high quality protein powerfully stimulates insulin production and drops your blood sugar. So it's the same reaction that happens when you go to sleep, your parasympathetic system lets inflammation develop. And so I learned to never eat more than one egg per glass of ten ounce glass of sweet orange juice, at least that much to balance the protein in one egg.
**CONTEXT:** Well that makes sense because I've been eating two eggs and just a little bit of orange juice so I'll try that thank you so much. Okay you're welcome. All right so let's take the next caller. Caller you're on the end where you from?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I would think so. Dr. Pete, what's your take on that? Yeah, having a Coca-Cola or Pepsi, I think, would work. Most of the people I know have had Coca-Cola work. A 12-ounce glass contains, I forget, but it's like 18% glucose, sugar, and I think it's mostly the sugar, but the caffeine contributes to the same thing, helping to keep your blood sugar up. And ephedra. It's more powerful than caffeine, but working in the same direction.
**CONTEXT:** Okay, yeah, we're talking about ephedra, Dr. Pete. Thanks for that caller. It used to be a par excellence herb for asthma. I used to use a lot of ephedra, and unfortunately it got abused and withdrawn from the marketplace probably 10 years ago now. But as a stimulant and for reducing the effects of inflammation and allergies, do you think that it was its sympathetic drive or some anti-histamine quality that it had that was responsible for it?

**RAY PEAT:** I think they're all the same thing. The pharmacologists like to talk about specific receptors being activated and so on, but there's an extreme overlap, the same way the steroid hormones, all of them overlap either positively or negatively. The benzadrine, amphetamine, ephedra, dopamine, adrenaline, diphenhydramine, ciproheptadine, all of these things that are they have different names and categories, but they all have a good antihistamine, pro-blood sugar, pro-respiratory effect.
**CONTEXT:** incidences of, oh I don't know, probably stroke in some people or high blood pressure in others that cause them to cause them to pull it off the market. Do you know if there's any of those sympathetic stimulants that maybe don't have such a stimulant effect to change blood pressure or pulse rate but would still have a antihistamine effect or one that had a different mechanism of activity?

**RAY PEAT:** Um, the, um, currently popular alternative that's legal is one that's produced in the brain, but it's a close relative of dopamine and adrenaline. It's called phenethylamine, P-E-A.
**CONTEXT:** Okay, phenethylamine. But people, again, are talking about 500 to 1,000 or 1,500 milligram doses, which I think are crazy. I think a helpful dose would be maybe 5 or 10 milligrams.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay. And that doesn't have a stimulant effect on the cardiovascular order?
**CONTEXT:** Well, I think it wouldn't, wouldn't it? Those tremendous crazy doses. 500 milligrams, it probably would, huh? Okay. Well, you're listening to Ask UREB, Dr. KMUD, Garbleville 91.1 FM. From now till the end of the show at eight o'clock, you're invited to call in with questions either related to allergy or allergy-related subjects. Or unrelated. The numbers, if you live in the area, is 707 923 3911 or there's an 800 number which is 1800 568 3723 you can use to call in between now and about 5 to 8. Well, Dr. P, I wanted to get onto the other subject related to allergies as the topic of atopic dermatitis. I know I've known several people with chronic dermatitis that's basically gone on to become severe eczema weeping and I read the article where in this is one of those PubMed articles that they've found 95% of people that have atopic dermatitis chronic atopic dermatitis get colonized with Staph aureus and that's Staphylococcal aureus bacteria that produces the yellow pus and becomes responsible for the kind of boil type appearance of the broken skin of the dermatitis that that is actually being used the anti-stress method that we've mentioned early on as a cause for allergy reducing stress but not only that but you piqued my interest when you're talking about vitamin d and vitamin d is being responsible for anti-allergy and again with magnesium and magnesium deficiency and how thyroid basically stabilizes magnesium in the body. Do you think atopic dermatitis is something that can be treated through the gut in the same way that you think allergies can?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the gut and the skin have some antigens and enzymes that are so closely connected that when one is inflamed the other one gets inflamed and thyroid and vitamin D are the most common solutions to those hypersensitivity of gut and skin.
**CONTEXT:** OK, so we talked about environmental enrichment now as a way of changing the tide, as it were, against inflammation. I think we'll pick that up just after this next caller. So let's just take this next caller. Are you on the air and where are you from? Dr P?

**RAY PEAT:** The parasympathetic system is overactive, pushes the blood sugar down and then the inflammatory things get loose in the intestine and blood vessels and I've used sugar and milk as a very compact and easy way to interrupt the night. If you expect that to happen at one or two, if you wake up at say 12:30 and have maybe a half a glass of milk with a heaping tablespoon of sugar in it, it will usually help you get through the rest of the night without it.
**CONTEXT:** How would you see low thyroid as a mechanism by which to help control blood sugar and in relation to hypnic issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the low thyroid function is the basic thing that it develops because of accumulating PUFA polyunsaturated fats in the system and then when your thyroid is low as the prostaglandins are let loose and activate the histamine release and so at the base of the problem, if you can't get rid of the polyunsaturated fats, which takes years of being careful with your food, increasing your thyroid can achieve pretty much the same thing, stabilizing your tissues so that they don't release so much unsaturated fat during the night, the polyunsaturated fats, which takes years of being careful with your food, increasing your thyroid can achieve pretty much the same thing.
**CONTEXT:** Another question, does the coffee enema, is it the same effect as drinking coffee?

**RAY PEAT:** I think drinking coffee with cream in it is better because you absorb it slowly and steadily and especially if it's with some food, maybe a raw carrot for example will extend the absorption of the caffeine and keep your blood sugar up. Coffee enema gives you a very sharp increase that can be stressful.
**CONTEXT:** That makes sense. Thank you very much. That makes a lot of sense. OK, thank you for your call, caller. OK, well we've just about got about six to eight minutes left, so if anybody else wants to call in either related or unrelated to this month's subject of allergy, please do so.

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect they are. The soothing, the famous soothing teas such as chamomile, I think are working largely on the intestine and cooked mushrooms are definitely acting on the intestine primarily. Have you heard of a compound called chromolin and sodium chromoglycate?
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, I've never used them but I've heard about them a lot. Alright, these actually I looked this up and they come from a plant, an Egyptian plant that I've known in herbal medicine but never used it, called Ami-Visnaga, apparently it's been used for a couple of millennia in Egypt, so that's one of those other alternatives and then the methyl xanthins, I know I've heard you speak fairly extensively about xanthins and methyl xanthins before, so things like theophylline from cocoa beans and apparently contain a lot of methyl xanthin. Caffeine is my favorite of the category but there is one that's used medically that has, I think it's five carbons added to it to make it a little more stable in the intracellular. It's a pillow, I can't think of the name of it, but it's medically used. Approved version of caffeine.

**RAY PEAT:** Or atropobeladon and give it to the patient with a caveat that when they just begin to get a dry mouth, that would be their threshold point at which they could back off their dose slightly and that would be their maintenance dose for treating them for asthma, for example with detura.
**CONTEXT:** Do you know whether or not the physiological tolerance for something like that class of compound to be used for allergies and asthma could be, you know, tolerated over long term?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah, I think the dry mouth is really the only serious side effect. I've known people who loved it so much that they ruined their teeth.
**CONTEXT:** Wow, because they used it enough because that was what they were using it for, you're saying, because it was chronic?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they would have night seizures or night asthma or night headaches or whatever, it's very good for that, but it's very bad to do it. Chronically, you can do the same thing safely with the oily vitamins, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin K in particular, and vitamin B6 and thiamine are important for stabilizing the mast cells and blood sugar. Magnesium is essential. It works with thyroid, so you can't expect magnesium or thyroid to work perfectly without the cooperation of the two at the same time.
**CONTEXT:** OK, so once again then we come back to the subject of adequate sugars, adequate thyroid hormone, avoidance of the polyunsaturates that block thyroid hormone, and the necessity of getting a clean diet with bowels moving correctly and not suffering from constipation and reabsorbing endotoxin as a pretty good way forward in terms of just those things which are fairly easy to do for the approach to asthma and or allergies in general. And I think getting back to the gut origin of allergies as you made that link, not just to the kind of inspired respiratory airborne allergens, but actually a lot of it can start in the gut. And I know you've mentioned a lot in the past, cascara as a good bowel laxative and a compound which has a fairly similar structure to tetracycline chemically.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the drug companies are seeming to get interested in it as a cancer treatment, treatment for dementia and heart disease. And it has a tremendous range of beneficial protective effects besides protecting the intestine. So I'll have to watch out for that one being banned I presume.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah it's so good. In the short term it'll just get too many good things going for it and they'll pull it off the market under the guise of some toxicity I would think. Anyway all right well it's 5 to 8 and obviously too late for anybody else to call in. But wanted to... Just thank you so much for your time and your giving of yourself to come to these radio shows and I know that you've Become pretty much the mainstay of the show here for quite a few years now So I do appreciate your time and I appreciate everything that you do for us. Dr. Pete.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay. Thank you.
