**RAY PEAT:** The medical establishment has had its own reasons for following their theory of cancer, but it has been reinforced by the government's biological warfare perspective. So they've blended them together to say that everything is determined by the DNA, and you don't have to learn anything about biology or about the chemistry of life itself.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the shift away from traditional biology towards a DNA-centric model, influenced by government and military research.

**RAY PEAT:** I've had a couple of very interesting experiences with people who had apparent emphysema. That was the diagnosis. Extremely inefficient lungs. One person was purple in the face and his memory was affected. He was getting so little oxygen to his brain. Another person was a woman in her 30s who had been that way for about 15 years. In the woman's case, it started when she had multiple estrogen injections when she was about 20. And that got me reading about the history of experimental emphysema, and they found that they could reduce the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen by 90% in just an hour after an injection of an excess amount of estrogen. And in the case of the man, I suspected that it was a combination of too much unsaturated fat in his diet, increasing his estrogen actions and decreasing his thyroid function. So I gave him some progesterone and pregnenolone, and I think a little thyroid. And in two weeks, the next time I saw him, that was in Toluca, altitude well over 8,000 feet, and his office was upstairs in a building without an elevator, and two weeks after he was sitting, puffing, and purple. And he took me around the city, took me up to his office, just zooming up the ramps, 80, 82 or 3 years old at that time, and fully functional lungs as quickly as two weeks. The young woman tried different things, but she noticed that she felt better when a doctor prescribed her thyroid, and she kept talking him into giving her bigger doses, got him up to five grains, and she was feeling pretty recovered, but she went to another doctor and got another five grains from him, and with the third doctor, each prescribing five grains as what they considered a maximum dose, she recovered completely over a period of two or three months.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about alternatives for emphysema. Dr. Peat shares his experiences treating emphysema with progesterone, pregnenolone, and thyroid hormone, explaining the potential role of estrogen and unsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, there were animal studies 20, 30, 40 years ago in which progesterone resolved their emphysema. And pregnenolone and progesterone both allow cells to handle water properly so that they don't swell up, and so that they retain normal elasticity.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on the mechanisms by which progesterone and pregnenolone can help with emphysema.

**RAY PEAT:** A low thyroid person sometimes compensates by producing gigantic amounts of adrenaline just to keep running. It helps to maintain their body temperature at normal and keeps their heart rate up, and they can seem even hyperthyroid sometimes when they have very little T3 production or very high reverse T3 blocking it. And when these people have their daily adrenaline measured in their urine, some of them are making 30 or 40 times more than the normal amount just to compensate for hypothyroidism. And those people, they often feel a great reduction of anxiety and tension, pressure, and so on. But since the adrenaline is compensating in many ways, keeping their blood sugar up, it's important to be very cautious when you oppose the adrenaline because it can sometimes give you asthma or low blood sugar because of it, it swings the other way, you're talking about it kind of crashes.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about using clonidine to reduce adrenaline at night. Dr. Peat explains how adrenaline can be a compensatory mechanism for hypothyroidism and the potential risks of suppressing it.

**RAY PEAT:** As adrenaline in chronic excess is also highly stressful in the organism, it can definitely keep the cortisol high. Um, yeah, the cortisol generally follows a period of excess adrenaline. So if you take your adrenaline down, it might let you lower your cortisol, unless you lower your glucose too much, and that can increase your cortisol. Yeah, salt and sugar are great ways to lower adrenaline. I recommend that to people who are performing and they're anxious before they perform. I'm stirring a little salt in a glass of orange juice. It works great.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the relationship between adrenaline, cortisol, and glucose, and suggests salt and sugar as ways to lower adrenaline.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of these things are not only contacting the membranes locally in your nose and mouth, but when you breathe them, you swallow them because they dissolve in the saliva. And in the last few years, people have been observing the same sort of taste buds existing in the intestine, so that your intestine can detect the chemistry of what's present, even though you aren't consciously maybe tasting it, but the nerves are still doing their chemical analysis. And so one of the things that enderologists have been noticing for a hundred years is that the inflammation of the nose and throat very often starts in the intestine. If you have a chemical irritant or a stretching from gas or constipation or a viral or bacterial infection, there can be no toxin or germ present in your nose, but the nose will get inflamed and start running. And then later, after the inflammation is under way, then it can pick up germs. But there's a very close integration between the respiratory system and the intestine. So things that you've eaten will affect the right nidus. And that's something that people often neglect. They'll take vitamin pills thinking that it'll help their immunity or their allergies. But I've seen dozens of people who recovered from their chronic runny nose when they stopped taking their vitamin and mineral supplements.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about atmospheric pollution from forest fires and smoking contributing to rhinosinusitis. Dr. Peat explains the connection between the intestine and the respiratory system, and how dietary factors can influence nasal inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** Avoiding irritating foods, green salads, uncooked vegetables, and many seeds and nuts are always irritating, and some people can have a runny nose from just having a salad once a week; it sets up a chronic irritation in their intestines.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat offers dietary recommendations to address chronic runny nose and nasal inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** The artificial sweeteners sometimes activate insulin and cause weight gain, just by acting on your hormones, even without increasing your food intake. But they have different toxicities. Some of them are excitotoxins if you eat large quantities of them, but usually if you just stop using them and eat a proper, non-irritating diet, things will correct themselves just nutritionally.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the negative effects of artificial sweeteners and how to undo them. Dr. Peat explains their potential to activate insulin, cause weight gain, and act as excitotoxins.

**RAY PEAT:** Irritation in the digestive system will increase the things that promote seizures or lower the threshold for them. The brain is one of our biggest steroid-forming organs, produces considerable amounts of DHEA, progesterone, pregnenolone, and metabolites of those, and those have a quieting effect, and when the brain is under stress, it's increased to compensate for the excitatory. There are some foods that specifically excite and damage the nerves and tend to predispose you to seizures. Amino acids, for example, including glutamic acid, aspartic acid, cysteine, and tryptophan are the worst amino acids for lowering the threshold. Supplements of progesterone have been used to reduce the sensitivity to various factors. The threshold to excitation and seizure increases in proportion to the amount of progesterone and several of the metabolites of these.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about alternatives for seizure medication. Dr. Peat discusses the role of digestive irritation, brain steroids, and specific amino acids in seizure activity.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I had a client that had epilepsy and she was able to wean herself off all of her medication and resume driving and lives a very normal life now, and she sticks to a very strict diet that doesn't have any kind of food that the bacteria can live on in her intestine. She takes pregnenolone and progesterone, and she has a thyroid prescription. And she also takes anti-adrenaline herbs like valerian and skullcap and passionflower.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares a case study of a client with epilepsy who successfully managed her condition through diet, hormone supplementation, and herbs.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the lady that I worked with, she was taking an eighth of a teaspoon of progesterone three times a day. Has she had her thyroid hormones, including reverse T3, measured? No. Those can, when someone is resistant to progesterone and needs extremely large amounts of it to feel right, it's usually because their liver is letting estrogen and the excitatory things accumulate. And so it takes a supernormal amount of progesterone to steady things. And if you eat the things that your liver needs, not too much of some proteins which contain the excitatory cysteine and so on, but for example, gelatin or glycine as an additive, shifting the balance away from the excitatory proteins towards more sugar, orange juice for example. And that's all. Making sure that your thyroid is letting your liver use the proteins efficiently to store sugar and eliminate the excitatory estrogen and other things.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses the dosage of progesterone and the importance of thyroid function and liver health in progesterone metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamins and minerals are the first things I think of. I've known people who had what they thought was Parkinson's disease, and all they needed was, in one case, vitamin B12; it did it immediately. Other people, magnesium supplements have a sudden steadying effect, anti-tremor. Sometimes more calcium and vitamin D will do it. All of these are antagonizing the excitotoxicity, and that effect, yeah, they're anti-inflammatories. And pregnenolone is always protective. Whenever you're under stress, you tend to use your steadying, quieting steroids faster, and sometimes just a supplement of pregnenolone will quiet things.

**CONTEXT:** A caller describes hand tremors and changes in handwriting. Dr. Peat suggests vitamins and minerals like B12, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin D, as well as pregnenolone, to address excitotoxicity and tremors.

**RAY PEAT:** It um, I think it's one of the safer things experimentally, at least. Okay. There are some, what it does, um, in small amounts, I think it's safe to experiment with it.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about alpha-lipoic acid. Dr. Peat considers it a safe substance to experiment with in small amounts.

**RAY PEAT:** If you're under stress, your reverse T3 goes up under the influence of cortisol, and if you lower cortisol, your reverse T3 just naturally goes down. But everything that helps to lower cortisol will help to free up the normal T3 production without reverse T3, and things that can help include sugar and aspirin and B vitamins and minerals.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains how stress, cortisol, and reverse T3 are related and suggests ways to lower cortisol and improve T3 production.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some people, I think it soothes the symptoms, but again, I think it's good to be cautious, especially if it's if it's used in any crude form that might have other plant components in it that could be irritating.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the use of cannabis for epilepsy. Dr. Peat expresses caution due to potential estrogenic compounds and irritating plant components.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I've never heard of serious allergic reactions to it. It seems to be fairly harmless.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the safety and allergenicity of stevia compared to artificial sweeteners. Dr. Peat finds stevia to be generally harmless.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, um, candida thrives when you're lacking some of the membrane surface antibodies, IgA, and those depend on many things, but especially thyroid and progesterone. So if you have low thyroid, you will both have a problem regulating your blood glucose, and your immune system will tend to favor things like candida overgrowth. But other bacteria too can produce similar symptoms. And so if you starve candida thoroughly by cutting off all of its sugar supply, it needs glucose, and so it can put out filaments and actually become invasive when you're not feeding it sugar. And if you do feed, if you do have candida in your intestine and you keep it well fed on glucose, it's not going to invade and become deadly. But the worst it does then is to maybe make too much ethyl alcohol. But it can be eradicated pretty easily just with a little very small amount of flowers of sulfur, just 200 milligrams or so, two or three days in a row will typically clean up the intestine from candida and other harmful fungus and bacteria.

**CONTEXT:** A caller mentions having candida and asks about diets. Dr. Peat explains the role of thyroid and progesterone in immune function related to candida and suggests flowers of sulfur as a treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the main rationale for the approach to treating your candida is that if you actually starve yourself of glucose, you're probably going to put yourself at a disadvantage because you will, by necessity of starving candida from glucose, you'll cause it to invade tissues more thoroughly to seek out sources of carbohydrate or other glucose stores. And actually, you really want to just keep a normal diet. Don't avoid and restrict sugar intake, but then if you use something as simple as flowers of sulfur, and I think Dr. Peat said 200 milligrams a day for two to three days, works pretty effectively for that.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat advises against severely restricting sugar for candida, suggesting a normal diet and flowers of sulfur instead.

**RAY PEAT:** And things such as a carrot salad, shredded carrots with a little olive oil and vinegar and salt. The oil suppresses candida multiplication, and the carrot has anti-fungal substances naturally because it grows in the ground and has to avoid being digested.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests carrot salad with olive oil, vinegar, and salt as a beneficial food for managing candida.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, progesterone is a feminizing. If it's in large amounts, it antagonizes the effects of testosterone. In France, there were studies 40 years ago in which women with whiskers, mustache, and sideburns and chest hair applied progesterone topically, and it didn't. Two or three months, I think it was, they feminized their facial hair. And when a man takes just a moderate amount of progesterone orally, it stops the whisker growing or slows it greatly. And those French studies showed that it would reverse the differentiated masculine type bristly hair, and it's safe for men or women, unlike the estrogen that they use to produce breasts.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about safe hormones for transitioning to a trans female. Dr. Peat discusses the feminizing effects of progesterone and its ability to antagonize testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** It's an individual matter. The quality of your thyroid function and your diet and liver and so on affect your response to it. It's important to make sure that your thyroid is good. A low thyroid person can increase the risk of cancer if they use anything estrogenic.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that the dosage of progesterone is individual and dependent on thyroid function, diet, and liver health.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, it's safe at several milligrams per day. I've experimented with it and saw that I didn't have to shave for a day if I took around 10 milligrams.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat shares his personal experience with progesterone dosage for reducing facial hair growth.
