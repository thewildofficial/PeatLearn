**RAY PEAT:** "A relative part of my science background is that I descended against some of the fundamental ideas in all of the sciences really, especially in biology. I had a master's degree in humanities from the University of Oregon for several years before I went to study biology. 1968 to 72 for a Ph.D., but I found that when I followed the college instructors' directions to give the students different perspectives on scientific issues in a course called physics for biology majors, the trustees... really didn't want their students to hear the other side of some of the things that were issues then in the 1950s, such as the dangers of fallout from radiation or medical radiation. So my whole activity over the years has been looking at descending ideas in all of the sciences."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to outline his scientific background and research.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1965, I saw a really interesting study by a professor at Oregon State University, which I'd never attended, but in this study she looked at the academic success of graduate students. In all the departments, I think, at Oregon State, which used to be an agricultural college, so it tends to be more agriculture oriented rather than humanities as the university in Eugene, but she ranked the scores on Mendel tests, I think it was the Miller Analogies test. And she looked at the way the brain functions. The Miller Analogies measures mental flexibility as well as vocabulary and other aptitudes, but it's heavy on flexibility. They changed the rules at Parkway every ten questions or so. They used different kinds of analogy. And she found that from the lowest academic achievers in graduate school, the lowest scores on that test corresponded nicely. And up to the middle range of the Miller Analogies test, that increased in rank with the academic success up to the straight A, four point students. But then... As the students' mental scores on the Analogies test increased, their grades decreased. And again, the very highest on the mental abilities were lower, very unsuccessful graduate students. That obviously is a matter of authoritarian fitting in. Being other-directed rather than being powered by curiosity and desire for knowledge, which really didn't fit in and made them fail."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat how authoritarianism manifests itself in academia, referencing his own challenges.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well it's like the fascist hospitals too I mean I was threatened to be thrown out on the streets when I needed care in the hospital because I wouldn't go along with one of their procedures. I mean that's fascism. Yeah the ruling class really has defined the words and where Mussolini clearly defined what he called fascism as the blending of state power with corporate power. That's exactly what is now being called free trade and the trade deals which are essentially allowing the biggest corporations to impose their political standards on the rest of the world in an empire. So free trade is really... subjecting political rules in other countries to the international corporations' benefit. The environment in Mexico, for example, has been deteriorating for several decades with the oculadora industry along the border, but then the NAFTA... started because corn can be grown industrially on a huge scale in the United States. The subsidized corn has to be freely admitted in New Mexico, where people using subsistence methods depended for their livelihood on growing their own corn animals. And so this subsidized cheap corn displaced farmers and created the influx of immigrants who are wanted for cheap labor in the farms and probably eventually, if there are any factories left, they would be doing Macaladora-type work in the U.S."

**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the concept of fascism and its connection to corporate power and trade deals.

**RAY PEAT:** "The sulfites are reductants. And the stress state is an exaggeratedly reduced state, and the things that promote good oxidative metabolism can help the intestine greatly, keeping your thyroid in good condition. And sulfites are anti-thyroid too, right? Yeah, and the slightly antiseptic foods, such as cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots. Raw carrots and saturated fats, these help to keep down the potentially toxic bacteria. Yeah, and saturated fats are, like coconut oil, is antimicrobial. Yeah, and just keeping the digestive system stimulated and very active so that you tend to digest the germs rather than being digested by them. Yeah, so... keeping your bowel movements frequent and also just another thing the one probiotic that I found quite useful for me personally was Dr. Ron's ultra-pure probiotic and that was one I didn't have adverse reactions to and I have had adverse reactions to a lot of the probiotics sold over the counter so that one is over the counter too you can find it on online Dr. Ron's probiotics and yeah the man mentioned that he was feeling better. Digesting milk when he had been eating cheese and yogurt and you do get a lot of natural probiotics from eating cultured dairy."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about re-inoculating their stomach and potential issues with sulfites, suggesting dairy products helped them.

**RAY PEAT:** "The circulation increases as the metabolic rate is increased under the influence of thyroid cells start producing carbon dioxide which opens up blood vessels and it also accelerates all of the normalizing processes of creating replacement cells for example rather than scar tissue. With aging there's a tendency to fill in with fibrotic simply useless scar-like connective tissue in between where replacement stem cells haven't been able to develop and a good supply of energy and oxygen can renew tissues. My own experience when I was experimenting with, among other things, DHEA and progesterone, but also thyroid, I found that in my 40s I grew more than an inch while losing some belly fat, staying the same weight, but my muscles developed as the fat disappeared, and even at that age my bones were elongating. Thank you for watching. So the repair and regeneration and anti-aging effects of thyroid used to be talked about in the 1920s and 30s, but since the pharmaceutical industry started suppressing the idea of treating hypothyroidism with thyroid supplements, since then attention has been strongly directed. away from those restorative effects of thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** A caller describes their lips becoming fuller and pinker after starting thyroid medication and asks for a physiological explanation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many things, but um, high estrogen tends to be the, both high cortisol and high estrogen make up for the metabolic deficiency in hypothyroidism. And there are several skin blood vessels. Things that you see with high estrogen, high cortisol. Little red dots of broken capillaries or just nests of overdeveloped capillaries and small arterioles producing red spots of different sizes and shapes. And sometimes the big bluish things called vascular spiders. And then... Our varicose veins at a very low energy state, estrogen tends to weaken the basic muscle tone in the veins. And progesterone and thyroid restore the muscle tone so that the valves are on the walls of the big veins. And if the vein relaxes, the valves... don't work as valves because the flaps can't reach each other. And so if you just contract the veins under the influence of progesterone and thyroid, the valve will begin working and restore the function of the vein. Then the tissues are better oxygenated so the hormones, vascular endothelial growth factor, for example, VEGF, is produced under the influence of... of high estrogen and stress and inflammatory mediators and it tends to be very much lower under the influence of thyroid. So you don't need those extra abnormal blood vessels when your thyroid is functioning well. But when you are taking a certain dose of thyroid, the thyroxine accumulates in your tissues with a half-life of two weeks. So you have to watch. People will usually feel great as they increase their dose some point in the first week or two, but if you're taking more than you need, you'll reach a point where you find that you're taking more than enough. You'll get out of breath and your heart will pound or something. But then when it accumulates and levels off, then your body. That goes through further adjustment, so you have to keep watching over a period of a few months, and then you have to watch for seasonal effects because you don't need as much thyroid in the summer as you do in the winter."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the physiological reason for noticeable green veins in their legs becoming less apparent after starting thyroid medication.

**RAY PEAT:** "The doctrine of eugenics actually went from the United States and England to Germany and Hitler put it into practice but it never left American biology. The Institute for Social... He was used to implement it basically for the Americans. Yeah, the Americans have continued citing......the work which was done scientifically to justify killing Jews and Slavs and black people and anyone that Hitler considered politically inappropriate. These pseudo-scientific studies were... essentially designed by Conrad Lorentz, who got a Nobel Prize, and our American geneticists have sort of worshipped these ideas of genetic determinism, including determinism even of political belief."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat for any final thoughts, and he brings up the topic of eugenics.
