**RAY PEAT:** In 1900, Moses Gomberg at the University of Michigan had produced a stable free radical, which, with a free but fairly unreactive electron, produced a deep purple color with a very small amount of the molecule in solution. This started other chemists thinking about what produces color in molecules. Over the next four or five years, several chemists were theorizing about mobile electrons in molecules like benthoquinone. These were really at the center of mainstream chemistry, but even the average university chemist wasn't up to date on the theories of electrons. It was only in 1916 that Gilbert Lewis gave his theory of electron bonding, and then Niels Bohr, I think it was 1921, described his picture of how electrons orbit around molecules, and then several years later Linus Pauling gave a more detailed description of how electrons work in chemical bonds. So the very best biochemists were just getting started around 1935 thinking about electrons. And biologists and medical doctors couldn't imagine how electrons could have anything to do with the life process. So the process that is involved in oxidation is the movement of electrons from a fuel such as sugar or fat to oxygen. And in the process, there's a lot of extractable energy in some form. When the biologists finally admitted that electrons had to be explained somehow, they wanted to compartmentalize how the energy is used in moving from glucose or fat down to oxygen. So they invented little machines that would take a sort of a quantum of energy out of that moving electron and attach it to various little machines which they called pumps or motors and so on and explained muscle contraction and secretion and all processes in this very primitive concept of biological energy where the actual process is a flow, a streaming process. There's no standing still for the electron. The cell dies if it isn't constantly moving the electrons from fuel to oxygen. So this is a process that's going on. Every breath we take and every single cell in our body is moving these electrons from sugar or fat to oxygen. When you try to measure the electrical energy of a cell, you stick a needle in, for example, to measure the voltage. And people have a sort of a standing static picture of the cell in which it's a membrane and inside there are statistically randomized molecules carrying electrons and so they think of it as effectively a bag of electrons which they're measuring. What they're doing is disrupting this intricate constant flow from fuel to oxygen and they're measuring an injured cell. Every time they try to stop it to fit their model, they're destroying some cell process. And in the 1940s, St. George, he published some of his work with oxidative processes in muscle and how energy is used. And he was the one who discovered that ATP literally makes muscle contract. He extracted muscle and used various simplified preparations to show that simply adding ATP made the muscle move. And he was thinking of something electronic going on related to oxidation and fuel use and so on. But he found that the contracted muscle in the presence of ATP didn't break down the ATP molecule. The ATP causes muscle to contract without changing its bond structure.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for an outline of the history of oxidative metabolism as elucidated by scientists like Frederick William Koch, Otto Warburg, and Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, and how this understanding was derailed from its potential medical applications.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the... When I was in graduate school, the muscle biologists all over the world were saying that ATP has a high energy bond of 11 or 14 kilocalories per mole, and it's that energy that can be used to explain the little muscle motors in the muscles that cause movement. Without that high energy, it would be impossible to explain their motors, but meanwhile, Gilbert Ling had... I think he probably read Sanctuary II and was aware that ATP didn't have to break down to release energy. He pointed out that the energy of the whole molecule of ATP sticking to the protein of the muscle has an energy of stickiness or adsorption energy of 21 kilocalories per mole, twice as much as the hypothetical bond energy, and that explains why it makes the protein change without having to break down simply. The relationship between the molecules shifts the whole structure.
**CONTEXT:** The host expresses surprise that muscle contraction can occur without ATP breakdown, contrary to their understanding from school.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so it's the same thing as suffocating or being overstimulated. There's no oxygen to turn off the production of lactic acid, and then the lactic acid itself is an irritant stimulant. It shifts the cell away from the use of oxygen towards the production of more lactic acid. So it's like a vicious cycle here.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on how a cell can be in a state of oxygen deficiency or overstimulation, leading to cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so it's the same thing as suffocating or being overstimulated.
