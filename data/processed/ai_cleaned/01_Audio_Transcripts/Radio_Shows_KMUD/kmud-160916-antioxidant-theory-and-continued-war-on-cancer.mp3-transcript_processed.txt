**RAY PEAT:** My biology study was at the University of Oregon 1968 to 72 where I worked on my thesis on reproductive aging and the oxidative metabolic changes that are involved in aging. At that time I was really just bringing together information on oxidative metabolism that had been developed over the preceding 50 years. And I thought the situation was ripe for sort of a conclusion. I at the time couldn't have imagined this. 45 years later, it would have gone backward to the 1890s situation of the government pushing a purely genetic causation of cancer and other diseases.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, could you outline your academic and professional background for those people listening who may not have heard our show before?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s there were lots of new discoveries. Daniel Mazzea and his collaborator Katsuma Don discovered how the mitotic apparatus works, the controlled cell division, and they found that the reduction of the sulfur groups, the sulfhydryls, increased at the time of cell division. And if you look at those as the interface between metabolic energy production and cell growth and differentiation, it suggests a very direct course to curing the tumor-producing diseases at least, and the inflammatory diseases by working on metabolism. The genes are only in the background, don't have any role in therapy actually, except everyone has to have genes. I have to produce proteins and everything else.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned in your newsletter, "100 Years of Cancer Metabolism," the stark contrast between the scientific inquiry-based approach of early 20th-century biologists like Otto Warburg and Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, and the mechanistic cancer-cidal approaches of the multi-billion dollar cancer industry. How does this relate to the gene theory?

**RAY PEAT:** I think a lot of people recognize the term oxidant and antioxidant probably erroneously and we've always looked at antioxidants as being the things we were necessarily looking for. When, in fact, when they've done autopsies in the brain, they find things like glutathione which is one of the main antioxidants in the system is actually not that depleted and so they're looking at other reasons for aging and cell death etc.
**CONTEXT:** How is your current understanding of antioxidants different from the common perception?

**RAY PEAT:** The ones that are therapeutically useful such as vitamin E and vitamin C actually shift the balance inside the cell. Vitamin C is known to be in a very highly oxidized condition so it isn't really the vitamin C we know. It's dehydro-ascorbate. It's inside the healthy cell and these are maintaining the, it's actually a constant flow of electrons, but the balance at every moment is pushed in the direction closer to oxygen and farther from the reducing electrons. And so if you're deficient in vitamin E and vitamin C and so on, the electrons......predominate and shift over to reducing the sulfur groups all through the cell into the sulfhydryl form, promoting inflammation. And if you think about what happens when any kind of injury happens, whether it's a microbe or getting stuck with a thorn or whatever, you disrupt the ability of the organized tissue to deliver oxygen and sugar and other nutrients to the cell. And so the cell in that area is starved, can't oxidize, and it has an immediate shift over to the basically the antioxidant side. The cell has a variety of enzymes that function as antioxidants, but they are only activated during injury or stress. And what happens to the cells in that condition is the sulfhydryls are reduced, the mitotic apparatus is activated, the cells de-differentiate, lose their functions except to grow and divide and move. So they creep into the injured area and multiply to repair the area and then if the surrounding organism is able to deliver oxygen and sugar and other nutrients then they are able to differentiate and finish the healing process. The theory of antioxidant that we don't want to oxidize things is really we want the cell to be oxidizing and an injured cell is not using the oxygen. It's actually in an anti-oxygen state. Yeah, and if you get stuck in the antioxidant state, that keeps the healing process from being completed and that's where cancer is. It's stuck in the inflamed antioxidant state is only able to divide without knowing exactly what it should be doing.
**CONTEXT:** How do potent antioxidants like apigenin and naringenin actually work within the cell?

**RAY PEAT:** The coenzyme Q10 is now known to fit very specifically into certain places in the mitochondria that deliver electrons to the electron transport system, delivering it ultimately to oxygen. Complete the production of ATP and carbon dioxide. So it plugs right into the oxidative system. So it's actually oxidizing. It's oxidizing everything upstream to deliver those electrons into the oxidizing pigments which deliver the electrons to oxygen. So it's a necessary link between oxygen and all of the reducing factors. So if you don't have that link, that's one of the essential links that you need to prevent the electrons from going into the growth cell division system.
**CONTEXT:** So, if cells don't have enough oxygen, they'll start dividing, potentially becoming cancerous if they don't get that oxygen and the oxidizing process happening?

**RAY PEAT:** And where the actual antioxidant function comes in is when you have an oversupply of polyunsaturated fats, for example. When you don't have enough oxygen and go into that inflamed cell diffusion state, the electrons that can't be taken up by oxygen are free to locate on iron atoms, for example. And the iron, when it's reduced, there's always some potential iron, but the older you are, the more free iron there's likely to be in your cells. The electrons activate the iron, which then attacks any of the polyunsaturated fats in the environment, and that sets up an oxygen-consuming system which produces nothing of value. The electrons have no place proper to go, so they go to iron, which then gives its electron to the polyunsaturated fat, which becomes a free radical. And consumes, reacts directly, then sometimes with oxygen, or with more iron, and you get cycles of oxidation without purpose.
**CONTEXT:** So, we want the oxidation to be in the cell, producing carbon dioxide, using sugar and oxygen, and the whole proper cellular respiration to be going on, not to where you're in this reduced state, or your body, the PUFA, the polyunsaturated fats are so hungry for oxygen, and so is the iron, and so those things are oxidizing and not producing. Is that a good way to understand it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and in the process of consuming oxygen, they are creating oxygen starvation. And so they're setting up the situation to spread. So it's a very energy wasteful situation. Yeah, an oxygen wasting system.
**CONTEXT:** Is that because the polyunsaturates will attract the oxygens more strongly than the respiring cell?

**RAY PEAT:** They become a trap for oxygen. And as they deteriorate, they interact with the iron and proteins and create imitation oxidative enzymes. As a short circuit directly between NADH and oxygen by way of the iron and proteins that are condensed in the form of age pigment or lipofuscin made up of polyunsaturated fats and parts of the cell which have been destroyed and those function as a very powerful oxygen sink, keeping the mitochondria from getting the oxygen they need.
**CONTEXT:** So that's why you don't want to eat fried foods that are fried in liquid vegetable oils because you're going to create oxygen starvation for your cells that need the oxygen because the vegetable oil is going to soak it all up.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and with time as that process accumulates, for example, small amounts practically invisible of the age pigment begin accumulating and keeping the cells in a state in which they take up preferentially more of the polyunsaturated fats if they're available. And so with age, organs like the brain, which are normally very high energy users, become slowed down and reduced, and preferentially concentrate more and more of the highly unsaturated fats. Especially DHA, the predominant fat in fish oil, concentrates more and more in the brain with age, and makes the brain more and more susceptible to the lipid peroxidation and losing function because the oxygen is being diverted.
**CONTEXT:** And it's the byproducts of that lipid peroxidation which are themselves very damaging.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and tends to produce more of the age pigment. So what is cumulative is the catalytic products of the degenerating polyunsaturates and not specifically mutations in the mitochondria which the Harman free radical theory of aging insisted on.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that the placenta will try and filter out polyunsaturated fats from the mother's diet. What happens if the mother has low blood glucose?

**RAY PEAT:** The placenta preferentially absorbs glucose and fructose, but if the diet, if the mother happens to have low blood glucose, then more of the mother's circulating fats, as your blood sugar goes down, you liberate into the bloodstream free fatty acids, so when the mother has hypoglycemia, the placenta loses the ability to screen out the fats to some extent, where the baby should make its own brain fats purely from glucose. And those would be saturated fats, those wouldn't be polyunsaturated fats, correct? Primarily saturated, but then we intrinsically are able to make a series of polyunsaturated fats called D. Omega minus nine series, and those are present in any healthy baby's brain, whether it's a human or a cow or a bird or rodent, the developing brain turns sugar into saturated fats and the omega minus nine series. And the brain is predominantly lipid.
**CONTEXT:** About 50% fat, very high fat content compared to other tissues.

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin E has been proven to reduce the incidence of seizures in lots of animal experiments and the process of stress in a brain cell. It lowers the oxygen availability, triggers that reductive process, causing lipid peroxidation. And if your tissues are well saturated with vitamin E, that's much less likely to happen.
**CONTEXT:** How does this relate to epilepsy and polyunsaturates in the diet?

**RAY PEAT:** There are a few researchers who have surveyed a lot of different animals and found that the highly unsaturated animals in the given species don't live as long as those less highly unsaturated. Halbert and Pamplona are two of the people who have done the most research. And they find that birds in general are much less unsaturated in all their tissues than mammals. And part of that is that they don't activate enzymes that extend. And for example, linoleic acid in a mammal is processed to remove electrons until it can, with the addition of more carbons, can become EPA or DHA, the highly unstable polyunsaturates. The birds simply don't use those enzymes to the extent that mammals do.
**CONTEXT:** So, birds can eat polyunsaturates and it just doesn't turn into EPA or DHA?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so they have more of the unprocessed linoleic acid than the highly unstable, longer ones, and part of that, I think, is because they live at a much higher body temperature than mammals. Mammals are usually somewhere between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the birds generally are well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, up to as much as 110 degrees, and that means that they will very quickly oxidize any of the most unstable fats, if they eat something with a highly unsaturated fat, it's more likely that the fat will be used for energy rather than circulating to cause trouble.
**CONTEXT:** How about the decreased problems with PUFA in the presence of higher temperature? You're saying that purely the higher temperature could cause PUFAs to be oxidized more rapidly and therefore not within the cell, but actually within a GI tract or elsewhere?

**RAY PEAT:** He's just saying it's not going to get stored and it will get used up for fuel right away because their metabolism is so fast. Yeah, even in a mammal at, say, 98 degrees, it turns out that a very high proportion of the DHA breaks down, even by the time it gets into the bloodstream. And it's the breakdown products that act on the immune system to suppress inflammation by temporarily stopping the production of prostaglandins.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding CO2 breathing machines and CO2 baths, what are your thoughts on their use?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it was in 1908 that someone wrote an article about the medical uses of CO2 as it's treating colon inflammation, vaginal inflammation and such with the actual application of the gas, or filling a bathtub. Since CO2 is heavier than air, if you seal the drains on a bathtub, you can just fill the bathtub with it and get in. And the person said an hour in the bathtub was like a day at the beach. You could probably leave your clothes on as well, couldn't you? Yeah, you don't have to take your clothes off because it instantly goes right through the clothing. You can feel it as a warm sensation because it relaxes blood vessels in the skin. And we have used huge plastic bags that come up to the shoulders. You fill the bag and then get on a chair or something so you can step in it without spilling the CO2. And pull it up around your body without spilling it and then tighten it around the top and that will usually stay put for at least an hour and your skin gets pink and warm from the relaxing effect and it has a systemic effect. It absorbs very quickly into your bloodstream and affects your blood pressure, improves pumping efficiency of your heart, reducing peripheral resistance in the arteries. Positively associated with good health. And the increasing your CO2 lowers all of the transmitters of inflammation by shifting you out of the over-reduced electronic state, it suppresses lactic acid production, for example. It helps your mitochondria to use the oxygen quickly. Yeah, in many different ways. It activates the Krebs cycle and reduces meaningless excitation. It lets you produce the energy in the right way rather than an inflamed pointless way.
**CONTEXT:** Can you drink sparkling water and would that help internally as opposed to externally?

**RAY PEAT:** You tend to burp it out and lose much of it, but the little bit you absorb is very helpful. I think that's one of the reasons why it's so calming on an upset stomach, right? Soda water or... Yeah, I think Priestley was really working on carbon dioxide when he accidentally discovered oxygen.
**CONTEXT:** Is CoQ10 good for your heart? And how much do you think is a good amount?

**RAY PEAT:** It is very good. It is good. So it's good to take CoQ10. I don't think anyone really knows what the best amount is.
**CONTEXT:** What about EPA? Is that good or bad? I heard that EPA was really good to support the heart function.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's exactly the wrong kind of antioxidant. It's the reductive kind that imitates stress and promotes degenerative processes. So it's okay to have CoQ10 but not to have EPA? That's correct. Uh-huh. And it also says that it supports your mood and it's better for your brain function. And you don't think that either? No, definitely not better for your brain function.
**CONTEXT:** So, an aging brain will have more and more of this EPA, which means your brain actually gets less oxygen and becomes more demented and more senile?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's one of the main antioxidants Dr. Pete was outlining at the beginning of the show. Yeah, along with vitamin C. And vitamin K2 functions with coenzyme Q10 to deliver energy.
**CONTEXT:** What about vitamin E? Is that good or not?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's good. I'm doubtful about that. It's been associated with changes in the pancreas, like diabetes.
**CONTEXT:** So you're not sure about glucosamine?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the first caller again. Thank you for letting me jump in line again. I had another question that came to mind. Does MCT oil do everything, every good thing that that you recommend or that you say coconut oil can do from a health and metabolism point of view? Yeah, essentially they're doing the same thing of bypassing your stored polyunsaturated fats and letting you oxidize more safely the saturated fats. But one of the problems is that they are so mobile relative to the longer chains that they can be irritating to your stomach and intestines. You have to take it in a good balance with other foods. And that's why a lot of times these supplements like the vitamin D is in it, MCT oil or the vitamin K, they can be irritating on people's digestion and therefore then they can use those vitamins topically if they experience intestinal irritation from the MCTs.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relation between vitamin K and CoQ10? Is it a precursor for CoQ10?

**RAY PEAT:** It works at the same site in the mitochondrion and it seems to just act as a stabilizer or amplifier of the effect of CoQ10. So it's almost like if you take vitamin K, you're helping protect the CoQ10 that you have in your system? Yeah, I think vitamin E and K both have that function of working at the CoQ10 site.
**CONTEXT:** So do you think it's necessary for someone to supplement with CoQ10 if they're using vitamin K?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, I wouldn't mix them. Even in your stomach, I think it's good to take them at a different time because I've seen a reaction which, at least in the presence of light, I think it might cause other reactions to happen when the vitamin E reacts with vitamin K.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding thyroid levels and inflammation, what are your thoughts on the endocrinologist's recommendation to increase thyroid medication to make the thyroid go to sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, keeping the TSH, that's probably a safe level, but I know lots of people who keep it at 0.01 and less and feel fine. But the TSH is a promoter of inflammation, not only in the thyroid gland, but in blood vessels, bone marrow, every place it's been studied. It promotes inflammation and it happens to be activated by the stress oxygen-deprived condition of the cells. So it's one of the mediators of the oxygen-deficient stress condition along with estrogen, prostaglandins, cortisol, and nitric oxide. TSH itself is an inflammation promoter, so if you govern your dose by things like heart rate, temperature, and especially your middle of the day temperature and resting heart rate, and your appetite, and thirst, and quality of sleep, and a doctor can do the Achilles reflex relaxation test to find out how your nerves and muscles are acting. The people have different sensitivities to the T3 and T4, and the tissue specific effect of either of those is affected by it. How inflamed you are generally, if you have a lot of polyunsaturated fat and prostaglandin circulating then a given amount of T3 isn't going to have the same local effect on any of your tissues. So really this persistence of an inflamed thyroid that's where I'm feeling like I'm being strangled. May have more to do with my generalized inflammatory response. Yeah, I think so.
**CONTEXT:** So, to summarize, to try to keep your TSH as close to zero as possible, and the blood levels of free T3 and free T4 are not as indicative of a good measurement. Are not a good guideline to assess your thyroid function? All those things Dr. Pete mentioned like your heart rate, your temperature, and your appetite, those things are much more accurate at diagnosing yourself.

**RAY PEAT:** Also when you're low thyroid, you produce a lot of antibodies to lots of things and you can also produce antibodies to your own thyroid. So part of the low thyroid condition is producing extra antibodies. And those antibodies are part of a cleanup process. So when you stop the inflammation, the antibody production will stop and then it'll take several months for the circulating level of the antibodies to disappear.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding magnesium supplementation and belly fat, what are your thoughts on magnesium glycinate and other forms?

**RAY PEAT:** I've never used that one myself. But all of the forms that I've experimented with, and for quite a few other people, magnesium supplements can cause intestinal inflammation or irritation, and I would guess that that's happening with an increase of histamine nitric oxide. And absorbing endotoxin and such. Yeah, so it's not actually an increase in belly flattening, it's probably more due to an increased bogginess or a water retention within the tissues that this magnesium may be causing that would then push your stomach further out and might make you feel like you'd actually increase more fat.
**CONTEXT:** Are you suggesting that increased inflammation could actually lay down more fat?

**RAY PEAT:** The fat would increase over a period of many months or years, but the water can increase overnight.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding prostate issues and urination difficulties, what is your approach?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid is the basic thing because it helps you make the anti-inflammatory pro-oxygen steroids. Pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA and testosterone and keeps down the estrogen and when anything is irritating your intestine, increasing histamine and other anti-oxidative mediators, the inflammation spreads from your intestine through your whole pelvis in particular and it will cause the smooth muscle of the bladder wall to become hyperactive and oversensitive and that causes frequent urination and lots of people assume that there's something wrong with their prostate when it's really the intestine inflaming the whole urinary system. Inflaming the irritation and that then the magnesium might be possibly indicated? I think so. You can get adequate magnesium. If your thyroid lets your cells retain magnesium, then 400 milligrams per day is easy to get from foods, fruit, fruit juice, milk, cheese, eggs, meat, seafood. All of those things are very good sources of magnesium. Coffee. Yeah, unfortunately, a lot of those are...
**CONTEXT:** You've said that when you have a thyroid deficiency, you're not able to store magnesium properly, and so it almost is like you have a magnesium deficiency as well.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and you can correct a magnesium deficiency if you go at your thyroid dosing carefully over a few days. It helps you extract it from your ordinary diet. Right, so you don't need to supplement such large doses. Yeah, in the first two or three days if you're going to start a thyroid supplement. Sometimes magnesium helps you adapt more quickly to the thyroid, but usually for a vegetarian you can boil any kind of green leaves. Doesn't matter what kind, but the magnesium comes out very quickly when you boil it. Just make sure to drink the water you boiled in. Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding eye color changes, why is this happening and is it true that the lighter the eye color, the healthier you are?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know about that, but I know that people who use prostaglandins as eye drops to treat glaucoma very often have a darkening of the iris. And that I think is a directly toxic effect for the like, ultraviolet light darkens your skin because it's injuring it, and the pigment is a defensive reaction to protect you against ultraviolet light. I think the prostaglandin, which is made from polyunsaturated fats, is activating the defensive formation of pigment in the iris. So I suspect that it's good if you reduce your polyunsaturated fat intake and have lightening of your iris. I suspect it's a corrective process.
**CONTEXT:** Just last month, an article came out by Su and Yin identifying EPA and DHA as brain toxic fats.

**RAY PEAT:** Good. I mean, the evidence is just so overwhelming. I don't know how people that listen to this show can possibly continue eating or taking this stuff. Anyway, it takes a long time sometimes for people to come to finally... Well, there's so much mainstream media. It's just like with everything else. There's so much mainstream media telling you that EPA and DHA are good for your brain.
