**RAY PEAT:** I don't make a clear distinction between any kind of arthritis or even between heart failure, atherosclerosis, various degenerative diseases, and any of the forms of arthritis. I think the interesting thing is to explain how a few basic metabolic problems have these very different looking expressions. And the really interesting research over the last 30 years or so has been in showing how inflammation relates to metabolism and what the factors are that can increase inflammation or reduce our ability to resolve, get over the inflammation. And in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, many years ago, I knew two women who were completely disabled with huge swollen knee joints and hands that they couldn't use. And I was interested in the fact that the condition developed when they started taking estrogen. One was only in her 30s, and her doctor, when she developed the arthritis, I think he told her that she needed to increase the dose of estrogen because of the very deep belief that estrogen is protective against almost everything. And I spent several hours over a period of two or three weeks going over some of the research with her, and then she would, after each time we talked, she would go back to her doctor, and the doctor would say she had to increase the estrogen. But finally, she was getting worse, and she decided just to stop it. The other one had not taken so long to reconsider and had recovered within a week or two of stopping it. And this one had the same experience, total relief, clearing of the swellings. And that got me interested in why they recovered so fast when they simply stopped estrogen. And so I kept that in mind. And the next person I saw with rheumatoid arthritis was a man about 50, 48 years old, who every afternoon his knee would just suddenly swell up hugely, and during the night it would get better, but he was increasingly disabled, hardly able to keep working at his bench fixing televisions. But remembering the way the women recovered from when they stopped estrogen, I thought he might have the same imbalance and got him a bottle of 500 milligrams of injectable progesterone, which he covered his leg with all in one application, and about two hours later, the inflammation was down, and the next day it didn't return. And I saw him, I think it was 40 years later, and he was just starting to get a knee inflammation again, never had a return in all of those years. So I was convinced that estrogen had a central role, that progesterone could be more curative apparently than cortisol. The glucocorticoids are the main popular treatment, but people usually end up using those for years, and one of the main side effects of the glucocorticoids is loss of bone density. Rheumatoid arthritis, which tends to involve overgrowth of the bone around the joint, shades over eventually in the breaking of the bones from osteoporosis. And I started reading about the osteoarthritis and saw that some of the studies that were published only in books, not in the medical journals, made a clear association between estrogen and osteoarthritis. Even though the medical journals are very consistent in saying osteoarthritis, with its loss of bone and cartilage, is caused by estrogen deficiency. I tend to believe that the research published in books somehow had been excluded from the journals. And so looking at the research on what activates the osteoclasts that cause bone breakdown in osteoarthritis, endotoxin is a major activator of the osteoclasts. So that would have a role to play in both osteoarthritis as well as osteoporosis. And in all of the degenerative diseases. And several things follow once you start having endotoxin absorbed in your system, then you begin overproducing nitric oxide and prostaglandins, for example.
**CONTEXT:** How does endotoxin relate to degenerative diseases and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** It's produced by bacteria, and it's a combination of fatty acids and carbohydrate, lipopolysaccharides is its chemical name. And the main source is from the intestinal tract. The intestinal bacteria are always producing it. We absorb a little bit of it all the time, and it acts as sort of a stimulant to the immune system, and other cells are being constantly irritated by it. So in everyday life, it doesn't have a harmful effect. The bactericidal effect of the carrot suppresses the growth of the bacteria, and then the fiber absorbs and stimulates the excretion. Yeah, and there's always a little bit of it getting into the liver, and probably a little always seeping into the general bloodstream, but in a very small amount, it doesn't have those serious degenerative effects. But when you let your liver function slow down, it massively gets past the liver barriers and it starts poisoning all of your systems, increasing nitric oxide and drastically lowering the oxygen metabolism. And this is where endotoxin and estrogen come together. They both interfere with the metabolic use of oxygen. And so that turns on glycolysis, turning sugar into lactic acid. The lactic acid shifts everything throughout the more irritated tissue or organ is, the more reduced it is, the more electron excess it has. And this shifts everything coherently through that tissue and organ and eventually through the whole organism. The concept of reductive stress is now pretty well established, but 50 years ago, everyone was thinking about oxidative stress. Really, the degenerative processes are exactly the opposite: not enough oxygen, too much reduction. And so estrogen and endotoxin do many things that interfere with the use of oxygen and shift us over to the glycolytic lactic acid producing condition in which we, since we can't oxidize glucose, and we are forced to oxidize fats, and that's very inefficient and leads to lipid peroxidation and the increased production of prostaglandins.
**CONTEXT:** How do prostaglandins relate to inflammation and polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Right, which are pain mediators for those people listening. They are mediators of pain and inflammation. If our bodies are well loaded with polyunsaturated fats, which we don't want, then that tends to increase steadily with aging. And so as a person increases their stores of polyunsaturated fats, every little stress becomes more reductive and more inflammatory. So the prostaglandins act increasingly to amplify any little stress.
**CONTEXT:** How do stress signals from inflamed tissues affect the thyroid and pituitary, and what is the role of TSH?

**RAY PEAT:** The thyroid gland is responding to the same stress signals that the local connective tissue is responding to. So the nitric oxide, for example, goes up in the whole organism, and this shifts the brain and the pituitary to increase the thyroid-stimulating hormone while blocking the ability of the thyroid gland to produce the hormone. So your functional hormone goes down while the TSH rises. And even within the normal range of TSH, which currently is something like 0.4 to 5.0, I think, even though supposedly the American Association of Endocrinologists lowered it to 0.3 to 3.3, I think, even within that normal range, the upper part of the range is now known to be associated with an increased risk of death from cancer and heart disease and other things. I think the best evidence is that you want to keep your TSH low because it's a factor that promotes all types of inflammation, especially rheumatoid swelling, loss of energy, tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1 and 6 in particular, and so on. So TSH is a major responder to the stress signals which come from the intestine and the degenerating joints, for example.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between thyroid antibodies and joint-specific antibodies?

**RAY PEAT:** And the antibodies that have been defined as thyroid-specific antibodies turn out to be joint-specific antibodies as well. Like with heart disease and atherosclerosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, it actually doesn't seem to involve attack on the blood vessels by antibodies, but it's simply something going wrong in the whole organism that causes more or less simultaneous degeneration of the blood vessels and the joints. It isn't a specific autoimmune process, even though the whole organism can be said to be in an autoimmune state.
**CONTEXT:** What is the primary function of the immune system according to Jamie Cuddenliff's view, and how does this relate to inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** The primary function of what is called the immune system is a maintenance of order of the body and its tissues. And when something goes wrong, it can be an organism causing damage to the tissues. In that case, the organism is destroyed and creates a specific immunity to that type of organism. That's really, in his view, a side effect of the basic clean-up process. And there are many theories of virus or bacteria of various types causing rheumatoid arthritis and the other inflammatory diseases. But I don't think you need those. When you have an energetically precarious tissue condition, it just takes any little cause to tip it over the edge into an uncontrolled degeneration and inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** How does pregnancy affect rheumatoid arthritis, and what is the role of progesterone in longevity?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the things about the cycle and degenerative diseases that people have noticed is that rheumatoid arthritis is frequently completely resolved during a pregnancy and then returns afterwards. And I think it's the huge production of progesterone that the placenta takes over during pregnancy. And in both animals and humans, the number of pregnancies during a lifetime correlates very well with longevity. The more babies produced, the longer the mother lives and the better the health is. And that, if you look at the age of puberty, the mortality rate decreases from infancy when the organism is very dependent on conditions as it grows and becomes more autonomous. At around the age of 12, the likelihood of dying is very, very low. Then from puberty on, there's a steady increase in the risk of dying from any cause. And I think that's the same estrogen risk factor that when the organism is detecting something in the environment that is threatening, it turns on the reproductive apparatus. And when that apparatus is working efficiently, it produces these huge amounts of progesterone that have a life-protecting, anti-inflammatory, life-extending effect. But if the estrogen isn't adequately compensated because of low thyroid or toxins, anything interfering with progesterone, then the estrogen cyclically produces damage to the organism and accelerates the aging process. So the reason that a cycle is valuable to maintain is that what cuts it off is the failure to produce enough progesterone. So even though the actual production of estrogen decreases somewhat at menopause, the effect of estrogen making the inflammatory factors that lead to degeneration, those become persistent in the absence of the cyclic production of progesterone. So it would be better if you could delay puberty to the age of 70 or 80, but in the absence of that ability, then having the regular, fairly generous production of progesterone is what makes it valuable to keep cycling as long as you can.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of berberine-containing herbs in relation to endotoxin and nitric oxide?

**RAY PEAT:** Infections of any sort are going to increase nitric oxide and impair oxidative energy production. Which goes back to what I was trying to say earlier about the intestines and eating foods that feed the bacteria that then make the endotoxin that then poisons the system and creates that vicious circle of inflammation. The berberine-containing herbs are very antibacterial, and then they're also stopping the nitric oxide production if they're antibacterial and stopping the bacteria.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between vitamin D2 and D3, and what are their effects on metabolism and weight?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know of any real evidence, but there were some publications around 1970 and arguing that D2 was contributing to atherosclerosis and the calcification of blood vessels. And up until that time, milk had been reinforced with vitamin D2, and suddenly every milk producer in the country around that time just quietly shifted to D3, and that was really just a few papers with superficial, largely opinions rather than facts, but it convinced most people to stop taking the risk of using the fungal form of vitamin D. Well, I think it's the parathyroid hormone, which is suppressed by calcium and vitamin D. Both types of vitamin D will keep the parathyroid hormone down, and so calcium and vitamin D both reduce inflammation in multiple ways. And the reduced inflammation goes with a more productive, efficient, higher rate of metabolism, keeping the weight gain down, stopping the production of fat from protein and sugar. And from taking too much or monitoring your levels so you don't get too much, you want to have a blood test every couple months until you find a stable level. You don't really want it any higher than 75, and you don't really want any lower than 50, so 50 to 75 is a good reference range to have for your vitamin D level, and you'd want to check it. You wouldn't want to just take a load of it because it can be harmful in high levels. Most probably helping your liver store sugar better. Losing weight. There are really a lot of publications showing that a high calcium and vitamin D intake will do almost everything good, including the avoidance of abdominal fat, tending to have a leaner body and keeping especially inflammation down. And it's just important to note that listeners, when you want to take vitamin D, if you change your dose or start taking it, it takes eight weeks to get to a plateau level before you'd want a blood test.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of glucose and lipid peroxidation in diabetes, and how can aspirin help?

**RAY PEAT:** The beta cells are always tending to regenerate, but they die quickly when you're having diabetes. And the factor that seems to be the main thing that kills them as they are being reborn is lipid peroxidation. And so getting your polyunsaturated fats down, I think aspirin would be one of the protective things. But glucose happens to be the thing that maintains the renewal of constant regeneration of the beta cells. So keeping the metabolism under control so that you aren't degenerating the polyunsaturated fats into lipid peroxides and prostaglandins is the thing to keep in mind. And this takes a long time. It takes four years to replace your fat cells completely. You can make a big change right away. So replace your vegetable oils using polyunsaturated fats. Aspirin improves insulin sensitivity.
**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended dosage of aspirin for blocking lipid peroxidation, and what is the role of vitamin K?

**RAY PEAT:** One thing to remember if you're going to supplement any quantity of aspirin for a long time is to make sure your vitamin K is adequate. Taking a supplement of vitamin K is a good idea because chronic aspirin will tend to give you a bleeding syndrome if you're deficient in K. So the dose is, for one aspirin, one 325 milligram aspirin, you'd want to be taking one milligram of vitamin K. Vitamin E and aspirin have overlapping effects. And so the amount of PUFA that you have stored in your tissues is what governs the amount of those that you need.
**CONTEXT:** How does T3 affect TSH, and what is the role of reverse T3?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, it does. Since you normally have a much higher level of T4 circulating in the body, the pituitary has the ability to convert T4 to T3 locally. So usually T4 is what is suppressing the TSH, but if you get enough T3 into your brain and pituitary, then it's at least as effective as T4. Apparently, it's partly occupying the same response site that the active T3 would and simply competing against it. And even T4 can out-compete T3 if there's too much T4, but there are local deiodinase enzymes that some of them can eliminate reverse T3, and if those are blocked by some stress substances, then the local reverse T3 can accumulate. So the systemic level of T3 and reverse T3 are both important, but they aren't the absolute factor that determines how effective T3 will be. That's why taking temperatures and pulses will tell you if you're getting enough T3 or if your body is converting the T4 that you might be taking or producing naturally into T3.
**CONTEXT:** What are the pros and cons of probiotics in relation to endotoxin and gut bacteria?

**RAY PEAT:** Usually they're helpful, but not always. And it depends on the particular species, and the individual probably can judge best by how you feel when you take it. Yeah, like some species will cause a lot of gas in people, and I think that's harmful. Yeah, some people really get worse when they take certain prebiotics or probiotics. So your particular reaction, I think, should determine that. Because everybody's commensal bacteria, their intestines are different anyway, so you're introducing another one in the interactions.
**CONTEXT:** What is the optimal amount of exercise, and how does it relate to respiration and energy production?

**RAY PEAT:** Any exercise that keeps you or makes you out of breath is not good for you. So gentle, moderate exercise, gentle weight-bearing exercise, definitely what you want. Or if you do have those cardiac bursts, then don't let them last for too long because what you will do is go into the anaerobic respiration. So if you're just walking and, you know, your heart rate's raised a little bit, you know, but you're breathing fine, I mean, you're not like huffing and puffing, that's ideal. You don't want to be over-breathing, and you don't want to get your heart rate up too much. So walking is gentle walking or just gentle weight-bearing exercise.
**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between the number of pregnancies and longevity, according to a Hungarian study?

**RAY PEAT:** There was a study in Hungary that looked at the whole population over a span of a lifetime, and they graphed the number of babies and the age at death of the mothers. And it was a very smooth, perfectly straight increase in longevity with the number of babies up to eight. I read it in the 1970s, and I think it was probably done around 1968 or 69.
