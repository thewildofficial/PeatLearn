**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin D is actually a pro-hormone, it's not strictly speaking in a sense the word vitamin.

**CONTEXT:** Is vitamin D a vitamin or a pro-hormone?

**RAY PEAT:** For preventing rickets, they're pretty much all around the world. There's very little rickets left, but since the idea of vitamin D as a rickets-preventing substance was established, that really cut off thinking and research about what vitamin D really is and what it's doing. And in the 1950s, there was a period when people started thinking about nutrition for themselves like Adele Davis' books came out, and the medical establishment reacted to discourage the public from using their own therapy. For example, vitamin A, there were stories about how horribly toxic it was. It would destroy your brain and make your skin fall off. Very little evidence backing it up, you can poison rats and mice, giving them a million or so units of vitamin A. The same, there were some animal experiments with gigantic doses of vitamin D, and supposedly there was a case of a baby whose mother gave it a million or so units of vitamin D, or took it while she was pregnant. It supposedly caused the bones to thicken so much that there was no room for the brain to develop. And so the newspaper stories in the 50s were saying that vitamin D causes brain damage. And I had been reading Adele Davis in the 50s, but despite that, I was sort of directed away from vitamin D because there was such a taboo about anything more than two or three hundred units per day.

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical perception and misinformation surrounding vitamin D, particularly in the 1950s?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, several of the conditions that are well associated with vitamin D deficiency and some of them have doubled and tripled in the last 20-30 years. And it looks like it's because of that fear of the sunlight, using sunscreen and such. I've talked to a few people who had 10 or below nanograms per milliliter or 15 or 20 and their condition really corresponded to how low they were, like one woman in her 60s. I said she was so weak she could hardly walk, her muscles were simply very, very weak and shrunken and she had, I think it was 7 or 8 mg per ml and within a week of taking just a moderate, I think it was 5,000 units a day, she could walk around and when you look at the symptoms of the people with 15 mg per ml, 20, 25 and so on, you can see gradations of that weakness, depression, shrinking muscles, insensitivity to insulin, tendency to have high blood sugar, all of the most common diseases of stress.

**CONTEXT:** How do low vitamin D levels manifest in terms of physical weakness and metabolic dysfunction?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything related to aging and degenerative and stress of atrial fibrillation, enlargement of the ventricle, calcification of the valves, degeneration of the valves in several different ways. Hardening of the arteries, calcification of the ordinary arteries and even calcification to the extent of what they call a heart stone, a huge mass of calcium.

**CONTEXT:** What cardiovascular and degenerative conditions are associated with low vitamin D levels?

**RAY PEAT:** And that's because people aren't eating enough dairy? Or green leaves. Green leaves and cheese and milk are really the major good sources of calcium and meat, nuts, grains, beans, all of those have terrifically high phosphate content. The excess phosphate and the reaction of the parathyroid hormone to that high phosphate intake. It's exactly the same as the deficiency of vitamin D. So too much phosphate, too little vitamin D, and you get what amounts to an early stage of chronic kidney degeneration. Parathyroid hormone and phosphate are called urinic toxins late stage of kidney disease. People are starting that process very early when they don't use enough calcium and vitamin D.

**CONTEXT:** How does the balance of calcium and phosphate, influenced by vitamin D intake, relate to inflammation and kidney health?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's only when you're in the middle of the day at a moderate latitude. The UVB is so low most of the year. In the high latitudes that it takes a long time to get enough but in like from 11 or 10 to 2 in the summer in high latitudes it only takes 15 or 20 minutes to get enough.

**CONTEXT:** How does latitude and time of day affect UVB exposure for vitamin D synthesis?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the color of your skin, the natural color, makes a tremendous difference and age makes a difference. There is apparently less cholesterol metabolism and such in an old person and just the degree of pigmentation influences the amount of reaction you have to the ultraviolet so that in Mexico, for example, even women who are outside all day, if they have dark skin and are only exposing their face and hands, they tend to be deficient in vitamin D, even at high altitude and a brilliant sunlight.

**CONTEXT:** What factors, beyond latitude, influence vitamin D synthesis from sunlight, such as skin color and age?

**RAY PEAT:** No, that's almost impossible. If you drink, say, two to four quarts of vitamin D supplemented milk, if it isn't whole, legally it has to be supplemented with vitamin D. That's only, I forget, I don't know what the current amount is, but it, I think, has been around 300 units per quart, something like that. And I think the modern levels that are advocated now are up to 2,000, I mean 2,000 to 4,000 IU per day. So if you're getting 300 IU from a quart of vitamin D fortified milk. It's going to take a lot of milk to reach that. And it is in a few other foods, things like oily fish, but again, I know you're not an advocate of oily fish from a PUFA perspective, egg yolks is what I think, I think 20 IU per egg yolk. So you're not going to get a lot of vitamin D from eggs either.

**CONTEXT:** Is it possible to obtain sufficient vitamin D from food sources alone, considering typical dietary intake and recommended supplementation levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, mushrooms have been exposed to light. During the 40s and 50s, the main form of supplemental vitamin D was synthetic by ultraviolet radiation of fungus and the research that changed the popularity of that claimed that it was responsible for the hardening of the arteries of young people starting in the 40s and 50s and this hard sorry to interrupt but this hardening was because of calcium deposition, aberrant calcium. Yeah, which normally happens in a vitamin D deficiency but there were publications arguing that the use of the synthetic vitamin D might have been contributing to abnormal calcium metabolism. I don't know if that's true but that's came out around 1970 and milk additives switched over to a vitamin D3 right after those articles came out so I think they were just being cautious.

**CONTEXT:** What is the history and potential concern regarding synthetic vitamin D derived from fungus and its link to arterial calcification?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if they've been exposed at all to sunlight, they probably account for why many people have a measurable amount of D2 in their serum.

**CONTEXT:** Can mushrooms exposed to sunlight be a source of vitamin D?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for the anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer functions mainly.

**CONTEXT:** What are the primary benefits of consuming mushrooms, beyond their vitamin D content?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the inflammations that you get with low thyroid function are structurally and functionally similar to those you get from a vitamin D deficiency and the thyroid stimulating hormone is an agent of those inflammatory processes Actually more than the the direct effect of thyroxin which lowers TSH the TSH itself directly activates. And that causes tissue to release the inflammatory cytokines, interleukins and so on and parathyroid hormone does that and just by taking vitamin D or increasing your calcium intake or decreasing your phosphate relative to the calcium, all of these changes in your diet will lower both TSH. And parathyroid hormone. And both of these hormones are directly involved in things such as mast cell activation, releasing histamine and serotonin, increasing all of the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, nitric oxide, all of the things that promote degenerative inflammatory processes. Functionally, vitamin D and thyroid are really parallel. You can't quite separate them.

**CONTEXT:** How do vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism share similar inflammatory mechanisms, and how do calcium, phosphate, TSH, and parathyroid hormone influence these processes?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and HIV, AIDS, malaria, as well as tuberculosis are very widespread conditions that are known to increase their morbidity and mortality in proportion to how low the vitamin D is.

**CONTEXT:** What infectious and systemic diseases are negatively impacted by low vitamin D levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I think the viral process is basically an energy process. When the cells are well energized, they're resistant to infection and replication of viruses.

**CONTEXT:** How does cellular energy status relate to resistance against viral infections?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and I think you can see the energy process in the brain conditions that are associated with vitamin D deficiency. Brain-injured patients have very low vitamin D. Probably the injury itself is causing it to be lost in some way. I read that Parkinson's was also implicated in low levels of vitamin D in some Parkinson's patients showing that that was a kind of interference either with dopaminergic type interference or another neural signaling interference that vitamin D positively influences. And the prion diseases are probably influenced because vitamin D prevents the polymerization of the prion protein, which is involved in scrapie, mad cow disease, Alzheimer's disease, and probably several other of the degenerative brain diseases. And anxiety and depression are associated with very little vitamin D.

**CONTEXT:** How does vitamin D deficiency impact brain health, neurological disorders like Parkinson's and prion diseases, and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you figure that being in a bathing suit in the sun for 20 or 30 minutes enough to just start turning pink, that can make 10 or 15,000 units. 5,000 or 10,000 units. It's never going to be harmful.

**CONTEXT:** Is a daily intake of 8,000 IU of vitamin D, combining a supplement and a multivitamin, potentially harmful?

**RAY PEAT:** You need a good ratio of calcium to phosphate. 10,000. I think it's really protective to take in well over 1,000. I try to get about 2,500 milligrams of calcium per day.

**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended daily intake of calcium, and how does it interact with vitamin D for optimal health?

**RAY PEAT:** Milk, cheese, and the leafy greens that are well cooked, and the water they cook in. They have to be cooked, because I ate a lot of salad, but those aren't cooked. Yeah, we can't digest raw leaves. Most of the calcium is not being assimilated from salad greens. So I should eat like cooked broccoli or something like that? Yeah, yeah. Oh, one or two big serpents of kale or chard would give you a good part of your day's requirement, but I think the best way is to have more than a quarter day of low-fat milk.

**CONTEXT:** What are the best food sources for calcium, and why is cooking leafy greens important for calcium absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, well, it's been very, very, very positive associations with a inability to absorb vitamin D, and I'm not saying you're obese, but in obese people, so the body fat has a direct, yeah, a suppressing effect on vitamin D absorption.

**CONTEXT:** How does body fat affect vitamin D absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, vitamin D and calcium both have a direct suppressive effect on fat formation. The fatty liver, for example, in animal studies it's corrected by both vitamin D and calcium. So that suppresses fat. That will help you not get so fat if you eat vitamin D and calcium. And a high calcium intake by itself just with a normal amount of vitamin D is very effective at preventing overweight.

**CONTEXT:** Can vitamin D and calcium help prevent fat formation and overweight?

**RAY PEAT:** Not enough calcium and vitamin D. Or too much phosphate that the combination, any of those will cause your parathyroid hormone to increase and elevated phosphate and elevated parathyroid hormone are very toxic to the kidneys.

**CONTEXT:** What are the consequences of insufficient calcium and vitamin D, or excessive phosphate, on kidney health?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid works in many ways similarly to vitamin D and regulates calcium and magnesium.

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid hormone function in relation to calcium and magnesium regulation, similar to vitamin D?

**RAY PEAT:** If you have a fairly high protein intake and your urine is on the acid side, down around pH 5, and you have a very high calcium intake, say from the equivalent of two liters of milk per day, you'll have a lot of calcium appearing in the urine. And if the urine is acidic, it isn't likely to form stones, but when it stands, the pH can rise. And as the carbon dioxide evaporates, that can precipitate crystals. So other things being equal, it isn't necessarily harmful to have a precipitation in the urine.

**CONTEXT:** What factors can contribute to sediment in urine, and is it always a sign of a problem?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the clarity is largely from the amount of fluid you're drinking. And if the urine is acidic, I don't think some cloudiness is going to hurt. But there can be bad causes of cloudiness. Infection, for example. And I think the yellow colour of urine is considered too indicate cell turnover. So sometimes the morning urine will be yellow and the afternoon urine clear. Because during the night, with the high stress hormones, a lot of cells are breaking down and the fragments of the nucleic acids turning over, I think, can produce some of the yellow pigment.

**CONTEXT:** What determines the clarity and color of urine, and what do these characteristics indicate about health?

**RAY PEAT:** The calcium metabolism and sugar oxidation is another subject.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between calcium metabolism and sugar oxidation?
