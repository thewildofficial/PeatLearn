**RAY PEAT:** My PhD study was at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. Before that, I had been a graduate student and teacher in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, English literature, among other things.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, would you just outline your background, your professional and academic background?

**RAY PEAT:** I see that one of your questions from last month, I think, was about the trophoblast theory of cancer. And just when I was starting my biology study in 1968, I had known a famous old cancer genetics researcher, Leonel Strong. He was studying the curability of cancer, mammary cancer, in the strains of mice that he developed by surgery, different types of liver extract. And in thinking about that, I realized that there might be an overlap with the work he was doing with the old John Beard trophoblast theory of cancer, which was behind the Laetrile treatment. Laetrile was for almonds, almond seeds, okay? And the Laetrile activated a process that its proponents thought was just a poison for the cancer cells. But since it involved activation by the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which happens to be an enzyme that activates estrogen, I saw a link with Leonel Strong's work in which the cancer-prone animals inherited from their mothers the prenatal gestational conditions; they inherited a tendency to have high estrogen. And when he used a liver extract, the animals that he treated with the liver extract not only didn't get cancer themselves, but their offspring for several generations didn't get cancer.

**CONTEXT:** Was that because of the vitamin B6 in the liver helping their bodies?

**RAY PEAT:** He believed it was one of the nucleotide fractions that has analogs in the mainline cancer chemotherapy, but he believed it was stabilizing the DNA. But my impression was that there were anti-estrogenic substances in the liver, and some of them were also the nucleotides that Lynn L. Strong was talking about. But anyway, the trophoblast theory, even though I think it's wrong in its details, it's extremely rich in its overlap with the actual facts of how cancer develops. The estrogen factor that Leonel Strong was working on and the role of enzymes such as beta-glucuronidase, which the Laetrile theory was based on, overlapped with the trophoblast theory. And the main treatment that people used, going by the Beard trophoblast theory, was pancreatic enzyme or extracts of the pancreas.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned now the product Laetrile that some people listening might recognize as the seed kernel extract from almonds. Apricots, sorry, apricots. Okay, so wasn't the rationale for that, that it would break down the sugar linkage and release cyanide, and that's why how it was a kind of a...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that was Krebs' idea that it was poisoning. His theory was very nice, except there was a theory for the Laetrile that he defined as the glucuronide. The molecule that he published had the glucuronic acid on it, which would be specifically released by cancer cells, well, by any inflamed cell, but would be poisonous only to cancer cells because they lack the ability to detoxify cyanide.

**CONTEXT:** Right, right. Now, isn't beta-glucuronidase... an enzyme that breaks down the beta linkages as sugar linkages?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the glucuronic acid happens to be how toxic substances are detoxified for excretion by the liver through the kidneys. Estrogen glucuronide is one of the main excreted forms. It can be sulfate or glucuronide, mainly.

**CONTEXT:** So, this is a process and that could change complex carbs into relatively simple sugars, but not so simple because the simple sugars are things like glucose, fructose, sucrose, etc. just single units, subunits or two.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the gumminess of it corresponds to the amount of starch left in it. Broken up starch turns the solid starch into a semi-liquid.

**CONTEXT:** So like cane juice, when you've ever, if anyone has ever had cane sugar juice, fresh juice, it's very thin, very, very thin. There's like basically zero starch in that, right? The refined cane sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh no, just if you have like fresh cane juice. Or you just, they juice the sugar cane and they give you a little...

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, the sugar... It's very thin. It contains sucrose itself, so you don't need to process that.

**RAY PEAT:** Right, but I'm just saying that's why cane juice is so thin, whereas corn syrup is so thick, because it still has the starch in it.

**CONTEXT:** All right, and just to recap there, anything really to do with temperature and starches involving caramelization, it can definitely be termed as carcinogenic, in terms of the makeup of the caramelized products.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, at least as far as the combination with amino groups and amino acids and proteins. Those are the best-known mutagens. But...

**CONTEXT:** Some burnt toast.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, acrylamide turns up. And every time you heat a natural carbohydrate that contains traces of amino acids or proteins, and in the absence of amino acids, instead of acrylamide, you probably get small amounts of acrolein, which is another very toxic carcinogenic material.

**CONTEXT:** And what about protein like meat and eggs when they brown, is that also carcinogenic?

**RAY PEAT:** There are traces of sugar in those, and so you do get some of the same compounds.

**CONTEXT:** All right, well, another question was, do amylase or amylopsin help change complex carbs into sugars? I know amylase, but I'm not too familiar with amylopsin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's just a pancreatic.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right, so this is the amylase would be like a salivary amylase.

**RAY PEAT:** Yep.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right, so that was that was those two questions. I had I had some other questions for another person based on... diet and you know recommendations for diet they've been a long time listener they were also quite aware of your favorites in terms of foods from basic orange juice to the your constant advocation of carrots, grated carrots and coffee for B vitamins. In terms of general nutrition, I just wanted to recap for those people that maybe haven't listened too much before, but in terms of calories for a female, what would you rate as being generally acceptable calories for relatively sedentary type work, just so we can understand those people that perhaps they look at their food caloric intake, they'll probably recognize they're getting far too many calories and that what is actually realistic. To burn in somebody's healthy metabolism versus the calories they're getting from food. What do you think is a caloric intake for a female?

**RAY PEAT:** I would say 2,000 is a ballpark. You can be very sedentary and still burn close to 3,000. Some people can be moderately active and get along on 1,700. Lots of people now are hypothyroid enough that they can move around with just ordinary daily activity and still gain weight on 700 or 800 calories. So you really have to look at your metabolic rate. And also if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, I know when I was full-time breastfeeding, I think I probably ate 3,000 a day and didn't gain weight.

**CONTEXT:** No, and maintained weight. Okay, how about some how about proteins in terms of someone's intake for a female for example?

**RAY PEAT:** The military did a big study on people mostly of military age in their 20s, both men and women of all the different sizes that are in the military, and found that to do just ordinary work, office work or whatever, both men and women needed at least 100 grams of good protein every day. But you see lots of people getting by on 25 or 30 grams. I've known people always with pretty serious symptoms who were getting only 20 or even less grams per day.

**CONTEXT:** Right. Now do you get expect things like tissue repair to be poor? Muscle mass obviously not to be in evidence and difficulty maintaining skin, nails, hair, that kind of thing with low protein intake. And it's hard if you're a meat eater. You can say, oh it's easy, but then you don't want to eat that much meat. You don't want to be eating meat three times a day. It's too much meat intake. So then you really have to rely on eggs, which you can't eat any more than two eggs a day because they contain some PUFA. And so then you're left with dairy. So really, I think dairy is the primary source of protein that's healthy for people to be getting.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, well, I know you advocate gelatin a lot in terms of protein content, and that's not going to make up to 100 grams of protein when one eight ounce glass of milk has eight grams.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, and then what do you recommend for sugars?

**RAY PEAT:** It really depends on your suggestion, your intestinal health. When I was in Mexico, I saw a lot of nutritionists trying to justify a bean and rice-based diet, and there are lots of reasons that you can't get along very well, even though the amino acids seem to be equivalent to protein. It turns out that potatoes are infinitely better than beans as a source of protein. But that requires either of those require that your intestine be in fairly good health because the complex carbohydrates of either of those can support bacterial growth if you have a sluggish digestion.

**CONTEXT:** Hang on, are we talking about juicing potatoes and cooking it in the pot?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if people were going to eat potatoes as a source of protein, they better have a pretty strong intestinal wall, otherwise all that starch will irritate them.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, because I know you advocate potato juice and use that in a double boiler to make a kind of scramble, that's actually starch-free, isn't it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's for people who have a digestive problem but still need a very high-quality protein.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so, just to recap in terms of the amount of grams of sugar for somebody in a day to be...

**RAY PEAT:** If you... these studies that I've written about in the late 1800s, they found that diabetics were putting out about 12 ounces of sugar in extreme terminal diabetes. They had about 12 ounces of sugar in their urine every day as glucose. And so they reasoned that they would die less quickly if they replaced that amount of sugar that they were losing. And so they gave them a regular diet plus 10 or 12 ounces of plain white sugar and found that instead of dying more slowly, they got well. And so it depends on your stress. Your system is under huge amounts of sugar like that can be curative if you're under stress and need something to compensate for the stress. But if your digestive system is very healthy, you can get along just with starch instead of sugar. But you still need a few hundred grams of carbohydrate either as starch or sugar every day. So like I, we had a client who had broken his knee and ankle and had very extensive surgery, and he was needing I think up to 400, I think a pound of sugar a day in various forms, you know, marshmallows and homemade marshmallows, sugar in the milk in order to sleep, to lower the amount of stress that he was recovering when he got out of the hospital. That was what he needed to sleep. And of course, he weaned himself off of that when he got better, but initially, that was very curative for his sleep and his healing. I've seen similar things in people with cancer or just extreme old age insomnia. When they drank a little syrup-like concentrate of sugar and milk, or ate a bowl of ice cream during the middle of the night, they could get back to sleep.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, he went from not sleeping at all, like waking every hour and just completely restless and in pain, to sleeping all through the night, just from increasing his sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, so in terms of in terms of a daily diet and I do get I get this question pretty pretty often in terms of it's new to people and so they think initially the diet is pretty restrictive. We've kind of produced a... a three-page-or-thereabouts breakdown of foods that we know from you and what you've researched that is healthy, thyroid-supportive, anti-inflammatory foods and those kind of foods that are definitely to be avoided. Obviously the polyunsaturates which really kicked off this entire thing with you with us seven years ago. In terms of, I'll even ask you personally, what kind of foods that you would you typically eat just to throw that out there and then we'll break down some of the foods here if that may be not obvious that people probably don't eat too much of that, they don't know they can, because it probably sounds like it's too either fattening or you know sugary or too, yeah, too problematic from another perspective. But what kind of what kind of foods do you typically gravitate towards that keep you going?

**RAY PEAT:** Two or three quarts of milk, up to a gallon of milk per day, usually one percent. And usually one big egg, fried in butter typically. And orange juice, as much as is available, if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Good, sweet orange juice. And typically, about once a week, some oysters or some liver. Almost every day, some kind of gelatinous soup, tail soup, or sometimes chicken soup with all the fat skimmed off.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right, well that's kind of key, key ingredients. So Sarah, I mean, because the person asked, they said they were very aware from listening to you and having, they said they came across you in the early 90s, they said, and they've been paying attention to you ever since in terms of your books and newsletters. But what they were asking for, which was kind of, in some ways it was a little strange because they would have thought by now they would have recognized all the kind of foods that you do gravitate towards, but we've produced a pretty extensive list of those foods that are thyroid suppressive. That people don't always recognize whether it's beans, nuts, seeds, you know, and that's kind of typical polyunsaturated rich foods that would have a thyroid suppressing effect. But I know Sarah's a very good cook and you do make some excellent food and so I'm very very lucky to have that. So I don't ever find there's any shortage of variation. I mean every now and again obviously we eat lots of different cheeses, we drink a lot of milk and orange juice. We eat milk powder pancakes every morning that I make ahead of time so I don't have to make them every day. And that's a pretty easy recipe if you can find some good organic, non-fat milk powder.

**CONTEXT:** How often do you eat the milk powder pancakes, Dr. Peat?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, every day when we have the powder supply, then we run out of it and don't eat them for a few months.

**CONTEXT:** So, just to recap in terms of the amount of grams of sugar for somebody in a day to be...

But if your digestive system is very healthy, you can get along just with starch instead of sugar. But you still need a few hundred grams of carbohydrate either as starch or sugar every day.

**CONTEXT:** So like I, we had a client who had broken his knee and ankle and had very extensive surgery, and he was needing I think up to 400, I think a pound of sugar a day in various forms, you know, marshmallows and homemade marshmallows, sugar in the milk in order to sleep, to lower the amount of stress that he was recovering when he got out of the hospital. That was what he needed to sleep. And of course, he weaned himself off of that when he got better, but initially, that was very curative for his sleep and his healing. I've seen similar things in people with cancer or just extreme old age insomnia. When they drank a little syrup-like concentrate of sugar and milk, or ate a bowl of ice cream during the middle of the night, they could get back to sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he went from not sleeping at all, like waking every hour and just completely restless and in pain, to sleeping all through the night, just from increasing his sugar.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so in terms of in terms of a daily diet and I do get I get this question pretty pretty often in terms of it's new to people and so they think initially the diet is pretty restrictive. We've kind of produced a... a three-page-or-thereabouts breakdown of foods that we know from you and what you've researched that is healthy, thyroid-supportive, anti-inflammatory foods and those kind of foods that are definitely to be avoided. Obviously the polyunsaturates which really kicked off this entire thing with you with us seven years ago. In terms of, I'll even ask you personally, what kind of foods that you would you typically eat just to throw that out there and then we'll break down some of the foods here if that may be not obvious that people probably don't eat too much of that, they don't know they can, because it probably sounds like it's too either fattening or you know sugary or too, yeah, too problematic from another perspective. But what kind of what kind of foods do you typically gravitate towards that keep you going?

**RAY PEAT:** Two or three quarts of milk, up to a gallon of milk per day, usually one percent. And usually one big egg, fried in butter typically. And orange juice, as much as is available, if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Good, sweet orange juice. And typically, about once a week, some oysters or some liver. Almost every day, some kind of gelatinous soup, tail soup, or sometimes chicken soup with all the fat skimmed off.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right, well that's kind of key, key ingredients. So Sarah, I mean, because the person asked, they said they were very aware from listening to you and having, they said they came across you in the early 90s, they said, and they've been paying attention to you ever since in terms of your books and newsletters. But what they were asking for, which was kind of, in some ways it was a little strange because they would have thought by now they would have recognized all the kind of foods that you do gravitate towards, but we've produced a pretty extensive list of those foods that are thyroid suppressive. That people don't always recognize whether it's beans, nuts, seeds, you know, and that's kind of typical polyunsaturated rich foods that would have a thyroid suppressing effect. But I know Sarah's a very good cook and you do make some excellent food and so I'm very very lucky to have that. So I don't ever find there's any shortage of variation. I mean every now and again obviously we eat lots of different cheeses, we drink a lot of milk and orange juice. We eat milk powder pancakes every morning that I make ahead of time so I don't have to make them every day. And that's a pretty easy recipe if you can find some good organic, non-fat milk powder.

**CONTEXT:** So, just to recap in terms of the amount of grams of sugar for somebody in a day to be...

**RAY PEAT:** If you... these studies that I've written about in the late 1800s, they found that diabetics were putting out about 12 ounces of sugar in extreme terminal diabetes. They had about 12 ounces of sugar in their urine every day as glucose. And so they reasoned that they would die less quickly if they replaced that amount of sugar that they were losing. And so they gave them a regular diet plus 10 or 12 ounces of plain white sugar and found that instead of dying more slowly, they got well. And so it depends on your stress. Your system is under huge amounts of sugar like that can be curative if you're under stress and need something to compensate for the stress.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so in terms of in terms of a daily diet and I do get I get this question pretty pretty often in terms of it's new to people and so they think initially the diet is pretty restrictive. We've kind of produced a... a three-page-or-thereabouts breakdown of foods that we know from you and what you've researched that is healthy, thyroid-supportive, anti-inflammatory foods and those kind of foods that are definitely to be avoided. Obviously the polyunsaturates which really kicked off this entire thing with you with us seven years ago. In terms of, I'll even ask you personally, what kind of foods that you would you typically eat just to throw that out there and then we'll break down some of the foods here if that may be not obvious that people probably don't eat too much of that, they don't know they can, because it probably sounds like it's too either fattening or you know sugary or too, yeah, too problematic from another perspective. But what kind of what kind of foods do you typically gravitate towards that keep you going?

**RAY PEAT:** Two or three quarts of milk, up to a gallon of milk per day, usually one percent. And usually one big egg, fried in butter typically. And orange juice, as much as is available, if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Good, sweet orange juice. And typically, about once a week, some oysters or some liver. Almost every day, some kind of gelatinous soup, tail soup, or sometimes chicken soup with all the fat skimmed off.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right, well that's kind of key, key ingredients. So Sarah, I mean, because the person asked, they said they were very aware from listening to you and having, they said they came across you in the early 90s, they said, and they've been paying attention to you ever since in terms of your books and newsletters. But what they were asking for, which was kind of, in some ways it was a little strange because they would have thought by now they would have recognized all the kind of foods that you do gravitate towards, but we've produced a pretty extensive list of those foods that are thyroid suppressive. That people don't always recognize whether it's beans, nuts, seeds, you know, and that's kind of typical polyunsaturated rich foods that would have a thyroid suppressing effect. But I know Sarah's a very good cook and you do make some excellent food and so I'm very very lucky to have that. So I don't ever find there's any shortage of variation. I mean every now and again obviously we eat lots of different cheeses, we drink a lot of milk and orange juice. We eat milk powder pancakes every morning that I make ahead of time so I don't have to make them every day. And that's a pretty easy recipe if you can find some good organic, non-fat milk powder.

**CONTEXT:** So, just to recap in terms of the amount of grams of sugar for somebody in a day to be...

**RAY PEAT:** If you... these studies that I've written about in the late 1800s, they found that diabetics were putting out about 12 ounces of sugar in extreme terminal diabetes. They had about 12 ounces of sugar in their urine every day as glucose. And so they reasoned that they would die less quickly if they replaced that amount of sugar that they were losing. And so they gave them a regular diet plus 10 or 12 ounces of plain white sugar and found that instead of dying more slowly, they got well. And so it depends on your stress. Your system is under huge amounts of sugar like that can be curative if you're under stress and need something to compensate for the stress. But if your digestive system is very healthy, you can get along just with starch instead of sugar. But you still need a few hundred grams of carbohydrate either as starch or sugar every day.

**CONTEXT:** So like I, we had a client who had broken his knee and ankle and had very extensive surgery, and he was needing I think up to 400, I think a pound of sugar a day in various forms, you know, marshmallows and homemade marshmallows, sugar in the milk in order to sleep, to lower the amount of stress that he was recovering when he got out of the hospital. That was what he needed to sleep. And of course, he weaned himself off of that when he got better, but initially, that was very curative for his sleep and his healing. I've seen similar things in people with cancer or just extreme old age insomnia. When they drank a little syrup-like concentrate of sugar and milk, or ate a bowl of ice cream during the middle of the night, they could get back to sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he went from not sleeping at all, like waking every hour and just completely restless and in pain, to sleeping all through the night, just from increasing his sugar.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so in terms of in terms of a daily diet and I do get I get this question pretty pretty often in terms of it's new to people and so they think initially the diet is pretty restrictive.

**RAY PEAT:** Two or three quarts of milk, up to a gallon of milk per day, usually one percent. And usually one big egg, fried in butter typically. And orange juice, as much as is available, if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Good, sweet orange juice. And typically, about once a week, some oysters or some liver.

And orange juice, as much as is available, if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Good, sweet orange juice. And typically, about once a week, some oysters or some liver. Almost every day, some kind of gelatinous soup, tail soup, or sometimes chicken soup with all the fat skimmed off.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right, well that's kind of key, key ingredients. So Sarah, I mean, because the person asked, they said they were very aware from listening to you and having, they said they came across you in the early 90s, they said, and they've been paying attention to you ever since in terms of your books and newsletters. But what they were asking for, which was kind of, in some ways it was a little strange because they would have thought by now they would have recognized all the kind of foods that you do gravitate towards, but we've produced a pretty extensive list of those foods that are thyroid suppressive. That people don't always recognize whether it's beans, nuts, seeds, you know, and that's kind of typical polyunsaturated rich foods that would have a thyroid suppressing effect. But I know Sarah's a very good cook and you do make some excellent food and so I'm very very lucky to have that. So I don't ever find there's any shortage of variation. I mean every now and again obviously we eat lots of different cheeses, we drink a lot of milk and orange juice. We eat milk powder pancakes every morning that I make ahead of time so I don't have to make them every day. And that's a pretty easy recipe if you can find some good organic, non-fat milk powder.

**CONTEXT:** So, just to recap in terms of the amount of grams of sugar for somebody in a day to be...

**RAY PEAT:** If you... these studies that I've written about in the late 1800s, they found that diabetics were putting out about 12 ounces of sugar in extreme terminal diabetes. They had about 12 ounces of sugar in their urine every day as glucose. And so they reasoned that they would die less quickly if they replaced that amount of sugar that they were losing. And so they gave them a regular diet plus 10 or 12 ounces of plain white sugar and found that instead of dying more slowly, they got well. And so it depends on your stress. Your system is under huge amounts of sugar like that can be curative if you're under stress and need something to compensate for the stress. But if your digestive system is very healthy, you can get along just with starch instead of sugar. But you still need a few hundred grams of carbohydrate either as starch or sugar every day.

**CONTEXT:** So like I, we had a client who had broken his knee and ankle and had very extensive surgery, and he was needing I think up to 400, I think a pound of sugar a day in various forms, you know, marshmallows and homemade marshmallows, sugar in the milk in order to sleep, to lower the amount of stress that he was recovering when he got out of the hospital. That was what he needed to sleep. And of course, he weaned himself off of that when he got better, but initially, that was very curative for his sleep and his healing. I've seen similar things in people with cancer or just extreme old age insomnia. When they drank a little syrup-like concentrate of sugar and milk, or ate a bowl of ice cream during the middle of the night, they could get back to sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he went from not sleeping at all, like waking every hour and just completely restless and in pain, to sleeping all through the night, just from increasing his sugar.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so in terms of in terms of a daily diet and I do get I get this question pretty pretty often in terms of it's new to people and so they think initially the diet is pretty restrictive. We've kind of produced a... a three-page-or-thereabouts breakdown of foods that we know from you and what you've researched that is healthy, thyroid-supportive, anti-inflammatory foods and those kind of foods that are definitely to be avoided. Obviously the polyunsaturates which really kicked off this entire thing with you with us seven years ago. In terms of, I'll even ask you personally, what kind of foods that you would you typically eat just to throw that out there and then we'll break down some of the foods here if that may be not obvious that people probably don't eat too much of that, they don't know they can, because it probably sounds like it's too either fattening or you know sugary or too, yeah, too problematic from another perspective. But what kind of what kind of foods do you typically gravitate towards that keep you going?

**RAY PEAT:** Two or three quarts of milk, up to a gallon of milk per day, usually one percent. And usually one big egg, fried in butter typically. And orange juice, as much as is available, if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Good, sweet orange juice. And typically, about once a week, some oysters or some liver.

I mean every now and again obviously we eat lots of different cheeses, we drink a lot of milk and orange juice. We eat milk powder pancakes every morning that I make ahead of time so I don't have to make them every day. And that's a pretty easy recipe if you can find some good organic, non-fat milk powder.

**CONTEXT:** So, just to recap in terms of the amount of grams of sugar for somebody in a day to be...

**RAY PEAT:** If you... these studies that I've written about in the late 1800s, they found that diabetics were putting out about 12 ounces of sugar in extreme terminal diabetes. They had about 12 ounces of sugar in their urine every day as glucose. And so they reasoned that they would die less quickly if they replaced that amount of sugar that they were losing. And so they gave them a regular diet plus 10 or 12 ounces of plain white sugar and found that instead of dying more slowly, they got well. And so it depends on your stress. Your system is under huge amounts of sugar like that can be curative if you're under stress and need something to compensate for the stress. But if your digestive system is very healthy, you can get along just with starch instead of sugar. But you still need a few hundred grams of carbohydrate either as starch or sugar every day.

**CONTEXT:** So like I, we had a client who had broken his knee and ankle and had very extensive surgery, and he was needing I think up to 400, I think a pound of sugar a day in various forms, you know, marshmallows and homemade marshmallows, sugar in the milk in order to sleep, to lower the amount of stress that he was recovering when he got out of the hospital. That was what he needed to sleep. And of course, he weaned himself off of that when he got better, but initially, that was very curative for his sleep and his healing. I've seen similar things in people with cancer or just extreme old age insomnia. When they drank a little syrup-like concentrate of sugar and milk, or ate a bowl of ice cream during the middle of the night, they could get back to sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, he went from not sleeping at all, like waking every hour and just completely restless and in pain, to sleeping all through the night, just from increasing his sugar.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so in terms of in terms of a daily diet and I do get I get this question pretty pretty often in terms of it's new to people and so they think initially the diet is pretty restrictive. We've kind of produced a... a three-page-or-thereabouts breakdown of foods that we know from you and what you've researched that is healthy, thyroid-supportive, anti-inflammatory foods and those kind of foods that are definitely to be avoided. Obviously the polyunsaturates which really kicked off this entire thing with you with us seven years ago. In terms of, I'll even ask you personally, what kind of foods that you would you typically eat just to throw that out there and then we'll break down some of the foods here if that may be not obvious that people probably don't eat too much of that, they don't know they can, because it probably sounds like it's too either fattening or you know sugary or too, yeah, too problematic from another perspective. But what kind of what kind of foods do you typically gravitate towards that keep you going?

**RAY PEAT:** Two or three quarts of milk, up to a gallon of milk per day, usually one percent. And usually one big egg, fried in butter typically. And orange juice, as much as is available, if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Good, sweet orange juice. And typically, about once a week, some oysters or some liver. Almost every day, some kind of gelatinous soup, tail soup, or sometimes chicken soup with all the fat skimmed off.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right, well that's kind of key, key ingredients. So Sarah, I mean, because the person asked, they said they were very aware from listening to you and having, they said they came across you in the early 90s, they said, and they've been paying attention to you ever since in terms of your books and newsletters. But what they were asking for, which was kind of, in some ways it was a little strange because they would have thought by now they would have recognized all the kind of foods that you do gravitate towards, but we've produced a pretty extensive list of those foods that are thyroid suppressive. That people don't always recognize whether it's beans, nuts, seeds, you know, and that's kind of typical polyunsaturated rich foods that would have a thyroid suppressing effect. But I know Sarah's a very good cook and you do make some excellent food and so I'm very very lucky to have that. So I don't ever find there's any shortage of variation.
