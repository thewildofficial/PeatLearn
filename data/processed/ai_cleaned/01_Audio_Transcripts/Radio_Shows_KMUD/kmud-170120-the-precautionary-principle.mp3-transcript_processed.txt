**RAY PEAT:** "Just after I got out of graduate school and was doing consulting and practical projects, people were talking about whether natural remedies were any better than pharmaceutical chemical remedies. And that started me thinking about what the difference really is. And a substance such as progesterone I think is a good illustration. Just yesterday someone told me the story of his wife being prescribed a new synthetic progestin. I looked up some articles on it and they described it as being designed to resemble. as closely as possible the natural molecule progesterone and a couple other molecules in the last 10 years or so have claimed that they are closer than any of the other synthetic progesterones to natural progesterone and that is very interesting that progesterone has existed in animals since animals began and these other substances in the case of this recent one it has existed in the universe only for 10 years and so we pretty well know that natural progesterone is safe because it it has been doing its thing in organisms forever absolutely this new one if it it has a group on it, a cyanide group that never was attached to a natural steroid molecule so it's undoubtedly doing many things that natural progesterone doesn't do but how soon will we know what the ultimate side effects of this historically unique intervention in the organism What will they be 100 years from now in the descendants of the people who are being treated with it now?"
**CONTEXT:** The discussion begins with the concept of the precautionary principle and its application to medicines. Ray Peat elaborates on the difference between natural and synthetic substances, using progesterone as an example.

**RAY PEAT:** "Why did they put the cyanide on there? Is that to make it a patentable medicine? That's part of it, yeah. They are making things as close to progesterone as they can but they can't patent progesterone so they have something as close to it as they can get but the actual... natural substance is cheap and the drug companies aren't interested in promoting something with very little profit because everyone can compete. When you use herbal remedies, even if there is one specific active agent that you're looking for, like in a fox glove. The digitalis type effect, you're not only going to have supporting surrounding metabolites that are acting somewhat like drugs, but you know that that natural form of the molecule has existed in plant cells since the plant became what it is. And the fact is that the structure and the biochemistry of plant and animal cells is very similar. We have the same basic types of enzymes and energy producing reactions. Photosynthesis is the main difference between plants and animals. And movement of animals. Have a specialized movement systems but for the basic chemistry plants are very parallel to animals and so we know that those molecules are compatible with at least many kinds of life where if you invent a molecule it might seem very similar but you really can't know until you have tried it for the whole. Lifetime of a particular organism and in the case of diethylstilbestrol, DES, it was introduced as an estrogen to treat menopause and to improve pregnancy. It was called the female hormone and so the argument was that if you were having trouble carrying a pregnancy... That was because something was defective in your femaleness so they gave you more of the female hormone and there were already many things known about the harm of the molecule at that time but it was given to millions of women and 20 or 30 years later they were seeing that the children both male and female and even the grandchildren apparently have been injured by their mothers use of this synthetic estrogen so that shows that the development of sickness which in the case of cancer an individual might not show the fact that they've been. got cancer from an exposure to a chemical might be 40 years after the exposure so with the six months animal study you aren't going to have a clue as to whether it might cause cancer in the old age of the person who uses it or even in their children or grandchildren and now the uh in the last 15 or 20 years the idea of epigenetic change has been accepted and the uh what you do to one individual is now recognized to have the effect several generations into the future um and one of those common effects which is now recognized as a type of epigenetic change or damage it's called genomic instability where even the dna which might not be mutated in the first day or week or year of exposure but the genome itself becomes destabilized even in subsequent generations so that there are mutations are being created in later generations from an early exposure estrogen and ionizing radiation have many overlapping similarities you can get a synergy between a certain dose of radiation and a certain dose of energy of estrogen which is more than additive you it's like adding extra radiation to an x-ray if you have an exposure all ready to estrogen so it's like a potentiating effect yeah yeah"
**CONTEXT:** The discussion continues on the theme of synthetic versus natural substances and the long-term consequences of their use, referencing the example of DES and the concept of epigenetic changes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, in the by the 1930s of years before the estrogens came on the pharmaceutical market they were already identified as very potent carcinogens and uh promoters of brain defects of movement disorders leaders of personality chances inflammation of practically all tissue, cancer development in every organ of the body, not just the breast and uterus but brain, kidney, lung, owl, all types of cancer were already known at the time that these came on the market and that they were abortifacient. Estrogen was clearly identified. Before 1940, as a powerful birth control, or actually early abortifacient, and despite that, it was sold for almost 20 years to prevent miscarriage, exactly the opposite of what it was known to actually do. So the fraud was the driving force behind the whole... estrogen replacement therapy, so-called. It started with the knowledge. There was, in many cases, doing exactly the opposite of what they were selling it to do."
**CONTEXT:** The conversation delves into the historical knowledge and fraudulent promotion of estrogenic substances, highlighting their known harmful effects that were deliberately ignored.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, often they still currently have the knowledge and hide it. We don't want to look for it. If someone suspects that it might have a certain kind of effect, they will carefully avoid in their applications for approval. They will avoid discussion of the mechanisms that could cause it to be harmful. The whole DNA revolution, it happens that... there were changes in the way people were thinking about the nature of science at the same time that the biology was being shifted over to a study of the DNA molecule rather than actual, the facts of inheritance. And I see it as a coordinated... effort, sponsored by the government, to support industry in its ability to evade responsibility. If you just look at ordinary liability... Well, look at vaccines... Yeah, the ordinary liability principles in law would make it impossible for many of these industries to function. The insurance... needed for a nuclear plant would be prohibitive. The insurance needed for vaccines and for many drugs. Well, they're indemnified, aren't they, for vaccines? They're legally indemnified and held unblameable. He's saying that because the insurance would be so great. They're just... they get off without having to get any insurance. Yeah, and even without putting this explicitly into the law. As indemnification beforehand, the cleanup projects of the great chemical contaminants around the country, these are being done at public taxpayer expense rather than holding the profiting corporations responsible for the full cost of cleanup."
**CONTEXT:** The discussion shifts to how current scientific research and regulatory bodies may facilitate the concealment of harmful information, with a focus on the pharmaceutical and nuclear industries' ability to evade responsibility through indemnification and public funding of cleanup.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, the government not only is working for the corporations in their immediate liabilities protecting them, but if you go back to the late 1930s again and the 1940s, even the very nature of the way science is done, and I don't want to go into too much detail, but it's the philosophy of science, of what explains the goodness of science. The government has intervened in ways that support this irresponsibility of the corporations. If you look at ancient science from Aristotle's time on down to about the 19th century, you see that cause and effect were... central ideas and around the middle of the last century, people started saying that with the quantum physics ideas, they were starting to question whether cause and effect is a real thing and that's very nice for the polluting corporation. I bet. But there are people now, foundations... and lawyers hired by corporations going around the country denying the common sense idea of cause and effect and saying that if you claim that this is dangerous, the thing that we're selling you, you have to prove absolutely. That you are being harmed by it or killed by it or whatever."
**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores how the philosophical underpinnings of science and the questioning of cause-and-effect relationships have been exploited by corporations to shift the burden of proof of harm onto consumers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it's putting all the responsibility on the consumer or the victim. Interesting. And then you have to have enough money and enough time and manpower to fight it."
**CONTEXT:** This statement summarizes the consequence of the shift in responsibility for proving harm from corporations to consumers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, depending on what the vehicle is sometimes only a very tiny fraction, 5% or less sometimes....of the progesterone used topically is actually getting into the body so it's really important to to check have a blood test once in a while and the liver is always regulating the hormones and when you when you are using progesterone all month the liver develops. Over the first two weeks the ability to excrete it quickly and so the following weeks you're excreting it almost as fast as you can put it in and the natural cycle has a rest of two weeks where the liver resets itself so that a small amount being produced or absorbed will have a full effect and then... after about two weeks the liver will start excreting it faster so its effect is reduced. So that's why we recommend that you take an internal progesterone like the Progest D that you can find on the internet and then cycle it from full moon to new moon and then stop from new moon to full moon and then hopefully you'll get into a cycle where you're ovulating at the full moon that's when you start your Progest D and then you take that until new moon which then you should have a period. The thyroid products are extremely variable. It's important to watch for changes in your temperature and pulse rate and many other indicators like the color of lips and warmth of the fingers, the quality of sleep and digestion. And usually low thyroid, high estrogen people have digestive problems. The estrogen tends to recycle when your thyroid is low. It's reabsorbed after being excreted into the intestine by the liver. It's reabsorbed and keeps the level high even when you aren't producing it. And so on. Fiber in the diet, a raw carrot every day, sometimes is enough to get the estrogen down to the point that the cycles are normalized. And especially the combination of a daily raw carrot and fiber is enough to keep your pulse and temperature up. And if you want a temperature and pulse chart so you can chart it out and see what you're getting up to with your temperatures and pulses 15 to 90 minutes after eating breakfast and lunch. You can email us and we'll gladly send that to you so that you can have a look at it and it has the normal values of what you should be reaching because 97.1 is an okay waking temperature but after you eat it should go up to at least 98.2 to 98.6 or 99."
**CONTEXT:** In response to a question about progesterone and thyroid dosing, Ray Peat explains the variable absorption of topical progesterone, the importance of cycling progesterone, and the role of the liver in hormone regulation. He also discusses the variability of thyroid products and the importance of monitoring temperature and pulse, as well as the link between low thyroid, high estrogen, and digestive issues. He recommends a raw carrot daily for estrogen reduction and improved metabolic indicators.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I've known people who who needed that much of even armor thyroid what's that about like six grains... yeah that's uh no eight grains make a five grain tablet of armor and uh even though veterinarians would routinely prescribe that much for a cocker spaniel that weighed 30 pounds and i've known people who needed one or two of those regularly so it isn't unheard of to need that much but it's important to watch for the signs yeah and also too two products can be different 40 milligrams of this beef glandular could be very different than 40 milligrams of armor thyroid gotcha the main thing you're saying the the signs to be looking for i mean what we did to find the dosing level was basically we had been ramping it up until she began to get nauseous you know from taking it and then we backed it back down from there and that's kind of where we settled and everything else seems to be fine i mean she's not having any negative side effects at all everything is functioning she feels healthy"
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat addresses the high dosage of desiccated thyroid, noting that while it might seem extreme, some individuals require such amounts. He emphasizes the importance of monitoring for signs of overconsumption and the variability between different glandular products.

**RAY PEAT:** "Well, I know the things that dr p always points out that are symptoms of over uh overdosing over consumption will be things like sweating uh with very minimal exercise uh breathlessness with minimal exercise excessive appetite overheating during strenuous exercise well not strenuous even but just and a pulse over 100 you haven't mentioned what her pulse is um it's been in the mid-80s most of the time yeah well you never know here's the other thing with glandular is that it's such a variable product like dr. pete says you know I think you could take a dozen different glandular extracts and find different amounts within the same milligram dose of you know of a glandular so that's I think some in some part a reason to advocate synthetics just because they are very finely measured so an arm or thyroid might be a better Solution then well armor should be quantified. Yeah, it should be there should be a spec sheet that comes with it That will tell you that there are this many micrograms of t3 and t4 and what it would you know What that ratio would be should be an ideal ratio"
**CONTEXT:** The discussion continues on thyroid dosing, with Ray Peat listing symptoms of overconsumption and highlighting the variability of glandular products, suggesting that quantified synthetic options might be more reliable.

**RAY PEAT:** "If she was going to start taking the progesterone internally, she'd probably want to start with like an eighth of a teaspoon once a day and then maybe go up to twice a day. And an eighth of a teaspoon of progesterone has 50 milligrams of progesterone in it. But you know you absorb it pretty much all of it. Yeah, and if you keep it in your mouth. And the cycling is very important two weeks off every month. There you go. That should help her use it a lower dose more effectively."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat provides specific guidance on initiating internal progesterone use, recommending a low starting dose, the method of absorption, and the crucial aspect of cycling.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's often associated with hair. Low thyroid function and so for your general health you should look at the whole picture of your cholesterol and body temperature, energy need, calories required and so on. And specifically for the health of the scalp there are a few simple things. Caffeine, for example, is a good stimulant of hair follicle, hair production, rate of growth and so on. You don't want to put coffee on your head, but you can dissolve purified caffeine in rubbing alcohol, for example. DHEA is another natural hormone that sometimes... activates hair follicle function, and for connective tissue, and especially the discs, DHEA and thyroid, again, are crucial things. If thyroid function is low, all of the connective tissues tend to be waterlogged and somewhat soft and lacking resistance and elasticity. And DHEA is sometimes just normalizing your serum level of DHEA, which might only take five milligrams a day. That can have very quick dramatic effects on connective tissues, ligaments, tendons, discs, knee cartilage, and so on. You must be careful with DHEA because it can raise your estradiol levels. So you might want to have blood checks to make sure that your estradiol-progesterone ratio is good in women and then your testosterone and estrogen ratio is okay for men. You want to use DHEA, I think the important thing with DHEA is to make sure that thyroid function is adequate enough because otherwise then that conversion to estradiol can occur more likely."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat addresses male pattern baldness and herniated discs. For baldness, he suggests looking at overall thyroid function, cholesterol, and energy needs, and specifically mentions caffeine and DHEA for scalp health. For connective tissue and discs, he emphasizes the importance of DHEA and thyroid, explaining how low thyroid can lead to waterlogged connective tissues. He cautions about DHEA's potential to raise estradiol and advises monitoring hormone ratios.

**RAY PEAT:** "If the government would just stop stifling the exchange of information, that would... I think it would reduce the need for legislative power and enforcement. For example, when a drug comes on the market with FDA approval, the FDA should make public all of the information that the drug company had, at least. But they let the drug company keep secrets as business. Secrets that very often relate to the safety of the product. So the FDA tends to conspire to keep information away from the public that the public should have complete access to if the government is going to say this is an approved thing that has the government support."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses how the FDA's practice of allowing drug companies to keep safety-related information secret hinders public access to crucial data, suggesting that greater transparency would reduce the need for extensive legislation.

**RAY PEAT:** "My position is pretty extreme and I urge people to learn as much as they can but I'm... colonoscopy, if there's no radiation involved, it's just a matter of the mechanics of it and possibly the toxic effects of any sedative or anesthetic that they might use but when you relate it to the commonly done CAT scans and various... X-ray exams, I would put it on the potentially justified medical procedure, while I would exclude almost always the CAT scans and radiation exams. The basic argument is that a... find a certain amount of polyps that are precancerous or even have definite cancer in them that can be removed. I would just suggest that these... no one really knows the natural history of a polyp because you would have to have a colonoscopy every month or so for years to watch the actual... development of an individual polyp and I suspect that many polyps the same way that many skin melanomas simply fall off and go away if you... without even being noticed. So there's a certain difference between a polyp and a polymorphism. Ambiguity in the science that's used to justify them. In the few areas of the world where almost no one dies of intestinal rectal cancer, the colonoscopy is not done. So it happens that there's a close correlation between doing colonoscopies and having colon cancer."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses a cautious view on colonoscopies, differentiating them from radiation-based imaging. He questions the certainty of polyp diagnosis and their natural history, suggesting that many may resolve on their own. He notes a correlation between colonoscopy prevalence and colon cancer rates in certain regions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and it's been known for since at least the 1940s. I think it was in JAMA. Someone published pictures of a biopsy made of various types of cancer. of superficial injury, cuts or stab wounds and such and showed that all of the features used to diagnose cancer in a pathological study, all of these features can be found in an ordinary healing wound. So right from the 1940s the documentation by biopsy slides and exam by skilled pathologists, all of that has been put into question since all of those features, abnormal cell arrangement, abnormal cell structure and so on, can be found in any healing wound. So if they had mixed up the slides and had someone's biopsy from a healing wound with someone's cancerous polyp... they'd see the same thing and misdiagnose someone with a healing wound with cancer. Is that what you're saying, basically? Well, it implies that if you don't follow that particular tumor or thing that you biopsied, if you cut it out and study it, you don't know whether it was in the process of healing or of not healing. And so I think the rational approach is to do what you can that promotes healing. Rather than doing a biopsy."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat elaborates on the potential for misdiagnosis in pathology, citing research from the 1940s that indicated features used to diagnose cancer can also be present in ordinary healing wounds. He suggests that a focus on promoting healing is a more rational approach than relying solely on biopsies.

**RAY PEAT:** "The areas where they don't get colon cancer, in effect, are areas of Africa where they eat a high fiber diet. Milk and fiber are very protective for the colon."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat identifies high-fiber diets, particularly in certain African regions, and the consumption of milk and fiber as protective factors against colon cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "The injury... done to the cell by ultraviolet light, you can create canning by practically any kind of injury to the skin, not just ultraviolet light, but it's a reaction to injury. And so when cells are being injured, for example, by a progesterone deficiency, they are stressed by stimulator substances. Such as estrogen or some of the nerve transmitter chemicals. The stress reaction creates a pigment as a defense because the pigment is a free radical scavenger. And as long as you're producing the pigment, it's defending itself against the free radicals. So the... I think of moles as a defensive reaction. A famous Israeli researcher, Gershom Zeitchik, has reviewed the evidence on melanoma surgery. He says it's very common for when you remove one confirmed melanoma, often new ones will... pop up almost immediately after the removal. And he suggests that the presence of one is sending out signals that suppress the formation of new ones."
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains that skin pigment formation, including moles, is a reaction to cellular injury, which can be exacerbated by progesterone deficiency and stressed by substances like estrogen. He views pigment as a defensive mechanism against free radicals and cites research suggesting that the presence of one melanoma may suppress the formation of others.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, just that the bystander effect is a vastly under-investigated subject. It relates to radiation, estrogen. Any kind of injuries spreading everywhere, everywhere in the body. It's in the field of quantum mechanics, right?"
**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat concludes by emphasizing the under-investigated nature of the "bystander effect," linking it to radiation, estrogen, and various injuries, and suggesting its relevance to quantum mechanics.
