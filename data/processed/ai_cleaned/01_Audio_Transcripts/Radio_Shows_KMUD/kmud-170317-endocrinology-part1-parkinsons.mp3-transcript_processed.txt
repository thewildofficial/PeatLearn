**RAY PEAT:** My orientation is very similar to Pavlov's, who saw the motor system as subordinate to the sensory system. He saw the cortex of the brain as primarily an extension of the sense organs, and that this formed the environment for the motor reflexes. And the idea of a reflex is another thing that originated with Descartes, and is simply wrong, that the cells aren't mechanically connected in reflex patterns. One of the first people in the West to analyze this carefully was the French existentialist, so-called philosopher, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who analyzed the meaning of reflexes. And he clearly shows that there are no reflexes in the Cartesian sense. And if you attend a neurology course, you'll probably find people still arguing that there are simple innate mechanical reflexes in the Descartes sense. For example, the linguistics system of Noam Chomsky is based entirely on this. Primitive, false idea of the brain function based on mechanical reflexes. And it simply doesn't work. Merleau-Ponty is probably the person who most clearly explains the problems with it. But in the Pavlovian picture, especially developed through the 1950s and 60s, his student P.K. Anokhin, the sensory system is fluid and continuously being revised as the organism explores its environment. And so the sense of exploring and being stimulated by newness, the idea of traveling through time and space is in charge of overriding defects in the motor system. Interesting. That's a relevant picture, I think, for seeing disease, especially Parkinson's disease, in a non-mechanical way.

**CONTEXT:** How do you see the motor circuit working in the body and how would you perhaps be able to rationalize an alternative approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease?

**RAY PEAT:** The protein you mentioned, Dargerin, the interesting thing about it is that it shows up as a defect in Crohn's disease, in the intestine, as well as in Parkinson's disease. And Parkinson's typically starts with constipation. And in 19th century medicine, people remembered the intestine as well as the brain in treating disease. It was very common to diagnose death as a result of inflammation of the bowel, which pathologists typically overlook as just a side issue. But the intestine was recognized as very important and the brain as the other end of the organism, sort of the two dimensions. And now doctors are taught that if you have a bowel movement three times a day or once every three days, it's all normal. And when you trace out the chemical links between what's going wrong in the intestine and in the rest of the motor system, the behavioral system and so on, you can see links, but they're always contextually working. There's no simple pathogenic chemical in the intestine. The bacteria living in the intestine, the food you eat, and the way your intestine responds to it. And the stress you're exposed to? Yeah. These act in the activating part of the brain. Around 1950, a part of the brain called the reticular activating system was identified. And this includes the region where the substantia nigra and the basal ganglia are and this is where sensory input is dished out to activate the upper parts of the brain and when that's happening it tends to go with an inhibitory effect on the body so the stronger your mentality is dreaming for example the more relaxed your body tends to be and in Parkinson's the system really tends to be over activated unable to relax properly and so a characteristic thing is that during sleep and dreams the person who is developing Parkinson's disease doesn't relax properly the body, if they have a dream they might scream and thrash around and hit people. So there is a failure of consciousness to override and relax the body.

**CONTEXT:** You were saying that environmental enrichment could totally restore a Parkinson's created or induced effect in a mouse that was put into an environmental enrichment situation and actually lost the symptoms. Is that where you were going to?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that the P.K. Anokhin and all of the people in the Pavlovian tradition see a global event or process in the brain that they called the acceptor of action. It is our intention and expectation in the world and this is what is integrating not only the the motor system and dominating the so-called reflexes but this process which is it's like a model of everything we know and intend to do in the world. This is supported in the organism, not just in the brain, but it's a process involving sensory nerves from the whole body. And this process in the brain, it's sort of during daytime at least, it's based on our inner ear balance system. The vestibular system and this, it's a unified picture of the world and the organism and this process itself of being conscious is involved in the activation of not only the endocrine glands throughout the body but in the nerves themselves as they are supporting this model of the world or acceptor of action in the process of metabolizing to be conscious they are making changes internally that involves for example synthesizing turning of energy substances sugar for example into cholesterol and turning cholesterol in the pregnenolone right in the nerves for example of the substantia nigra. This process is going on energy sugar cholesterol pregnenolone progesterone and the endocrine process which is then stabilizing the structure and the consciousness. So that the flavor of your consciousness when it's it's successful is modified by the balance you have in your progesterone, the ATA and other steroids and the energy processes.

**CONTEXT:** Can you try to explain like the personality that you're saying in people that develop Parkinson's? They're not experiencing learned helplessness?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're stuck in a way so that they aren't getting enough stimulation.

**CONTEXT:** That's so interesting because I think when you read the regular texts, medical texts about Parkinson's and they go through the plethora of symptoms, one of the symptoms or characteristic I think is fairly emotionless expressions are on the patients with Parkinson's not enthused, difficult to engage, don't have any kind of, what can I say, any kind of joie de vivre, any kind of joy of life, but that's very much part of a learned helplessness type construct that would cause an organism then to just see things just within the boundaries of what they have and then not be anything new and stimulating them and that stimulation, you're saying, is very much part of switching on what is a totally holistic approach to Parkinson's outside of the mechanistic view that the regular science has.

**RAY PEAT:** The dopamine theory, it's really part, you have to look at it in the history of brain drugs, particularly traits in the white matter in concurrent with Macrodiemia, bless the moment. At the beginning of the 20th century, with the mechanistic view, they were seeing the brain as a mechanical thing, which was having defects, causing the tremor. And they actually started cutting out parts of the brain to remove the tremor. Oh, yeah, sounds like a good idea, isn't it? The man who invented the word cybernetics, Robert Wiener, he proposed the best surgery up to that time instead of cutting out parts of the cortex which they had been doing in the 1930s. They were focusing on the brainstem and he designed the radar-searching self-control systems that would focus on the brain on an airplane and aim a gun. This feedback system, he saw the brain having tremors. His radar gun aiming system, if it was poorly aligned, would have a tremor, a searching movement back and forth. So he saw the tremor as a feedback searching process and so he suggested what you would do to his radar apparatus was to knock out part of the sensitivity. So he suggested the surgery to cut out as part of the searching feedback apparatus and it actually worked better than the grosser surgeries. It's been done right down to the 70s and 80s. They were still simply ablating or destroying part of the brain. Then they got a little more refined and started stimulating it. But sometimes that didn't work like Michael Fox said that he wasn't going to have any more surgical treatments because instead of stopping the tremor of his left side, he started the tremor in the right side.

**CONTEXT:** So are you saying new sensory output will, for example, increase the dopamine output from the substantia nigra in the brain? Or the protective progesterone? Or the hormones that protect against those cells degrading, not producing dopamine?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I guess we'll get into some of the medications now just to bring them out and to explain the mechanistic view that was constructed to support the use of these drugs. Okay, so the substantia nigra is part of the brain here that we're focusing on in Parkinson's that is the site of dopamine production. Now dopamine, excuse me, dopamine is, I think I understand this right, but I think the nervous system is pretty much wanting to be firing fairly constantly and dopamine actually controls that from happening ad hoc so that you don't get these sudden jerks etc. and that dopamine allows through this inhibition the ordered movement of muscles in coordinated patterns. It's not a stimulant per se and that it's it's integrated with the inhibiting systems so much more relaxing. Yeah, in itself it is an activator but it runs into nerves that feedback with an inhibition. Right. So when somebody, for example, I think L-DOPA is supposedly the gold standard for want of a better word of treatment and that within five years most patients using L-DOPA as the replacement for dopamine because L-DOPA, dopamine doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier as far as I know, but L-DOPA does and within the brain L-DOPA is converted into dopamine and then has an action directly. But the long-term effects of L-DOPA are a condition called bradykinesia where there's involuntary movements like there is in a fine tremor, a resting tremor because again there's a differentiation I guess without getting too medical there's a difference between intention tremors and resting tremors. So resting tremors are typically something you can see in Parkinson's patients with either the leg tremoring or the hand tremoring in the pill-rolling fashion. I always remember this from studying but they they talk about pill-rolling tremors, one of the hallmark signs of classical Parkinson's. So supporting somebody with L-DOPA to treat that tremor does initially have a positive beneficial effect, but how is it I wonder that the administration of dopamine over a chronic period of three, four, five years actually causes worse symptoms than the tremor for which it was prescribed and most patients that use L-DOPA are in worse shape five years down the road than they are if they weren't treated.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the problem is that the whole theory of what L-DOPA and dopamine are doing is mechanistic and mistaken. And so they're just patching, they're just putting a little band-aid on, they're not treating the sensory input deficiency. The drug that is approved for use in Parkinson's is amantadine or memantine more recently. In the 19th century, they were already using Belladonna and hyoscyamine. Okay, and I call energics to treat the tremors and they were pretty effective and didn't have bad side effects of increasing rigidity and so on that L-DOPA does. And it turns out that these amantadine and memantine have the anti-cholinergic, anti-excitatory effects, but they are also anti-excitatory in the glutamate-ergic system. The glutamate and cholinergic systems are both very powerful, excitatory. The glutamate system ends up producing nitric oxide, and the amantadine and the anticholinergics, imantadine, are not only stopping the excitation that is part of the tremor, but they end up lowering the exposure to nitric oxide. NO is a chronic stress-induced factor in suppressing mitochondrial respiration and energy production and accelerating aging of the brain. So using these approved drugs, it actually is giving insight into what's going on. It's a much more global, organismic process rather than just restoring the lost so-called dopamine regulatory system. It's restoring energy processes, reducing the effects of stress in a systematic way.

**CONTEXT:** Are there simple things that someone can do, like a stepping stone to get out of learned helplessness for people that are overcoming hypothyroidism and still find it overwhelming to do big tasks or big things? Or what do you suggest to increase sensory input to the brain and to help get out of the learned helplessness?

**RAY PEAT:** Painting. Behavioral things like going new places, meeting new people, doing very different things that you've never done before but thought you might enjoy doing. At the same time as you try to correct your energy processes that are suppressed, having more enjoyable, more varied meals, for example, and making sure that your thyroid function is good. I know you told me when I asked you what was one of the best things I could teach our daughter. What's a good education for our daughter? And you said introduce her to new people and she loves to meet new people. She gets so fired up.

**CONTEXT:** As long as that's not something you do every day anyway. I'm just thinking of it as a construct that would be maybe more more easily attained rather than...

**RAY PEAT:** Doing something unexpected out of the routine and some people actually quit their job and learn a new profession or trade.

**CONTEXT:** Supporting mitochondria and whether it's co-enzyme Q10 or other kind of nuotropics and things like that. I know you're not particularly keen on nuotropics and drugs that supposedly enhance mental function and or mitochondrial function because you you don't you don't really put a lot of value to it but in in terms of mitochondria and and their obvious role in energy production and how energy in the body is at the root of paying for all the transactions how do you feel about mitochondrial support in the in the approach to a Parkinson's patient?

**RAY PEAT:** Getting good rest is part of of the support stopping unnecessary excitatory stimulation. Good stimulation should be fun rather than stressful and so not jumping out of an aircraft. Well, unless you find that fun. That's stressful probably. Riding a roller coaster, I mean that might be a little bit stressful but it's fun, right? Everything that is anti-inflammatory can be relaxing as well as stimulating. Caffeine is extremely protective against all of the defects in Parkinson's disease and it activates while protecting the mitochondria. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate, which is in some plants like the passionflower? Yeah, the tropical fruit, what's it called? Passionflower. He was thinking you meant GABA. Oh, well, it's an activator, gamma hydroxide. Okay, well the passion fruit or the lilikoi or what else do you call it? Yeah, passion fruit is what I was looking for. Yeah, I thought it might be, but I didn't want to jump in there. I think it's another name for it. Yeah, it's something we make along with GABA which helps to eliminate stressful overexcitation. The synuclein, which is one of the things that goes wrong and is damaged in Parkinson's disease, it happens to have the same effect as rotenone. Wow. It's a toxic thing that has been seen to cause something exactly like Parkinson's disease by blocking the complex one of the mitochondrion.

**CONTEXT:** So then all of the herbs that act on the GABA would be useful, you're saying?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And even cannabis has been, because of its sedative effects, it can be protective against the toxic types of overstimulation.

**CONTEXT:** And what about alcohol?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it's antioxidant, can be anti-inflammatory, and can be, in the right circumstance, it can be anti-Parkinson's.

**CONTEXT:** Now how about this, nicotine? I've seen a fair amount of research showing that nicotine is actually protective, significantly protective against Parkinson's in a big study that's been done.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the population effect where they see the smokers have somewhat protection against Parkinson's. I think part of that effect is that it relieves constipation. It activates the intestine and that in the cell has an anti-inflammatory anti-toxic effect.

**CONTEXT:** Interesting. So what do you think is the best method for delivery of nicotine like making a tea out of it?

**RAY PEAT:** I think either absorbing it through the skin as in the form of an ointment or ingesting very small amounts of the leaf.

**CONTEXT:** Very quickly I think while we're talking about tobacco I read an article today that's now saying that the vaping craze that's really starting to take off and reintroduce smoking to a younger generation is actually showing up with some fairly disturbing health effects. It's kind of early days yet for the research to come through, but they're actually saying that there could be some even worse side effects to vaping than there would have been to smoking, obtaining nicotine that way. So nicotine in its own right is not, well I mean it's a neurotoxin for sure, but it's not a good molecule, but it's not the poisonous component in tobacco smoke, it's mainly the carcinogens correct and the tar. But nicotine can have some therapeutic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and keeping the intestine healthy because of the, when endotoxin in itself reaches the nervous system, it locally as well as systemically activates processes that lead to the same blockage of mitochondrial respiration that rotenone does, or that ionizing radiation does in a chronic sense. Having cat scans of the head, I think, is probably part of the reason that Parkinson's prevalence has increased so greatly over the last 20 or 30 years. Because they're pretty keen to give you cat scans for anything.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah. Oh, well, it's a shame, but I'm hopeful that, in time, things far less damaging will become more commonplace, a little bit like the switching attitudes towards saturated fats from the long-protected polyunsaturates that have been shown to do so much damage. Now, how about... Aspirin is another mentioning of the polyunsaturated fats. One of the prostaglandins produced in substantia nigra is very toxic to the brain and simply having a regular use of aspirin will protect against that prostaglandin made from the polyunsaturated fats. And the breakdown of the polyunsaturated fats, acrolein is a very toxic material that we produce internally from the polyunsaturates and that is one of the things that turns synuclein into a toxic fibrous material. Sort of like the prions in mad cow disease.

**CONTEXT:** Interesting. Because now what do you think about this concept that the... I think I think I was reading that they haven't actually proved beyond a doubt that these Lewy bodies which do show up in a substantial on on micro, you know, microscopic evaluation. They may be or they may have a protective role. I mean, I think they've made them pathognomic and kind of diagnostic for the confirming Parkinson's but they them actually have a kind of a protective role and I think somebody might be parking to get out of the way some of these synuclein fibrils and packing them up in in little compartments that are relatively safe but some of the toxic fibrils of synuclein are known to be passed from one cell to another causing a damage to the cell that receives it.

**RAY PEAT:** You know, it's the same thing. Nothing in the body can relax fully when your thyroid function is low. That's one of the funny things that came out of the idea of the cell as a compartment enclosed in a membrane. If you think of it as a corpuscle that has to be in a state ready to work when it's rested, the state where it's ready to perform its job is a high-energy state, and that's the well-rested state, full of energy, ready to go. If you don't have enough of the thyroid and glucose and oxygen, whatever, to produce the energy, you stay in a semi-contracted, excited state. So what happens in Parkinson's is this reaches a chronically deadly cell killing condition. In chronic hypothyroidism, it's simply a nuisance that your sleep isn't as restful as it should be. You can't get into the deep, relaxing, restorative sleep because you don't have enough energy. So the cells are not ready to work. They haven't accumulated the energy and structure needed to do a proper job. And so they keep churning through the energy producing process without relaxing and storing up the energy as glycogen, ATP, creatine, phosphate and so on.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, well I know there was more questions surrounding things like the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the A and B inhibitors and how they have been used with varying degrees, but ultimately this condition doesn't have any real course of action for it other than trying to offset the symptoms as long as possible followed by palliative care. I would very much like to carry on this subject next month just to break down some of the things that are definitely shown, like, lack of testosterone is definitely shown, and ameliorates, makes better the symptoms of Parkinson's. Reducing estrogen, because estrogen is kind of very inflammatory and kind of anti-restful type molecule. I know there were plenty of other things, and as usual, I'm sorry, we only got one call. I didn't really plug too much for people to come on the air, but I've kind of been a little bit selfish this month. Maybe next month, if you're able, would you be willing to carry on with this?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. Great. I really appreciate that.
