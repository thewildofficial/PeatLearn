**RAY PEAT:** The idea of a hormone is something that has developed over the last 30, 40, 50 years, incorporating the idea of genes as the really controlling agent of any cell. And so, for a substance to act on a cell in a different part of the body, it must be somehow activating on its genes. And so, the idea of a receptor is something that picks up something from a cell's environment to activate the genes within that cell. That has come to the center of the textbook type of medical endocrinology.

**CONTEXT:** What is a hormone, and how has the definition evolved?

**RAY PEAT:** The way I see the subject, it's really an extension of the very beginnings around the middle of the 19th century. Charles Edward Brown-Séquard, for example, he took over as a professor following the glycogen researcher whose name I can't remember. He became famous when he, in his old age, claimed that squashing testicles in a watery solution and injecting the solution would rejuvenate a man's virility. He described the changes that he saw in himself and it took off around the world, but for various reasons in the 20th century almost every textbook of endocrinology and every course of endocrinology starts out by ridiculing that as a complete mistake, that it was nothing but a placebo because they say testosterone isn't water-soluble. But he wasn't saying that he was injecting testosterone, he was making a squash solution of testicles. And the testicle is full of hormones, many of which are fairly insoluble in water, but it's also full of lipids that solubilize and emulsify any of the more or less insoluble steroids. Hasn't that been a part of ancient medicine, the ingestion of ovaries and testicles? You can beat them and get the same hormones out of them, but if you do squash them and make a watery extract, you're getting emulsified a whole range of not just testosterone, but many other steroids closely related to testosterone. So, it's a very ideological thing that these textbooks and professors have to put down Brown-Séquard before they can get on with their business. He was saying that the gland itself is producing substances that are vitally important and that can simply bypass many medical problems and reverse degenerative processes.

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical perspective on hormone research, and how does it contrast with modern endocrinology?

**RAY PEAT:** The implication when you look at the fact that a skin cell contains all the genes needed to make a brain cell and so on, the idea of cloning an organism from a single cell means that every cell is full of potential. So it's just the environment that it's exposed to that determines its... Yeah, and the way the organism comes into being is by each cell confronting its environment. And when it divides, the new cell becomes part of its environment. So each time cells divide, they experience themselves in a new environment, which at the beginning it includes the uterine fluids and so on. And so the whole development of the organism is a process of perceiving its environment and adapting to what it perceives. So the perceived world for any cell is always complex. And always includes every byproduct of all of its other cells. So the things such as carbon dioxide and glucose are very central to the function, development and possibilities of each cell and of the whole. Hormones as we currently talk about them are just one of thousands of components of substances produced by cells and acting on other cells. One of the meanings of this is that we're all in slightly imperfect environments. Our history is continuously a matter of overcoming environmental limitations. And that process is going on in the uterus as we develop and determining how the parts relate to each other.

**CONTEXT:** How does the cellular environment and the concept of potential influence our understanding of development and physiology?

**RAY PEAT:** The ratio of the person's brain to body and their longevity, life expectancy and the amount of energy they have at any stage of life. This is pretty much set by the intra-uterine condition.

**CONTEXT:** What factors determine longevity and energy levels throughout life?

**RAY PEAT:** The important thing is to keep your body temperature up. It should be in the range of 98 to 99.5 Fahrenheit (around 37 Celsius) during the daytime. A little higher is fine because it promotes the healthy oxidation of fats. But keeping your liver well nourished with protein and B vitamins, especially, the liver is able to throw off the polyunsaturated fats, recognizing them as toxic materials that it would be better not to oxidize. So your liver can get rid of quite a bit of stored fat largely during the night. Your free fatty acids tend to increase during the night and in the morning that shows up as foamy urine, a soapy effect from the free fatty acids. That's good. And keeping your body temperature up fairly well during the night by a good amount of protein, calcium and all of the trace nutrients in your diet and if necessary supplementing T3, progesterone and either pregnenolone or DHEA. DHEA is anabolic for the muscles but it activates heat production. It causes you to waste heat so to speak. It isn't really wasted because it's keeping your nerve function up and your inflammation down. So making sure that you're not deficient in progesterone and DHEA is important.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key factors for increasing metabolic rate and promoting fat oxidation, particularly for someone with a sluggish thyroid and weight gain?

**RAY PEAT:** You need about 100 grams of protein a day if you're at all active, just moving around normally, to keep your metabolic rate up. The calcium in two liters of milk is probably enough calcium. It promotes heat production and getting a normal amount of sodium and magnesium in your diet is important. Sodium works with the calcium to produce heat. And progesterone helps to set your temperature so that your body temperature stays up during the day towards 37 degrees Celsius, but not dropping extremely during the night. It's okay to cool down maybe as much as one degree Fahrenheit during the night, but it shouldn't go much below 97.7 or 98 Fahrenheit.

**CONTEXT:** How does protein intake, calcium, sodium, magnesium, and progesterone influence body temperature and metabolic rate?

**RAY PEAT:** DHEA comes in and adjusting your T3 or their thyroid. And the progesterone setting your temperature is important. Estrogen tends to lower your temperature, so you want to keep the ratio of progesterone to estrogen pretty high. A hundred to one is good.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of DHEA, progesterone, and estrogen in regulating body temperature and hormonal balance?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the things that can cause you to produce nitric oxide, which lowers your temperature working with estrogen, reversing the effects of thyroid, progesterone and DHEA, is intestinal inflammation produced by bacteria eating some kind of food that isn't fully digested. So, avoiding anything that's hard to digest, such as maybe potatoes or undercooked vegetables, can reduce the nitric oxide, reduce the estrogen, and help you to raise your temperature. Sometimes just having a raw carrot every day or a good portion of cooked mushrooms can reduce the endotoxin and nitric oxide production enough to switch your progesterone-estrogen ratio in a favorable direction. And raise your temperature over a period of just a few days.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between intestinal inflammation, nitric oxide, estrogen, and body temperature, and how can it be addressed?

**RAY PEAT:** For yeast overgrowth, the mushrooms and carrots sometimes is enough, but flowers of sulfur, just a pinch of it will clear up a yeast infection pretty quickly usually. Just two or three days will usually eliminate a yeast infection.

**CONTEXT:** What are effective natural remedies for yeast overgrowth?

**RAY PEAT:** In a fertility clinic about 30 years ago, they were giving antibiotics to see if it improved fertility, which it did. But a lot of the women noticed they were having drastic improvements in their general health, stopping migraines and other estrogen-related symptoms. And it turned out that the antibiotics were very quickly lowering the stress hormones and estrogen and raising progesterone. And that's been done on animals as well as people. And it is apparently eliminating the endotoxin to the extent that it stops producing nitric oxide and lets your cells begin oxidizing intensely.

**CONTEXT:** What is the observed effect of antibiotics on stress hormones, estrogen, progesterone, and cellular oxidation?

**RAY PEAT:** The other thing is the pulse is definitely seem very low in terms of the mid 50s. That's, I would probably call that a sub-metabolic rate for pulse. I know Dr. Peat, you always recommend from a healthy perspective that your pulse is round about 75. Between 75 and 85 is actually pretty good. It's a good indicator of metabolic rate for somebody who's actively eating a lot of fruits and vegetables. I'm burning glucose oxidatively and there's thyroid working properly in order to generate the heat that we would expect to reach 98.6 Fahrenheit on a kind of daily at midday from there on and or above basis every day. Well yeah and if you're not even reaching those normal temperatures then your metabolism is even slower than normal. Sometimes a little bit of coconut oil can increase your heat production.

**CONTEXT:** What is considered a healthy pulse rate, and how does it relate to metabolic rate, thyroid function, and heat production?

**RAY PEAT:** People that are overweight definitely have a more of an uphill struggle using thyroid in order to generate metabolic rate to help shed weight, because the very weight itself makes it kind of resistant for thyroid hormone to be absorbed by the cells. Keeping your serum vitamin D around the middle of the range, 50 to 55 or 60 nanograms per milliliter, is helpful for keeping your temperature and metabolic rate up. And the carrots will also help absorb the fat in the food too. It slows it down, but it's helpful for losing weight because it binds some of the fat you've eaten and carries it out of your body, too. And some of the material that your liver is excreting in the bile is carried out. Especially estrogen, which is excreted in the bile. It'll be reabsorbed if you don't have a constant flow of material, such as carrots or mushrooms, through your intestine.

**CONTEXT:** Why can being overweight make it harder to utilize thyroid hormone for weight loss, and how do vitamin D and carrots play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** Liver stimulants, even things like milk thistle to be liver supportive and also help excretion of waste products. And in terms of the fiber from raw carrot in the bowel would also help to reduce excess estrogen that way that would lower your overall toxic burden. And like Dr. Peat was saying the mushrooms because they're you know a good fiber and then they're also anti-estrogen. Red button mushrooms. Just make sure they're really well cooked. Two drugs that help the liver maintain its high activity are cascara sagrada, which is anti-inflammatory and sort of a liver tonic, and aspirin.

**CONTEXT:** What are some liver support strategies and natural compounds that aid in waste product excretion and estrogen reduction?

**RAY PEAT:** You want to keep your protein up, 75 to 100 grams, and your sugars. You don't want to go too low on the sugars because then you'll run on stress hormones. So really, in order to lose weight, you just have to really calorie count but make sure you're getting the right nutrients, getting the calories from the right nutrients like proteins and sugars rather than from very calorific sources like fat because you can make your own fat from the good sugars. And doing a little muscle building exercise such as dumbbell lifting, just two or three minutes at a time, helps to shift the hormone ratio. Because that will stimulate muscle production and muscles are very effective means for burning sugars and burning calories.

**CONTEXT:** What is the optimal approach to calorie intake, macronutrient balance, and exercise for weight loss?

**RAY PEAT:** Crying is a sign of stress and so finding out what the cause is important. Minimizing all of the stresses is going to maximize the life potential.

**CONTEXT:** How does stress, such as infant crying, impact brain development and life potential?

**RAY PEAT:** The hypothalamus itself, TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), stimulates TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) release, which is something we talk about a lot in terms of moving into action the production of thyroid hormone, and this comes from the pituitary. As well as thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulating prolactin from the anterior pituitary.

**CONTEXT:** How does the hypothalamus, specifically TRH, influence the release of TSH and prolactin from the anterior pituitary?

**RAY PEAT:** It very often does. For many many years I've noticed that when a woman complains of menorrhagia or a prolonged excessive menstruation they're often secreting milk even if they've never been pregnant or especially if they've had a couple of kids. The hormone changes that lead to the excessive menstruation also are causing prolactin excess, probably growth hormone excess too, too much growth hormone causes lactation, but it's really not uncommon for a middle-aged woman to have chronic milk formation associated with the overactivity of the thyroid system because their thyroid gland itself isn't able to produce the active hormones and the feedback process to turn off the pituitary. Almost everything the pituitary does it has its constructive adaptive effect overcoming whatever is causing stress to the whole organism in response to the changed feedback system. But in itself the substances produced in the pituitary are all harmful if they are continued. So what you want to do is have such a responsive high metabolic system that you can the tissue can respond fully to a little bit of pituitary hormone and turn it off quickly. Animals that have their pituitaries removed that are given a supplement of cortisol and thyroid will often live two or three times longer than animals that are normal with a normal pituitary function. Showing that the pituitary, to the extent that it's overactive, is shortening your life and shrinking your potential.

**CONTEXT:** Can TRH stimulation of prolactin lead to milk production in non-lactating females, and what does this indicate about pituitary hormone activity and its impact on lifespan?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the pituitary hormones I think should be kept minimal. Because if your body is producing enough thyroid and enough cortisol and enough estrogen and progesterone and testosterone, then your pituitary hormones will be minimal.

**CONTEXT:** Why is it recommended to keep pituitary hormones at minimal levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and your skin, if you get sunburned or have an inflammation, poison oak or anything that's hurting your skin, your skin can produce the pituitary hormones as well as stress hormones of various types. So every simple little tissue, your tonsils, any simple looking tissue if it's stressed will produce pituitary hormones, estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Can various tissues, including the skin and tonsils, produce pituitary hormones and estrogen when stressed?
