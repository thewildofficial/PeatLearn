**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, probably maybe a hundred women that I've talked to who were simply hypothyroidism was their basic problem but unwelcome lactation was just one of their symptoms. And usually there were menstrual irregularities at the same time either too much or too little menstruation and just correcting their thyroid function took care of the lactation and menstruation both and what it's doing it's partly it's regulating. Oxygen metabolism so that you can use your fuel very efficiently to keep your blood sugar steady so that you don't experience stress. Estrogen is in good health it's produced for about 12 hours once a month in a big surge to basically create tissue stress to stir up cell division to prepare the uterus. And the breast and the other tissues that are pituitary are the main things that are activated by estrogen. Low thyroid by letting you get low blood sugar inappropriately at the same time it's activating... the stress hormones and inactivating the parts of the liver that are normally destroying estrogen as soon as estrogen reaches the liver. Normally the small amount of estrogen being produced under moderate stress is kept very low by an active liver when the thyroid is activating the liver. When the thyroid is low, estrogen tends to rise and both of these tend to create an oxygen deficiency and a glucose deficiency. One intensifies the other and these are the first step in any kind of stress reaction. The stress reaction turns on your... pituitary as a way to organize the adaptive system of the body and prolactin in fish, prolactin regulates salt and water metabolism and mammals have the various components of milk formation involving both. the flow of water and salts, but including proteins and sugar. So prolactin in all animals has a range of anti-stress functions, and lactation is just a useful component for handling the stress of pregnancy fertility.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the potential for women to be exposed to higher than normal levels of prolactin and lactate when not nursing or fertile, and if Dr. Peat has observed this.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Any tissue of your body that is stressed will start to produce estrogen. It's a very basic reaction to stress. And so, with aging, for example......when you've lost some of your basic anti-stress hormones, thyroid and progesterone and pregnenolone......then all of your tissues are suffering from oxygen and glucose......bad metabolism. They're simply not interacting properly. And that means that all of your tissues will... begin producing a little bit of estrogen. For example, the postmenopausal breast tissue is producing several times more estrogen than it does during menstruation. And if the liver slows down because the thyroid is low, then that little bit that's being produced by any stress tissue is going to... pile up in the blood because it should be eliminated constantly through the liver and kidney.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks how the natural surge of estrogen once a month compares to the background levels of estrogen women are advised to protect themselves from, and if all cells can secrete estrogen in response to stress and inflammation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and old men get low testosterone because their stress tissue is turning it quickly into estrogen. Right, this is aromatization, right? Yeah, and a younger man. Who is very sick or has an accident will have very high estrogen. Right. And that will bring up usually prolactin and growth hormone and a lot of adaptive secondary hormones.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing how the ovaries are not the only source of estrogen and that any cell can secrete estrogen in response to stress and inflammation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Oxytocin really is just to release the milk once it's formed. It isn't involved in directly informing it. When I was a little kid during the Depression, there were very poor people moving into Southern California and some of them were finding jobs and one family we knew, the mother was able to find a job when they had a baby that was a few months old and the father, they'd been starving for years. And the father was able to lactate to nurse the baby while the mother was at work.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if oxytocin is a more powerful stimulator of lactation than prolactin, and shares an anecdote about a father lactating.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it's a very extreme thing. There were lots of men when they came out of the World War II prison camps. When they started eating, they got enough energy to mobilize cortisol and some thyroid and such. They began lactating because they had injured their tissues much as they were very high in estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat sees a difference in the quality of milk produced by men who lactate.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, they're probably not as harmful as the... the yeast-produced estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing gynecomastia in men and the role of estrogenic substances, including hops and yeast, in beer.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Within the first two or three hours of a big dose of cortisol or the synthetic glucocorticoids, the thymus gland starts shrinking and the skin and muscles begin shrinking as the cortisol shifts the metabolism in the opposite direction of testosterone. So what's the estrogenic side? Well, they activate... the proteolytic enzymes that break down the proteins and inhibit the anabolic protein synthesizing mechanisms. The brain, heart, and lungs are very concentrated testosterone metabolizers and retainers. If you give someone radioactive testosterone, you see the... Emission from those organs most of it from the heart and the brain the lungs are are so full of air you don't see Much radiation, but the testosterone is there protecting these vital organs But when you give a big dose of cortisol you swamp that protective effect of progesterone and Testosterone and the tissues that aren't very well protected It very quickly shrink your skin becomes thinner, blood vessels weaken, you tend to get little bloody spots, petechial hemorrhages and bruise very easily. Lots of women have constantly bruised thighs and sometimes upper arms because of the... if they're low in thyroid and progesterone then they compensate with increased cortisol which we conserve. Small blood vessels and they bruise easily. If that continues over the years it leads to the strokes and osteoporosis and the typical aging conditions. I've known people in England especially that I don't know whether or not the doctors there were just more readily prescribing aerosolized inhalants, corticosteroid inhalants for asthma and all. Tropical creams for eczema but it was the only thing that was ever really done and I've known people that have been on these things for years and years and I'm sure to their detriment.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the dangers of chronic use of hydrocortisone and what a better approach to quell inflammation would be.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and asthma is one of the typical. Estrogen induced inflammation, high estrogen women are very susceptible to asthma especially during the night and one of the effects of estrogen is to directly stimulate the adrenal glands to produce cortisol so high estrogen leads to weak blood vessels and shrinking bones and aging skin and low immunity and such. Shrinking effect of cortisol on the thymus gland and estrogen activates, shifts the balance towards serotonin away from dopamine and this shift in the serotonin dopamine ratio is one of the things that activates the prolactin system and it also, serotonin is one of the major activators of the... corticotropic release hormones, CRH. So estrogen activates the pituitary, the hypothalamus, the adrenal glands directly to increase the tissue breakdown effect.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if Dr. Peat's view on cortisol is that it switches off protective anti-excitotoxic mechanisms and mediates estrogen-induced inflammation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, all of the stress hormones rise during the night. And again, in response probably to low blood sugar because of fasting or... Yeah, and hypoglycemia or disturbed oxygen availability increase. Both prolactin and usually growth hormone stress induces, I think, all of the pituitary hormones except for luteinizing hormone, the one that produces testosterone and progesterone. So when you activate all of the other parts of the pituitary, you're likely to... become sterile by losing your progesterone and testosterone.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the worsening of asthma in female asthmatics at night is related to nighttime stress and low blood sugar.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think from a male perspective, for those males that are listening, I know we do tend to get more female listeners that I think intuitively are more nurturing and I don't know, empathic maybe, but for the guys that are out there, having testosterone is extremely important to reiterate. Not just the prostatic involvement with decreased testosterone but to maximize your testosterone is the best thing that you can do as a guy because it is the counterpart to estrogen and it is the anti-excitotoxic route by which inflammation is quelled and the body is governed by a orderly system of growth and sugar metabolism etc. It's close enough in function to... progesterone in protective tissues that they've experimented removing the ovaries from rats after they've been impregnated and then giving them testosterone during pregnancy. It is a progestin in that sense of being able to sustain pregnancy in the absence of ovaries.

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the importance of testosterone for men.

---

**RAY PEAT:** When that happens during gestation, or in the first few months, after being born, the actual cell structure of the brain is still going on, and it's either masculinized or not by the presence of testosterone, which is turned into estrogen, and estrogen, in those stages of development, is the masculinizing hormone, and so a deficiency of progesterone. Early in life leaves the estrogen unopposed and tends to masculinize the brain, and so it can set up the feeling of the gender that is chemically activated rather than what the chromosomes were able to do.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks if a hormone imbalance can influence someone's perception of their gender, referencing environmental estrogens and the case of Caitlyn Jenner.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think the... The technology is so simplified compared to what actually is needed by the organism to maximize its metabolism and function and experience that I don't think the technology is going to have a role in future. Development of health longevity or brain development. It's certainly not going to be passed on to the next generation so it's certainly a very temporal thing and I think from my perspective the human body and I think the psyche plays a much bigger part in the protection and the development of the human organism far more than perhaps people give real credit to for positive thinking etc etc self-empowerment. Doing the right thing in terms of everything that you propose in terms of nutrition and or some of the few supplements that you recommend, things like thyroid and progesterone and things that protect the anti-inflammatory side, then I think we have a far better chance of living a genetically very healthy life is something that I think that can be passed on to next generations and certainly we hear about in utero effects onto the fetus. I've often wondered, I'm fairly interested about the transhumanism subject with, like the call has mentioned, things like robotic replacements and or chips to secrete or to prompt secretion of neuropeptides etc. etc. into the brain or other areas but it doesn't continue, it's just a very temporal thing. I don't think it's something that can ever be transmitted but what can be transmitted is a mental state of mind that is based on positive thinking, creating that in harmony and, you know, whether it's yoga or doing, you know, exercise and getting outside and just appreciating everything that you have around you rather than looking at negative things which I do hear people calling about from time to time in terms of help with negative emotions and how it's actually one of the questions, funnily enough, later on the show.

**CONTEXT:** A caller from Finland asks Dr. Peat's thoughts on transhumanism and its potential role in future human evolution, referencing the theory of life trending towards maximum metabolism and energy.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think the hair on the head actually has the function of preserving heat, helping to keep the brain warm, wearing a wool hat will substitute somewhat for not having enough hair on the head, and the other hair, armpits and cubic hair, I think that has the function of helping to distribute pheromones. Somewhat the facial hair and the arm hair probably has that pheromone distributing function, but I think the body hair that is tending to appear more often in women is a sign of stress, that it's probably related to that pheromone system shifting to a... an exaggerated steroid production in the skin.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the stress of frequent shaving, and Dr. Peat discusses the functions of hair and the potential meaning of increased body hair in women.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Muscle contraction activates the synthesis locally in the muscle of testosterone and decreases the cortisol activity. So, good physical work is probably the central thing to keeping your testosterone up. Thank you. It shouldn't be episodic, intense, stressful work. That is known to lower your testosterone and increase cortisol and at the same time keeping your metabolic rate up so that you can do more intense activity without it being stressful. Having your liver very healthy is essential for keeping your testosterone up because otherwise the......episodes of falling blood sugar activate cortisol, estrogen, all of the other stress hormones.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a good program for men to increase lean muscle mass to promote testosterone production, noting that muscle itself promotes testosterone surges.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think that even in Parkinson's disease, I think the studies are moving towards... thinking of a balance between serotonin and dopamine and the other symptoms. So you're thinking of serotonin excess might exacerbate... Yeah, they are somewhat antagonistic. For example, serotonin increases the CRH and prolactin. Dopamine tends to inhibit them. So this bad bowels or bad bowel function or poor elimination would certainly speed that serotonin excess up, wouldn't it? Yes, nitric oxide, endotoxin and serotonin all shift your body towards the stress. And progesterone and its derivatives in the brain, allopregnenolone, for example, are important for keeping the balance in the right direction. Yes, estrogen. Increases the serotonin and stress progesterone tends to reverse that and increase the balance towards dopamine.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a lack of dopamine, potentially leading to addiction, could cause Parkinson's-type symptoms in the future and if dopamine supplementation would be useful for addicts.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I think you can correct it most safely with... Progesterone and Testosterone or the precursor of both of those, Phrygminolone, because when you try to push the dopamine system, you tend to increase oxidative damage. And it's safe to work at the anti-stress level rather than pushing the end product of dopamine. So improve muscle......muscle mass, plenty of sugars, then obviously, pregnant alone thyroid, all helpful and anti-inflammatory aspects. Yeah, and keeping the toxic fats down and sugar stable. Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if addictive natures, linked to a lack of dopamine, could be a cause for Parkinson's later in life.

---

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think deep sleep is important as a restorative part of your brain function. Yeah, and I think a lot of people would be happier and healthier if they would eat during the night People Who resist eating near bedtime or during the night? often have more stress, more hypoglycemic insomnia and most people can get back to sleep if they have could be orange juice or lemonade or milkshake or ice cream or whatever. It's almost a cultural barrier where there's this feeling that if you eat close to bedtime you're just going to put it on as fat. I think I've certainly heard that doctrine that excess carbohydrates are stored as fat which I don't know that it's completely inaccurate but the nighttime stress that is achieved by lowering your blood glucose is probably offset by the very fact that you're going to consume some glucose before you sleep. Yeah it's very important to restore your glycogen level during sleep. I think that's one of the main purposes of sleep is to get the glycogen back into your brain cells and heart cells and other tissues so that you can expand it to resist stress during the daytime.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the connection between sleepwalking, raiding the fridge at night, growth hormone, and deep sleep, questioning if it's a scientifically mismanaged subject.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think he was having standard chemotherapy for a while and then brain radiation and then he got this new antibody that is specific for allowing cells to undergo the normal apoptosis so statistically nd then he got this new antibody that is specific for allowing cells to undergo the normal apoptosis so statistically doesn't look like it was a terribly impressive cure because the number of people studied was not very big and the percentage who responded well I think it was 24% had a temporary regression of the tumors and that happened in a lot of the people who had. Only the preceding brain radiation.

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks if Jimmy Carter's cancer cure had anything to do with receptors and if the entire cell is a receptor.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The carrageenan is sulfated. And I think all of the sulfated polysaccharides besides their own heparin, I think all of those are toxic and dangerous. And the xanthan gums and gum arabic and lots of the plant gums are not digestible but they can support bacterial growth in the intestine. Where the carrageenan is specifically pro-inflammatory and very dangerous, the other gums are simply nuisances that tend to increase bacterial growth and gas production and such. Where the frankincense and myrrh contain lots of anti-inflammatory substances, probably anti-cancer effects, some steroid. Like molecules, not so different from testosterone and progesterone, they seem to have an anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation effect on cancer cells.

**CONTEXT:** A listener asks if gums like frankincense and myrrh are toxic, similar to carrageenan and xanthan gum.

---

**RAY PEAT:** But my position is that since the condition of the cell determines... what a particular substance binding to that receptor is going to do to the cell, it isn't as meaningful as some people think to activate a receptor because it can have opposite effects depending on the history of the cell and the present condition of other cells.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's view on receptors.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think we're full of stem cells and what we have to do is activate them intelligently. Yeah, do you think the research is going in the right direction? You probably know more about what is actually being conducted in some of these experiments and see if it's actually reasonably possible to bring about something positive. Yeah, finding out exactly what the kind of stress signal is that activates them. It's already known that many types of stress will activate the maturing of stem cells and that things like progesterone and testosterone, once they have been activated, will keep them going in the right direction so that they......replace tissues rather than replacing cancer. When they kill cancer by radiation or chemotherapy or surgery, the cancer tends to come back even though they removed the tumor completely because the place where the cancer was has been injured and it calls out to the body for stem cells to repair the damage and being damaged itself as a framework, it... misdirects the stem cells, so they develop into cancer.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the view on stem cell technology and if it's a way forward to turn around degenerative processes.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The nutrients that are most important are magnesium and vitamin A. Replacement and repair of cells, but the whole range of nutrients, protein, zinc, vitamin D, anti-inflammatory things like vitamin E and vitamin K, everything is really essential ultimately for protecting the intestine. So having liver and eggs and milk and orange juice, for example. That can often get the repair going. I think the reason eggs have a bad reputation is that they are extremely concentrated protein. And if a person eats an egg or two without carbohydrate, their blood sugar is going to fall for sure, especially if their liver doesn't have good glycogen stores. The egg will drop their blood sugar. That will activate mast cells and you'll have allergic reactions. Ah, that is fascinating. Without the carbohydrate, you're going to increase inflammation. And sugar and progesterone and aspirin are things that will protect you from those surges of histamine and serotonin, etc.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about controlling endotoxin and compounds to heal or strengthen the intestinal lining, mentioning gelatin and the avoidance of nutrient-dense foods like eggs and dairy in some protocols.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Well, low thyroid, ultimately, is the most common reason for not having enough glycogen stored. And the cortisol weakens the tissues so that... Yeah, even though it helps get your blood sugar up and momentarily protects the glycogen in the long run, it's adding to the problem of unstable blood sugar. And anytime your blood sugar falls, the mast cells are likely to degranulate. And that's influenced by a lack of testosterone and progesterone or an excess of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if histamine is produced due to a lack of glycogen from a cortisol spike.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Your digestion slows down. When your metabolic rate slows down from hypothyroidism, your stomach becomes sluggish, doesn't secrete much, and doesn't move fast enough. People might have transit time. They might eat a carrot today and it might not come out for four or five days. That's what happens with hypothyroidism. Speeding up your digestion and secretions, it should be... So active streaming fluid from your stomach and pancreas and liver should wash your whole small intestine clean so that no bacteria can thrive in it.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks if a lack of thyroid hormone is a root cause of small bowel overgrowth (SIBO) and leaky gut.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Years ago, I've seen some really good monographs on particular topics like how the intestine works, how the digestive glands work and so on, but I don't know of one that has put everything together.

**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a recommendation for a nutrition-based textbook that covers mechanisms with nutrition and hormones.
