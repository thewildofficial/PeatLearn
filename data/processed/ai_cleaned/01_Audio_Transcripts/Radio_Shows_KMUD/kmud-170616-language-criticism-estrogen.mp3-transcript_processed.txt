**RAY PEAT:** The gene theory is really the best basis for an authoritarian theory of society and organization of society. Konrad Lorenz developed the idea of genetically based behavior for Hitler, for the Nazi party, as the ideology for the race supremacism and the elimination of inferior people and so on. And exactly that ideology was taken up by American biologists as soon as the war was over, and Chomsky's idea of generative grammar, it's really structurally identical to Konrad Lorenz's genetically based theory of behavior. And Chomsky's research is financed by the Pentagon for use in war-making. But it's really the same ideology that Lorenz developed for social control and genocide.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to the influence of certain ideologies on scientific thought and societal control.

**RAY PEAT:** It started in the 1930s, Chomsky wasn't the originator of the idea, it came out of the early computer thinking, that you needed a language that wasn't complex and fluid, if you were going to put all knowledge into computers, things had to be absolutely self-contained. And so they developed a theory of reality in which the reality was made up of self-contained units in which their position in space and time didn't affect them essentially because they wanted the language to have a one-to-one relationship to reality. And the computers could only handle absolutely discrete units of information. So the ideology of reality was set so that it worked in computers. And that fit with the idea that each of our units of meaning is determined genetically by a discrete molecular structure. And so behavior would be reduced to these discrete units. And grammar was simply one of the types of behaviors that could be genetically determined. And so Chomsky was just one of the people completing this theory that genes control behavior, grammar is one of our behaviors, and so language can be reduced to these units.

**CONTEXT:** The conversation explores the link between early computer science, genetic determinism, and linguistic theory.

**RAY PEAT:** The body makes a variety of hormones which are essential for acute reactions to stress. Histamine, for example, and antihistamines are beneficial in many, even though the antihistamine is a synthetic drug turning off a natural. It can be very protective, save lives. Estrogen, antitensin, serotonin, nitric oxide are other intrinsic natural hormones which are very important for acute reactions to stress. But like histamine, when they are continued too long or at too high a concentration, they become deadly.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the difference between estrogen and progesterone, and why one is considered beneficial while the other is not.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen was known over 100 years ago, about 1905. It was clearly identified as a cause of cancer. I thought they knew in the 1800s that the chimney sweeps were developing testicular cancer from the high estrogenic content of the charcoal and the coal. Oh yeah, the identity of estrogen and the carcinogens that wasn't. It was clearly chemically identified until about 1935, 36, 37, a series of papers came out and these people warned against the use of any estrogen for treatment because the chemical work made clear that the soot carcinogenesis that was known from the 18th century and the various chemical coal tar carcinogens that were studied through the late 19th and early 20th century these were seen to be essentially estrogenic, creating inflammation, fibrosis and cancer as well as the typical estrogen symptoms and in the 1930s already progesterone was identified as the protective agent against the carcinogenic and other degenerative effects of both estrogen and the coal tar soot polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. And for 20 years, from 1935 to 1955, that work continued. It was submerged. The story that Carla Rothenberg tells makes it clear what was happening. In 1940, 1941, the drug companies intervened to create their own story. First, estrogen was a female hormone that would support pregnancy and retard aging. Then, in the later 1940s, progesterone, to sell products, they realized that progesterone was expensive to make and couldn't be patented. So each company developed a synthetic product that had some of progesterone's actions. But testosterone, for example, had some of progesterone's actions. It couldn't sustain the uterine condition that's necessary for pregnancy. But many of the chemicals that showed one of the reactions of progesterone, most of them in the late 1940s, had also properties of estrogen. And in fact, they would terminate pregnancy. Progesterone was named for the ability to sustain gestation, progestational, but the synthetic chemicals were given that name even though they blocked, destroyed gestation, created immediate miscarriage or abortion. So the FDA was basically controlled by the drug companies to falsify language, use language exactly in the opposite sense so that these progestins that have continued to be used in birth control pills some of them are strongly estrogenic and all of them interfere with terminating pregnancy and they're not bioidentical progesterone they're a synthetic progesterone um yeah they're anti-progesterone actually but the FDA do not support gestation allows them to be called progestins and worse than that the FDA requires that natural progesterone be given the properties of the anti-progesterones. If a synthetic progesterone causes heart disease, for example, then they have to warn that natural progesterone might cause heart disease or deformities of the developing embryo.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion delves into the historical understanding of estrogen's carcinogenic properties and progesterone's protective role, highlighting the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in shaping medical narratives.

**RAY PEAT:** Also, I'm aware that estrogen is found in food. Leach is out of plastic bottles, hormones that are in the oral contraceptive pill are estrogenic. The water supply becomes contaminated with estrogens. What else is there that's estrogenic? Bisphenol A is one of the most widespread synthetic estrogenic substances used in plastics. It's been known for about 120 years. A man who developed diethylstilbestrol, DES, in the 1930s was warning that it shouldn't be used in treating humans, but the drug companies immediately put it to use as a female hormone to prevent miscarriage and retard aging, even though it was known to cause miscarriage and to cause cancer. So we're exposed to a lot of estrogens in our environment. But are we exposed to progesterone, natural bioidentical progesterone, in our foods or in our environment? Milk naturally contains some progesterone, and it contains a little thyroid and estrogen, but naturally if the mother was providing a large amount of estrogen to the babies, natural milk would cause feminization of boy babies. So it's obvious that natural milk contains predominantly progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** The conversation addresses environmental sources of estrogenic compounds and the natural presence of progesterone in milk.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen makes the blood vessels leaky, and various types of inflammation can set off that leakiness. It isn't necessarily an injury. This girl that I recently talked to didn't have any identified injury. It was just closely associated with PMS symptoms. And vitamin D deficiency is one of the things that can increase the leakiness of the membranes.

**CONTEXT:** A caller describes a condition involving fluid leakage and headaches, and Dr. Peat discusses potential contributing factors related to hormone balance and vitamin D.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that I think is the safest antihistamine because it also takes down serotonin excess. That's... Yeah. I tried that and then I got restless legs. So I could try it again, but it really didn't help me sleep very well.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion touches upon the use of cyproheptadine as an antihistamine with potential benefits for serotonin excess, and its side effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, after you've used a few of the typical doses of one or two milligrams, it seems that you get more sensitive to it and can get a good reaction from a tenth of a milligram.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat suggests a reduced dosage for cyproheptadine.

**RAY PEAT:** One other substance that has some antihistamine anti-leakiness effects is Emodin, either from Cascara or Rhubarb Root.

**CONTEXT:** Emodin is mentioned as another substance with antihistamine and anti-leakiness properties.

**RAY PEAT:** I use two scoops. Is that not enough? I don't know what size the scoop is. What is that size, please? 30... probably 150 milligrams. When I first tried it, I brought back a telegram from Syntex in Mexico and... I felt so much better on a hundred or three hundred milligrams, I wanted to see if it was safe to recommend and so I ate about three thousand milligrams a day for a year and felt great, didn't find any side effects and studies on rats in which they gave a rat about ten thousand milligrams in a single dose, they didn't see any harmful side effects so... And I noticed personally that a hundred milligrams I didn't notice anything with but three hundred and fifty milligrams and I said okay now I notice an effect from this pectinal and a very positive effect.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat discusses his personal experience and research with pregnenolone, noting significant positive effects at doses of 350mg and higher, with no observed side effects even at very high doses in animal studies.

**RAY PEAT:** It would be good, you know, despite your reservations about being punctured for phlebotomy it would be good to know your progesterone to estrogen ratio to be reasonably scientific about the whole approach to it because you might have a very low progesterone to estrogen ratio which is what Dr. P is coming from I think in terms of estrogen being a very low progesterone. Totally responsible for inflammation and that inflammation and leakiness that is governed by estrogen's effects on the vasculature may well be a contributory factor to what you're experiencing at night time. And if you look into Life Extension you can get some blood work ordered. They'll order blood work for you without a doctor. So if you don't want to go see an MD then call Life Extension up. Very good. They'll order you blood tests.

**CONTEXT:** The importance of assessing the progesterone to estrogen ratio is emphasized, as a low ratio is linked to inflammation and vascular leakiness, potentially contributing to the caller's symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1930s and 1940s, Alexander Lipschutz tested on various animals the effects of very small doses of estrogen. And he thought that if that small dose was continuous, it would be carcinogenic to every tissue he looked at, brain, kidney, one, so on. Was that bioidentical estrogen? Yes, bioidentical, but he found that if you interrupted it regularly, the way the body does with the monthly progesterone, the luteal phase where you have progesterone in huge amounts for two weeks, that interrupts the carcinogenic effect of estrogen. Even a big surge of estrogen once a month isn't carcinogenic as long as you're protecting it and knocking it out of cells with good dose of progesterone. So it doesn't matter that the dose of estrogen is small, it's the discontinuity that is protective.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat explains that while estrogen can be carcinogenic, regular interruption, similar to the body's natural progesterone cycle, mitigates this risk.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, actually the estrogen turns on nitric oxide which is a vasodilator and causes leakiness of the blood vessels. You've got all three, you know there's three estrogens and you're using them all. They all have the same effects but at different doses. This is the best trial. It is about ten times weaker than estradiol and so many doctors prescribe a dose such as maybe a hundred micrograms or up to one milligram of estriol to get the same effect that they would get from maybe twenty or thirty micrograms of estradiol but it's still harmful if you don't interrupt it.

**CONTEXT:** The role of estrogen in vasodilation and blood vessel leakiness is discussed, along with the relative potencies of different estrogen forms.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that's the strongest one, so it's safer with the lower dose. E3 is the weakest. Well, E1 and E3 are both weak. So why don't you try cutting out E2 and just using the E3 for two weeks out of the month? And using the progesterone the whole cycle and see what happens with your hot flashes.

**CONTEXT:** A suggestion is made to experiment with reducing estradiol (E2) and using estriol (E3) for part of the month, alongside progesterone, to manage hot flashes.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't know of any such effects of the pH of the food metabolism. But it's important to keep your protein and your B vitamins up. Those are the main things that a deficiency of will allow the liver to let estrogen build up in your body. Protein and B1 especially are the anti-estrogen nutrients. Another research fact that my colleague friend from Oxford University found out about plastic water bottles is that if they're room temperature they leak less plasticizers into the water. If they're cold or frozen they become brittle and leach much more. Plastic compounds into the water. I think with the advent of this information of plastics leaching estrogenic mimics into the food and into the liquid they carry I think there's much more effort now to produce HDPE and other plastics which are not... Yeah but not into go foods. I mean they're not going to use that high quality plastic into go foods. So that might apply to your food that you buy out of plastic containers. If it's in the refrigerator it's going to be leaching more. Plastics into the food.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat addresses concerns about plastic leaching into food and beverages, emphasizing the importance of protein and B vitamins for estrogen metabolism and suggesting that room temperature storage of plastic water bottles may reduce leaching.
