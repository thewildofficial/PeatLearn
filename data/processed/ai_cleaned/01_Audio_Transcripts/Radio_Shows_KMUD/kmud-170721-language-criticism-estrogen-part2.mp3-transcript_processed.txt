**RAY PEAT:** "My professor had previously found that a vitamin E deficiency would create the same conditions and others had found that an excess of polyunsaturated fatty acids created very similar conditions. Vitamin E was, around 1935 to 40, was known as the fertility vitamin and some Italian researchers in the 40s called vitamin E the progesterone protective vitamin. They saw that both progesterone and vitamin E were preserving fertility while estrogen... or polyunsaturated fats were seen to create very quick miscarriage."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking Dr. Peat to elaborate on the anti-aging effects of progesterone and its cell-stabilizing properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "My professor showed that at any stage of pregnancy, if you adjusted the dose of estrogen, you could create miscarriage, death of the fetus in animals, very often resorption rather than expulsion of the embryo. According to the stage of pregnancy, he would give an increased amount of estrogen and it would kill the developing embryos."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the historical suppression of progesterone's benefits and the promotion of estrogen, referencing Dr. Carla Rothenberg's thesis.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1930s and 40s, both thyroid hormone and progesterone were recognized as the fertility protective chemicals and progesterone was widely prescribed to if a woman was starting to bleed during the early months of pregnancy just a few doses of progesterone would prevent that and make the pregnancy turn out normal even if it wasn't continued."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about progesterone supplementation during early pregnancy, particularly for women experiencing spotting.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Fibroids was. after a long time considered to be the main fertility chemical for both men and women, but then in the 1940s after the estrogen industry had created the consortium and conspiracy that Carla Rothenberg wrote about, the similar things were happening to the thyroid industry and the same companies that made... Estrogen were selling progesterone and since progesterone countered the effects of estrogen they suppressed their own promotion of progesterone and started selling something that would be compatible with their sales of estrogen and to suppress the importance of using progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the historical suppression of progesterone and its connection to the estrogen industry.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it was 1946 or 47 that I saw the publication declare that progesterone, the natural substance, is destroyed by stomach acid and this one, as mentioned in a medical journal, had no supporting reference, no explanation. They just said, stomach acid is harsh stuff and it'll destroy progesterone. But it turns out that... To make progesterone, you purify the substance, including stages in which it's boiled in concentrated acid, to remove the other things. Progesterone is intensely resistant to breakdown by things in the stomach, so it works fine to take them orally. But they created the myth among doctors that you can't take it orally, so they sold a new chemical... which they called a progestin, that would... It sounds like progesterone, but it wasn't."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the misrepresentation of progesterone's oral bioavailability.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and in fact, it became a component to use with estrogen in the birth control pills because it prevents gestation. Antiprogesterone. Antiprogesterogenic. Yeah, they're antiprogestational, but they're categorized with approval....of the FDA in the same category as progesterone, so that has tainted the understanding of progesterone because it's classified in the anti-progesterone class. And a similar thing happened with thyroid. The synthetic products displaced the natural thyroid products and... the whole thing that thyroid creates fertility by lowering estrogen and increasing progesterone. That whole principle was suppressed and forgotten for 70 years."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing how synthetic progestins in birth control pills have tainted the understanding of natural progesterone.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that's a good description it stimulates cell division during a period of about 12 hours once a month it surges and dominates and is concentrated in the pituitary the breasts and the uterus and it prepares those for pregnancy by creating a wave of cell division but the function of progesterone is to come in at a hundred times the concentration or even higher to knock out, destroy these progesterone or the estrogen binding chemical to destroy the influence of estrogen so that the cells stop dividing and start maturing."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking Dr. Peat for a concise description of estrogen's function, comparing it to progesterone.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Because it is totally progesterone that sustains the pregnancy and like you said it's a hundred times or more that background physiological levels that give women that glowing skin and and the kind of freedom from any acne they might have had before. As well as the hair that's growing beautifully and it's silky and the nails and everything that's flourishing and blossoming in a woman when you look at a pregnant lady and you go wow she looks really healthy she looks beautiful you know that's a glow of progesterone isn't it?"

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the visible signs of progesterone's benefits in women.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I've used Progesterone myself on and off for about 40 or 45 years. And I've found that at times only 10 milligrams per day was enough to stop my whiskers growing temporarily and act as an anti-testosterone. But other times I can take 5 or 10 milligrams and it seems to increase my testosterone and my whiskers don't slow down. And people have told me that they have a similar effect. Usually it's people over 55 or so who have the pro androgen effect when they take 10 or 20 milligrams of progesterone. But if a person has, for example, heart failure or other fairly intense things for migraine or epilepsy, for example, I've used as much as 100 or 150 milligrams in one dose. For a migraine, and it stopped it within about a minute, and you get a very sudden effect. Strengthen your heart, for example, if you're having heart failure when you take a good strong dose like that. But it depends on the situation and your own hormone balance."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about progesterone dosage and application, specifically for heart health and general use.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The same way a woman would, you can take 5 milligrams, wait 15 minutes. If you feel the desired effect, repeat it. Just keep taking 5 or 10 milligrams at a time until, for example, when I'm under stress, sometimes I have bulgy veins on the backs of my hands and wrists. And either a big glass of very sweet orange juice or sugar and milk or a dollop of progesterone will make the veins tone up. And I don't have any varicose veins in my feet and so on, which I was starting to get 45 years ago. But the occasional use of progesterone has made all of the visible blood vessels in my feet disappear."

**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking for clarification on progesterone usage, and Dr. Peat is providing personal experience and practical application.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, those are produced under stress. And so keeping the intestine un-inflamed, avoiding raw or undercooked vegetables and grains, for example, sometimes is all it takes. Increasing the movement through the intestine by increasing the fiber. The content of your food, raw carrot or cooked bamboo shoots or cooked mushrooms, for example, can lower the stress hormones by cleaning out your intestine, preventing reabsorption of estrogen and cortisol from the intestine."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about high calcium and high triglycerides.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I think that's too... it's similar to digitalis which in the right dose it can be protected but progesterone......and DHEA are the body's natural hormone equivalents and they don't have the risk that you run if you're taking an unmonitored wabin or a digitalis."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about Ouabain and its potential use, and Dr. Peat contrasts it with natural hormones.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Oh, yeah, if something is driving your aldosterone abnormally high, such as a deficiency of progesterone, then the combination of high aldosterone and high salt intake will increase your blood pressure. But when you're thyroid... and vitamin D and calcium intake are good, that will hold down your aldosterone. And progesterone antagonizes the effects of aldosterone. So that combination vitamin D, calcium, thyroid, and progesterone are the basic anti-aldosterone system and the blood pressure regulating system. Apart from sodium."

**CONTEXT:** The caller is experiencing slight swelling in their feet and has concerns about salt intake and aldosterone.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The high calcium level in the serum is a pretty good indication in most people that you're not eating enough calcium. Or not having enough vitamin D, not enough sunlight. A vitamin D deficiency will very often cause your parathyroid hormone to rise to the point that it takes calcium out of your bones and increases the serum calcium. So taking a good supplement, getting your serum vitamin D level up to 50 nanograms per... nanograms per millilitre and taking in at least a thousand milligrams of calcium per day will generally lower your serum calcium to normal by lowering the parathyroid hormone."

**CONTEXT:** The caller mentions having high calcium according to their tests.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, it could be it could be that you're I do say talk to people. In Canada that have low vitamin D I think just being that far north you certainly get less daylight well less sun exposure than you do in more temperate regions so vitamin D supplementation is always good to get your blood tested for vitamin D because you may well find you've got a low level you didn't even know about."

**CONTEXT:** The caller mentions eating eggshells and cheese but still having high calcium, and Dr. Peat discusses potential vitamin D deficiency, especially in northern climates.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "It was around 1970 when it was finally becoming too public that linoleic acid was carcinogenic to keep promoting it as the heart protective hat because it caused heart disease as well as cancer and that was when the fish oil industry, the Environmental Protection Agency was pressuring them to stop polluting, throwing throwing fish fat and fish heads and fish skins in the coastal waters and nearby landfills. And the carcinogenicity of the vegetable oils was an opportunity for them to say, well, here's another essential fatty acid, so-called, that isn't linoleic acid. So that whole promotion of the fish oils. As the alternative, supposedly less carcinogenic essential fatty acid grew up. But around 1970 was a turning point for the essential fat mythology and for the estrogen progesterone industries."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the dangers of vegetable oils and their link to cancer, and Dr. Peat elaborates on the shift to promoting fish oils.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "For example, in the 1940s it was the George and Olive Smith professors at Harvard who promoted the DES use during pregnancy and created the epidemic of cervical cancer in the daughters of the women who had it and even in the granddaughters of those women. Then the birth control industry created a new definition of the protestants and progesterone was identified with the anti-protestants used in contraception. And in the 1960s the three major estrogen industries... In total, they gave 1.3 million dollars, which in the 1960s was a lot of money, to Robert Wilson and his foundation. He wrote Feminine Forever, a book, really just an accumulation of lying claims that estrogen keeps you young and that menopause consists of the loss of... of estrogen, when in fact the first signs of menopause involve the failure to produce the surge of progesterone around the ovulation, leaving estrogen unopposed. So the onset of menopause really is the onset of estrogen dominance."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking Dr. Peat to detail the phases of the conspiracy against progesterone, as outlined by Carla Rothenberg.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Following the support for Robert Wilson's book, there was a huge increase in sales of of progesterone, such as... Premarin and other, not progesterone, estrogen and premarin especially, the number of prescriptions for estrogens between 1970 and 75 quadrupled largely because of that promotion of Robert Wilson's phony claims about estrogen-preserving youth. And the consequent... of that tremendous surge between 1970 and 76. In those years, the incidence of metastatic breast cancer in very young women between the ages of 25 and 39 began to increase steadily every year. And by the year 2009, that age group......had experienced a three-fold increase in metastatic breast cancer. Other things, environmental estrogens and obesity and other things probably contributed to it. But that great surge of the use of estrogen was probably the main cause. We're still seeing the......increased, drastic increase of metastatic cancer in young women where it never used to occur."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the impact of Robert Wilson's book "Feminine Forever" and the subsequent increase in estrogen use.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "And in the 1930s and 40s, animal experimenters were seeing that estrogen is not only carcinogenic to the uterus and breast, but the next most sensitive tissue is the lung. The kidneys and brain and other organs are... also cause to develop tumors and then cancer, but the lungs are the next most sensitive. And if you look at the incidence of lung cancer in men, it was dropping off by the 1970s when women were starting to use more estrogen and the female incidence of lung cancer......took off at the same time breast cancer in young women took off. And the curve is very similar for lung cancer and young women's metastatic breast cancer. And it has continued to rise. It's rising more slowly in the last ten years, but still it shows that tremendous increase in exposure to estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the link between estrogen and cancer, and Dr. Peat elaborates on estrogen's carcinogenic effects on various organs, including the lungs.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The same changes that occurred in old animals in the uterus could be produced immediately just by overdosing them on estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is explaining his observations during his graduate studies on the effects of estrogen and aging on the uterus.
