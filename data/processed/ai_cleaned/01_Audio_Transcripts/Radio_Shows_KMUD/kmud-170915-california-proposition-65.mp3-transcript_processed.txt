**RAY PEAT:** Well, the way the committee is set up... The people in charge of choosing the evidence are appointed and they are basically able to lobby for products that they are associated with. When I was in contact with the agency about ten years ago, three of the members were from... a single university. These three all had conflicts of interest. One woman was a representative of a company developing transdermal products including hormones. Two of the people were connected with the development of a new approach to birth control with chin pals. The suppression of progesterone and the articles that were chosen, supposedly all relevant evidence relating to the carcinogenicity of a substance are to be considered. Fewer than 1% of the articles relating to progesterone and cancer were even listed and of those, two of them. We're about a totally different substance, a carcinogenic synthetic progesterone and one of the articles that they cited as evidence of the carcinogenicity of the actual substance progesterone was actually someone's attempt to refute a famous publication. showing that progesterone prevents and cures cancer and this publication was used explicitly a method that the one they were trying to refute a method that they said previously didn't work at all. So they used a known false method to supposedly invalidate. The evidence showing that progesterone cures cancer and that was listed by the committee as evidence that progesterone causes cancer. It was like the people were basically drunk when they were choosing the papers. I asked the chairman of the committee for the names of the people who made those crazy choices of evidence. And she said they were too busy to give me that information. And my impression was that it was not really a regulatory agency in public interest. It was promoting products. Right. On a pay for view basis. Yeah. And the university that these people worked for. I looked at their research support. I forget the number of many. There were dozens of grants of promoting arguments, research that gave the impression that estrogen was therapeutic for many different things. And I looked for how much they had on progesterone. They had two or three research grants. Aimed to show that progesterone was harmful. And this was ten years ago, just three years after the Women's International Health Study showed that the combination of estrogen and synthetic progesterone caused cancer, strokes, dementia, heart disease, blood clots.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, do you have any thoughts on Prop 65 in terms of how it affects people or what you think the government are doing?

**RAY PEAT:** The result of that study, Women's International Health Study, showed that those negative results resulted in cancer. An extreme rejection by women of the use of that combination of synthetic progestin and estrogen and there was an 80% decrease in the use of that particular prescription form of progestin plus estrogen with the loss. One company lost billions in sales. Everyone invested in promoting estrogen especially with the synthetic progestin saw their main profit making product becoming very unpopular and suddenly at the same time when estrogen sales were falling progestin sales had increased a hundred fold and suddenly money became available to research progesterone as a toxic substance and since that time since the early years right after the study came out there has been this flood of people researching progesterone as a brain toxin a carcinogen and so on and when you examine each one of these they're doing things known previously to produce the results that look bad for example where progesterone is known to reverse a brain tumor they were using about a hundred times smaller dose and claiming that it caused the tumor and finding changes in breast tissue that they said was associated with breast cancer to distract attention from the studies that showed that it reversed and prevented breast cancer.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, I guess not to labor the Prop 65 thing any more other than to just explain that there certainly is a way, not always in government, but there's certainly interested parties for and against certain things happening and obviously collusion between companies, especially when there's plenty of money involved to protect vested interests. But I think if people ever wanted to find out more about this and I mentioned this on the last radio show that Dr. Carla Rothenberg's PhD dissertation was basically exposing all of the bad evidence, all the bad scientific, supposedly scientific reasons for which were given that progesterone was to be deemed and a fit for the list was actually very inconsistent and she clearly outlines the mistakes that were made but like anything else in big government I think it's just extremely difficult to get it to change just like trying to change the direction of an oil tanker once it's moving in a certain direction it takes a long time it's taken how many years here to get people to stop, well hopefully stop consuming liquid oils and recognize the fact that the brainwashing surrounding saturated fats is actually very wrong and that people are actually much better off using saturated fats. It's probably taken 50 or 60 years. Anyway, we have a caller on the air, so let's take this first caller.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, her speaking voice doesn't sound as masculinized as many women that I've known who used androgens, by prescription, or just who had an ovarian problem with excess androgen production, they very often get voices almost as low as mine, a normal male pitch. But what happens under the influence of androgens, the way they change the hair follicle involves reorganization of the whole structure of the hair follicle. But since the hair follicle has a finite lifespan, if you interrupt that stimulation consistently, like there was a study in France showing women who applied topical progesterone to sideburns and mustache and chest hair that had developed under androgen stimulation. They stayed with it through the expected lifespan of these hair follicles and re-feminized their facial and chest hair. But in the case of vocal cords, if they actually develop a male pitch, that's because they have grown and enlarged, and the whole voice box enlarges, and generally you can't see a woman's Adam's apple like a man's sticks out in proportion to how bass their voice is. If the whole cartilage voice box is enlarged, the vocal cords have to adapt, and they simply don't have any way to get smaller without the framework that's holding them changing.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. P, do you think it's possible to get my singing voice back to where I can sing high notes easily again?

**RAY PEAT:** Even the cartilage can change shape a little bit by losing some of its excess water. And so it would be a good idea to have your thyroid carefully checked. Check your waking temperature and pulse rate and your midday temperature and pulse rate. And if your TSH is not in the lower end of the normal range, then it's possible that just a thyroid supplement would raise your range a little bit.
**CONTEXT:** So, Jeff, your first question is about your thyroid. You're taking 90 milligrams of natural desiccated thyroid twice a day, about three grains a day, but your pulse in the AM is around 60 and your temperature is between 97.2 and 97.8. At midday, it goes up to 68-69, and your temperature never gets above 98.2. You're wondering what you should be doing to change that.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, have you ever had a blood test for TSH?
**CONTEXT:** Yes, I have. It was about 1.8. I haven't had it in a while. At that same time, I had a cholesterol, total cholesterol of 330. The guy wanted to put me on statin drugs, and I brought his attention to the piece you mentioned. I have a copy of that shows there's no correlation between cholesterol. And to me, that was an indication at heart attacks. But this is an indication that clearly that my thyroid was underactive, which has kind of got me...

**RAY PEAT:** Were you taking this glandular when you got your TSH of 1.8?
**CONTEXT:** I started taking that, right. So you got a TSH of 1.8 and then you decided to start using a natural glandular?

**RAY PEAT:** 1.8 is high. Yeah, exactly. And my T3 level was on the low end of the scale, that's their scale, which may or may not be useful. And the T4 was sort of on the average end. So, they didn't take reverse T3, so I don't know that, but...
**CONTEXT:** Have they measured the cholesterol since you've been taking thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I'm due for another blood test, but I'm sure... My guess is it'll go down, but I'll... You know, my real question related to the temperature, I think I can answer those questions after the next blood test. My guess is it'll go down dramatically, because I am in very good physical shape. I know you guys say I don't jog, but I do do under two miles three times a week, mostly with sprints. So I feel that, like, no activity is, like, not useful, but obviously, as you pointed out, jogging is, you know, repeatedly running marathons, et cetera, is long-term detrimental. But I don't think you go to the other end and literally do nothing but ride a bike. You know, I think you've got to do more than that, at least in my case. So, and I think you said that sprinting is okay in some of your write-ups. In other words, doing, like, five, six sprints for 20 yards, et cetera, after sort of warming up.
**CONTEXT:** Have your muscles enlarged noticeably since taking the thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Not at all. I have the same weight. My weight goes from 172 to 178. It's sort of centered around 175. It's been my weight for a long time. I do find it drops, though, from in the evening, I mean, from to sleep to the next morning. But it's usually in that range. Mental clarity is so much better. But, um... That's really the key, and that's why I'm used to this, and it definitely... You're definitely right about the pufa. There's no doubt about it. It's the biggest hoax in the world. In animal experiments, it takes about four years for a complete exchange. When you stop eating pufa, it's just a random exchange of what's in your present diet and what's in your body, and that takes four years to be complete, so it takes about two years to get a good 50% reduction in it where you'll start feeling your thyroid more consistently. Because for taking three grains, your pulses and temperatures do seem pretty low.
**CONTEXT:** If you're overweight, it would take four years, but on the lean side, more muscular and more active, perhaps that accelerates the process, but... But by the way, there's no chance that you can eliminate PUFA. I mean, the notion of getting five milligrams per day is like a fantasy. You just can't do that. It's like possible for anybody, even you, Dr. Pete. There's no way you can limit it to five milligrams, right? Because if you add up the milk you drink and the eggs, etc.

**RAY PEAT:** No, five grams, I think, was... Sorry, five grams, not milligrams. Five grams, you mentioned, was the limit. Yeah, it's possible to get it down to a couple grams a day, which is the inflection point where you see cancer correlating very closely to the amount of pufa in your diet is around 4 grams per day. And so you're pretty safe if you keep it under 4 grams per day, which you can do just by low-fat milk or skimmed milk, fruit and low-fat cheese and eggs and such.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, I do all that. The only thing I do take is cooked vegetables. I've been doing that like twice a day. Ironically, I was thinking to myself, sometimes I can't sleep at night. I'm thinking, if you cook food, you're killing the enzymes. And if your body, if your stomach's not generating those enzymes, you're going to have trouble breaking down that food, even if there's less PUFA in it. I'm wondering whether digestive enzyme, you know, Lida Lee talks about that, and I know you know her. Is that something that ultimately is useful, recognizing you have to worry about additives?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think if you're going to eat vegetables, they should be thoroughly cooked. Otherwise, partly the problem is that you can't extract all the nutrients if they aren't thoroughly cooked. And some of the carbohydrate complexes are going to feed bacteria if they aren't thoroughly cooked. I think measuring your cholesterol again and having your vitamin D level checked, sometimes a deficiency of vitamin D interferes with the way your body is handling the thyroid. It probably leads to more reverse T3 production, but the vitamin D level in the blood should be around the middle of the range, 50 nanograms per milliliter. And the healthiest population for having no thyroid disease, essentially, they were below 0.4 on the TSH scale. And cholesterol is a pretty good indication of how you're responding to thyroid. It could be around 200 or a little less. In the 1930s, cholesterol was recognized as a good diagnostic indicator of thyroid function. Someone published a study showing that when you removed someone's thyroid gland, immediately as the metabolic rate went down, the cholesterol went up. And when you supplemented thyroid, the cholesterol came down as an exact mirror image of the metabolic rate. So I think that's exactly what's going to happen here, because before I started your program, for years, my total cholesterol was 200, and I had very good levels according to modern medicine. When I started your diet, I started eating a lot of ice cream. I didn't used to eat that. And a lot of milk. And I ended up, that's when it skyrocketed to 330. But I think when you make a change like this, it's a shock to your body and to your point. I think I need to go through another blood test and see whether or not the impact on the thyroid supplement and the vitamin D level, by the way, which was in the 40s, but I'm trying to get that up a little bit. It's below 50, but it's not dangerously low. It's on the low end, somewhere between 40 and 50. But the real question was the temperature and pulse. If my... how low... If your symptoms are not there, is it reasonable to have a pulse that sort of, you know, ranges between 60 and 70 throughout the day if you're athletic and a temperature that really never gets above 98.2?
**CONTEXT:** I wouldn't worry about it. Some people have a big heart that pumps efficiently and does fine at 65 beats per minute.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you're right. In fact, I was told I had, someone, when I was a younger kid, they said I had a larger heart. I think that exactly might be correct.
**CONTEXT:** You've been very kind with your time. There's one last question. This is a real quick one. There's another guy named Lawrence Wilson, if you've ever heard of him. He's a very prolific writer. He deviates from you on a couple of points, no fruits. But he says take omega-3s. But he's very good, but the one thing he does say, and I know you're big on coffee, is he's big on coffee too, but not orally. He's big on coffee enemas. Now, I know in the past you came up once and you mentioned that that can be stressful, but the bigger problem for people over 50, one of the biggest problems, as you've mentioned, is iron toxicity is a real problem. If you do coffee enemas on a regular basis, is that a way, other than bloodletting, to ultimately reduce the toxicity of iron in your body?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, just drinking coffee every time you eat an iron-containing food. I always have coffee with oysters or eggs or meat, because it drastically limits your absorption of iron.
**CONTEXT:** Okay, but my question is, you maybe don't have a position to answer that. I mean, you may not know. I mean, you know a lot, but maybe you don't have experience in this area. Or do you have a view on the coffee enema in terms of its not whether it's stressful or not, because it's like running. If you run the first time you're going to be stressed, but if you do the same running, you know, ten weeks in a row, it's not going to be as stressful because your body got used to it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I know there's a lot of benefit some people have from the coffee enema, but I think you can get the same benefit probably more by having it with food so that you don't give yourself a sudden jolt of stimulation, that's where the stress is. It can make you burn fuel so fast that you get hypoglycemia.
**CONTEXT:** Caller, where are you from and what's your question? We lost this one. It had to do with endometriosis and IUDs. Is there a relation in the health of that? Dr. Peab, do you think IUDs could be responsible for endometriosis from an irritation point of view?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's been well established that endometriosis is from the prolonged excessive exposure to estrogen without interruption from a progesterone. And the mechanism of the just plain plastic or copper IUD is to send a signal to the ovary that the uterus isn't ready for pregnancy because there's a foreign object in it that the uterus perceives this injury. And the signal travels up the fallopian tube and tells the ovary not to make progesterone. So it's a very specific interruption of your hormone ratio the same way that the birth control pill is.
**CONTEXT:** Right, so just constant stimulation and estrogen excess with no relief from the progesterogenic part of the cycle.

**RAY PEAT:** Right.
**CONTEXT:** Alex, from Southern Humboldt, went through testicular cancer treatment last year. Had his left testicle removed, went through chemotherapy, and then had an RPLND surgery where they removed a section of lymph nodes. He's 34 years old and hasn't had anything crop back up, but is interested in general health advice for someone who's been through that. He didn't have any classic risk factors like an undescended testicle.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, when experimenters have removed, for example, one adrenal gland or one ovary, I don't remember any experiments with removing one testicle, but the removal of some of the steroid-forming tissue in those other situations causes the pituitary to drive the remaining gland twice as hard, basically, to keep up the systemic level of the steroid production. And so I think it's important to watch your LH and FSH levels. And there are ways you can, without necessarily supplementing an androgen, but you can reduce the stress, keeping your thyroid hormone level up, vitamin D level up, regulating your protein and sugar intake carefully, and possibly supplementing pregnenolone, which will feed into the system, suppressing the exaggerated stress reactions that are more likely if your androgen is low. Testosterone works closely with progesterone and pregnenolone to make it less necessary to produce the stress hormones such as cortisol.
**CONTEXT:** My testosterone levels are actually up because the one testicle that's left is working double time. So I'm at like the upper range. I've been going to UCSF and going to the OCEAN. Do you know what your value is? Is it $600,000, $700,000?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's good to concentrate on the whole anti-stress process because the androgen is probably compensating for the need for all of the stabilizing, quieting hormones. DHEA and Pregnenolone and Progesterone have a stabilizing effect. Pregnenolone is the most neutral of those and it will hold down the need to produce cortisol and help to restrain LH and FSH production by the pituitary.
**CONTEXT:** Is there anything dietarily? They've got me on vitamin D definitely. They want me to have elevated vitamins. They have me taking like mushroom capsules from fungi perfecti, and then it's like fish oil, vitamin D, fungi perfecti, mushroom capsules, and...

**RAY PEAT:** You want to stop the fish oil? I think that's about it. Yeah, fish oil. You want to cut the fish oil out? Cut it out? Oh, definitely. Yeah, that's been the mainstay of Dr. Pete's research in the last 40 years is the toxic effects of polyunsaturates, and fish oil is probably the worst of them all.
**CONTEXT:** Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm well versed. I've listened to your program a million times, and I know the polyunsaturates are a problem. I guess I was oblivious to the fact that fish oil was included in that category. Yeah, very much so. I mean, the science, I'll go back and listen to the actual chemicals or reactions that you're speaking about, but is there anything dietarily or whatever that you'd recommend just generically that would be kind of a soft approach to try to achieve the aims you're speaking, you're talking about?

**RAY PEAT:** Supporting the anti-stress effect vitamin D, a high ratio of calcium to phosphorus is very helpful. So cut down your meat intake compared to your dairy intake or have a good ratio of dairy to meat and just eat small amounts. Not a lot of muscle meat, if you're going to eat meat you're better off consuming the bone broths. The knuckle broths and the shanks. And a little liver, maybe once or twice a month.
