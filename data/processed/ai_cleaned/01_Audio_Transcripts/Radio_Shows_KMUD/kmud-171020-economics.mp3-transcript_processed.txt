**RAY PEAT:** My undergraduate study was 1953 to 1956. I had a summer job where I made $500, and with a tuition scholarship that paid for my nine months of schooling every year. I looked at the prices recently, and it was about at least 20 times more expensive. I couldn't afford to go to school currently. It was something that average and low-income people could afford in the 1950s.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, you're 81. You've seen the economics change in America over the last 80 years, and the cost of things increase. What do you think about the median house price, average car price, and average wage, and how high school graduates have lost $4 an hour from 1973 to now, while graduate students are still earning the same hourly wage as in 1973?

**RAY PEAT:** For the average income, those are actually the median income. The actual per capita average income in the U.S. for one person is $58,000 or $59,000 a year. For a family of 2.54 people, the average household size, the average family income is almost $150,000 a year. But newspapers and almost everyone refer to the average income actually using the median income, which neglects the vast incomes that the upper one or two percent are making.

**CONTEXT:** Since the gold standard was thrown out, the government has had to keep the illusion going. They're increasingly hiding information. They used to give out the figures for the money supply. A few years ago, they stopped giving out much of the information that had been routine.

**RAY PEAT:** So the reason the stock market seems to be going up is really because the government is pumping money into it, basically, by printing money. This is by having central banks that are basically able to print money without any penalty. The money is worthless, and yet people are still buying it. People are still buying US Treasury bonds, still buying US debt. And the oil is still pegged to the dollar, which is why the whole petrodollar thing was coming under scrutiny. It still is, and the Chinese were perhaps trying to break away from it. That's in a lot of conspiracy circles, at least the reason why Muhammad Gaddafi basically was wanting his population to be free, and he was socializing them. The Muslim population there was being very Westernized and actually not at all radicalized, and how he was going to use fairly large reserves of gold that he had to go back to the gold standard and get into trading oil in Libya with gold and actually starting to encourage the other Arab nations to do the same. And this is when he was taken out. It was the same with Saddam Hussein; he was trying to get off the dollar. And Venezuela is doing the same.

**CONTEXT:** The caller mentioned that the starvation in Bangladesh was tied to Nixon removing the U.S. dollar from the gold standard in 1972, leading the rich to invest in tangible assets like land, displacing farmers.

**RAY PEAT:** As organisms, as human beings, we are living in this biosphere and very much subject to the stresses that we get, either through television or advertising or obviously debt. And I think debt at this point has the biggest chain around most people's necks that stops them looking sideways.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding Vernadsky's concept of the biosphere and the noosphere, and the current fear of carbon dioxide.

**RAY PEAT:** Vernadsky was looking at the planet as a metabolic system. The biosphere was he saw the soil and the atmosphere and the solar energy being converted to food and living substance. His concept really saw carbon dioxide as a promoter of life and increasing the quality of living. I see the current fear of carbon dioxide as partly a distraction from the actual pollution. Deforestation is one of the major causes of the carbon dioxide increase, but it's actually doing much, actually doing damage rather than the carbon dioxide increase that they're talking about. It's degrading the rivers. The oceans are being degraded by the petroleum spills and chemical runoff from the use of mass chemicals in agriculture.

**CONTEXT:** The host mentioned an article suggesting rising carbon dioxide degrades the food supply by stimulating plant growth, but the reasoning was flawed.

**RAY PEAT:** The mass media are still promoting myths to confuse the argument, make people worry about a false process, and get them looking in the wrong direction. Vernadsky was exactly right. The carbon dioxide is part of the soil-forming process. The plants secrete acids from their roots to dissolve minerals. But the carbon dioxide carried into the soil from the atmosphere is part of the process of making minerals more available to plants.

**CONTEXT:** The host noted that the government's interest is to steer people away from looking in the right direction, not publishing fiscal figures.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, we hear about the government debt a lot, but there's a lot of other features of banking and finance that we don't hear about these days that used to be published. And I think when that caller called in about Nixon and the gold standard in '72, Nixon got taken out not long after being involved in politics by that Watergate scandal, which is nothing compared to what's going on now or what has happened in the last few years. It would make Watergate look like a complete tea party.

**CONTEXT:** The host asked about real wages, disposable income, and the preference for organic production.

**RAY PEAT:** Even the health statistics, for example, longevity and disease incidents, these are being falsified. In the '90s, the government declared that it had won the war on cancer. At the time, '94, I pointed out that the Secretary of Health was using faulty statistics. Looking at the figures, I predicted that they would have to change the rules by the end of the century because the way they were falsifying the statistics, the arrival of the baby boom population bulge, by the year 2000, the cancer rate of this huge population bulge was going to make it impossible to keep up the illusion that longevity was increasing, that cancer was decreasing, and so on. And exactly, I think it was the year 2000, the U.S. Bureau of Statistics changed the rules and stopped giving out the raw figures, have only age-standardized figures on health and longevity and age-specific death rates and so on. So people are really being put into a dream world in which nothing is real.

**CONTEXT:** A caller described a lump on their neck that was diagnosed as a skin cancer, treated with chemo and radiation, and later developed a rash that they suspected was shingles, possibly related to the treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it would lower your resistance for sure. And shingles can be reactivated chickenpox at any point in a person's life, especially if you're under stress.

**CONTEXT:** The host asked the caller for the type of cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** It was a benign cancer in some terms, then. It wasn't metastasizing, it wasn't spreading. It took 12 years to evolve.

**CONTEXT:** The host asked Dr. Peat about the caller's experience with a rash and whether it could be shingles, and if it was related to radiation and chemo.

**RAY PEAT:** I had the experience in my teens of being extremely sensitive to poison oak. I was working in the woods for the Bureau of Land Management and could hardly stand it. My sleep was interrupted by extreme poison oak. The word went around the camp that vitamin C, which was new on the market, it was just fairly expensive, coming out in 50 milligram tablets, the word went around that vitamin C protected against poison oak. So at the end of the week, I bought a bottle, took a few tablets, 50 or 100 milligrams, and suddenly the poison oak disappeared, and I never had it again. About 65 years later, I'm not really sensitive to poison oak. I've been here for about 40 years, I get it just a little bit, but it was like, just a little bit, and by a day or two later, my whole shoulder and down my back turned into these huge bubbles, these blackening bubbles. And I've been familiar with poison oak. Usually it's blotchy, and if you itch it, it gets worse and worse. But this was like just a takeover of my skin.

**CONTEXT:** The caller described the rash as bubbling and crispy crust, on one side of their body.

**RAY PEAT:** If it's a virus, shingles, yeah, I think it is a good idea to have your vitamin D level checked. Vitamin D is a very powerful antiviral. It regulates all the levels of your immune system. And your serum level should be in the middle of the range, around 50 nanograms per milliliter.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asked for advice on finding dentists who use calcium oxide for root canals and sorrel cement for regular fillings, and the importance of these materials.

**RAY PEAT:** For the root canal, I think the calcium, it's antiseptic and anesthetic, and it's traditional but safer than the gutta-percha or metal fillings. And I think the composite fillings are now high enough in strength that they're good for even the chewing teeth.

**CONTEXT:** The caller asked for advice on finding dentists who use these materials.

**RAY PEAT:** I've, for about 50 years, had all my dentistry done in Mexico, because they emphasize skill, dexterity, and care rather than speed and profit. So it could be worth a trip to Mexico purely for dentistry. I know lots of people do it for medical issues like surgeries.

**CONTEXT:** A caller commented on the use of the term "benign cancer," stating it's an oxymoron and that benign means not cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** A lot of the language used medically in relation to cancer has been to promote the business of the oncologists. 50 or 60 years ago, cancers were things that were definitely identified as benign. The language was escalated so that something which formerly was not cancer was called pre-cancer and then cancer. If you use the language of 1940, many cancers wouldn't exist that are now officially named as cancer.

**CONTEXT:** The caller questioned the definition of benign versus malignant.

**RAY PEAT:** An article in JAMA about 40 years ago looked at the evidence of the pathology methods of analyzing the properties of the cytoplasm nucleus ratio and the matter of disorganization and invasion and so on, and in this article it was demonstrated that a healing wound, if it's biopsied, will show all of the properties that are used by the pathologists to identify cancer. So what is defined as cancer has become more inclusive, and if you happen to have an injury that gets biopsied, it'll be called cancer because it has the properties of rapid growth, invasive appearance, and so on.

**CONTEXT:** The caller asked why Dr. Peat told the previous caller not to go to the doctor when his lump was small.

**RAY PEAT:** I never tell people not to go to doctors, but I tell them to think and question what the doctor tells them to do.

**CONTEXT:** A caller asked about herbs for sclerosing mesenteritis to dissolve internal scar tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** Dissolving internal scar tissue? Hmm. Yeah, a little difficult in terms of any tissue that's truly become fibrotic and has been organized that way to do that. It's not that easy. I don't know, Dr. P, if you're looking at scar tissue. I know there are some things that they have said in the past are good for dissolving scars, but I think once tissue has gotten as organized as a proper scar with those fibrin and connectins, I think they're fairly insoluble. Maybe something like progesterone might be useful in that case.

**CONTEXT:** The host asked if vitamin E taken internally would have a topical effect on internal scar tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** No, but a lot of the sclerosing problems are calcification, abnormal calcification. And Hans Selye pioneered the study of how to cause and regress calcified tissue, various types of sclerosis, and that's a good place to start. But vitamin D, vitamin D and the high calcium intake to lower your parathyroid hormone is part of the process of reversing calcified tissue. Vitamin K is another anti-soft tissue calcification factor.

**CONTEXT:** A caller diagnosed with Graves' disease, experiencing eye issues and swollen feet but never hyperthyroid, asked if it would be treated differently than Hashimoto's.

**RAY PEAT:** I think a more thorough metabolic study would show something other than the antithyroid antibodies. You would want to check the steroid hormones, progesterone, cortisol, vitamin D, and the actual level of your thyroid hormones, the T3 and T4, and reverse T3.

**CONTEXT:** The caller stated they had checked these, with only slightly low testosterone, and normal vitamin D levels. Their temperature is usually 96-97°F in the morning, rising to 99°F by the end of the day.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's what they tell me. They tell me I have Hashimoto's and Graves now because I have all of the thyroid antibodies very high. And I'm on four and a third grains of natural thyroid, and all of my numbers come back right, but my temperature is all whacked out. I still have some of the swelling. I just don't know what to do next.

**CONTEXT:** The host asked if the caller had changed the thyroid dose while monitoring pulse rate, temperature, and calorie requirements, and if they had taken T3.

**RAY PEAT:** No one's ever given me a T3 supplement. You mean like a Cytomel or something?

**CONTEXT:** The host explained how T3 acts faster than T4.

**RAY PEAT:** Since it takes a couple of days for anything to pass through the intestine normally, sometimes longer, there's plenty of time for the T4 to absorb. And your body doesn't want it to absorb all in an hour or two. When it does that, it induces enzymes in your liver which destroy it. If the body, if the liver perceives this huge unphysiological surge of T4 coming in in just an hour, it's going to eliminate it 12 hours later so that you'll actually be hypothyroid 12 hours after you take it.
