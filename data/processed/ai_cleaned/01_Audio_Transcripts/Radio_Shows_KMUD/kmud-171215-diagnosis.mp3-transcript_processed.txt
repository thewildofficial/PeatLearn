**RAY PEAT:** As a new graduate student in the 1950s, I tried several different departments, but mostly concentrated on linguistics and the psychology of language, and dropped out of several departments before going back to get a PhD after I got my master's degree with a thesis on William Blake. I went back to study biology, intending to investigate how the brain can function in ways that could explain intelligence and language use. I was partly reacting against Noam Chomsky's doctrine, which when I began thinking about linguistics in the late 1950s, he was just taking over the culture of language theory, and I considered him as one of the great evils of our culture, the way he was treating language, leaping the brain and intelligence out of the whole thing. It became a motor program, actually, for following rules laid down in the genes.
**CONTEXT:** Would you just outline your professional and academic background so people can understand where your training comes from?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, his doctrine, he's explicitly said that the behavior that allows us to make language and follow dramatic rules must be in the genes, very much the way Conrad Lorenz said that all of our behavior is in the genes. To improve the species we have to kill inferior people. Chomsky doesn't say that, but he has a very arrogant attitude towards people who question his very arbitrary genetic explanation of things.
**CONTEXT:** What was he a proponent of, then, in terms of that discussion?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a kind of cultural arrogance that was based in MIT. With all the power of the Pentagon behind it. So, over the years, when I was trying different departments, I found that he had penetrated every department of the universities. A friend and I did a course in the Honors College at the University of Oregon on interdepartmental views of humanity....human nature and we invited ten different professors...
**CONTEXT:** This is to get their perspective, huh?

**RAY PEAT:** ...to speak about that and we picked a professor in each department that students thought was the outstanding professor in that area. And each one of them said that his department's contribution to understanding human nature was Noam Chomsky's. Generative grammar, sociology, folklore, literature, all different departments of the university. At that time, 1968, thought Noam Chomsky had defined the world for him.
**CONTEXT:** You've obviously had plenty of experiences with research that doesn't make it to the market, with false ideologies, with the truth being there but not being revealed, lies getting around the world faster than truth can get our shoelaces tied. And I know you've mentioned this many times, so within education at that point in time, there was this lie being spread and seeded rapidly through these different domains that all seemed to agree on the same thing. I mean, that rule. Deluded by the same lie. And you can trace it going back to the beginning of the 20th century, being financed by various corporate interests, military interests, all of the powers that were interested in expanding their power were promoting research and teaching in these areas. Really, we're representing a very arbitrary and degraded picture of human nature.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the idea of genes and determining the nature of a species has its theological advocates in the 19th century, and that genetic definition of a fixed... unchanging organism. Accidents were the only things that could change the genes and the genes controlled our being and so our being was essentially an accidental construction. And on top of that understanding, which was well embedded by the 1940s, the industries were starting to produce a reaction to her. Polluting processes, especially when atomic bombs were being exploded in Nevada and poisoning everyone downwind all the way to New York and around the world, people were getting concerned about the quality of air and water and city pollution was killing people with smog, factories and cars. So the industry started fighting back, saying that, well, look at history, we see that what, if something didn't kill you, it made you stronger.
**CONTEXT:** Because we do hear that, don't we?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you survive the mercury treatment, then you were cured and a strong healthy organism, supposedly, when the mercury stayed with you.
**CONTEXT:** Right. So this was the original heroic medicine, and then it basically morphed into a, like you mentioned, the atomic bomb testing in the early 50s here, where it took quite a while for public outcry to get to the gates, as it were, to start fighting this back so that it didn't carry on happening. The industries started funneling huge amounts of money. For example, one current professor in Boston Someone figured that he has received more than $40 million in research to promote this phony idea of hormesis, which is several years, about 15 years ago, they started giving it the definition that it's a biphasic response, meaning that a small amount moves the biology in one direction, a larger amount moves it in the other direction. The idea was that a little bit of poison is good for you, so the argument was that the leak from the nuclear industry, atomic bombs falling out, etc., all of these were called low-level radiation, and they used some pretty phony evidence and argument, all of it turned out to be. Upside-down evidence, but they argued that these so-called low-levels of radiation or other pollution were actually causing biological benefit, and that developed into the argument of the big think tanks financed by these same industries, saying that the government should stop regulating....industrial pollution, because the regulation is causing damage to the public health, because the pollution is so beneficial. Really. Unbelievable, isn't it?

**RAY PEAT:** I think what you're calling the shamanistic view of their reality, I would call the simple basic reality, and the world that the scientists and government people are advocating is a world of manipulation and control and enforced agreement where the... All you have to do is back away from the way it's set up by the academic orthodoxy. You back away from it and you see some of the reality that the shamans are working with. It's a basic participation in the world around you. All organisms do it and so... Sometimes I call it the animal consciousness, but it's the Shaman's therapeutic reality is to get the person back in touch with the complex reality that they're living in, in reality and not being attached to the story that they're being brought up with.
**CONTEXT:** So what are your views on the mind-body-spirit approach to healing, and do you think there are fundamental differences which would yield more beneficial results?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the composition of city smog.... is rich in carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, and so it's interesting that these now become medically and biologically desirable. They're calling carbon monoxide a very powerful anti-inflammatory agent in our bodies. Carbon monoxide. Yeah carbon monoxide. And it just happens to make smog in the city look beneficial rather than harmful if it's stuff that we produce it for our own benefit. But when you look at how it's produced in the body, it breaks down the heme group which is involved in it. All of our essential oxidative metabolic processes inside the cell, not just in the bloodstream, but it does break down the heme of blood, but also the heme of respiratory and detoxifying enzymes. And as it breaks it down and releases a molecule of carbon monoxide, it also releases an atom of iron liberating it. We're going to act randomly as an oxidant, and the first step of degrading the heme goes into biliverdin, which is quickly turned into bilirubin. And bilirubin is being touted as a very powerful anti-inflammatory antioxidant agent, so both carbon monoxide and bilirubin are......said to be antioxidants and something I've been pointing out for many years is that cancer is extremely endowed with antioxidant processes. That's why it can resist chemotherapy and radiation so well because of its antioxidants and what makes a cell healthy and able to... endure and function is the whole system of oxidative processes and if you stop, if you plug up the ability to run the oxidative machinery, you go into a reduced state and that's the antioxidant power of a cancer cell that it pushes reductive processes against in the failure of oxidative processes. And that's what you have when you increase your carbon monoxide and bilirubin. And bilirubin has the extra function of exciting nerve cells. And so you get the process of inhibiting respiratory enzymes by both carbon monoxide and bilirubin. At the same time you're exciting the nerves, exactly the formula. For excitotoxic death of brain cells and that's the so-called very powerful protective antioxidant. It does have that reductive function of, in certain contexts, being an antioxidant. But those processes are among the very most dangerous things that... can happen in cells.
**CONTEXT:** So, like you said, this is the way that cancer can evade this kind of treatment, then, huh? Is that it has enzymes that are able to... It turns off the oxidative process and that produces things like lactic acid, which is a reductant. It took me a while to get this concept, too, because I think, again, one of those things that's just so in-your-face, whether it's in dietary supplements or foods that are advertised for their ability to be antioxidants. Now, you've mentioned before, and I don't know if other people have got this, but it certainly has tripped me up in the past, because I always... you've understood the word and term antioxidant to be beneficial, but you're actually saying that oxidants, so vitamin E and C, are actually the beneficial substances, and it's not...

**RAY PEAT:** In a healthy cell, vitamin C exists in the oxidizing form, and it stabilizes the structure of the cell by keeping things from being excessively reduced. By oxidizing things, and vitamin E fits into that picture too.
**CONTEXT:** So the precautionary principle which we did a show on back in January, how does this concept work into our consciousness and subjugate our well-being in terms of the way it's just constantly purported as something that we need to be paying attention to and it's good for us and, you know, I don't know how it is that people... can wake up from what it is they're being bombarded with in terms of finding information. I think this is something that you've brought out in the past that medical abstracts no longer reside in libraries and real data is actually pretty hard to find and the initial documents that were written or the initial papers that were written can get buried quite easily and so actually what we hear is usually the result of well-funded research. I think you've long held the tenet, perhaps, that it is actually a, how do I say, conspiratorial, but it is actually a fairly blatant act in that what's actually proposed in many papers that are written does not reflect the true science that there is behind the reality of it.

**RAY PEAT:** The......theory that is repeatedly taught and publicized of what consciousness is, what the brain is doing, fits into this picture that is beneficial to industry. They want to present the brain as having, for example, programs... that are genetically termed or trained by so-called adaptive learning, the behaviorist approach that you learn by repetition rather than by insight. This programmed behavior... tends to be digital or have very concrete, symbolic units of meaning. And the actual organism deals with patterns, holistic, very rich, information-filled patterns, so that in a moment's perception, a book called... I think it was I and Brain by Gregory in the 60s, had the illustrations showing, if you looked at one image with one eye and the other image with the other eye, you could see a three-dimensional image which involved, I think it was something like a million different... points of information which had to be processed in an integrated way by each eye and put together by the brain. That kind of input, sensory assimilation of millions of points of information every moment is something that is denied by the culture that wants to have controllable......educable people who will deal only in symbolic forms of information.
**CONTEXT:** So this, again, is another example of the reductionist view, world view.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah. That...the only way those types of mental calculation can be conceived is... in a simultaneously presented form of consciousness so that a formula exists as something out of time. It works the same way backwards and forward where the actual organism is embedded in time and seeing the implications in the future and reinterpreting. The past input, so that logic and math are distractions from the way the organism is integrating its information.
**CONTEXT:** I wonder, what do think it'll take, given where we've come from and where we seem to be going, what do you think it's going to take for medicine to actually change and be beneficial and do no harm?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's going to take a public recognizing the extent of the harm that is happening and I've seen that happen locally where doctors, it only took four or five patients standing up to the doctors to absolutely change them 180 degrees.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah, again, because it's such a powerful effect that this kind of brainwashing has and I think the personable nature of most people, I've heard it from several doctors here now that their training was so brutal, they use that word, it was so brutal and put them under so much stress that there was a very corporate feeling of one upmanship that was displayed by many people in their training as doctors or when they were specializing and going onwards to become surgeons that it was almost a rite of passage that you had to dominate and I won't say destroy but dominate and control the other peers in your field and wouldn't take no for an answer and what she was doing was absolutely right and you weren't to be questioned and there was very much a pecking order. In medical school that I think caused some people to drop out and others to become really very resistant to change. I think there are lots of doctors who are open to the opportunity that would be presented if the public would start asking for that other kind of medical approach. The doctors I think feel trapped by the system just as much as the patients.
**CONTEXT:** Yeah. I can understand that too because I think financially there's quite a lot of strings being attached and they certainly wield their own effect in terms of debt when you've graduated and then also in terms of becoming successful. So I'm not bashing the doctors. I know there are some very good ones out there who are very altruistic but I think the main model and concept of medicine really puts somebody up on the pedestal and I think that is... I think human beings are very vulnerable to that kind of pressure that kind of temptation too I think which comes with you know large salaries private practice etc okay so I'm getting on getting on to another subject you brought out and then this brings us back to those things like pregnenolone, carbon dioxide, glucose and you mentioned warmth obviously as a function of temperature and presumably that's all tied in with metabolic rate but you said that experiments done over the last 60 years showing that these substances during embryonic and fetal development can affect the growth of the brain and the brain's way of guiding future development and adaptive ability. Do you think outside of gestational sufficiency of these, that supplementation of the things I just mentioned, it can make up......for lack of these things earlier in life, or is there a finite replacement or reorganization event occurring in the brain?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think every night we're producing masses of stem cells that are going out and attempting to renew worn out or damaged tissues, and that with age, things......accumulate polyunsaturated fats and iron and bilirubin, for example, accumulate, making it too hard for the stem cells to do full repair. And so instead of getting repairs, we get fibrosis and gliosis and degeneration of the various organs. But with the right support both in the... the way the person is using their brain or their self and the way they're getting access to what they need in the environment, I think at any late stage those repair cells can be integrated and taken advantage of.
**CONTEXT:** Ok, so this would support what everyone would probably, some of the truth that they hear in this repeated statement is that most of the repair happens at night time and that's why a good night's sleep is very important and you do advocate and I know it's probably, it sounds strange to people when I mention it and they say, well how much? You think like nine hours or more of sleep is good for someone, right?

**RAY PEAT:** In the winter, when days are short, I think more hours of sleep are protective. And I've seen examples where very, very damaged brains, sometimes life-long damage, can very quickly show radical restructuring. It's like the brain knows how to rebuild itself when it's given the right opportunity and materials.
**CONTEXT:** All right, this brings me on to my next question then. You stated that... In experimental situations and the epi... Okay, there's a feedback going on now, I think they've turned. That in experimental situations, the epigenetic changes produced by stress are reversible. But when the organism stays in the same sort of environment that started the process, reversals become less likely with increasing age and that polyunsaturated fats amplify this effect by generating carbon monoxide. and prostaglandins liberating themselves carbon monoxide from the breakdown of heme and prostaglandins which activates heme oxygenase and aromatase production which you've mentioned in the past which produces estrogens from androgens both of which are degenerative and destructive processes. So the picture of learned helplessness comes to mind here coupled with lack of environmental enrichment and do you see these as paramount transformations necessary? to drive change in the right direction and can cultivating a positive attitude in the absence of this suffice?

**RAY PEAT:** I see adaptation as constantly choosing between two directions one to become more to know more and have more ability to move into the future the other defensive adaptation, simply surviving on the cellular level, and the brain, if you look at it across generations, the mother who is under stress, or actually both parents under stress, contribute to the outcome of the developing baby, but the brain is. The first thing, it's a very expensive organ, and so stressed parents will tend to have babies with a less functional brain, even a smaller brain, and that, at any point, the brain is willing and eager to repair itself and grow, but if the background has been very bad, it can be incredibly��도. poor and restricted, then that means that the repair situation has to be more intense, so that the conscious attitude has to be pretty deliberate to avoid getting in the harmful routes of helplessness, and to seek the particular things that will, for example......stop that production of prostaglandins, reduce the storage of polyunsaturated fats, help to eliminate the iron which is causing lipid peroxidation and activating aromatase and so on. The substances I've talked about so much are active at these various points. For example, aspirin against the production of prostaglandins and lipid peroxidation, progesterone against the prostaglandins and the aromatase, and the elimination of carbon monoxide and iron.
**CONTEXT:** Let me hold you there for a moment because we do have a caller here who's just been on hold for a little while, but let's take this next call.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, monounsaturated fats are fine. They're very a part of our nature. If we... eat nothing but sugar, we'll make monounsaturated fats of our own. And those are the N-9 fats, like in olive oil and butter. And we produce that ourselves, even if we eat only starches. And then from that N-9 series of fats, we produce our own polyunsaturated fats, called the... N-9 or the omega-9 series, and it's the lack of those, partly, which is the damage done when we eat things like soy oil and safflower seed oil and so on. They inhibit our ability to produce our own polyunsaturated fats, which are stable and beneficial.
**CONTEXT:** Now, maybe I missed a little bit here, but what is a major difference between mono-unsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, the mono are almost always the N-9 fats, like oleic acid, and from that... we make, if we aren't interfered with, we make our own omega-9 series. And the ones that are synthesized in seaweed or soybeans, crops, things that grow in a cold climate, can't use the more saturated fats. They produce their own polyunsaturated... fats for the sake of being fluid in cold weather or in the cold ocean. So the cold organism polyunsaturated fat happens to be unstable when you make it as warm as we are. 98.6 degrees, for example, will cause very quick oxidative breakdown of the fats that are stable. At almost freezing temperature in fish, fish oil is very good for fish, although when they gave a more saturated fat diet to salmon, I think it was, they had greater endurance than if they had the algae or fish oil in their diet.
**CONTEXT:** Can I interrupt you there for a second, because we do have one more caller who I think has got a very quick question and has been waiting some time, so thanks for your caller caller.

**RAY PEAT:** If you're really hypothyroid and have, say, a 97 degree temperature when you wake up, it's important to keep taking your temperature and pulse rate during the day to see what the effect of food and activity is on both your temperature and pulse rate. Lots of people who have discomfort in the heat have a very high nitric oxide production. And that causes vasodilation and reddening of the skin, but that will lower the core temperature. So to understand what's happening metabolically, you should check your temperature before and after those experiences of heat intolerance.
**CONTEXT:** Okay, I've got to stop both of you there. I'm glad that person got the chance to pick their question. But thanks so much for your time, Dr. Pete, and I've got to give out your information. I appreciate you joining us again.
