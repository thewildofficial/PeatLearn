**RAY PEAT:** My PhD study was at the University of Oregon in 1968 to 72. My dissertation was on reproductive aging. And my intention when I went back to graduate school in biology was to study the brain. But I found that the brain research was the most doctrinaire next to genetics. And so I looked around and found that the reproductive physiology was actually oriented towards science. My background before that had been studying literature, linguistics, and painting. Probably the background in literature made me think in an adversarial manner in evaluating science, rather than an authoritarian, "except because the professor said it's true." I think the legal attitude of looking for truth by an adversarial approach should apply to medicine and science in general.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, can you give us a background on your academic and research history?

**RAY PEAT:** There have been, I think it was about 15 big studies on brain injury. And, interestingly, after overwhelmingly promising results from, for example, using intravenous magnesium to reduce swelling and restore metabolism, all of these, by the time they reached the phase 3 level, suddenly the results were the opposite, and nothing turned out to be beneficial for treating human brain trauma, even though the previous smaller studies and many, many animal studies were showing overwhelming good increased survival, increased full recovery and so on. The fact that something happens at the phase three level I think is very suspicious when the government and big corporations get involved. I suspect that they really are protecting drugs that are not generic the way progesterone is. Urea, I don't think there's ever been a major study of treating brain trauma with simply intravenous urea. But it has had just amazingly good results. And I think probably a serious study could be done using all of the known beneficial things: urea, magnesium, progesterone, hypertonic saline solution, and so on. I think if you do everything that's known to be beneficial to the brain, you would get even better results than with a single drug-like treatment. The worst thing about this big PROTECT study, I think, was that they not only didn't give a big enough dose, but they gave it emulsified with, I think it was intralipid, a soybean oil. And the amount of soybean emulsion that they were giving intravenously in animal studies, it in itself is harmful. It's a 6% solution. I think it was about 1970, someone injected an emulsified soy oil into rats and showed that on the first pass through the brain, 17% of the oil was taken up into the brain. There's no blood-brain barrier that functions against oil. And then they dissected the brain and showed that one dose of oil was enough to alter the morphology of brain cells. So intravenous treatment with something supposedly beneficial with a known toxin to the brain with a long history of evidence. It's hard to imagine how corporate and government interest putting millions of dollars into the project could have been that ignorant.

**CONTEXT:** The PROTECT-3 and SYNAPS trials on progesterone for traumatic brain injury showed no benefit. How do you interpret this negative outcome in comparison to progesterone's known capabilities?

**RAY PEAT:** Some people have reported that in the last week or two of a healthy pregnancy, a woman's placenta is producing eight or nine hundred milligrams of progesterone per day, and that doesn't do anything potentially harmful. Women generally feel great the last two or three weeks when their progesterone is at a maximum. So they could easily have given 2,000 milligrams of progesterone per day instead of a few hundred milligrams.

**CONTEXT:** The trial dosage was 0.5 milligrams per kilo per hour for 120 hours. Can you put this into perspective with normal progesterone exposure for females?

**RAY PEAT:** The estrogenic effect of the polyunsaturated fats is tremendously amplified by their conversion to the pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. And in any trauma, not just trauma but any harmful experience of an organism, estrogen is produced in the injured tissue and in the whole organism. There can be sunburn or parasites in the intestine or a broken bone, X-ray treatment, any harm you can think of due to the organism is going to increase the estrogen production and the conversion of polyunsaturated fats to the pro-inflammatory mediators.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the potential estrogenic effect of polyunsaturated fats. How does this relate to trauma and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** That's part of it. That's an even more specific part that happens under the influence of estrogen and polyunsaturated fats: they activate the glutamatergic transmitters in the brain, these literally excitatory signals to the point that they become toxic. And progesterone opposes all of these—not just the direct anti-estrogen effect, but it blocks the formation of prostaglandins, blocks the release of the stored polyunsaturated fats, blocks the formation of other inflammatory mediators, and antagonizes the glutamatergic excitotoxins. Every function of the organism you can think of that's harmed by trauma is intensified by estrogen and polyunsaturated fats, and those are blocked by progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** You've described the excitotoxic situation. How does progesterone interact with this?

**RAY PEAT:** First, I'd like to comment that my interest in salt supplementation was related to the estrogen issue because I saw premenstrual women restricting their salt and making their symptoms worse. I suggested to a friend that she salt her food to taste, and suddenly she didn't retain water. Salt was acting as a diuretic. And then years later, I knew old people who were restricting salt and developing serious insomnia and not improving their blood pressure. So I suggested the same thing to them, and again, they went to sleep, got good sleep suddenly, and their blood pressure actually came down. And then I realized that Tom Brewer, with his diet for pregnant women in the 1950s and 60s, had seen the same thing: that some people he collaborated with supplemented pregnant women with toxemia symptoms with huge amounts of salt daily, and their toxemia essentially was cured. That's Shanklin and Hodin's book. Anyway, the progesterone, I used it myself after I had worked with it in aging animals. I tried it on my own migraines, and twice, in having a very intense migraine, I had complete reversal of the symptoms in from one to two minutes, from a total migraine to total wellness, after ingesting about a hundred milligrams, I guess it was. And that was what really got me interested in describing it to other people. And I, when I took too much for too long, I noticed that it had the effect of a cold shower for a day or two, an anti-testosterone effect, but that passes quickly when you stop taking it. And I've found as I got older that I could tolerate five milligrams or ten milligrams a day without that anti-testosterone effect. Several people have told me that it actually seems to reinforce their testosterone. And I think that works because testosterone, when you're under stress, is being converted to estrogen. And if you stop that conversion with progesterone, progesterone, like aspirin, inhibits the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. You can actually raise your testosterone by blocking that conversion of stress.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding salt and insomnia, and then also about progesterone in men, can you elaborate on those?

**RAY PEAT:** I've never seen a test of that idea. I think it should be tested. When I spent some time in San Francisco without thinking about the fluoridation of water there, I was using a daily supplement of T3 cytomel, and within a few days, I developed a migraine, which made me assume it was a sudden crash of my thyroid function. So I looked up the interaction: if you take T3 with fluoridated water, if it's in your stomach at the same time, the amount of fluoride in the water will totally knock out the dose you're taking. But I think there is some effect once it gets in your body, as long as it's circulating as ionic fluoride, I think it will knock out any T3 that it runs into.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a potential interaction between T3 and fluoridated water. Can you explain that further?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't discourage people from taking those if they want to try them, but I don't use them myself.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on isolated amino acids like taurine and carnosine as supplements?

**RAY PEAT:** Holding your breath does have its value, but the amount of time you hold it depends on your metabolic rate. If you have a high thyroid function, you might be unconscious after a minute of holding your breath. If you have a high metabolic rate, underproducing CO2 and consuming oxygen very fast, the fall-off of oxygen supplied to your brain is going to be twice as fast as the average person and four times as fast as a hypothyroid person. So if you have a high metabolic rate, you don't want to force yourself to go two minutes.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding breath-holding exercises to increase CO2, what is a good target duration, especially for older individuals who might be modestly hypothyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** A very high proportion of the population is breathing too fast, hyperventilating, and so it's beneficial for most people to hold their breath or breathe slower to some extent, but there's no way without doing an oxygen consumption test that you can tell exactly how many seconds you should hold it.

**CONTEXT:** Is there a general guideline for breath-holding duration for someone who is breathing normally or perhaps slightly hypothyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** There is a lot of good interesting research on that, and my orientation to it is that the activation of T3, the active thyroid hormone, is the crucial thing. And that, yes, stress will... prolonged fasting is going to have a lot of harmful counterproductive effects, and one of those is that it knocks out the T3 in the various tissues. Even though the T3 that circulates in the bloodstream, two-thirds of it is roughly produced in the liver and about a third in the thyroid gland, but the various tissues of the body—muscle, skin, kidneys, brain—all of the tissues that have been studied are able to produce T3 from T4 locally to supplement whatever can get in from the bloodstream. So that even if your circulation isn't delivering enough T3, your tissue is able to produce it itself. And the crucial factor for producing it locally in the tissue is partly glucose, but fructose seems to have a special ability to activate that tissue local production of T3. And so I would say that eating enough sugar, having your orange juice and other fruit regularly throughout the day, is much better than either chilling yourself or starving yourself.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the white fat versus brown fat research, and the role of cold exposure or fasting in fat metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** I like Toluca, Mexico. A little chilly, but I really feel accelerated at that altitude. And I think it's better to be a little higher, 12,000 feet or so. Probably less chance of getting bombed by the Koreans, too.

**CONTEXT:** If you were to choose a place to live based solely on optimizing metabolism, would you choose a warm climate at high altitude?

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that progesterone in itself is, but it is converted, reduced chemically, to form allopregnanolone, and that seems to be the most powerful activator of the GABA system in the brain. But I think all of them are acting in the same direction. And besides acting to reduce stress and excitation by activating GABA, progesterone also inhibits several of the excitatory processes, including the glutamatergic and NMDA receptor systems.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the GABA receptor and the role of progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone, is the metabolite more active, or is progesterone itself a good anxiolytic?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm sure you do, but I've never seen X-ray evidence that they actually spaced out the distance between the vertebrae. I don't know whether the bones themselves can adjust, so I think it would be possible for the disc to rebuild itself and for the bones to conform themselves to the regenerating nucleus pulposus.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding disc herniations and the possibility of regenerating the nucleus pulposus, what are your thoughts?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm sure you probably advocate the use of progesterone in and of itself for and thyroid. Yeah, yeah. I've heard and seen knee joints and shoulder joints that were making noise and causing relative immobility to the person to heal themselves from an hour to overnight. Overnight, a completely functional knee recuperated to the point that the guy had to come to the house just to run up and down my stairs to show what had happened to his knee.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned seeing joints heal. Have you seen similar regenerative effects with spinal discs?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, putting it next to the mole, the pigment cells are extremely mobile. They can, if your skin is warm like in summer, they can travel through your skin close to an inch per day. And if you know what they're looking for, depending on whether it's on your forehead or your wrist or your chest, if you put it in the right place, they will apparently satisfy their need for the progesterone or DHA and leave, go back to where they should be to keep your hair pigmented, for example. So the mole just kind of breaks up because the pigment sort of doesn't clump together? They congregate because they're deprived of something where they came from. And for example, on my temple, I applied, I forget which it was, DHA or progesterone, on the front side, and the next day there was a ring of pigment cells nearly an inch to the back side, and the mole itself had shrunk. The second day I applied another dab in front of it, and the following day there was like a bull's eye, two brown rings spaced out in a curved line behind it, and the mole itself was again smaller. And I kept doing that, and within a few days, a red shiny blood vessel appearance constricted the base. It had been as big as a dime and it constricted down to about the diameter of a matchstick, and then dried up and fell off and didn't leave a scar.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned applying progesterone or DHA near moles. Can you describe that experience?

**RAY PEAT:** In animal studies, when they gave it to a healthy animal, none of it seemed to get into the brain. But if the animal had been sleep-deprived, so its brain really needed GABA and was in an excited state, then the GABA was able to get into the brain and relax it.

**CONTEXT:** Is GABA something that can be taken as a supplement, and does it affect other neurotransmitters?

**RAY PEAT:** The effect that I was describing of ordinary sucrose, for example, in orange juice, is able to stimulate weight loss by activating the T3 in your fat cells. So, fruit toast is available at health food stores. In the pure form, if a person is diabetic, that doesn't increase the blood glucose the way...

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned monk fruit sugar. What are your thoughts on its constituents and its effects compared to table sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's a pretty toxic product. And it's like xylitol and all the other sugar substitutes. I do believe that there's a lot more negative effects to them than any positive effects from any lower calories or insulin sensitivity type reactions from their non-sugar sugar. I know there's lots of information out there that will say that sugar is toxic or it's pure, white and deadly, etc., and we've totally visited it, and I don't think there's any mileage in it. Not too sure why it is that you would have had your inflammation clear up, but it's good that you did. Who knows what else is going on with you, with your thyroid, etc. You said you were pretty large. I don't know if you have any metabolic issues. Maybe have some low thyroid situation happening with you. But typically those situations there do predispose to toxin buildup, and that obviously has its effects, as does weight on the joints. So I think all of those things kind of work against you, but yeah, happy that you got a reduction in your inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on monk fruit sugar and stevia as sugar substitutes, especially concerning inflammation and weight loss?
