**RAY PEAT:** In all sorts of crisis situations it lowers the damage that's done by the interruption of the oxidative processes. It lowers inflammation and helps to restore energy production. It's very parallel to the effects of T3, the active thyroid hormone. And it helps to produce that and the T3 helps to increase the ratio of progesterone to estrogen. And T3 is equally acutely protective to the heart. Several years ago, when they were doing heart transplants, they found that if they gave the donor, the heart donor, T3 before removing their heart, that heart was much more successfully implanted.

**CONTEXT:** Do you think progesterone would be useful for a heart attack instance?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, in all sorts of crisis situations it lowers the damage that's done by the interruption of the oxidative processes. It lowers inflammation and helps to restore energy production. It's very parallel to the effects of T3, the active thyroid hormone. And it helps to produce that and the T3 helps to increase the ratio of progesterone to estrogen. And T3 is equally acutely protective to the heart. Several years ago, when they were doing heart transplants, they found that if they gave the donor, the heart donor, T3 before removing their heart, that heart was much more successfully implanted.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that T3 is the active thing that promotes the production of progesterone in the oligodendrocytes.

**RAY PEAT:** In the oligodendrocytes that you mentioned, we're progesterone is produced, T3 is the active thing that promotes its production there.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned in the past the similarities between carbon dioxide and progesterone. Can you elaborate on how carbon dioxide is beneficial and equate that to progesterone's protective effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Both of those increase the production and retention of carbon dioxide. And another point on giving progesterone to a recent heart attack, the effect of estrogen on the energy production, which makes the heart able to beat, estrogen delays the restoration of the energy needed to make the heart beat. And that shows up as prolonged QT interval and progesterone shortens that interval, makes the heart less likely to have a rhythm problem because it accelerates the ability to return to the resting energized state where it can beat rather than having an arrhythmia event. And carbon dioxide has that same muscle-stabilizing effect at high altitude. For many years they've talked about the lactate paradox. A person can work full force at high altitude without producing the excess lactic acid that they normally would produce at sea level. That's because it's a body. At lower oxygen pressure is able to retain a higher balance of CO2 in the tissues and that stabilizing effect in the working muscle is very similar to what progesterone is doing in the heart and brain.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that people living at high altitudes have longer lifespans. How does CO2 retention relate to sleep quality?

**RAY PEAT:** If you look at how sleep is affected under stress, when someone is having altitude sickness, they develop insomnia. And it's primarily the low thyroid people who develop altitude sickness because they hyperventilate. Rather, they were hyperventilating chemically even at sea level. That's the one they go to. At high altitude, that hyperventilation or a low retention of CO2 shows up as an acute problem. But at sea level or at high altitude, if your thyroid function is good and you're well saturated with carbon dioxide, your restful, slow-wave sleep, the deep part of sleep, is longer in proportion to the amount of CO2 in your tissues. And they've experimented with having people sleep in atmospheres from one-half percent to one-and-a-half percent or even higher. At those moderate but greatly increased CO2 levels, there's a dramatic improvement. The slow-wave, deep sleep is extended. Greatly in the around 1% CO2, where normally it's only about 400 parts per million.

**CONTEXT:** Should athletes consider mixing carbon dioxide with oxygen on the sidelines, or is doping oneself with carbon dioxide generally beneficial for athletic performance?

**RAY PEAT:** It should be five or six percent of CO2 and fewer oxygen and at on some of the Mount Everest experiments it was traditional to have a plastic or rubber bag to put zip the person up inside the bag with oxygen at the high altitude to help them recover if they were becoming mountain sick and someone found what happened in that plastic bag was they concentrated their breath CO2 increase and they found that giving the high altitude sickness patient pure CO2 like a 5% additive would cure them as well as the oxygen supplement.

**CONTEXT:** What can be done to lower high prolactin levels if thyroid hormone and progesterone are not effective?

**RAY PEAT:** If there's really a tumor that's secreting it bromo-cryptine is. Almost always successful at shrinking it, but if the tumor isn't very large you can, I think, just as reliably do it by keeping your thyroid function a little above normal for two or three weeks and watch the prolactin as you first should see the TSH go down close to zero because the same serotonin which rises in hypothyroidism activates the production of prolactin so the TSH descent will be followed by a slower lowering of the prolactin.

**CONTEXT:** What is the safe way to cook and eat mushrooms, and what about marmalade?

**RAY PEAT:** I think eating, it's safe to eat about a cup of well-cooked white button mushrooms every day. You boil them. OK, you boil them. OK, how about frying them in butter? That tastes good too, but they should stay at the boiling temperature for at least an hour. I think so. They're probably safe after even 15 or 20 minutes, but just to be sure. Raw mushrooms have cancer-promoting substances in them, but the paradox was that well-cooked mushrooms. Had that anti that aromatase blocking activity. And with Marmalade, it's important to get good organic oranges. You don't want any insecticides or fungicide in your marmalade. You don't You just said you need to make sure you got a certified product because any any residues will be in the skin and that's where You're going to be making a marmalade, but not but not the pith of the orange.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential positive and negative effects of donating blood for the donor, and could the longer lifespan of females be linked to monthly blood loss?

**RAY PEAT:** As far as heart disease goes, the incidence of heart damage of different types increases at menopause and so the women become similar to men for the high rate of heart damage and that's probably because they had been throwing away some. excess iron while they were menstruating. Besides the red cell iron that you lose, I think you can get a great benefit if you keep your, if you aren't eating too much iron, if you keep your red cells but donate the plasma. It might not be good for the recipient but it's very good too. I get rid of some of your stress-induced microspheres.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding CO2, if one uses a bag of CO2 regularly, would the body acclimate and get better at retaining CO2?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think that's exactly. What happens, you're training your cells to take advantage of the lactate paradox effect. The longer you stay under the influence of higher CO2, your bones are charging up on it. If you're in a submarine, for example, for two months, you are still assimilating CO2 into your bone structure. And so it lasts a long time after you're at high altitude or in a submarine.

**CONTEXT:** So, training the body with CO2 makes sense, and it's a powerful way to supplement normal CO2 retention, especially when considering factors like progesterone, thyroid, salt, and sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you're training some parts of your brain not to be hypersensitive to CO2. Estrogen makes your nerves overreactive to CO2. So under the influence of too much estrogen, everyone hyperventilates and blows out too much CO2. And the CO2 temporarily sort of anesthetizes that process and gradually trains you to stop hyperventilating.

**CONTEXT:** What is your view on hair tests for toxic metals and how to balance copper and iron?

**RAY PEAT:** Hair is extremely able to bind even out of the air, but so many people have copper plumbing nowadays. If your water is at all acidic, it will absorb enough. Copper out of your plumbing to totally invalidate any hair test if you wash your hair because your hair will catch all of the copper to saturate it just out of the wash water.

**CONTEXT:** How do you get rid of toxic metals and balance copper and iron over time?

**RAY PEAT:** I advocate eating shellfish, because they're They use copper for blood instead of iron, and a constant, once a week, shellfish will, I think, keep your copper up where it should be. With age, as you overload on iron, that tends to displace copper from the enzymes where it's used, elastase, in blood vessels. It tends to deteriorate as it loses copper with aging, and the pigment is displaced. Karl Pfeiffer, who was big on the fear of copper, took a little sulfur every day, because he knew it would reduce the absorption of copper. But when I met him, he was in his 70s, and he had no trace of pigment anywhere. His skin was absolutely pink and his hair was pure white. I think that was because of the creating a deficiency of copper by too much sulfur.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that estrogen is more responsible for sex drive than testosterone. Can you explain the relationship between estrogen and sexuality?

**RAY PEAT:** It just takes the conversion of any androgen to estrogen in certain parts of the brain to increase the libido, so it doesn't have to be in your serum.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that high estrogen can be associated with inflammation, and that progesterone is the counterpart. You also mentioned that mushrooms and aspirin can help regulate estrogen. What about reishi mushrooms for inflammation and estrogen issues?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is the counterpart to estrogen dominance or any estrogen issues you would have had in inflammation. And DHEA, Pregnenolone and Progesterone will favor the right conversion of just the right amount of estrogen, not too much, and you can boost that regulatory effect if you still have too much general estrogen with things like the mushrooms, aspirin, and Yes.

**CONTEXT:** You've stated that iron is not great for us. What is your perspective on iron deficiency and its treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Doctors for at least a hundred years have been diagnosing iron deficiency in women. A hundred years ago they were prescribing arsenic to treat it. But either arsenic or iron supplements do stimulate the production of red blood cells because of the red cell production. Depends on stress and you create a local oxygen deficiency with arsenic or iron and so it can increase the formation but the problem is usually that your long bones, arms and legs... the temperature of your extremities goes down as your thyroid function decreases. Or your estrogen increases. So high estrogen always tends to cause slight anemia appearance just by slowing the production of red blood cells.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that drinking milk, orange juice, and coffee can help with high lead content.

**RAY PEAT:** Drinking milk, orange juice, and coffee will correct that over a period of weeks.

**CONTEXT:** Why is it recommended to boil mushrooms for an hour to get the aromatase blocking activity?

**RAY PEAT:** The hydrazines are heat sensitive. It's believed that the hydrazine compounds are the carcinogens and they evaporate and break down and around an hour will drastically lower the concentration. Longer would be better, but I think it's completely safe because it's a balance between the pro-carcinogenic hydrazines and the anti-cancer agents which are multiple, such as lowering the aromatase function.

**CONTEXT:** Is taking ornithine at night to mop up excess ammonia a reasonable approach for sleep issues?

**RAY PEAT:** It might help with the ammonia, but I would worry about the promotion of cell division if you used it chronically. It's one of the things that activate cell division.

**CONTEXT:** What about L-threonine for preventing cancer and helping metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think it's very safe to use individual amino acids. Glycine is the only one I know of that is safe by itself, because it can be used as energy.

**CONTEXT:** Is monolaurin, a product related to coconut, useful for intestinal flora and conditions like Lyme disease?

**RAY PEAT:** It does have a good effect. Killing a lot of fungi and bacteria, but several years ago when the guy was promoting his development, I forget his name, but he asked me to sign on to advertise it. And I asked him if he had done any tests to see if it didn't have an action like soap on the intestine. It is a emulsifier and it could, in a large dose, I think it could be irritating to the intestine, but he didn't have any opinion on that so I didn't participate.

**CONTEXT:** What is your view on eating organ meats like heart and brain, or desiccated organ products, for rejuvenation?

**RAY PEAT:** The brain has a very high concentration of progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone. Eating the brain is like taking a supplement of those steroids. I knew someone who was Norwegian. She said that in her coastal villages, everyone ate fish head soup at least once a week. And she said that everyone that she knew lived to be 95 if they were eating their fish head soup.

**CONTEXT:** You advocate for whole animal consumption and gelatin-rich foods like bone broths. What about desiccated organ products if they are the only way to obtain them?

**RAY PEAT:** I would worry about the dehydration process it in the fatty acids and the tryptophan and cysteine are very sensitive to oxidation and they can break down into a lot of toxins so you would have to be sure that it was dehydrated under nitrogen and it just seems like a risk. And that's why you're always advocating good quality food as your source of nutrition just because it's alive and hasn't been processed. Eggs, for example, have lots of extremely beneficial substances. Some of them are just being discovered, and they're always fresh.

**CONTEXT:** Have you encountered catamenial epilepsy, and what is your experience with it?

**RAY PEAT:** Katherina Dalton was one of the early people working on that. In the 1940s she started treating premenstrual syndrome with progesterone and there isn't a terrible difference between the catamenial epilepsy and the PMS. One of the first people, maybe it was the very first person I ever, no the second person I gave progesterone to was someone who hadn't. Migraines when she was in her 30s and she was a schoolteacher and a doctor said migraines are like epilepsy and so he prescribed an epileptic treatment and she said it made her too stupid to teach and so when fall term came she stopped it and had an epileptic seizure. The doctor said see I told you. Migraine was right next to epilepsy. But anyway, she kept having seizures for until she was in her early 50s when I saw her and every year the neurologist would give her an IQ test and say now your IQ has deteriorated to the point that you're an idiot. Don't go out of the house alone. Her son brought her to talk to me. I showed her how a progesterone can be absorbed through the skin and she had two stiff arthritic fingers. She dipped it in the solution of progesterone and I gave her some to take home and a chart to fill out and a few days later she came back all by herself with her chart filled out showing that her symptoms had all disappeared and she was grinning and bending her fingers and within a few months she went back to graduate school and got straight A's, got a master's degree in gerontology showing that the psychologist or neurologist was right that epilepsy is closely related to PMS at least. She was simply having a premenstrual migraine and sometimes that fades over into epilepsy.
