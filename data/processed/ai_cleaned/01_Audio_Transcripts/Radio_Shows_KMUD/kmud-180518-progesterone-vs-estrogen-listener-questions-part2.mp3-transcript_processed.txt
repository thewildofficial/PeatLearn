**RAY PEAT:** Before I studied biology, I was a literature, linguistics and art major and teacher, and I decided to study biology, initially, to get more understanding of how language and intelligence and consciousness work. And what I found was that brain biology, cognitive science, so-called, was pure dogmatism, very little science in it. So I shifted over to reproductive physiology to basically study how the organism works. All the way from the germ cell to the brain and the brain science really is not distinct from reproductive physiology. The brain is really the motor for the whole life process and I did my dissertation 1972 on the oxidative changes in the uterus in particular as it changes with aging.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, would you just give an outline of your professional and academic background so people that are listening can hear where you've come from?

**RAY PEAT:** In my research, I looked through everything that had been done on physiology, especially as it relates to the brain and uterus, up until 1970. And I couldn't find any evidence that would clearly distinguish the physiology of estrogen stimulation from X-ray stimulation or oxygen deprivation or vitamin E deficiency, which interferes with oxygen use. All of those things deplete the energy production of the cell, which is based on oxidation. And when the brain is oversupplied with estrogen or lacks its antagonist, especially progesterone, the whole system, but everything in the brain included, wastes oxygen and is unable to keep the energy level up to the point that the cells are stable. And one of the strange things that has been overlooked or seen upside down in both biology and medicine for most of the century is that a high energy state of a cell is the state in which it's ready to work and function, but it is not acting all the time. It's sitting there ready to work. And when it is forced to work more than it is ready for, the energy level falls. And it gets into a state trying to restore the energy but it is in a constantly active state. If you cause hypoglycemia by interfering with the liver, for example, it works the same as a lack of oxygen. And estrogen happens to interfere with the supply of oxygen. Of glucose to cells, it activates insulin, but it also activates the release of fatty acids from the tissues. And the fatty acids block the ability to oxidize glucose. So estrogen does, it activates the cells by increasing the function of glutamic acid, a brain excitement. And in increasing glutamate, it decreases GABA, the inhibiting signal. GABA should be produced by the breakdown of glutamic acid. So estrogen is exciting the brain cells and at the same time interfering with the use of oxygen and glucose.

**CONTEXT:** Catamanial epilepsy and the estrogens like estrone, estriol and estradiol, how do you understand the triggering of the epilepsy? In these certain susceptible females, it's estrogen related, isn't it?

**RAY PEAT:** I consider estrogen's function to be the controlled stress. The whole organism is moving through a developmental process. It requires a constant supply of energy and if that energy supply becomes fatally impaired then the function of estrogen in the reproductive system is to erase the whole scheme that was producing the organism's development through its life process. Suddenly the excess of estrogen as a stress signal erases the whole program and reverts to the single multiplying cell. So without anything interfering, estrogen tends to produce the cancer cell. But it also activates the production of the egg. The readiness of the egg to start a new organism, so it's proper function should be once a month for a few hours to activate the potential new life. And that only starts at puberty. Up until puberty, the brain is metabolizing at a very high rate. The catamenial epilepsy tends to begin around the age of nine when estrogen is rising and progesterone hasn't risen yet. And the brain metabolism slows down at puberty and so the body takes it as a threat to survival and so it turns on the reproductive process.

**CONTEXT:** Is it correct that estrogen's only real benefit is the inflammation it provides or promotes to stimulate implantation of an oocyte in the endometrium in terms of successful pregnancies? And outside of that, it doesn't really have too much benefit.

**RAY PEAT:** Throughout the organism, whenever the tissue is stressed, it tends to turn on locally the production of estrogen. That's how it so easily leads to cancer because every tissue has the apparatus for making estrogen. And after menopause, when the production of progesterone becomes very limited, there is a tendency for all of the body's tissues to begin producing estrogen. For some reason, we've been looking at those records and searching for different ways that estrogen can be nourishing. So it's just the opposite of what the menopause doctors have been teaching. When progesterone disappears, the breast, the uterus, the brain, the liver, the skin, the fat, muscles even begin producing estrogen. But it can't escape from the cell because it also increases the estrogen binding protein, the estrogen so-called receptor. In the absence of progesterone, the intracellular estrogen increases, but it doesn't get into the blood, so you measure the blood and it looks like you're estrogen deficient. Exactly when you're being systemically poisoned with intracellular estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** And as you've mentioned before on previous shows, estrogen is very responsible for edema. The cell swelling and that inefficiency that comes with that waterlogging from an energy point of view.

**RAY PEAT:** The individual cell swells up when it's being excited and de-energized. When you can get the energy back up, that squeezes the water out. And that same swollen state occurs in capillaries and blood vessels. And even though they get thicker, they become leaky. Water goes through them into the tissues and out of your bloodstream. And that's involved in the circulatory problems of pregnancy. The blood volume can't be maintained while the legs and feet tend to swell up. And the kidneys sense the lack of circulation because the blood volume has shrunk. And so the kidneys send out signals to raise the blood pressure to try to get more.

**CONTEXT:** So you mentioned that when a cell is in a ready state to perform work, that relaxed state is what is so important for that proper contraction, that proper action potential to occur to do work. And that in hypothyroidism, the cell remains in a constantly stressed state where it's not able to relax and that's that very lack of relaxation that causes the energy problems.

**RAY PEAT:** You can see exactly the same process in the heart muscle as in the brain and other cells, but it's very easy to study in the brain and in the muscle because the muscle is such a concentrated muscle system. And estrogen weakens but makes more frequent the contraction and it's great excess of estrogen causes a shock-like state of the heart, rapid but very, very weak pulsation, where progesterone strengthens, it lets the cells build up energy so that when it does contract, it's a very powerful contraction and pumps very efficiently.

**CONTEXT:** Your ideas on chronic fatigue syndrome, how do you see it? And then also naltrexone, low dose.

**RAY PEAT:** One way of thinking of it is that it's very similar to, in the brain, the seizure state or in the heart, the failure state under the influence of a lack of progesterone and excess of estrogen or simply such a deficiency of energy that the cell goes into that swollen, over-excitable state. When a cell is in very bad condition, as far as I know, every cell in the body can also produce histamine as it's getting very desperate, not only in a chronic sort of desperation, cells produce estrogen, but in a most acute situation, they produce histamine. And in the hypothyroid, low progesterone, chronic state, the body tends to locally produce a lot of histamine and other inflammatory things.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, and what do you think about naltrexone, low dose naltrexone? Does it have any merit?

**RAY PEAT:** In my experience, using naloxone more than naltrexone, but they're essentially identical, one is a little more oil soluble, I found that from 1 to 4 milligrams per day of naloxone would break a depressed condition by suppressing the endorphins which are induced by naltrexone. Lactic acid and fatigue, the endorphins are another emergency measure to turn off the excitation. But with a very small dose, some people use even a hundredth of a milligram and find a very therapeutic effect. So, I consider four milligrams a day a fairly big larger-than-necessary dose.

**CONTEXT:** So, I understand B1, B2, and B3 and why they're beneficial. I wanted to go backwards. So, B9 is folic acid and B7 is biotin, and I think in some of the stuff I read about, what people seem to be interpreting regarding your research or point of view, is that 1, 2, and 3 are important and 6 in a smaller amount, but B5, anaphenic acid, B4, adenosine, and folic acid in B12 are probably not to be taken. Are these the bad guys and if so, why?

**RAY PEAT:** Their main metabolic similarity is that they are regulators and facilitators of cell oxidative energy processes. Panathenic acid is somewhat off the main group, but it's very essential, it's anti-stress, helps with regulating blood sugar and allergies, so sometimes 400 to 500 milligram dose of panathenic acid can relieve stress symptoms. And it's unusual in that it doesn't affect the interactions of the others. It's sort of on a sideline where it can be taken. In monkeys, they fed them a cup a day of pure panathenic acid with no side effects. If you did that with any of the other B vitamins, you would quickly reach a toxic effect.

**CONTEXT:** So panathenic acid... It can be taken daily, because all these are water soluble, but this can be taken daily, up to 400 milligrams and you will see some benefit of cellular oxidative energy, particularly, I'm thinking more about digestion too, because some of these, like I've taken B1 and B2 recently, and I really believe it's helped my ability to digest things. I'm a young man of around 60, so I'm just wondering, you know, how to take these, how much to take. And how often, as opposed to, you know, what's being out there in the research, because it seems to not be accurate relative to what you're saying.

**RAY PEAT:** The orthomolecular movement 40 years ago, I think encouraged a lot of overdose excess use of them. You can get extremely therapeutic results sometimes with five or ten times the minimum daily requirement. Like 10 or 20 milligrams of B1, 10 milligrams of B2, 10 milligrams of B6, and so on. But sometimes larger doses are effective, but I think it's good to try the smallest dose, maybe five times the minimum daily requirement.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, so it's okay to take that daily, so for the ones you mentioned... About 10 to 20 milligrams in a day is okay, and I guess B3 is a little, like, different in the sense you could take, you know, 4 to 500 of that one too, right? It's not just B5, but B3 also, am I right? Niacin?

**RAY PEAT:** Niacinamide. Yeah, it's important to get the amide form. The other releases inflammatory mediators. The niacinamide is safe up to at least a couple hundred milligrams, but I think I've seen people with brain, terminal brain diseases cured themselves taking just 150 or 200 of niacinamide per day.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, and B7 is biotin. I hear people say that that will reduce your blood glucose levels, but then I read and I say, well gee, maybe that's not true. Maybe it actually regulates them dynamically. So what about biotin? Is there any negatives to taking, you know, biotin in like five to ten thousand? I think it's micrograms, not milligrams.

**RAY PEAT:** I've seen the good results from very, very big doses of biotin, but 50 years ago, some animal studies showed that a moderate overdose could cause liver cancer, so I've always been leery about it, but I've never seen people repeating those experiments. I would stick to around one milligram of biotin.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, one milligram, okay, gotcha, per day. Okay, and then... Folic acid, you're kind of... I mean, I've read that you somehow think that's, like, somehow dangerous to take at all. Is that... I could be wrong too, but that's what I've read.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's safe at a dose of around one milligram, maybe as high as five milligrams per day. But you have to be cautious with, especially, vitamin B2 and folic acid, because something in the synthetic process makes a lot of people get migraine headaches and hemorrhoids and other very intense symptoms from those which happen to be yellow molecules. And I think it's something about their sensitivity to light and oxidation that makes the pure chemical pretty allergenic for a lot of people. The worst symptoms I've heard about are migraine-like headaches and bowel problems, but that could, the bowel inflammation can lead to rashes.

**CONTEXT:** And then B12, I really almost see almost no writing on that or just curious. There's a lot of people say you've got to have your B12 up and I know I guess to methylation but is there an amount or is it the amount that you consume in your basic diet should be more than enough?

**RAY PEAT:** If you eat animal products in particular and the intestine bacteria can make a lot of it. I hear from a lot of people with small intestine inflammation who have about 50% higher than the upper normal range for B12, apparently because their bacteria are thriving where they shouldn't be.

**CONTEXT:** So Dr. P, what do you think about maintaining this sentence, even just regarding serotonin's positive effects? [Referring to an article stating estrogen increases serotonin, associated with happiness.]

**RAY PEAT:** To be polite, I think it's very, very silly. It's confused and backwards. For example, the serotonin thing, the happiness signal. Serotonin is very essential for the inflammation, osteoporosis, cancer, blood clotting, spasms, and so on, of bad effects. Inflammatory processes are dictated by serotonin. Yeah, it's right there with histamine as the most intense acute local inflammatory signal. And in the brain, that inflammatory process of serotonin turns on the whole stress system that activates ACTH and cortisol. Estrogen not only activates that serotonin dependent pathway but it directly activates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol so estrogen is a basic stress hormone. Serotonin is kind of a terminal mediator of that stress process turning on the defensive antistress of cortisol production. But in itself, serotonin is a very powerful bone destroyer by its inflammatory process. It's basically an alarm signal.

**CONTEXT:** So where did you get that from, that progesterone has this depressant effect? [Referring to an article suggesting progesterone has a depressant effect similar to depressive drugs.]

**RAY PEAT:** That's a very interesting confusion of the meaning of depression. In the heart, for example, progesterone depresses the spastic activity that leads to cardiac arrest. And it depresses the premature contractions and facilitates a good rhythm. Estrogen has the opposite effect, tends to produce arrhythmia by delaying the ability to regain its energy charge and get ready for the next beat.

**CONTEXT:** So she suggests that [progesterone's effect] may be particularly pronounced now because women are having far more periods and far fewer children than in the thousands of malnourished years before birth control. Like birth control is a popularly appreciated product. Anyway 300 years ago women started menstruating around 17 or 18 because they were less healthy than today. So I'm not too sure what you got to say about being less healthy and having a later menarche which you've actually said and is well and shown that it's actually a positive thing to actually have your period start early is actually related to high estrogen it's actually very detrimental to your long-term health isn't it?

**RAY PEAT:** The age at menarche is getting lower and lower all the time over the last several decades and that is now known to correspond to all of the estrogen problems later in life. One of the recent groups of studies related to the early puberty and the tendency to have autistic babies, the uterus during gestation has a higher estrogen level in the women who started at a very young age.

**CONTEXT:** Now this this would have subjected them to a fairly sustained level of progesterone correct through being pregnant seems to get it just exactly wrong with pregnancy as a time of the low progesterone but the normal cycling woman produces maybe 30 milligrams a day during the luteal phase before menstruation and the ovaries weighing six or seven grams maybe are working pretty efficiently when they can produce 30 milligrams a day but the placenta in the term pregnancy weighs about a pound and a half roughly a hundred times bigger than the ovaries and it can produce at least 30 times as much progesterone per day and there's an interesting discussion of the effect of pregnancy on aging and general health in a book by A.V. Everett and others called Hypothalamus, Pituitary and Aging in which he describes experiments mating rabbits constantly as soon as they have a litter, mate them again so that they live their whole lives you producing a maximum number of litters and others that were not mated the multi-litter rabbits had much more flexible young connective tissue their tissues were less aged at the end of their lives than the non-mated and they mentioned studies done in Hungary looking at the lifespan of women in relation to the number of babies they had produced and graphing it from zero babies to eight babies, the maximum that they calculated, they showed a straight line of life expectancy increasing with each baby that was born and in the rabbits they showed that it was this very high constant, almost constant, exposure to progesterone that was protecting, reversing the estrogen induced age changes in the connective tissue that made them live longer and be healthier.

**CONTEXT:** Looks like there's a double the risk in men. Dr. Paed. [Referring to a study on aspirin and melanoma.]

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I saw that and I don't know what happened with all of the other cancers that have been studied. Aspirin prevents them. Yeah, I find it strange as well. It looks like it was a surprising result versus all the other cancers. You'll probably find the same thing with the synapse studies and the protec studies on progesterone that didn't turn up with positive information. You'll probably find the same thing with the methodology or some of the methodology is probably going to be in question.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, and just one more question. What are his thoughts about molecular hydrogen water and the benefits? Looks like there's a few studies coming from Japan. Looks like there's some positive benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything I've seen looks like it's maybe simply reducing the free radical oxidative damage substances like lipid peroxides. It lowers inflammation in all the experiments I've seen.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned bag breathing, and I've also heard about dry CO2 baths, and I was just wondering if CO2 is heavier than air, can you just put it in a bathtub? Sure. And how would you measure it? Because if you move around, it seems like there'd be quite a bit of disturbance.

**RAY PEAT:** If you get in slowly and get out slowly, it's so heavy that you don't flush much of it out, but you can check with a match or a lighter to find the level. The match goes out as soon as you sink it into the pure CO2.

**CONTEXT:** How long do you have to stay in there for benefit? Could you do this, like, once a week or something, you know, like your recommendation on liver, for example?

**RAY PEAT:** A 1908 article described it. A weekly bath in CO2 as being equivalent to a vacation at the ocean. It gets boring after an hour, but you can get a big bag or tub, and a plastic tub works fine, doesn't have any leaks in it like a bathtub does. Sit in it and read or watch TV or whatever. It has a warm sensation when it touches your skin. But that's because it's opening up blood vessels, getting more blood to your skin. So you could chill yourself, I think, if you did it in a cold place, because it would make you lose heat faster through your skin. I use it from a welding shop.

**CONTEXT:** What about PQQ? Is that also helpful to manufacture and replace damaged mitochondria in conjunction with CoQ10?

**RAY PEAT:** PQQ, pure quinolone. I've heard about that but never studied it.

**CONTEXT:** Before adenine was mentioned, that's something that's not really mentioned as a B vitamin, and I was just wondering, is that really just an omission for and it should... is something that could be taken beneficially?...externally, like the other ones that someone went through earlier? Uh, did you say adenosine? Or, I think it's adenine. Vitamin B4 is what I've heard it referred to as. Uh, how did you pronounce it? Uh, I guess, well, I thought it was adenine, but maybe it's adenosine.

**RAY PEAT:** Adenosine is sort of risky. It's the opposite of caffeine in some ways. And it can bring on symptoms that caffeine can alleviate so I wouldn't risk using adenosine that can cause an asthma attack for example.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned migraine and things that can make them, can give you a migraine and things that can take it away, but I miss... The first one, I think you said biotin and folic acid was a tricky combination that could cause migraines and then you said something that I just missed what you said actually alleviated it.

**RAY PEAT:** Riboflavin and folic acid are the ones that are most irritating and getting the intestine free of any of those irritants is very important. It's a fibrous food such as raw carrots or cooked mushrooms helps to clean out the inflammatory substances from the intestine, but sugar helps to stop the production of histamine and serotonin. Progesterone and sugar. Yeah, sugar helps to stop the production of histamine and serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think about K2's use with or without aspirin in that instance if you're mentioning its affinity with CoQ10?

**RAY PEAT:** The Japanese have experimented with it at higher levels up to 40 or 45 milligrams per day and I've known several people who had extremely high, persistently high blood pressure like 240 over 140 I think was one person's regular pressure for a year because his blood vessels were very calcified and he took 40 or 50 milligrams per day of Thorne vitamin K and in after a week the pressure was much lower and after two weeks it was essentially normal 140 over 70.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think Dr. P as a general for a female now presumably? What a progesterone dose would be and if you're taking it orally in an oil dissolved form?

**RAY PEAT:** 20 or 30 milligrams is a very effective dose. I've used as much as a hundred milligrams myself for a headache it took about two minutes to knock out of my drain. It's a powerful sedative if you take enough. A hundred milligrams after it knocked out the migraine, it put me to sleep for a couple hours.

**CONTEXT:** What does Dr. P think is the mechanism behind that [earthing/grounding]? if there is any?

**RAY PEAT:** Negative ionized air is more abundant near the ocean or waterfalls I think that's part of the good feeling you get at the beach. Another thing is the skin stimulation of freeing your your shoes from being imprisoned in shoes and socks. That's a very powerful stimulus but supposedly the body does, the immune system, for example, reacts to the electrically charged things in the environment. For example, they put nylon on some animals that supposedly was interfering with the normal skin ionization and found that their immune systems were suppressed. And the Earth is always a source of electrons, actually, relative to the higher atmosphere. You get a gradient with a positive at high altitude and the negative pole at the Earth.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peake, very quickly on CoQ10 and mitochondrial activity, you think there is relative merit there for using CoQ10?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think so. In many cases, a person is not producing enough of it, and it happens that vitamin K works with CoQ, Dan, and makes it more effective and stable.
