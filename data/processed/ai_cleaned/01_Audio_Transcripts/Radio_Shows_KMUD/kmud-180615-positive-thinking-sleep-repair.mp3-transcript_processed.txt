**RAY PEAT:** My early education was in literature, painting, general humanities including philosophy and then after about 10 years in 1968 I went to graduate school in biology. Intending to study nerve biology and the finding that that was the most dogmatic of the biological studies I found the most empirical people in the department were working on reproductive physiology and so I did my Ph.D. in basically reproductive endocrinology and physiology in 1972. That was when I got my Ph.D. and I've been studying and writing and consulting since then.
**CONTEXT:** Could you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**RAY PEAT:** In between working in literature and linguistics and going back to school to study biology, I had an experimental college, Blake College, and my theory there was that there are deliberate attempts to plant bad seeds in our garden and my approach to education was that if you create the right environment, people can uproot those planted bad seeds and create themselves a fresh, new way of looking at the world and we found that people who had thought they were inferior students in just four or five or six months in that environment where they were expected to be fully functioning became fully functioning and achieved more in five or six months than the average American college graduate achieves in the whole four years and this is through a kind of more of a liberal for the sake of the word being liberal philosophies to the subject of understanding and learning rather than just rote memory and recapitulation of facts.
**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on positive affirmation and the mind as a garden?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, that's exactly analogous to what we were doing at Blake College, healing people from the cultural disease they've been given, and there's a fairly recent book, the last 20 years, I think, that was published by Larry Dossi called, I think, Words That Heal or Healing Words, something like that, and an older book published in Russian in 1930, and then in English in 1959. Words. As physiological and therapeutic factors, the word has a way to handle ideas and thoughts. In both of these cases, they're treating words or thoughts as healing physiological factors. So it's exactly putting in scientific terms that idea of faith healing.
**CONTEXT:** What do you think about faith healing?

**RAY PEAT:** The stress which might be malnutrition or emotional stress, overworked, many things can cause a high cortisol. Which then damages the beta cells and the mobilizing the fats from storage during stress, a lack of sleep for example creates a diabetic condition. And chronic stress including poor sleep quality leads to the hormonal situation which damages the pancreas. And the fatty acids when you are treating it improperly you keep exposing the pancreas to these toxic fatty acids when it turns out that glucose, when it's predominant in the blood, causes regeneration from stem cells. Regeneration and differentiation of new beta cells. But when you're under stress and improperly treated, your free fatty acids and cortisol come in and kill the new cells.
**CONTEXT:** Do you see diabetes as an example of pancreatic cell destruction, or do you define it differently?

**RAY PEAT:** The rest of your body can't repair itself unless it has a brain in good working order. The most sensitive thing to the stress is the brain itself. But when the brain can't repair itself and impose resting state on the rest of the organism, then you get things like the chronic excess of free fatty acids and cortisol, which destroy not only the pancreas, but all of the other organs.
**CONTEXT:** Is sleep more necessary for brain repair, or restructuring and energy renewal, or for tissue repair throughout the body? What do you suggest as a minimum number of hours for a sleeping adult?

**RAY PEAT:** When the blood sugar isn't able to produce the carbon dioxide that it should, its wasted becomes lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide, raises the pH of the cell interior, creates a catabolic excited state in which the brain cells ultimately end up dying or being blocked so that they can't act even if they stay alive. And in reaction to the falling oxidation of glucose, you get the rise of adrenaline which tries to activate cells. It provides more glucose if you have that in storage and that can remedy the situation. That's why it's there. The adrenaline should bring up the glucose and stop the stress reaction. But if you don't have enough stored glucose, then you resort to the cortisol level of stress adaptation. Cortisol provides the glucose by breaking down your muscle cells and skin cells. Turning it into glucose and if that glucose doesn't solve the problem then you get a chronic recurring stress, low blood sugar, increased adrenaline, increased cortisol and whole breakdown process.
**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones directly affect sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** Norbert Wiener, who invented cybernetics in the English-speaking world, he probably the best information theorist. In terms of the brain and how it works as a control mechanism integrated intimately with the metabolism of the body. So it's a metabolic control system as well as an interpreter of how the body relates to its ecosystem.
**CONTEXT:** How do you view the brain's control of the body and homeostasis, in relation to Norbert Wiener's view of the organism?

**RAY PEAT:** The energy state of the cell in a healthy cell ultimately is charged electrically charged positively rested and ready to begin an action potential and that in the tendon reflex when there is a slow return to the resting state that shows that the cell has been overstimulated and just like in sleep if we don't get enough sleep we are essentially too excited in terms of people that are insomniacs for example too excited to be able to get that relaxation so that we have that energy in the morning when we get up like we do when we're healthy and strong and we get lots of sugar in our diet and our thyroids are good and vitamin D and everything else and calcium so that we are charged and ready to go so the ability to relax and to accumulate energy. The substance of differentiation then this is a predominantly oxidative high energy production system. And as a third dimension of this comparing the brain to the cramping calf muscle in the Achilles reflex test if you think of the cancer cell as an energy deprived overexcited. So it has the exact situation of the fatigued or ceasing brain cells or the cramping muscle cells, deficiency of sugar or oxygen will cause cramping in the muscles, insomnia or seizure in the brain and compulsive growth and fusion in the cancer cell. And so this is what we call excitotoxicity. The term for this then would refer very well to cancer cells. They're just completely excited and unable to relax ultimately.
**CONTEXT:** What is your understanding of the Achilles tendon reflex as an indicator of hypothyroidism and its relation to cell energy and excitotoxicity?

**RAY PEAT:** The soft tumor is harder than that tissue is normally. The hard tumor is just at the stage beyond that.
**CONTEXT:** Do doctors differentiate between soft and hard tumors, and how does this relate to cell contraction?

**RAY PEAT:** The first thing I would do or that I do whenever I have a symptom like that is to put lots of sodium chloride, get it for ice cream freezers so you can put a couple of pounds in a bathtub and about a pound of baking soda and make a slightly hyperosmotic solution and soak in it for a while and that usually takes care of minor skin problems but some people make an application of baking soda and sodium chloride just as a soothing thing but it has much of the effect that a drug like triamcinolone or the glucocorticoids in general which doctors love because they they'll make everything feel better even if it's making you sick in the long run.
**CONTEXT:** What would you suggest for a rash that is red and bumpy, possibly with fibrosis, and is correlated with waking up between one and two AM?

**RAY PEAT:** The baking soda has that function because if the sodium holds the bicarbonate in solution so it doesn't bubble out of the warm water. But your body has such a high affinity for carbon dioxide that it will pull, even the bicarbonate will be pulled into your body against the gradient with the body is already pretty concentrated with CO2 but the bicarbonate will help to increase that and the warm water doesn't hold much gaseous carbon dioxide but it's a healing component in mineral water which is carbonated but it's a very low concentration compared to what you could get from the baking soda and a pure CO2 dry bath it is instantly starts raising your body's carbon dioxide with the anti-inflammatory effect. There's a good article published in a US I think Michigan State Medical Journal, 1905, on the uses of a carbon dioxide gas bath.
**CONTEXT:** Is a dry CO2 bath beneficial, and how does baking soda relate to CO2?

**RAY PEAT:** The main thing that causes that age-related interrupted sleep is that things like decreased thyroid function slow your digestive processes and as your blood sugar falls in darkness and when you're sleeping the falling blood sugar lets you experience a toxic reaction to whatever is in your intestine and the irritation, inflammation and absorption of endotoxin and surges of serotonin from the intestine those get into the bloodstream, finish off your stored glycogen and wake you up with a stress reaction and so trying to have the calmest, cleanest intestine possible at bedtime.
**CONTEXT:** What causes age-related interrupted sleep, and how can it be prevented?

**RAY PEAT:** Having a carrot salad or a good bowl of cooked mushrooms or some slightly antiseptic fiber like that in the early afternoon, and then having a fairly low-protein, high-carbohydrate supper right before bed, like ice cream or a chicken broth that's very salty. A combination of salt and sugar right at bedtime helps to relax the intestine for a longer period.
**CONTEXT:** What dietary choices can help prevent interrupted sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** The high niacin content of the brewer's yeast is a very effective thing for lowering the free fatty acids and the free fatty acids are the main things killing the beta cells and there are a couple of articles on glucose and diabetes on my website that describe the results of a couple doctors in the late 19th century and a high sugar diet but niacin and sugar are two things that hold down the liberation of the toxic or free fatty acids and anything you can do to interfere with those free fatty acids which are toxic to the pancreas will help it heal.
**CONTEXT:** Why does brewer's yeast work for diabetes, and how can one transition from it to getting off insulin?

**RAY PEAT:** If you're really thirsty, water is what you need. But if you're drinking milk and orange juice to get your calories and protein and calcium and so on, you usually don't need any plain water because the amount of water you're taking in to get those nutrients is usually on the order of a gallon or so.
**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on drinking water, and how much is needed?

**RAY PEAT:** The stress of darkness creates an inefficient catabolic state where you start breaking yourself down and this is mainly from cortisol again in order to generate glucose and that sleep to some extent reduces the stress. But that red light and exposure, a pre-bedtime exposure to red light can mitigate a lot of this.
**CONTEXT:** How does darkness affect cortisol production and the body's catabolic state, and can red light mitigate this?

**RAY PEAT:** The Chinese study found that it not only improved the depth of the sleep but it improved the athletic performance the next day after the good sleep following the red light treatment.
**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of red light exposure before sleep?

**RAY PEAT:** About 40 years ago, someone experimented with putting living tissue, for example, a seed was a very self-contained, easy to study material, they found that if it was exposed to ultraviolet light or sunlight and then you put it in an electron spin resonance machine or paramagnetic resonance device to measure free radicals or free electrons, that after the ultraviolet light exposure, it kept in the machine, it would show free radicals or free electrons for hours and hours without any new exposure. But if they, right after putting it in the machine, if they shined red light on it, it went quiet. The red light just knocked out the free radicals immediately. And experiments with gamma rays on frogs have showed the same thing. A dose of gamma rays that would kill the frogs if it was followed immediately by red light exposure it quenched the excited electrons and the frogs didn't die.
**CONTEXT:** How does red light interact with free radicals and excited electrons?

**RAY PEAT:** You know, when someone has their back to the sun, how red their ears look, or if you put a flashlight under your hand in the dark, you see the red light coming right through your hand. One night I let my eyes get adapted by sleeping until about four in the morning, and then put a red light behind my thigh and I could see my whole thigh illuminated a bright red color except the bone left a shadow like an x-ray.
**CONTEXT:** How deeply does red light penetrate the body?

**RAY PEAT:** As people get older they talk about people needing less sleep and I think this is a bit of a misnomer I don't think people need less sleep I think people need the same amount of sleep and when they don't get it they get less relaxation so they talk about the elderly and that their hearts failing and the muscle being another typical muscle I mean although cardiac and skeletal muscle do have physiological differences they're still muscles and when the cardiac muscle can't relax just like a skeletal muscle can't relax when it's over excited and the thyroid hormone is not adequate enough to allow relaxation fully they basically get these heart failure type pictures scenarios coming on as part of their old age and it's not at all related to their old age is because they just don't have enough relaxation going on.
**CONTEXT:** Why do elderly people often experience sleep disturbances and heart failure, and how is it related to relaxation?

**RAY PEAT:** The heart doesn't beat strongly because it doesn't relax fully. The diastolic relaxation just isn't there as the energy production decreases and the same thing with the brain the relaxation. It is impaired the same way as the heart relaxation.
**CONTEXT:** How does the inability to relax in the elderly relate to their cardiac cycle and brain function?

**RAY PEAT:** The sunlight is the middle of the sun spectrum is yellow. The middle of an incandescent light bulb spectrum is orange. And you get the full red light benefit either from sunlight or incandescent light bulbs. You don't have to get rid of it except for convenience. You don't want a brilliant, shiny room around you if you're trying to relax. And so the dim quality of bright red light, it isn't necessarily any brighter than 200-watt incandescent bulb would be, but you don't need the blue and green part of the spectrum for the therapeutic effect.
**CONTEXT:** What is the difference between sunlight, incandescent bulbs, and specific red light bulbs, and what is the therapeutic benefit of red light?

**RAY PEAT:** During the daytime I have a 250-watt reflector bulb called an infrared bulb, and that's what it looks like. It's an ordinary white light, but it runs at a lower temperature than a standard bright incandescent bulb, so it's heavier on the red part of the spectrum.
**CONTEXT:** What type of bulb do you use for daytime red light exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** People have experimented with pigeons, despite their feathers. They can see the systemic effect coming through their body because the red light penetrates pretty much anything living material.
**CONTEXT:** Does red light penetrate through feathers or other materials?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1980s when I first experimented with it a lot of younger people wanted to try it and good healthy people in their 30s and early 40s felt nothing they could take a spoonful and have absolutely no noticeable effect but when someone was in their late 40s or early 50s and feeling hopeless and depressed even a pinch of it 15 or 20 milligrams in 15 minutes their faces would light up and they would grin and Get ambitious projects are going again decide not to quit her her job So when you need it, it's a very vivid effect even with a small amount.
**CONTEXT:** How does one determine if they need pregnenolone, and what are the effects of taking it?

**RAY PEAT:** The CO2 and the ATP are the things that hold good water in the cells while squeezing out unwanted, improper water. Pregnenolone, progesterone, ATP and CO2 all have that effect on the cytoplasm in particular to keep it from taking on disorganized water but making it hang on to the water that's running its metabolism. So I think old people will take up a lot of cellular metabolic water that increases their metabolic rate when they repair their mitochondria. Reduce stress hormones.
**CONTEXT:** How do CO2, ATP, pregnenolone, and progesterone affect water balance in cells, particularly in older individuals?

**RAY PEAT:** A healthy kid's cell that contains lots of water is metabolizing intensely, keeping its CO2 up and its lactic acid down. And the water is part of letting the cell run at a high rate. And you can restore some of that metabolic active water with those things such as progesterone, pregnenolone, thyroid, and carbon dioxide.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of water in a healthy cell's metabolism, and how can it be restored?

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think there's a definite ratio because as your thyroid function increases, you're able to use lots of Vitamin A in making pregnenolone and progesterone. It's coordinated with thyroid hormone and cholesterol to convert cholesterol into the good hormones and if your thyroid is low then too much vitamin A interferes and lowers the thyroid function.
**CONTEXT:** What is the optimal ratio and dosage of Vitamins A, D, and K, particularly as one ages?

**RAY PEAT:** Cholesterol rises with age because things like low thyroid function and low vitamin A availability interfere with the production of pregnenolone and progesterone and so your body compensates by increasing the cholesterol and the cholesterol increase can cause your tissue production of pregnenolone and progesterone to increase and it's true to the limit of the cell's capability governed by vitamin A and thyroid.
**CONTEXT:** Why does cholesterol rise with age, and how does it relate to pregnenolone and progesterone production?
