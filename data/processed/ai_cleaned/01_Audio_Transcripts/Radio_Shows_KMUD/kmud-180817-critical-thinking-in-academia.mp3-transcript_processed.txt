**RAY PEAT:** My biology study was, academically at least, was at the University of Oregon, 1968 to 72, biology and biochemistry, especially reproductive physiology. Since then, I've been just continuing to study, primarily, with interest in nerve biology, reproductive physiology, and especially aging and how it relates to energy production.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, would you mind giving people an update on your previous history, your academic and research background?

**RAY PEAT:** Long before I went to the university, I had been interested in many biological fields, especially radiation poisoning from the various sources, especially atomic bomb testing in the atmosphere, and as I got interested in the late 40s and all through the 50s in reading about what was available before the atomic bomb took over the field, and then after the government and its atomic energy commission began controlling the publication, I saw that anyone, basically, after some time in the 1950s, anyone who was working in biology or radiation physics, who told the truth, had a big campaign organized against the person. One of the first researchers who studied the harmful effects of radiation and got it into the media, found that X-raying pregnant women caused the fetus to be genetically injured in a way that increased the rate of cancer in children. It took about ten years for that to be somewhat recognized and spread, decreased the radiation exposure of pregnant women, but the government was essentially censoring everything that was published and ruining the careers of all of the researchers who spoke out against the dangers of radiation. My main concern with an apparently very bright and confident biologist and physicist who was speaking the government line was John Goffman. I considered him the ultimate in corrupt mouthpiece for the government all through the 50s and in the 60s. Suddenly he described the event he said he was talking to a group speaking to the government line saying that we can't intervene to stop the bomb tests and exposing the public because we don't know yet whether these radiation exposures will cause serious or lethal mutations that might even kill the whole population from cancer at some point. He said as he was speaking he realized that he was saying insane things but he had been saying them for 15-20 years at that point. But suddenly when that dawned on him that he was saying criminal insane things he suddenly switched sides and began honest investigation of the effects of radiation on the organism. Immediately his research money was cut off. He was fired and went into private publicizing of the problems for the rest of his life. He did very good work exposing the richness all the way back to the radiation exposure to the atomic bomb survivors in Japan. The figures on that were completely falsified right down to recent years, the fake data has been put into the journals prominently. And one of the ways that they operate is, for example, the radiation health journals that supposedly are scientists watching out for the public safety, exposing them to medical x-rays, or nuclear power plant leakage exposure and so on. These journals, all of them that I have known of, were basically owned by the nuclear industry. The public health organizations that are concerned with protecting the public, these are agencies of the industry, government, nuclear industry work together to control the publication of safety information. When I was in graduate school, our lab working on reproductive physiology, the director decided we should have a course in radiation safety in case someone was going to work on isotope studies. So we went, the whole lab went over to Oregon State University where they had a full-time radiation safety expert and he and his graduate students did presentations on what we should know about radiation dangers and safety. And I have never seen a university operate at such a low level as that radiation lab did at the State University. It's considered the, it's a land-grant university and the biology department is heavily influenced by agriculture, chemistry, herbicides, insecticides and so on, but apparently the nuclear industry got to them too.

**CONTEXT:** So maybe he wasn't being so safe with it, making it out to be a fairly harmless substance perhaps that you shouldn't all worry about too much.

**RAY PEAT:** Basically, yeah, I've taken the line that there's a threshold below which it's totally safe or even beneficial.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, so I wanted to question you specifically about several points of this, of which I understand you do have personal experience. I think that the perhaps not the donor interest side of it because you've not been a donor or received donor funding perhaps. Freedom. You might mention that freedom to do research is restricted by many and the same forces that shape publication. I think people need to hear this in terms of the mechanisms by which supposedly quote-unquote respected peer-reviewed journal publications or prestigious publications at the New England Journal of Medicine or yeah, you know, some of the other publications that people will be fairly familiar with. How these publications come into being and the funding that is so lucrative and so seducing for both the editors and other people in charge of the publications, how is this freedom to do the research actually shapes the publication itself because of the ownership of the publication?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the same thing, the same companies control funding. Even though it might be coming from the government and taxpayers, the culture is set by the industry and the government operating in the NIH, for example, are conforming to the beliefs that are favorable to the industry. Gilbert Ling happened to have a one person in the funding oversight branch of the NIH. His whole career depended on one person thinking that objective research should continue in the area he was working on. But when that person retired, his funding was cut off. Same thing happened to the virus researcher, I can't think of his name right now. He was very famous as working in the retrovirus field when he suggested that the HIV AIDS so-called virus might not be harmful at all. His research money was totally cut off and he was ostracized. Even in something as safe-seeming as astronomy, a famous astronomer named Halton Arp was doing various studies of galaxies and he happened to photograph some galaxies that were obviously continuous. There was a band of matter between separate galaxies that was there were no breaks in the line but one galaxy showed a very different redshift from the other galaxy and you can't have a single object connected by a band of matter, one end of it going at a vast speed away from the other one. He found several of those connected galaxies with very different redshifts, which essentially proved that the idea that the redshift indicates acceleration away from the viewer, that concept must be wrong, because single objects had different redshifts. So they cut off his access to the telescopes so that he couldn't ever use them again. He had to leave the country if he wanted to use a telescope again.

**CONTEXT:** He also mentioned things like these wars, quote unquote, on various lucrative diseases, like he mentioned the war. We've heard about the war on terror and how that's been a complete failure and the war on cancer, another complete failure. So these are basically brought to the front as a battle cry for funding, being a war, but they never objectively result in too much success. I can think of a number of conditions or diseases for which there's been a long time of potential time to find a cure but which nothing really has been found in which there is still seemingly endless supply of funding to promote research into its discovery, into the cure. And the people who want to wage those wars and convince the government to fund them in working in particular theories of how diseases work, whether it's heart disease and atherosclerosis, dementia or cancer, kidney disease, whatever major field they're working in, it always happens that the researchers love the line of research that happens to enrich the drug companies. We're always aiming at some solution that involves a drug that can sustain patients. Definitely, they don't want to cure the patients at a low price. They want to develop drugs to keep the customers buying. And then also the other quote here for what I know you've said is completely erroneous science. And again, I'm going to want to bring out a little later on that the information's been there and was being followed six or seven decades ago, but was buried. When corporations began to exert their financial clout, you mentioned the tumor-specific chemotherapy, the kind of tailored, tailor-made, personalized tumor-specific chemotherapy for particular cancers and how you said that's completely ridiculous. Think of it mechanistically like that because it just does not make any scientific sense. The traditional approach to medicine, way back to the Greek, they were looking for general principles that would go wrong and be correctable. Their approaches, diet or exercise or herbs or particular drugs, these were designed to adjust the person's constitution and make their physiology go in a healthy direction rather than a sick direction. That is still scientifically valid. It's really the only practical solution to all of these major degenerative chronic diseases. Figuring out what it is as a general problem that causes basically everyone to go down one or more of these degenerative pathways. But although it's the primary scientific problem in biology, that is constantly being attacked as unscientific. What they want is a mechanism that potentially leads to a drug, a specific drug for a specific mechanism and preferably it will be so variable and unpredictable that it will require a great diagnostic effort, more drugs involved to diagnose the particular brand of cancer or heart disease or dementia that the person has and then a particular individually designed treatment for that where if you're actually working on the idea that the organism is intrinsically whole and healthy and that certain things are diverting it from the pathway of good health. That is where biological generality should be the basis of scientific thinking. But that competes and so it's considered pre-scientific or unscientific if you try to look at the organism as a whole and something that can be supported to make it either not get the disease or spontaneously recover from the disease.

**RAY PEAT:** First two problems with products of the pancreatic enzymes are very much like our own enzymes and can be very effective for someone who is deficient in enzymes. Stress and aging often slow down the digestive process and so they can benefit from using pancreatic enzymes, however they're made from raw animal tissue, you can't get the enzymes out without sterilizing it. If you sterilize it, the enzymes are inactivated so you take the risk of whatever infection the animal had and there are a couple of plant enzymes papain and bromelain which I think are pretty safe but they only digest proteins and the non-animal enzymes that digest fats and carbohydrates happen to come from a fungus. There's the risk of allergens from the fungus with those enzymes, so I think the best approach is to keep your energy and nutrition up so that your own stomach and pancreas and intestine and liver produce the proper enzymes for digesting. And that you consider the chemistry of the plant. Some of the enzymes, if you chew it raw, a vegetable, for example, or a seed or sprout, for example, these enzymes that are released are, in many cases, their function is as a defensive enzyme for the plant. The plant doesn't want to be chewed up, and it can release toxins, for example. If you chew up raw bean sprouts or alfalfa sprouts, you can get a big burst of toxins. I think someone calculated that it was something like three ounces of alfalfa sprouts would release a lethal dose of cyanide if you chewed them up.

**CONTEXT:** So I guess I was thinking based on studying previously that you're talking about cooked vegetables being okay. So if I have root vegetables or different leaves and you cook the daylights out of them, you know, for 40 minutes and they're really soft, then they become a good food, right? So the issue that you're talking about I assume goes away completely and plus the pufa is taken out so that it has nutritional value, am I right?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you can get, if you process vegetables properly, you can get very good nutrition out of them. But the cows and goats, ruminants, are designed to do that for us. And so milk and cheese are basically detoxified plant nutrition. And to do that industrially, it's very possible and there are people working on it. But to get all of the PUFA out is one problem. To get the right ratio of nutrients is another problem of you know leaves for example have a very good content of calcium and magnesium and other nutrients so cows can subsist on a leaf based diet because they have enzymes to detoxify the PUFA but other parts of the plant have a bad ratio of phosphate to calcium and magnesium. And so you have to look at the ratio of type of fat and type of mineral. You don't want too much iron or too much phosphate or too much unsaturated fat. Those are pro-stress, pro-aging chemicals.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. P, what do you think about the, as we're talking about digestion and this caller's wondering what can be done. In terms of the herbal pharmacopoeia. Using herbs like dandelion root as a cholagogue as a liver stimulant to support bile production to emulsify fats and the bitter compounds in plants like gentian and absinthe for stimulating hydrochloric acid production as well as pepsin and other things in the stomach.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's an extremely valuable use of herbal remedies to stimulate gentian. Yeah, gentian, the greater gentian, but there's also the lesser gentian depending on how the greater gentian probably has a stronger effect. But yeah, there's lots of different herbal bitters. I mean some are called hot bitters, some are aromatic bitters and some are pure bitters. So things like absinthe even which is that wormwood which is put in drinks now is not banned anymore, it's legal. Essentially it was a bitter to support stomach acid production. Anyway, you would stimulate HCL and pepsin production in the body because you could take that plus the pep and bromelain and maybe those are the best you can do and then you just have to keep your energy up. And the aroma of food is extremely important. If you don't enjoy your food or if you're anxious while you're eating it, you will mess up your digestion.

**CONTEXT:** And keeping the stress down too, correct?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**RAY PEAT:** It's possible if you're under stress, for example, cortisol and adrenaline can shift the metabolism of T4 into reverse T3, but I would check your general nutrition, make sure you're having seafood about once a week because selenium is the most crucial nutrient for making sure you're converting T4 as needed, your brain and kidneys and skin, every tissue has the equipment for converting T4 to T3, but it needs selenium to do that. And then mushrooms are a good source of selenium.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, have you heard anything about monk fruit sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, I read about it. I don't remember exactly what it is, though.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. P, I was going to say, again, you've explained the things like donor interests and how the wars on various lucrative diseases have failed us and how the whole personalized tumor-specific chemotherapy is such a failure. I was going to ask you here that the whole, how it all happens, you know, how does science come to the mainstream? We know it's all about advertising, we know it's all about generating revenue and we know all about powerful interests that are certainly not going to do themselves a disservice by producing or printing damning trials that show no benefit or no potential harm and then the entire Hippocratic Oath, which most doctors, or every doctor should take, and most doctors which should thoroughly believe in, first, do no harm, should certainly be first and foremost in their minds. But obviously most doctors that are practicing want to help people, but don't have the time to look into the science behind the things that they're prescribing. And as the medical schools are indoctrinated by drug reps and the money that comes from supporting these drugs in terms of private sponsorships or gifts, quote-unquote, to various professors in medical schools, for example, all of this becomes very easily corrupted. And I wanted to mention the open access movement as being a alternative to this donor-funded publication machine, which I think produces so much negative press, really, in terms of when it's uncovered from drugs that were supposedly designed to help people. Let me just ask first, I think I saw the lights flashing a couple of times. I don't know if there are anybody else waiting for us. Engineer, do we have any callers? Does the engineer hear me okay? The engineer is looking down into space as though he can't hear anything. Anyway, Dr. P, um, the open access movement, do you do you know much about that and do you think it's a valid institution because I did find an article by Jeffrey Biel writing in the American Association of University Professors stating that the advocates of open access tell only one side of the story, ignoring the exploitative practices and poor quality of many open access journals. What do you have much feedback or or much to say about open access?

**RAY PEAT:** He, Jeffrey Biel made some good points about the possible corruption of the open access by simply turning it into sort of a personal advertising thing for researchers who aren't doing anything of special value but want to go on record as having publications for the university, for example, and so they pay a publisher to publish something even though it's junk. So you open access, it has its faults. It can be just an expansion of the advertising industry but even advertising it isn't required that advertisers lie about their product. Sometimes they might tell the truth and so open access is susceptible to being used as personal advertising but if you read critically, you can often find very good stuff in it. The Public Library of Science so far has had a really good record of getting novel information out to the public that would have been censored by the regular old-fashioned journals that are owned or controlled by the industry.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, do you know of any benefits of living in a high-rise, living on the top floor of some multi-story high-rise?

**RAY PEAT:** One advantage is that the stuff over your head reacts with cosmic rays. The researchers used half an inch of lead as a roof, put it over rabbit cages. And those rabbits very quickly miscarried, were infertile, and developed degenerative diseases. And they found that it was the tertiary cosmic rays caused by the high probability of a cosmic ray causing a nuclear reaction in the layer of lead. Because they were slowed down enough to stop within them or not pass right through them? One cosmic ray would produce a shower of intense secondary and tertiary radiation which increased the toxicity the lower you are. So the nuclear industry talks about the danger of radiation flying across the country in an airplane. But actually, the higher you are, the less toxic the radiation is because the dense atmosphere at low altitude produces more secondary and tertiary cosmic rays, similar to having the half inch of lead over your head. So when you're on the bottom floor of a big building, you're going to have a lot more of the tertiary toxic cosmic rays and less of the high altitude radiation, high energy cosmic rays that go right through you without doing any harm.

**CONTEXT:** I had a skin rash. I talked to Dr. Pete about I think last call and he said sodium chloride bath which I've done with kosher salt and also the dry CO2. It's gone away but it's actually keeps coming back and I was just wondering if there's anything else because it sounds like it might be digestion or endotoxin related and I was just wondering other things that might be useful. I did take acidophilus, cassia, and rhamnosus in a 100 milliliter bottle with 50 billion units in the bottle but I'm just wondering, you know, am I on the right track? What is it incrementally that I could do if I sort of comply with your regular diet recommendations?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin D and thyroid are the most important things I know of for skin problems.

**CONTEXT:** And would you have to take A and D together, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Not necessarily. You don't want to overdo the vitamin A but the vitamin D works both on the intestine to control the endotoxin and the skin reaction. It's there's no serious interaction between vitamin D and vitamin A but they're both important for the skin.
