**RAY PEAT:** The authoritarian aspect of medicine peaked when this idea of evidence-based medicine based on these big multi-million dollar, multi-year studies became at least a nominal standard. Most of what doctors do has nothing to do with that, but it's a way of enforcing certain practices and kicking out of medicine the doctors who don't want to conform to those big practices. And it has to be either the giant industry or the government working with those industries to fund these huge multi-institutional, multi-year research projects. And many of these major studies, for example in AIDS drugs, the corruption has been documented. Some of the institutions participating simply put in funny information to support the sale of the drugs they wanted to sell. And this is the collusion, and this is between such things as the government and their ability to silence opposition and the corporations that have the financial wherewithal to pull this off?
**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the influence of corporate interests and government on medical research and practices, and asks Dr. Peat about this collusion.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the... In many ways, the institutions have controlled the governments and the universities, and there's a long tradition of that. At one time, the land-grant colleges were a way of letting science help the farmers, and the county extension agents and the Department of Agriculture and such......for a time actually put out useful information to the public, but they were soon taken over by the industries, and now, for example, over at Oregon State University, which was land-grant university, the insecticide and herbicide companies, and the radiation industry, really set the tone for what they're doing over there.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on how institutions, including universities, become influenced by industries.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it must have been the serotonin increase produced by the first generation and so we've got a new way to increase the serotonin and actually a study of one of these SSRIs so-called that they were going to try to treat vicious dogs by increasing their serotonin supposedly which was the serenity and peacefulness and bliss transmitter but they found that the aggressive vicious dogs actually had high serotonin and when they gave it the SSRI its serotonin went down as it became a pleasant dog and so something which has been sold to millions of people to increase their serotonin It actually sometimes does have good effects, but they're most likely by lowering the serotonin.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the mechanism of SSRIs and their prescribed purpose, and Dr. Peat explains a study that suggests their effectiveness might be due to lowering serotonin, contrary to their intended mechanism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's known to cause blood clotting spasms of of coronary arteries other arteries Inflammation, the lightest horrible thing is that it's a major factor in osteoporosis just the excess serotonin produced by an inflamed intestine creates osteoporosis but that's one of the side effects of drugs that increase it.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions Dr. Peat's advocacy for blocking serotonin exposure and asks for his view on serotonin's negative effects.

**RAY PEAT:** The intestine was a central part of... medical understanding of the body, right at the core of how the body works. But then, with the beginning of organized so-called scientific medicine, there was a campaign to wean doctors away from the use of laxatives and enemas, claiming that... Seen as too primitive, huh? Yeah, and they taught doctors that they were dangerous, addictive... All kinds of ways to incriminate and just move doctors into more mechanical treatment. But in fact, if you start up in the middle 19th century to the more recent endotoxin studies starting 20 or 30 years ago, you see that they were on the right track. In the 19th century and now it's turning out that endotoxin, serotonin, histamine are major things in everything that goes wrong in the organism.
**CONTEXT:** The host discusses the historical understanding of the gut and its connection to health, and Dr. Peat explains how this understanding was suppressed by modern medicine.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, definitely the out the whole endotoxin issue surrounding Poor gut motility is responsible for inflammation and that inflammation is picked up in the intestine and actually causes a like a reflex reflex action. for migraine, triggering migraines in terms of vasoconstriction.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the connection between migraines and the gut, and Dr. Peat explains the role of endotoxin and inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** When your blood sugar is low, your intestine is very touchy and has exaggerated reflexes so that stretching it or bulging it with gas or with constipation or chemical. Inflammation from the endotoxin and other chemicals produced by the bacteria, any of those irritations is exaggerated when your blood sugar is low. And a good diet, making sure your thyroid function is good to stabilize your blood sugar can greatly reduce the incidence of migraines because your intestine loses that hypersensitivity when your blood sugar is good.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on migraines in relation to serotonin and endotoxin, and Dr. Peat explains the role of blood sugar and thyroid function in gut sensitivity and migraine triggers.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's like I mentioned, the FDA is making a statement about this, a public statement in 2007.
**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the correlation between antidepressants and violence, referencing a previous statement by the FDA.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, generally people with a Poor judgment and bad information are in control, you know.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat for his opinion on who is at the top of the pyramid of world power.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's almost like... You tell the biggest lie and you have the greatest chance of getting away from it, or rather be the most blatant. And people, I think, unfortunately, are just in a state at this point in time where they just don't really want to hear too much more because it's just too shocking. And so when they freely tell you that these things cause cancer or they cause, you know, heart attack or stroke or increased risk of death, I think, unfortunately, most people are not really... serious enough about being critically thinking about it.
**CONTEXT:** The host expresses shock at the blatant advertising of drugs with known cancer risks and asks for Dr. Peat's thoughts on public reaction.

**RAY PEAT:** Nutritional yeast does have a good range of the B vitamins. The drawbacks......besides the small amount of estrogen is the indigestible starch and the high phosphate content. So if you use it for a supplement, using it for several days is okay, but you don't want to use it as a major part of your diet because of that high phosphate content unless you take measures to balance it with calcium.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about nutritional yeast as a source of B vitamins, and Dr. Peat discusses its pros and cons.

**RAY PEAT:** I stopped using oral vitamins in the 1970s because I had some extreme allergic reactions to vitamin B2 and folic acid, which being yellow-colored, they're absorbers of even visible light, causing the chemical reactions to happen. And that means that before you get them... into your mouth, they're likely to have been exposed to oxygen and radiation that has activated free radical processes, making them a pretty bad risk for allergy.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the quality of vitamins and Dr. Peat explains his reasons for avoiding oral vitamin supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, bioavailable. In fact, the magnesium supplements very often cause migraines and asthma symptoms because of probably some contaminant in them, but in your stomach, the stomach acid generally will turn much of the supplement, such as magnesium carbonate, into magnesium chloride, which is instantly absorbed.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the bioavailability of magnesium and calcium carbonate and whether the body treats less bioavailable forms as toxins.

**RAY PEAT:** Big doses of vitamin K often cure it in just a week or two, but getting enough calcium in your diet, especially in relation to phosphate... Calcium and vitamin D are extremely important, and then if you can't do it with good nutrition, then of all the medical approaches that I know of, the angiotensin blockers and the ACE inhibitors are the safest medical approaches that I know of.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's approach to high blood pressure and his opinion on lisinopril.

**RAY PEAT:** I know people who lowered their chronically extremely high blood pressure over 200, over 100. Lowered their pressure within a week or two down to the normal range by taking 30 to 50 milligrams a day and then stopping.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a specific dosage recommendation for vitamin K in managing high blood pressure.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, no, it's generally a liquid, but I know you can get a pill. Oh, it's a liquid, okay. The liquid form is what I use, but there are obviously tabulated versions of it, but Thorn Research does a good one milligram per drop. Actually, now I think that's actually 10 milligram per drop, but they do a liquid vitamin K2, which is a supplement that I would recommend most people go find.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the form of vitamin K supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it's generated by your gut, but your gut flora generally produce vitamin K.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if vitamin K can be obtained from food.

**RAY PEAT:** You want about 4000 to 6000, 8000 IU. It's very different from person to person if you get your blood drawn and I think the reference range is above 30 nanograms per milliliter or nanograms per deciliter. Somewhere in the range of 50 is probably better. I think the upper limit is 70 or 75. And I find people that take 2,000 or 4,000 a day, sometimes they have very low vitamin D labs and some people that can take 8,000 or 10,000 or 12,000, they still have normal vitamin D, so it's quite important to get your vitamin D tested. It's not an expensive lab, but it'll give you a good idea of where it is and then you can get retested in a month or two months and see where you are.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for a recommended dosage of vitamin D.

**RAY PEAT:** The right kind of thyroid supplement often lowers the blood pressure. You want to keep your TSH fairly low at the low end of the normal range because TSH itself is responsible for increasing blood pressure.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions taking thyroid medicine and asks for Dr. Peat's opinion on its effect on blood pressure.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, try natural alternatives first and see how they work for you. That's my advice, but, and then hopefully you're supporting K-MUD financially.
**CONTEXT:** The host expresses nervousness about taking lisinopril, and Dr. Peat advises trying natural alternatives first.

**RAY PEAT:** So all you have to do is look at serotonin. Look at the negative effects of serotonin and get over the fact that they're painting it in this blissful peaceful hormone type light because that's not the way serotonin is but that's just misinformation again, you see. So have to be very careful where you get your information from and see who's selling it because you sometimes find there's a very biased approach that they're taking.
**CONTEXT:** The host is wrapping up the discussion on SSRIs and asks for Dr. Peat's final thoughts on serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** That they synergize with radiation and stress, that estrogen is sort of an ultimate stress-related hormone like histamine and serotonin, and they have their place in tissue renewal, but that place should be limited. to a few hours following any trauma or tissue injury.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for Dr. Peat's quick take on estrogens, referencing their link to cancers and inflammatory processes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the same thing. When any tissue is injured, it helps to activate the cell renewal process, but if that continues, then the cell renewal turns into a tumor. Right, and there's lots of estrogen-dependent or estrogen-promoted tumors.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions estrogen's role in implantation and asks about its function in tissue renewal and potential for tumor formation.

**RAY PEAT:** It's very hard to do though and so it takes a lot of trial and error... yogurt works for lots of people but sometimes it takes... other bacteria my experience is that the antibiotic substances produced by... bacillus subtilis and the cainiformis the cainiformis i think it is or lichen licheniformis i guess but anyway the the bacteria that produce antibiotic substances are very helpful and the bacteriophage virus that kills specific bacteria including some of them kill E. coli and some of the others that can be toxic.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about probiotics and their effectiveness in building the right bacteria, referencing Mechnikov.

**RAY PEAT:** Are these bacteriophages are available are they yeah a few of them are available in a life extension foundation for example but there are other companies making a bigger variety of them now available but most of the work for the last 70 years has been in Eastern Europe and it's just now catching on in the US.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if bacteriophages are available.

**RAY PEAT:** They are at least good nutrition and some of them do have some active agents like adrenal cortex contains a fair amount of pregnenolone.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about glandulars.

**RAY PEAT:** Very good. They're poorly absorbed and you do absorb this very helpful.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about vitamin E and CoQ10 as a topical treatment.
