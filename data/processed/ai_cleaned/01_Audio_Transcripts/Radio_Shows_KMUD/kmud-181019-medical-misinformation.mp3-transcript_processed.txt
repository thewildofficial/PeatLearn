**RAY PEAT:** I was in the 50s. I was mostly studying humanities in the 60s I got involved in experimental education and then in 1968 to 72 I did graduate school in biology for a Ph.D. in physiology.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, can you tell people about your background and what you've spent your last four decades doing?

**RAY PEAT:** Over the years I spent a lot of time in the university science library and in all those years there were only... two professors that I saw repeatedly in the library looking things up out of several dozen.

**CONTEXT:** You were there a lot, and they weren't. It was rare to see.

**RAY PEAT:** The industry has promoted the idea that the only valid science to support a medical approach is the... randomized, blinded study in humans, but that requires a huge amount of financing. Normally the drug companies want to put that much money into that sort of thing. The average, typical scientist actually looking for things to explain how the organism works. That would be......do their experiments on animals at a moderate expense, maybe several thousand dollars rather than dozens of millions of dollars. And so the drug companies say that animal research isn't valid for basing medical decisions except when they don't have any valid... Human information, the drug companies will base everything on animal studies, for example, with estrogen. They first tested estrogen on dogs and found they killed them in various ways, so they shifted to rats. And the whole science of preventing osteoporosis by using estrogen, for example, is based on rats because... they gave the right kind of result where dogs gave the opposite result. So by selecting their animal experiments, they can gather up information to support selling their product. But if it's anything critical of their product, then it can't be accepted. It has to be these huge, double-blinded, controlled human trials.

**CONTEXT:** When you look at the papers that supply the evidence base for drug use, sometimes there are glaring mistakes or the inferences are not significant.

**RAY PEAT:** For example, last month when we were talking about this, I don't know if I got to the article which was published in the 40s about the effects of ciproheptadiene as an anti-serotonin agent and antihistamine on cutaneous allergy and so we have I mentioned the things like the SSRIs the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which would block the uptake of serotonin making it more available more prevalent but yet here in the 40s and 50s there was clear evidence that they were using anti-serotonin drugs to benefit people and how that just gets twisted when there's a mode and a way of manufacturing and spinning a product and putting it out to millions and millions of people at great profit.

**RAY PEAT:** In my recent newsletter on cholesterol I mentioned that for decades it's been known that if you lower cholesterol you... you create depression, suicidal tendency, cognitive impairment, all kinds of physical ailments that are demonstrably damaging cell structure, leading to these disease increases. Just a couple of months ago a new trial was started to supposedly treat atherosclerosis and heart disease by removing cholesterol from the arteries using exactly the chemical, the cyclodextrin that for decades has been shown to damage the organism and the specific cells by removing. Cholesterol from them so for example one trial years ago found that just a short exposure to the cyclodextrin removed first it removed cholesterol from the fibers of the hearing apparatus and the cochlear hair cells causing deafness in the people and animal studies made it clear that these things are very dangerous, damaging brain cells, muscle cells, hearing apparatus and so on but the trial is going ahead on the really sort of crazy idea that taking cholesterol out of the blood vessels is going to improve the health and prevent heart disease.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that cholesterol introduces fluidity and flexibility into a molecule, and that when cells become rigid they rupture. You also mentioned that low cholesterol has been positively correlated with dementia and negative neurodegenerative effects. What do you say about the flexibility that's conferred to cells with adequate cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** The best known model of that kind of flexibility is the red blood cell which has to fold up to go through the capillaries which are narrower than the diameter of the cell so if they are stiffened by removal of cholesterol they just won't go through the capillaries and when they are put under pressure, they tend to disintegrate because of the brittleness. But that same stiffness has been identified in essentially every type of cell. It just happens the red blood cell is a very convenient one to look at and measure the stiffness. But that lubricating quality of cholesterol is something that really the... The foundation of what it means goes back 90 or 100 years to the work of Bungenberg de Jong, a Dutch chemist who studied emulsions and he called the complex emulsion a coacervate or a complex coacervate, meaning a clustering together of different phases of different types of molecule. For example, a starch and a protein don't just mix, they find stability containing different proportions of the two polymers and different proportions of water. So you get several phases with just those three substances and those phases become stable. And each phase has its way of relating to small molecules so that they will segregate ions, sodium and potassium, and other molecules, sugar and urea and so on, in very complex ways. That led to many people followed up with the implication for what it means for the cell having these different types of polymers, nucleic acid. Starches, proteins, complex fats, interacting in the system, and Gilbert Ling, for example, was working directly out of Ungernberg de Jong's basic research on the physics of solutions. And it's in this context of the actual......physical approach to biology, the current work on how cholesterol relates to the various health problems. The cholesterol has a lubricating, limbering effect on these coacervate complex......mixtures of polymers and small molecules, the cholesterol, the people who ignore that physical basis of biology talk about cholesterol as existing in cell membranes, but every protein in the cell is associated in particular ways with cholesterol. The cytoskeleton......the structure that creates cell division, the matrix that regulates and holds the DNA in the proper arrangement, preventing certain regions of the DNA from replicating, allowing other parts to be reproduced so that the cell can express... only those proteins and RNA. All of this involves intimate lubricating or relaxing effect of cholesterol on these large polymer molecules. The people who talk about cholesterol as simply a membrane substance. Some of them say that 97% of the cholesterol in the cell is in the cytoplasmic membrane. But that would ignore 97% of its real functions which are to control the entire physiology of the cell. So that explains... how these studies can be, they can seem to be sane if they ignore the actual science behind what a cell is doing.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned that cholesterol is a positive indicator of longevity, and that over the age of 50, a cholesterol level around 250 is more protective.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, 250 is more protective for you.

**CONTEXT:** You've also discussed nitric oxide, and its role in Viagra and other medical applications. You mentioned that in the early 20th century, nitric oxide was known as a toxic component of smog and was found to kill cells or impair energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** Several gases were known and studied for their toxic effects. Cyanide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and nitric oxide were in various ways found to kill cells or impair their energy production blocking respiration. And these... have, over the years, been found to be produced inside the body. And some people say that if the body produces them, they must be beneficial. But until about 1980, when nitric oxide was shown to be produced in the body, it was mostly known as the toxic component of smog. But... As it came to be studied through the 80s, several people were showing that that toxic effect contributes to diseases such as diabetes by knocking out oxidative energy production. But in the late 80s, someone noticed that estrogen acts by way of increasing nitric oxide. For example, when uterus......is exposed to either estrogen or nitric oxide, it swells up, takes on water, and goes through its oxygen-resisting type of metabolism. And that sort of thing happens everywhere under the influence of estrogen. And so the estrogen industry has created a great myth about the benefit... of estrogen, and so the nitric oxide people attached themselves to the estrogen-nitric oxide interactions. And then the Viagra came on the market. It was shown to intensify the effects of the endogenous nitric oxide. And that, combined with the estrogen myth......created a great surge of positive thinking about nitric oxide and suppressed all of those ten years of research showing that it contributed to various diseases. Brain damage, heart damage, vascular damage, and so on. And all of that was reversed, and then for the next ten years... 20 years, it has been highly promoted as a wonder substance that, for example, women with pulmonary arterial hypertension, impairing their circulation, creating heart stress. The blood vessels were failing to open and so they said the nitric oxide opens blood vessels, let's have them breathe nitric oxide. But one of the functions of interfering with oxidative metabolism is that causes cells to turn on collagen production. And breathing nitric oxide creates fibrosis of the lungs. And I've known people, older women, who were being given Viagra because of that mystique of nitric oxide in the lungs. The whole history of nitric oxide and its toxicity was reversed to the extent that in the 80s, people started saying smog. It's good for you. In Mexico City, they found that kids who went to the beach at low altitude and got away from the smog, that they developed asthma. They said that's because nitric oxide from the smog is curing their asthma when they're at home breathing it in the city. There really is no limit to the type of advertising phony science that they all do.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that nitric oxide, estrogen, and increased DNA methylation are conjoined and can be heritable.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah for example it shuts down your energy producing systems and that shuts down your expensive organs and tissues such as brain and so you can turn off the best functions of the organism not only in the individual but pass it on to the next generations.

**CONTEXT:** You also said that nitric oxide shuts down the beneficial oxidative metabolism of glucose.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and in the heart when the parasympathetic system which is activated to an extreme in shock, that slows down your heart and the parasympathetic acetylcholine stimulation activates nitric oxide production and that reduces the heart's... ability to use oxygen, so it's in effect creating a hibernation state. Animals in the fall increase their production of nitric oxide if they're going to go into the hibernating state, but in the heart, the stress and shock reaction can shut down the energy production and need... For oxygen, within limits it has its benefit because if you can't use oxygen, you don't suffer in the same way from oxygen deprivation. But what happens is that the function of the heart is restricted by that reduced ability to use oxygen. The heart becomes unable to relax, relaxation. is a high energy function. If you turn off energy availability, contractile cells such as the heart or other muscles won't be able to relax. In the heart that will raise the diastolic pressure. Usually the whole circulatory system fails to relax in between beats. Not relaxed fully, then it can't beat fully, so it creates a progressive tendency to heart failure.

**CONTEXT:** You've pointed out that nitrates and nitrites, byproducts of nitric oxide's oxidation, also shut down metabolic rate activity and have been linked to cancers.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah in 1970 they were definitely identified as cancer carcinogen formers in the stomach and now that nitric oxide has been promoted the nitrates have lost their carcinogenicity apparently.

**CONTEXT:** You also mentioned a causal link to Alzheimer's in relation to the content of nitric oxide in the patient's body.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah starting about the age of 40 nitric oxide synthesis increases generally even in healthy people but it's intensified in the demented brain.

**CONTEXT:** What about amyl nitrate, which is a nitrogen-releasing compound?

**RAY PEAT:** No, just the legend, basically, that for a while they thought it was the cause of AIDS. And I think it's still considered to be an immune destructive. An interesting thing I saw recently was that nitric oxide stops the hair follicle renewal. So if people start thinking about baldness they might be more interested in investigating the dangers of nitric oxide than just heart disease or dementia.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the ruddy cheeks and red shiny nose that can affect aging men more than women, is there any cause and tips to avoid that?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's, um... Related to the hot flush that women get at menopause, which is clearly a surge of nitric oxide. But I think in men there are other things, including an actual deficiency of riboflavin. I think that's... for some reason a consequence of the nitric oxide poisoning. That riboflavin vitamin B2 is essential for the respiratory energy production. And the rosacea cheeks and red shiny nose and such, the vitamin B2 is usually a factor in that I've seen almost instantaneous relief. When someone got a big dose of vitamin B2, but it doesn't last long. Once you've got a deficiency, the tissue doesn't retain the vitamin B2 effectively, so it seems to be a chronic problem of getting the diet converted so that you every day are taking in a little more than the normal amount of vitamin B2.

**CONTEXT:** Cardiologists frequently tell their clients taking statins to take CoQ10. Why do statins mess around with that, and how does CoQ10 help?

**RAY PEAT:** The statins are poisoning the enzyme that makes cholesterol. And that system makes several substances other than cholesterol, including CoQ10. And so that's now widely recognized that I don't know. You're poisoning the whole respiratory system. Oh, lovely. Okay. The CoQ10 is one of the other essential factors for oxidative metabolism. And when that's deficient, the failure of energy can reach the point that muscle cells lacking functioning mitochondria. So if you exercise where... About 7% of the statin users have some muscle pain. If you exercise while you're under the influence of the statin, you greatly increase the risk of killing the muscle cells because the energy production can't keep up with the energy expenditure. And if the muscle breakdown is complete, that can destroy your kidneys by the flow of......debris from the disintegrating muscle. Yes, thank you very much. And so giving a good dose of CoQ10 is very protective. And it isn't just protecting the muscles because the statin is doing exactly the same thing to the brain mitochondria, heart mitochondria. CoQ10 is protective to all systems.

**CONTEXT:** What about nitroglycerin for relief of angina?

**RAY PEAT:** It has similar side effects. It's something that I think should be limited. I should use it to relieve the symptoms but work on correcting the problem with such things as CoQ10 and normalizing.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding stomach acid, is it possible that taking smaller doses of Betaine HCl with glycine or gelatin improves digestion and metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh sure, any acid. They used to have...drug stores would dispense a glass of dilute hydrochloric acid with a glass straw for people to sip to acidify their stomach during meals, but even strong vinegar... Acetic acid helps the enzymes to function, so that the betaine hydrochloride definitely acidifies the stomach and works, but one long-range concern is that betaine feeds into the methyl metabolism, and you want to look at the long-range effects of increasing methylation. It's stylish to supplement methyl groups, but one of the background facts is that if you decrease the methionine and cysteine in the diet of animals, their lifespan increases 30 or 40 percent just by the absence of those methyl donors. So I would suspect that trannic use of betaine is going to... be like increased consumption of the methionine and cysteine.

**CONTEXT:** If one takes a small amount of Betaine HCl wrapped in gelatin, does that balance the potential long-term concerns about methylation?

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, so my second question relates to, if someone wakes up in the middle of the night, I guess they could either use the red lamp, they could get, you know, carrots or some milk. Or they could actually take a CO2 bath. And in the night, obviously, cortisol raises up to, you know, I guess 5, 6 a.m. in the morning. Which combination of those would be, you know, reasonable, rational to use to try to help your body get back into a state of repair during that period of time when it's supposed to be repairing? You know, even though you might be sort of having a cortisol jump because you need enough protein during the day or whatever or you can get the right combination of foods. What's a good way during the night to, you know, which of those methods might be useful or is a combination useful?

**RAY PEAT:** Nitric oxide has the same curve rising to a peak around 7 a.m. along with cortisol and so penetrating red light helps to free the respiratory apparatus from both carbon monoxide and nitric oxide. It is a way of protecting yourself from darkness but sugar and the thyroid function producing carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is the basic stabilizer against stress.

**CONTEXT:** What about a dry CO2 bath if one can't produce it in the body during the night?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for example, having a big plastic box full of CO2 by your bed. If you're having night stress, you can just get out of bed and sit in your your box of CO2 for 20 or 30 minutes without eating that. So if you don't eat those those are good methods.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that amphetamines prescribed for ADD and ADHD can be linked to lymphoma.

**RAY PEAT:** Things that impair the oxygen metabolism of your brain do create attention deficit and some of the studies found that coffee improved focus and attention not only in... those with the diagnosis but even honors students had better focus when they had a coffee supplement so that there is a benefit from some supplements but it happens that as far back as late 1960s people were noticing a connection between the amphetamines and... lymphoma and I was aware of that because I had a close friend who loved his benzidrine and he died in his 40s from lymphoma that kept me aware of the research and for about 30 years no one would admit that that connection existed but lately more people are recognizing that lymphoma is... the result of toxic stress....with good nutrition. It relaxes the nerves by restoring their energy and carbon dioxide production.
