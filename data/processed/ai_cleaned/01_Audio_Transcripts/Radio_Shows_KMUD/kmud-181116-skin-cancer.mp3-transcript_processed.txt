**RAY PEAT:** The cholesterol content is a very important factor which has decreased in the elderly. They've known for several years that over the age of 60 or 70, it takes about twice as much sunlight exposure to produce the same amount of vitamin D. And it turns out that that's simply because old skin has only about half as much cholesterol as young skin. The age effect occurs in the adrenal glands, for example, which are the largest producers of not only steroid hormones but of cholesterol itself. The digestive system, the intestine, and liver are important sources of cholesterol, but the brain and skin produce usually most of the cholesterol that they need. But all of those organs, the machinery for producing cholesterol declines with aging, roughly 50% by old age. And in the skin, it becomes obvious that the vitamin D isn't produced in the sunlight, but every organ, the cholesterol, has many functions. The brain produces steroids from cholesterol, the same way the gonads and adrenal glands do. The skin can produce steroid hormones from cholesterol. And any injury to the skin, even intense blue light or injecting irritating substances will cause the skin to defensively increase the production of both cholesterol and the vitamin D derived from it to the extent that it can according to its age and health.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids and their lipid byproducts, like lipofuscin, damage the endothelium, leading the body to produce cholesterol as a repair response, and how this relates to cholesterol not being the problem, but rather the underlying insult?

**RAY PEAT:** The polyunsaturated fat, its direct action on the cholesterol enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, it inhibits the production, where the saturated fats don't inhibit cholesterol production. So if you're going to use any oil on the skin, it should be cocoa butter or cow butter or anything highly saturated and not any of the polyunsaturated oils. There were experiments about 30, 40 years ago on rabbits. They shaved their backs so that they were exposed to ultraviolet sunlight. And the rabbits that were fed polyunsaturated fats developed quickly wrinkled aged skin on their backs and the ones with saturated fats didn't have that sun damage. So the polyunsaturated fats, the double bonds are especially reactive to ultraviolet light, but even through indirect pathways, even blue light can activate the lipid peroxidation process. For example, vitamin B2, yellow vitamin, absorbs blue light and is excited chemically and it becomes reactive. Either the ultraviolet or blue light will create vitamin deficiency, in effect, impairing the ability of the cell to produce energy oxidatively and that leads to the production of lactic acid which creates inflammation. So even blue light can lead to a fatigued process of the cell leading to inflammation and degeneration. And this is via polyunsaturates, and this is why you advocate eliminating polyunsaturates from your diet and just switching it all out to saturated sources, and that over time you will change the mass of your fat content to saturated from polyunsaturated, even though we do produce some polyunsaturates ourselves. And it's coming to be recognized that stearic acid, a purely saturated fatty acid, has an anti-cancer effect.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that in an older person, cholesterol in their skin is 50% less, and they need twice the sunlight exposure to create the same amount of vitamin D. What are your thoughts on this, especially concerning people in nursing homes?

**RAY PEAT:** So, in an older person, just to recap here, that an elderly person has 50% less cholesterol in their skin and they need twice the sunlight exposure to create the same amount of vitamin D. So, obviously, that's a big concern for people in nursing homes. Being indoors in a nursing home and not getting sunlight further compounds their chances of becoming susceptible to cancers. As vitamin D has been shown repeatedly to be a good strategy for protecting against cancers.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding the mevalonate pathway and the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is blocked by statins, what are the implications of this blockage on the production of other essential compounds, and how does this relate to the function of Coenzyme Q10?

**RAY PEAT:** Statins, blocking this enzyme will lead to a deficit in all those other steroids and all the other products from which cholesterol is a building block. It's now gradually being realized that ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10, which is a product of that same enzyme that the statins lower, and it's an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory system. And when a tissue is stressed, such as a muscle during exercise, the mitochondria fails to produce enough energy and that can lead to the breakdown of the muscle and sometimes the muscle breakdown plugs up the kidneys in effect and kills the person, but very commonly it's causing muscle pain made worse by exercise and that's because of damage to the mitochondrial respiratory system mainly, although the structural effects of reduced cholesterol will affect the structure and function of mitochondria, but since the brain and other organs use the same coenzyme Q10 and mitochondrial processes, the muscle damage is just a very noticeable thing where the cognitive damage is less noticeable.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that lactic acid is a byproduct of impaired oxidation. Is this related to the decrease in CoQ10 or a separate issue?

**RAY PEAT:** It is a necessary adaptation to anything that impairs oxidation.

**CONTEXT:** What is your understanding of the role of skin bacteria in health, and is UV exposure a beneficial treatment for controlling them?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid and vitamin D are major factors in immunity. There is another cholesterol metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol, which is very similar in function to 25-hydroxyvitamin D. They're very structurally similar, and they both activate the immune system, and I think they work right along with vitamin A and the thyroid hormone in keeping the skin bacteria under control.

**CONTEXT:** Would topical application of vitamin D, combined with a saturated fat like coconut oil, be a reasonable approach to improving vitamin D status in the skin and potentially overcoming precancerous conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** I think both vitamin D and cholesterol, especially with saturated fats to compete against whatever polyunsaturated happens to be in the skin, I think all three of those have a good chance of overcoming the precancerous condition. In a typical cancer, there will be a fully cancerized zone surrounded by lower degrees of conversion of the cells as if something is being emitted from a center causing a gradual progressive change in the surrounding tissue. It isn't that cells are traveling out, it's that the surrounding normal cells are gradually being injured the closer they are to the cancer. And part of that is that the normal metabolites are being suppressed by the toxins such as lactic acid being emitted by the cancer cells. And fairly well saturating the skin both from the bloodstream internally, taken supplements, but also from things applied topically in the vicinity are going to keep those precancerous cells from going the rest of the way and increasing the tumor.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that experiments showed that covering facial skin for a few weeks could eliminate mutated cells. What is your interpretation of this finding?

**RAY PEAT:** And about 20 years ago, someone was taking samples from facial skin of people who were just normally exposed to daylight. And they found that almost everyone, with any outside light exposure, had quite a few mutated cells, precancerous cells, in their facial skin. But when they covered the skin for just a few weeks, that same area that had been producing streams of mutated cells were entirely free. The mutant cells showed that the body is able to kill off the bad cells and replace them with fresh, non-cancerous cells given the chance of letting them simply rest from the damage. Presumably, this would be in instances perhaps where there wasn't severe and repeated sunburn as a direct cause of mutated DNA. But which is a very slight irritation that's not such a severe...

**CONTEXT:** You also noted that autopsies of middle-aged people who died in accidents revealed cancer in everyone by age 50. What is the takeaway from this observation?

**RAY PEAT:** And other people looking at middle-aged people who had been killed in accidents found that everyone at the age of 50, if you did a thorough autopsy, everyone has cancer by the age of 50 somewhere in their body. Same principle as they saw in the facial skin, if you stop injuring it, it's going to return to normal. Most people don't die of cancer, even though everyone by the age of 50 has cancer. So the thing is to stop making cancers in your body as far as possible. I think that's the function of applying things such as progesterone, vitamin D, cholesterol, maybe mevalonic acid.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the use of progesterone and DHEA for skin conditions, particularly in relation to thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's the function of applying things such as progesterone. Vitamin D, cholesterol, maybe mevalonic acid. Progesterone and DHEA. DHEA. Now, I just want to put the caveat out there, and Dr. Pete, you would agree with this because you're the one who stated it, but in terms of using DHEA, you need to make sure that your thyroid is working well, otherwise you risk the you run the risk of converting that DHEA into estrogen, which you don't want to do because that in its own right is a pro-cancerous compound. So make sure your thyroid function is working well, and or if it isn't, use a thyroid hormone. So whether it's a desiccated natural or indeed synthetic, which is absolutely fine, you should be making sure that your thyroid is working well so that you can convert that DHEA appropriately. And sometimes skin cancers heal up just for increasing the thyroid because the thyroid is going to increase the production of cholesterol and the immune steroids.

**CONTEXT:** How can one assess thyroid function, and what is the significance of body temperature and pulse rate in this assessment?

**RAY PEAT:** Broder Barnes was a person who showed how effective the temperature check could be for diagnosing hypothyroidism, and his books are still available on the internet, I think. Very important to read for everyone. Your temperature and pulses will be a very good way to see what your metabolic rate is, which is the underlying driver of your metabolism and hormone conversion, etc. So, you know, you can get a blood test to see what your TSH is like. It might be, you know, fairly high. So that would be clinically a way to show that, but your temperature and pulses would be the best way to do that.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on vitamin E, specifically the difference between tocopherols and tocotrienols, and their role in relation to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)?

**RAY PEAT:** There is some information that the tocotrienols can, in large doses, in experimental animals, they cause liver enlargement, which suggests that they're treated as a toxin by the liver. And so ever since seeing that, I've been suspicious that maybe they're over-emphasizing their value because of the amount of money they can sell them for as distinct from a traditional vitamin E. And one of the problems with vitamin E is it can preserve the amount of PUFA in the tissue, so it's important to keep your polyunsaturated fats down, as well as using the vitamin E to block their effects as far as possible.

**CONTEXT:** What is your opinion on royal jelly compared to bee pollen, particularly concerning their nutrient content and potential PUFA content?

**RAY PEAT:** Royal jelly is extremely rich in nutrients, and if there was a lot of it, everyone should probably eat some of it, but you don't want to steal the bees' food, they're already having problems.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the efficacy of cannabis oil for skin cancers, and what role might olive oil play in its application?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm afraid I don't have thoughts on cannabis oil. The only thing I would wonder is, was the product in what kind of oil was the product extracted in, or was it just olive oil? Olive oil, right. It was basically hash, it was basically hashish mixed with olive oil, if you get on to it, what it was. I think the olive oil is more therapeutic than the cannabis oil. The oleic acid, which is the major fat in olive oil, increases synthesis of cholesterol.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on aloe leaf as a topical treatment for skin cancers?

**RAY PEAT:** Aloe leaf is another thing that people have used successfully on skin cancers to squash the aloe leaf on it. Aloe, really?
