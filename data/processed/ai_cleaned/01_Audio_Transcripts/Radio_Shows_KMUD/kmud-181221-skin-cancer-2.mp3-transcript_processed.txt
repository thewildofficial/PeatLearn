**RAY PEAT:** My dissertation was on biochemical changes involved in reproductive aging, working on the hamster users mostly. I'm seeing how many factors parallel aging in the biochemical pattern that they create. Estrogen excess, progesterone deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, exposure to radiation, all create the same typical age pattern of metabolism. And it's at its most extreme in cancer metabolism. And that was why I was so interested in Otto Farberg's work at the time. When I was just starting in graduate school, American biochemists were turning against Otto Farberg, despite his Nobel Prize, because he was saying that cancer is a metabolic condition, not a gene mutation. And now, 50 years later, finally, the US and European cultures are coming around to looking at what Barber did almost 100 years ago.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, could you outline your academic background and research focus?

**RAY PEAT:** About 40 years ago there was a big mania in the U.S. blaming everything on Candida. And that led me to study how it actually interacts and if you're under stress and hypothyroid and inclined towards diabetes or not being able to oxidize glucose thoroughly and tending to have high estrogen, it happens that all of those favor and attract Candida growth. And so... The presence of Candida coincides with hypothyroidism, estrogen excess, and poor ability to oxidize glucose. So, it happens that inflammation and improper oxidation of glucose is typical of cancer metabolism more intensely than of... a simple stress metabolism. So, Simoncini is seeing something very central to the metabolism of cancer, which is intensified by the inflammation-promoting effects of the Candida. And Candida itself, besides being attracted to estrogen, estrogen is a sex hormone. for the Candida fungus, and it contains an enzyme which can aromatize male steroid hormones. So it can become an amplifier of estrogen, first it's attracted to it and stimulated by it. So it can convert testosterone into... Yeah, at least one of the precursors of estrogen, a steroid... from the adrenal, rather than from the gonads. And so it's definitely, in many ways, an amplifier of cancer once it gets in a tissue. And when the immune system is failing, the fungus can convert from a... a yeast form to a filament form and invade the tissues, looking for sugar and estrogen. So it's very commonly associated with cancers. The sicker a person is, the weaker their immune system is. And the less they are using their own glucose and they're producing themselves histamine and lactic acid in the tumor. In the tumor. And both of these are attractive to the fungus and so if you simply increase the pH and do it with bicarbonate which converts to carbon dioxide, that helps to suppress the cancer promoting lactic acid formation by the tumor itself. He's really onto something and his critics really, most of them, sound sort of nasty and hysterical.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, what are your thoughts on Dr. Tulio Simoncini's hypothesis that cancer is caused by Candida albicans?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and that follows from a cholesterol deficiency with aging, the ability to make cholesterol and the steroids goes down. And so, when the sunlight hits old skin, it makes much less vitamin D. Just a few months ago, in Poland, there was an interesting article on the so-called activated form... of vitamin D, calcitriol, or 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D. They showed that vitamin D form, the active so-called form, suppresses immunity and creates the ideal environment for causing mammary gland cancer metastasis.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned vitamin D deficiency and its role in skin cancer. What is your perspective on the activated form of vitamin D, calcitriol?

**RAY PEAT:** No, that's produced under stress. It's sort of the way the steroid hormones under extreme stress. I can emphasize the estrogen version of the steroid, the calcitriol is the extreme stress form of vitamin D, it has its use under stress, but like estrogen, it easily becomes counterproductive and in the case of cancer can promote the cancer spread.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, so the 1-alpha-25-dihydroxy-vitamin D is not the beneficial form?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, like, a pregnant woman is the precursor of the pathway that, at its endpoint, leads to estrogen and aldosterone and other end steroids. But if you take enough pregnenolone, you'll reduce those end products rather than increasing them.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, can you elaborate on the relationship between precursors and end products in metabolic pathways, similar to how you discussed vitamin D?

**RAY PEAT:** When bicarbonate gets into the bloodstream, the sodium leaves in the urine and the bicarbonate is converted to......carbon dioxide as it enters the cell and so it acidifies the intracellular environment despite increasing the alkalinity temporarily of the bloodstream. And the typical cancer metabolism has an alkaline intracellular pH and so you're getting right at the... part of of the problem when you increase the CO2 inside the cell. Since the 18th century carbon dioxide gas has been used to treat visible cancers such as ulcerated breast cancer and the Japanese are currently using it to treat cancers, using that same principle that it acidifies the cell, turns off......the growth mechanism of the production of lactic acid. And several drug companies are working on enzyme inhibitors similar to acetazolamide, but things that they can patent to increase the internal acidity of cancers.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, can you explain the mechanism by which sodium bicarbonate, or CO2, affects cancer cells?

**RAY PEAT:** It causes the body to retain it and acidifies the whole body when you get a certain amount, but intracellularly that acidification turns off lactic acid production, and lactic acid is the main carcinogen effectively.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned acetazolamide. How does it relate to CO2 and cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, if, if it's happy in the intestine, it's... it grows in the yeast form, getting enough sugar, but when there's no sugar in the intestine and it starves, then it will attach itself to the surface of the intestine and then send out filaments to find sugar from the bloodstream or the cells.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, you've previously stated that starving the body of sugar is not the correct approach for dealing with Candida. Can you explain why?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm inclined to think it's the olive oil that's therapeutic because it has so many anti-inflammatory effects, where I think the cannabis......oil has some potentially pro-growth, pro-inflammatory components or effects.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, regarding the use of cannabis oil for skin conditions, do you believe the olive oil suspension is the primary therapeutic agent?

**RAY PEAT:** The things related to the cannabis, the characteristic... What are they called? The endogenous cannabinoids, amandamide I think is the endogenous one. It is a metabolite of a very unsaturated fatty acid and the effects that I've seen really are along the line. of the polyunsaturated fatty acids themselves which as a group are amplifiers of the estrogen effect.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, what are your thoughts on the endogenous cannabinoids found in cannabis oil and their potential effects?

**RAY PEAT:** A very good general nutritional value, including selenium and iodine and other trace minerals that all of the ocean organisms have. But it does have a lot of the polyunsaturated, so I think maybe one meal a week is fine.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, what is your assessment of sardines as a food source, considering their nutritional profile and PUFA content?

**RAY PEAT:** No, I don't think that would happen if you're using something like 7% iodine on the infected nail. It takes a long time to diffuse through a toenail, but it is a good fungus killer.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, is there a risk of fungal infections, like toenail fungus, spreading to other areas of the body if treated with something like iodine?

**RAY PEAT:** Eating well can help to upset the stress, but... the attitude, the way you interpret the experience. It is also essential to see it as just one of the challenges of living, I think, and not interpret it in any way that impairs your understanding of yourself. It should just be seen as one of the environmental challenges.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, how do stressful relationships affect an individual's physiology, and how can one mitigate these effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, well, hopefully not. You'd be sitting there breathing nothing day and night or... Anyway, Dr. P, did you hear all of that question? Not all of it. Where was the fungus? Yeah, just describe again. I mean, is it a bagged product? How does it release it? Exactly. I suppose it's a plastic bag of several kilograms or maybe, I don't know, six pounds or so. Okay. And you just lay it on the soil? And I suppose that in there, there is some kind of fungus and something to feed it. Okay. All right. Yeah, I had a bag of masa arena from Mexico that had the humidity in Oregon started. A fungus growth and for about a year it was hot and producing carbon dioxide, so it's a very productive passive way to increase the carbon dioxide in your bedroom, for example. I don't think it's anything seriously harmful other than the carbon dioxide is beneficial and I don't think... if it has a like a cloth enclosure, I don't think it's going to put out any spores.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, what are your thoughts on using bagged CO2-generating products for increasing indoor CO2 levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Just a pinch of flowers of sulphur. If it's internal, if it's on your cheeks, you can rub it with your finger into the white spot. Wet your finger, dip it in the flowers of sulfur and rub it on. Otherwise, if it's in your stomach or intestine, a pinch of it every day for 3 or 4 days is very reliable for cleaning it out of your intestine. And if it's on your skin, genital or crotch area in general, where it's living in the sweaty area, dusting the area. With flowers of sulfur, or I had a whole body coverage of some kind of fungus when I was in a tropical area of Mexico. And someone from the Amazon had a similar experience and she told me about 10% sulfur soap. And one bath eradicated it. It's amazingly effective against skin Candida infections.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, regarding Candida overgrowth and the common advice to starve it of sugar, what is your recommended approach for treating Candida?

**RAY PEAT:** Broda Barnes, in his books, advocated the use of temperature as an important basis for diagnosing functional hypothyroidism. Back in the 1930s, if we used their definitions of hypothyroidism, about 40% of Americans would fit their definitions. But in the 1940s, the drug industry came in with some ways of chemically diagnosing hypothyroidism. It happened that they were... completely meaningless biologically, but they convinced everyone that 95% of the population is not hypothyroid. And this isn't thyroid-stimulating hormone, is it? No, they were using a protein-bound iodine which has absolutely no relation to how you're experiencing your thyroid. And about 20 years later when that was thrown out... It was completely meaningless. They switched to the TSH as they call it the gold standard of thyroid diagnosis. But they completely neglect the fact that stress lowers your TSH. And so that you can be under such intense stress with high cortisol that your TSH can be down near zero. While your thyroid gland is producing nothing. Also they neglect that TSH is an inflammation promoter. It in itself creates hypertension by causing inflammation directly in the blood vessels as well as in the bone marrow and every place it's been studied. It has harmful tissue effects. So one of the......effects of the thyroid hormone on your blood pressure is simply that it suppresses TSH. People in a population that was determined to be generally healthy without heart disease or cancer, their TSH was 0.04 or less. So they were all in the... what would be diagnosed as a hyperthyroid state. Right. So, many people now are saying that the upper limit of TSH should not be higher than 2.0. And the T4 and T3 in the bloodstream can't be interpreted all by themselves. You have to... know what the reverse T3 is because it can interfere with the activity of the T3 itself.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, regarding hypothyroidism and erratic blood pressure, what is your perspective on TSH levels and their interpretation?

**RAY PEAT:** My own experience, when I stopped taking thyroid for a while... My blood pressure has gone up to something like 170 over 110, and other times as low as... Most doctors wouldn't believe it, but 55 over 28.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, can you share your personal experience with blood pressure fluctuations related to thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** It makes the substance more digestible, so you get more... protein out of it, but the greens do have too much pufa to use them as your main food. Even if you cook them? Even if you cook them for 40 minutes or whatever? Yeah, if you cooked them for hours, much of the pufa would float to the surface, and you could get some of it off that way. But... Still, they're high-end pufa, and the cow's digestive system uses bacteria and vitamin E to eliminate 98% of the pufa, so it's better to process greens through cows. You're drinking the milk. Yeah, the calcium-phosphorus ratio is the best thing about greens. They're extremely high in calcium relative to phosphate.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, regarding cooking vegetables, does adding baking soda reduce PUFA content, and what about the calcium-phosphorus ratio in vegetables?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, turnips, for example, they have fructose when they're in a young and fresh state and are relatively nutritious.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, are root vegetables similar to greens in terms of their nutritional profile and preparation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it has a good balance of all of the nutrients compared to carrots. Cooked mushrooms have, in general, a fair balance of minerals. They're somewhat low in calcium, but not as bad as grains and beans and meat. But, um... They have the fibrous effect that the carrot has of helping to sweep out the intestine just by the bulk effect.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat, how do mushrooms compare to carrots and charcoal in terms of their health benefits, particularly regarding endotoxins?
