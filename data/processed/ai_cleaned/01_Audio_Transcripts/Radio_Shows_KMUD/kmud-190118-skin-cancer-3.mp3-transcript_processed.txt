**RAY PEAT:** The incidence of melanoma has been on the rise exponentially since the 80s. I think from before that, I've seen has increased 500 percent since about 1940.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think is the reason for the increase in melanoma?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm pretty sure it's not sun exposure because it has an inverse relation with altitude. The change that I think is relevant is the polyunsaturated fats diet, which have increased just about at the same rate that melanoma has.

**CONTEXT:** Are you thinking it's because the polyunsaturates are energy-depleting or producing lipid peroxidation in the skin?

**RAY PEAT:** Many of those things, yes. The energy goes down and inflammation goes up. In the veteran study, supposedly to prevent heart disease in the 1960s, they gave a corn oil-based diet to one group and regular fats, including margarine and butter and ordinary moderately unsaturated fats. The one group that got corn oil in their diet regularly, at the end of eight years, had three times the mortality from cancer. So one of the industry's own studies relates to what you see in the animal studies. For example, if you look at just linoleic acid, which was the original essential fatty acid, so-called, as the proportion of linoleic acid in the diet goes up, the cancer incidence, mortality, goes up right with the proportion of linoleic acid.

**CONTEXT:** So these are just because of the pro-inflammatory nature of this in people's diets and in the food chain in general?

**RAY PEAT:** And they do interfere with production and use of cholesterol.

**CONTEXT:** The lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation, with evidence for oxygen as an inhaled carcinogen. So, sea level versus altitude, and what you've always mentioned about CO2 being protective with longevity, definitely increasing with elevation.

**RAY PEAT:** The insurance companies have known for more than 100 years that cancer mortality in general decreases with altitude. Very low in the high altitude cities. And as the oxygen pressure in the air increases, the carbon dioxide tends to decrease. If they are competitive, the pressure of oxygen displaces the carbon dioxide bound to blood.

**CONTEXT:** So this is at sea level, so people at sea level are much more likely, perhaps statistically, than to get cancer because they don't have the protective effect of CO2 that you'd get at altitude?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's an anti-inflammatory protective factor.

**CONTEXT:** You're completely against statins, and you have a very different base level at which someone's cholesterol will be considered healthy. The medical association starts looking at interfering with people's cholesterol levels when they get up to 200 milligrams percent. You've always said that people over the age of 51, a cholesterol level of 200, 220, 230 is fine. In terms of what statins do, I saw from their pharmacology that they block mevalonate or they can interfere with mevalonate, and it's a kind of upstream chemical. This can cause aneuploidy, and this, in its own right, is a really quite a serious outcome for using statins.

**RAY PEAT:** If you experimentally starve cells for cholesterol, the same thing that statins do to the person, the cells in vitro are stuck in the tetraploid state. They can't do the reductive separation of chromosomes. And old people's skin is relatively loaded with cells stuck in that state because, with aging, the cells lose their ability to maintain the production of cholesterol. And when they get stuck in that condition, then if something forces them to divide, they get the number of chromosomes sort of randomized as they divide, and that can produce cancer cells.

**CONTEXT:** Do you have any kind of answers in terms of rejuvenating skin cholesterol?

**RAY PEAT:** Experimentally, in the cosmetic industry, they're starting to put cholesterol in cosmetics. In effect, it does rejuvenate the cells. It restores their ability to divide healthfully.

**CONTEXT:** So you can physically, topically apply cholesterol in the form of an ointment or a cream to the skin and expect the skin to take up a reasonable portion of that?

**RAY PEAT:** That's what the experiments show, and the cosmetics companies are taking advantage of it.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned about vitamin D production in the elderly. You have to have twice as much or more sunlight exposure to get the same conversion from cholesterol to vitamin D, which is so important for immune health and immune surveillance. There's half as much cholesterol in the old skin as in young skin.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, half as much.

**CONTEXT:** And I know the collagen is the issue, or some of the issue in people's skin when they get older when it starts to look a little unsightly or wrinkly or saggy. Do you think there's much that can be done to restore the collagen or the scaffold in which the skin is normally elastic and stretchy?

**RAY PEAT:** The cells normally are able to turn it over. Energized cells can eat up the hardened, cross-linked, aged collagen and let the cells produce fresh collagen. The cholesterol lets the cells divide normally. They are more energetic, produce a thicker layer of healthy cells rather than a scaly, hardened layer of aged, flaky cells.

**CONTEXT:** So there does seem to be, from what you're saying, research showing that that is beneficial. If people want to think a little bit along those lines down the road, they could probably do something themselves in terms of acquiring cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** The practical way to keep your cholesterol synthesis ability is to avoid polyunsaturated fatty acids because they turn off the synthesis of cholesterol and interfere with its use in the cells.

**CONTEXT:** In terms of raising your cholesterol, you've always advocated orange juice as a good fructose source that would actually increase a person's cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, getting the cell energized with sugar and supplementing thyroid if necessary.

**CONTEXT:** So, if you were able to do this, you're saying you think the cholesterol here itself would be distributed evenly throughout the body, and actually in the skin, you would wind up with a higher concentration of cholesterol than before?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, except if your body is already saturated with polyunsaturated fats, they will interfere with it and misdirect it, put it into harmful forms. The aging brain has much less, about half as much, free cholesterol as the young brain, but it fills up with the ester form combined with polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**CONTEXT:** You've always said that four years is a rough approximation for the turnover of lipids in the cell. So, given that you had a completely exclusive diet of saturated fats and you completely excluded polyunsaturates, after four years, there should be a fairly good turnover within the cells. How is this the same with the brain, for example, if you're talking about the polyunsaturates causing damage in the brain and interfering with energy production and dementia, etcetera, down the road?

**RAY PEAT:** Every night, there's a tremendous turnover of the lipids in the brain. But when you're asleep, your blood sugar falls, and the free fatty acids tend to be liberated from your fat stores. So if you have bad fat in your fat tissue, during the night it's going to be in the blood vessels when your brain is remaking itself. If you can keep your blood sugar up or get your fat so that it's pretty saturated, then your brain every night remakes itself considerably.

**CONTEXT:** What about hydroxymethylbutyrate as a producer of cholesterol? Was that a precursor?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's a precursor that supposedly helps to increase it. I think most people are always thinking about decreasing their cholesterol, but I'm always thinking about increasing it. I know my cholesterol is actually low; I almost have a problem with it. It's probably 135 or 140. It's very important to get it up to 160.

**CONTEXT:** So, regarding antivirals, you have a very different perspective. You've mentioned that a person's physiology and the "terroir" of the person are very responsible for the outcome of coming down with a virus or resisting it.

**RAY PEAT:** A very large part of our genome resembles the retroviruses. But when you wonder how viruses came into being, since they can only exist in the cells of animals, they obviously derived in some way from the animals' genetic material. And it's only in the last several years that Western biochemists are starting to recognize that there are particles circulating in our blood and lymph system. A Korean, 60 years ago, claimed that he discovered a third circulatory system other than blood and lymph, which carries particles of genetic material. And about ten years ago, this was actually documented. Not the third circulatory system, but the fact that there are very small particles of nucleic acids circulating in the blood and lymph, carrying genetic information to repair cells or change their functions. The particles are so small that people examining blood under microscopes just considered it to be sort of dust in the background. But with proper magnification, they see that there are these microvesicles, they call them, which bud off from the surface of cells, or exosomes, some of them are called. They carry both DNA and RNA and proteins and other parts of cells that act as signals. For example, between a working organ like the lungs and the turnover of cells in the bone marrow that are producing stem cells and immune cells and so on. So all of our organs are communicating with each other through these little particles that are about the size of viruses and that contain genetic information and proteins the way viruses do.

**CONTEXT:** Do you think there's anything, well, let's say the word "useful," about viruses? I mean, I always imagine viruses just to be the bad guys, and you just don't want to pick up a virus if you can at all avoid it because there's nothing good about them. Is there anything to be said for viruses?

**RAY PEAT:** Most viruses, the smart ones at least try to keep the host alive. But a lot of viruses end up causing morbidity and early death. So when bacteria are exposed to a dangerous environment, such as antibiotics or starvation, they are able to edit, re-engineer their own genes to produce adaptive changes. So it's now recognized that bacteria are capable of non-random, so-called mutations for defensive adaptive purposes. And when one bacterium achieves immunity to a certain thing in the environment, they can conveniently pack it up into a little exosome, a plasmid, which they pass on to their neighbors. So it spreads like a viral infection. It's like you can share the good news. Yes, a self-constructed virus that the bacteria pass on for the defense of the community. And within our body, we're passing these little plasmids or microvesicles to different parts of the body. When we eat another organism, we incorporate some of their DNA into our own cellular DNA. It's like beef, and you get some cow DNA incorporated into the cells. You eat carrots, and you get some carrot DNA. And in that sense, we're communicating across species all the time, genetically. It's kind of equivalent to what the bacteria do defensively. I imagine that viruses have some of that function. So that if it's in our genes, and it's like a bacterium can use its adaptive ability to change its genes or to find this plasmid that it has received from a neighbor, I think we have the ability to look into our genetic reservoir, including carrot and cow genes, to see what's useful. And that these things, if they aren't useful, if we're not able to adaptively use them, if our energy is very low, then they can cause trouble. They can interfere with our adaptation. But if our energy is high, I think getting these particles of genetic information can actually increase our repertoire.

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about cholesterol levels: total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL. What are the appropriate ranges, especially relative to someone who has a normal cholesterol of 225? You view LDL and HDL differently, not as good and bad cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** When your low-density cholesterol is low, that's what increases the cancer risk or dementia risk too. But the things that poison your liver or stress you increase the HDL. And it happens that that protein that forms the HDL is anti-inflammatory, so it's a defensive reaction to stress. So things like estrogen and alcohol, for example, will increase the HDL defensively. The LDL is a protective source of the cholesterol, and if the triglycerides are fairly saturated, they aren't very harmful. They found that heart failure is actually less of a problem if your triglycerides are high. But if the triglycerides are polyunsaturated, that goes with interference with the function of the cholesterol. And free fatty acids are the dangerous form of fats in the blood. They have multiple interferences, for example, with oxidative metabolism and the use of sugar. But the triglycerides are pretty innocuous. They're just evidence that you're under stress and not using your sugar properly.

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks about healing a sprained ankle with torn and stretched ligaments, focusing on minimizing scar tissue for long-term outcomes.

**RAY PEAT:** Things to keep the free fatty acids low so that you use your glucose as efficiently as possible to produce anti-inflammatory things like carbon dioxide and aspirin and niacinamide, for example, are anti-inflammatory things that reduce the disorganizing kind of scar tissue and promote maximum quality healing with a minimum of excess random collagen deposition.

**CONTEXT:** So red light and CO2 would also be useful, but those are more short-term trauma-reducing issues. The actual intake of low-proof aspirin and niacinamide, you're saying, will help reduce the scarring yet facilitate healing properly?

**RAY PEAT:** And vitamin D and vitamin K are very important. Getting enough calcium in your diet with vitamin D so that you keep your parathyroid hormone suppressed to keep the tissue energy high, including salt in your diet to keep the aldosterone to a minimum because aldosterone promotes disorganized collagen healing and fibrosis. So some unexpected things: sodium and calcium in the diet are protective to the healing of connective tissue.

**CONTEXT:** If a doctor says the only way it's going to heal is when scar tissue develops, what's your take on that?

**RAY PEAT:** Good scar tissue is fine, but the worse your metabolism is, the more disorganized the scar tissue is. So that a keloid, for example, is terrible scar tissue, very disorganized because of polyunsaturated fats in your circulation, disorganizing the healing. A baby in utero with no essential fatty acids in circulation and plenty of carbon dioxide will heal without any disorganized structures.

**CONTEXT:** An older person has fungal toe and someone suggested mixing equal parts of apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide and soaking the toe for 30 minutes each day for about a month. What do you think about this idea?

**RAY PEAT:** Iodine is a good fungus killer. Vinegar is a pretty fair antagonist to the fungus.

**CONTEXT:** In combination with hydrogen peroxide? Because that seems to be a fantastic product. Both of them.

**RAY PEAT:** Individually, I imagine together they work all right too. You can damage the tissue with too much hydrogen peroxide. Once I spilled some 30% peroxide on my finger, and it turned strangely paper white, and I stuck it in a bottle of ascorbic acid, and in a flash, it looked normal.

**CONTEXT:** The caller followed your suggestion to take coconut oil but experiences severe digestive distress. They've tried ultra-purified and unrefined versions, finding the refined and even hydrogenated coconut oil easiest on the intestine.

**RAY PEAT:** What kind of coconut oil is it? If you put it on a hot frying pan and if it smells, then it's more likely to hurt your intestine. It should be odorless when it hits a hot pan.

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if there's any medical condition or cause that would lead a person to develop digestive issues with frequent and loose bowel movements, as well as high blood pressure, that came out of the blue around the same time.

**RAY PEAT:** There are lots of things that can be involved, but the stress physiology is generally involved in both inflammation and tendency to diarrhea, high blood pressure.

**CONTEXT:** Have you had blood tests? Yes, yes, they've been normal. Everything has looked really good. What do you think about anti-serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** Low thyroid function with a TSH measurement up to three they call normal, but anything above one is likely to promote inflammation, including in the intestine. And high serotonin is the main thing that contributes to an overactive bowel. And it's also named for its ability to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. And there are drugs that will lower it, such as cyproheptadine. Usually, you can change your diet to reduce the inflammatory foods, such as starches or raw or undercooked vegetables that support bacteria that cause intestinal inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** So, less starch and less raw vegetables?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, salads and bread and beans and nuts. Even potatoes can sometimes feed the bacteria that cause the inflammation and release serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** Can you get a measurement on the serotonin that you have in your body? Would a blood test do that?

**RAY PEAT:** It will usually show up as increased reverse T3 and sometimes an actual low T3 count. But the simplest approach to it is to eat a bland fiber. Some people are okay with cooked oat bran as a mush, but some bacteria can feed on that. And cooked mushrooms and cooked bamboo shoots are bland fibers that will often lower the serotonin and diarrhea effect.
