**RAY PEAT:** Bacteria have their own... independent existence. They can generally live without us. Viruses depend on a higher organism to exist and when I was in grad school I asked a few people what they thought the origin of viruses was and no one wanted to suggest anything at all. The nature of the immune system at that time, 1970, people were still very puzzled about how we could have such an immense potential immunity to every sort of conceivable antigen. At that time they were still thinking in terms of being born, being created with every antibody, every gene, specifying an antibody in someone. I worked out the numbers and saw that it would take something the size of a tennis ball for a nucleus of every cell if it was to contain genes for every antibody that we produce. So people had to start thinking about innovation, the inventive process happening for the immune system and the origin of... viruses seems to be related to that process of cell invention, innovation, and interaction. People have said that viral diseases became a human problem at the same time that we shifted to an agricultural economy. Suggesting that diet could be part of it and historically wars, famines and deforestation, all sorts of natural disasters have led to epidemics and stress is one theory is that stress causes mutations in the virus causing a benign virus to mutate and become dangerous. Whatever the mechanism is, it's known that viruses appear and circulate during social stresses. When you look at an individual under stress, each type of tissue or organ sends out messages when it's under stress. There's little micro vesicles. Microsomes, various names for them, are emitted as a very fine sub-microscopic particle which contains nucleic acids, RNA, DNA, proteins, hormones, a great variety of substances that travel through other cells in the body and can be assimilated, transmitting, differentiated. Nucleic acid patterns to other cells that are under stress, helping them adapt. Messages, oh. Yeah, and when the individual is under stress, this is a natural. Everyone does this constantly. And the sicker you are, the more of these micro vesicles you have circulating around. And that seems to be why old serum transmits. Aging, young serum transfusions communicate a youthful physiology. So part of the stress of aging is that we're sending more and more of these distress messages around. And since viruses never could develop on their own, it's probable that they're......an emission from a stressed population, escaping from this therapeutic, corrective, adaptive process that happens always, constantly within our body as part of our normal development, some of that escapes. And getting into an organism which is in a different state of stress, that can become a virus that... microvesical that the recipient organism hasn't learned how to deal with.
**CONTEXT:** How do you interpret the viral inclusion in our DNA and our evolution with them, especially considering their role and our approach to dealing with damaging effects of coexisting with viruses?

**RAY PEAT:** It was the grains that made that kind of civilization easy to develop. And the grains are bad for you, right? Yeah, two things in particular. They're very high in phosphate and low in calcium. And that in itself I think is enough to damage your immunity.
**CONTEXT:** The host mentions that grains are bad for you and asks if it's the practice of growing wheat in large quantities that affected nutritional status, leading to decreased calcium and increased phosphate.

**RAY PEAT:** No. A high iron content in the diet is another thing that damages immunity because most microorganisms depend on iron as one of their host. You've always mentioned iron as being a very damaging element in terms of its ability to oxidize things and rapidly cause that kind of damage and that high iron is always associated with disease. That has been one of my interests in looking at the role of milk in public health because it's very low in iron and babies are immune to many diseases such as malaria and viral diseases while they're being breastfed and so they're getting a high calcium intake and a low iron intake.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of iron in immunity and its association with disease, prompting a discussion about milk's low iron content and its protective effect on breastfed babies.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some of these like respiratory infections are said to be only about 20% as frequent as breastfed babies. Malaria and such in the zones where it's endemic, babies don't get it until right after they stop being breastfed at 3 years old or so.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if breastfed babies have a statistically lower proportion of disease than weaned children.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the social invention of disease, especially viral disease, is a definite historical thing that you can see the cellular meaning in a very direct way There hasn't been much written about the concept of reductive stress but it simply means that when your cells are being burdened or overstimulated more than their oxidative metabolism can deal with They lose their pro-oxidative balance and go into the reductive stress. And that's where iron, for example, becomes toxic, because iron that is harmlessly stored in the oxidizing cell suddenly becomes a source of free radical destruction when the cell goes over into the overstimulated reductive state. I think that's the central fact of... The failure of the immune system is something interfering with the oxidative, pro-oxidative balance of the nervous system. And calcium deficiency or phosphate excess is another thing that contributes to that reductive stress. The parathyroid hormone shifts the cells in that direction. And so when you're eating too much... grain phosphate, you increase your parathyroid hormone that shifts your balance over in the direction of too much reduction, activating cellular weakness and oxidative destruction.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the historical link between viral diseases and agrarian societies, and Dr. Peat explains the concept of reductive stress and its connection to diet, iron, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, for the cell energy system, cancer and bacterial and viral infections and various types of inflammation are all the same process. It shifts from the production. Of carbon dioxide, which is an anti-entropic factor, the carbon dioxide spontaneously binds to all of the amino groups in proteins and shifts the acidic balance and so the mineral retaining balance of the cell, stabilizing it in the potassium retaining, calcium and sodium resisting. A condition of the cell, the stable conformation of the cell proteins and when something interferes with your ability to produce that stabilizing carbon dioxide, instead we produce lactic acid which adds exactly the opposite. It shifts us over into the unstable state, increased pH ionization that attracts calcium and sodium and so on. And can't take up enough magnesium and potassium.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the energetic basis for good health and how viruses fit into this framework, leading Dr. Peat to explain that cancer, bacterial, and viral infections, and inflammation are all the same process related to cellular energy production and the shift from carbon dioxide to lactic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's exactly the the same ideology that was imposed early in the 20th century as neo Darwinism and it basically removed some of Darwin's most important ideas and called it neo-Darwinism. But Darwin wouldn't have subscribed to neo-Darwinism. It's a purely mechanical theory of existence in which random variations in the genetic material is the essential idea. It's randomness from the bottom up. Random changes lead to... organization. Eventually, yeah, by weeding out ones that don't work, supposedly the random changes lead to something that worked. And then those, by random diffusion within a cell, do various things. Everything is explained in terms of random changes. The... ever since... Lamarck and Darwin, the practical people working with organisms, have known that that doesn't work. It's only the academic ideologues who have pushed that abstract view of genetics. James A. Shapiro has worked as a bacterial geneticist. He has written books describing bacteria as... Perfect genetic engineers, they're perfectly designing and engineering their genetic systems. But his view of all organisms or of nature is that life is cognitive all the way down, top to bottom. And instead of randomness, it's cognition, cognition on the cellular level. Brain level and so on.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about gene editing technology like CRISPR and its potential impact, prompting Dr. Peat to critique the neo-Darwinian ideology and contrast it with the idea of life as cognitive.

**RAY PEAT:** The cervical dysplasia that is one of its effects. Can, if it persists, can become carcinoma in situ or cervical cancer and so on. But all of the women that I've known who had cervical dysplasia or carcinoma in situ of the cervix surged up in just a few weeks by improving their diet and applying vitamin A, vitamin E progesterone. Taking supplements of folic acid and thyroid, 100% of them.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about human papillomavirus (HPV), genital warts, and cervical dysplasia, and their potential to cause cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** Um, the irritation among other things. Any irritation increases the reductive balance of the cell and the activation of estrogen production. And estrogen tends to lock it into that reductive and dysplastic condition. And these various things in different ways, vitamin A opposes the structural changes on epithelial cells. As an anti-estrogen differentiating effect, a progesterone knocks out the estrogen and its products. All of the metabolic changes shift the cell away from estrogen and inflammation towards the oxidative energy producing condition.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks how vitamin A, vitamin E, progesterone, folic acid, and thyroid can have an antiviral effect on cervical dysplasia and its progression.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the energy system should be able to use the antibodies to clean out the defective enzymes and not continue to be produced. I think supporting the GABA system with magnesium, glucose, carbon dioxide, anti-inflammatory things, the pro-GABA steroids derived from progesterone in particular, and the anti-immune steroid, DHEA, which helps to redirect. The antibody production. Estrogen tends to make us over-produce antibodies, but not be able to guide the correction process. So things that shift the whole physiology towards oxidation and the relaxed, highly energized state of the cell. I think that's the route out of all of those autoimmune diseases.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase, associated with type 1 diabetes and stiff man syndrome, and how gamma hydroxybutyrate and passion fruit juice influence these autoantibodies and GABA.

**RAY PEAT:** Those same things. The things that increase stability and energy production and carbon dioxide production. All of those are constantly... causing cells to be born and to differentiate in the right direction.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the impact of adverse childhood experiences or physical injuries, like a head injury, on the system discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** There are a lot of products or powders out there that have this. Normally it doesn't get into the brain because of the so-called blood-brain barrier, but when the brain is very injured, it is taken up because basically the brain needs it. But... I think it's enough just to eat a pro-oxidative diet, avoid the excess of phosphate, lactic acid, iron and so on.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if there is any use for GABA supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** The mechanism is that the carbon dioxide relaxes your skin blood vessels so your skin gets pink and warm and then the plastic bag prevents the water from leaving so it's just natural sweat vaporization. It's an inconvenience but it doesn't hurt anything.
**CONTEXT:** The host describes an experiment with CO2 bags on limbs and asks for a physiological explanation of what is happening and if it is beneficial or causes dehydration.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, people who have had terrible edema keeping their legs or lower body in a bag very efficiently get rid of the edema. So much of the water is going to leave through your kidneys and your lungs. It's being breathed out, but also some of it is leaving through your warm skin.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if the CO2 bag method is a good thing to do in place of other methods and if it removes "bad water."

**RAY PEAT:** No problem, except you might get mold. Might get what? Skin fungus, if you stay too humid, too long, it might favor the growth of microorganisms on your skin.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about potential downsides of the CO2 bag method.

**RAY PEAT:** The reason people benefit from taking a thyroid supplement isn't that their gland is weak. It's that their whole body is working to interfere with the function. There can be enough cyroxin circulating in the body of a hypothyroid person for a dozen people, but if you're......a body is not activating it properly, not able to mobilize the mitochondrial respiration, then that thyroxine is counterproductive in some cases. It interferes with the formation and effect of T3.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks why thyroid medication is often recommended long-term, unlike for adrenal glands, and if the thyroid can rejuvenate itself.

**RAY PEAT:** When you have eliminated most of the polyunsaturated fats in your tissues, then your tissues are extremely sensitive to thyroid hormone. And so your gland doesn't have to work very hard to keep you in a high metabolic condition. So that's the number one thing.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for two or three important things to do if one is not going to take thyroid medicine.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and by the time a person is 45 the body is really soaked in polyunsaturated fats. They talk about the N-3 fatty acids as being predominant in the brain, but that's only an old brain. A healthy, young, 5-year-old brain is highly saturated in comparison to a middle-aged brain.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for clarification on the thyroid issue, suggesting the problem is with the body's consumption of PUFAs rather than the gland itself.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you look at a newborn brain, people are now saying that all newborns are deficient in PUFA. But when you look at the brain function, the reason little kids can learn so spectacularly quickly is that their brains aren't overloaded with PUFA. is extremely high in the absence of PUFA. That was one of the things that Burr, in 1932 or 3, discovered was his animals that were made deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids. He put them under a bell jar and found that they were consuming oxygen almost twice as fast as the normal rats. And people are the same. We have a terrifically high in the absence of PUFA. metabolic rate when we're 2 or 3 or 4 years old and is gradually suppressed as we accumulate fish oil and veg oil.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks for perspective on the role of Omega-3 fatty acids, questioning whether the goal is to eliminate them or maintain a specific ratio, and if the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fats is more important.

**RAY PEAT:** It's definitely worrisome, and I think we should look for a much better way to get saturated fats, but the experiments like the Russians who used fully hydrogenated peanut oil... and found that old mitochondria were restored to the youthful functions just with that highly saturated peanut oil. The results are so good that despite the possible danger of traces of the catalyst...
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the safety of catalysts and particles from the hydrogenation process of oils.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it is the saturated fatty acids that are most anti-bacterial and probably help with the viral resistance.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks if more saturated fat means more anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties, referencing coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, although they're called antioxidants, like vitamin C is called an antioxidant, but when it's in the cell, when those flavonoids are in the cell. They function as pro-oxidants. They shift the cell into the healthy oxidized condition.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the antioxidant properties of flavonoids like epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate from green tea, and their role in reducing glutamate excitotoxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think it's exactly the same mechanism that aspirin has for its antiviral function, a pro-oxidative cell restorative function.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the antiviral properties of naringenin and hesperetin from citrus fruits, specifically in relation to the herpes virus.

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that it is sort of like a cofactor for vitamin A. Both of them are very important for healthy protein synthesis. I've experienced when I was about 50 I had aging eyebrows starting to get stiff and I found with a zinc supplement or a vitamin A supplement either one would reverse the age properties of those eyebrows. And I think that's because they accelerate normal. Differentiated protein synthesis and oppose the degraded estrogen excitation reductive process.
**CONTEXT:** The host asks about the role of zinc in combination with pomegranate rind extract against herpes virus.
