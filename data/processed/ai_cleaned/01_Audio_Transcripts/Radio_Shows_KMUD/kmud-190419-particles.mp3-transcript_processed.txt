**RAY PEAT:** Between 1968 and 72, I studied biology, emphasizing physiology, especially reproductive physiology, at the University of Oregon. But I didn't start academic study of biology until I had about 20 years of investigating controversies in biology and having decided that academic biology, especially in the U.S., was too dogmatic and commercial to really be scientific. I finally decided to go through the academic process and find out some of its weaknesses in the process. After getting a Ph.D., I just continued my independent studying, doing nutrition counseling, hormone counseling, and studying how the brain reproduces. And immune systems in particular interact with the environment, especially nutrition.
**CONTEXT:** Could you outline your academic and professional background for people who may not have heard of you before?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, I think it works the same way aspirin and progesterone and all of the cell stabilizers work. It increases the oxidative balance of the cell simply reinforcing the effect of the oxidative respiratory metabolism and that makes the cell able to resist improper excitation, stabilizes it against random irritation and just about anything that is a... unphysiological will destabilize the cell in the same direction, so these things protect against viruses, radiation, vibration, oxygen deprivation, sugar deprivation, too much of the polyunsaturated fats and too much phosphate, too little calcium, just anything that shifts the balance towards meaningless excitation or reducing proper energy production.
**CONTEXT:** You've talked about naringenin before as an antioxidant. Do you have a way of explaining naringenin's potential antiviral effects, as there are studies showing it's effective against herpes simplex virus?

**RAY PEAT:** When the virus wants to replicate, it excites the cell, gets the cell churning its mechanism and that damages the organism, produces more viruses.
**CONTEXT:** So it's cell stabilizing, which also has an antiviral effect because of its energy-saving effect rather than allowing the cell to become excited and in an excited toxic way wasting energy and being unstable?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the protein synthesizing function of zinc is like vitamin A for accelerating healing. So the protein synthesizing effect and this would be why it's... would be used in the production of sperm.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned zinc being used as a sun blocker and a healing agent for cold sores. Do you have anything to say about zinc that would support its activity?

**RAY PEAT:** For melanoma, sun really isn't the main factor. Most melanomas occur in areas that aren't... much exposed to the sun, back and inside of the thighs, even on the bottom of the feet. And it's a very hormone-sensitive thing. Estrogen has been suspected for a long time of being involved in it. I've seen dozens of apparent melanomas that disappeared. And a couple of people who... were diagnosed with terminal melanoma, a very advanced metastatic. It regressed when they changed their diet, used coffee, aspirin, and various nutritional things, vitamin D, a lot of orange juice and milk and such.
**CONTEXT:** In terms of cancers and skin cancers, do you have a way of defining it or understanding it outside of the regular sunburn causing genetic changes approach?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. So far, all of the melanoma people that I've talked to have had a really quick response from changing their diet.
**CONTEXT:** Is this an anti-estrogenic type of approach?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the first one I saw, a man about 80, 45 years ago, put progesterone on his diagnosed lip cancer and in a week or so it was gone.
**CONTEXT:** Have you come across many people yourself that have had either actinic keratosis or basal or squamous cell carcinomas that have been treated effectively without any medical intervention?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm not sure exactly where the industry came from. People have recognized that particles like soot spontaneously makes these highly structured, ultra-microscopic particles. And the industry... I think about 30 or 40 years after they recognized that these things were happening, they thought of things to do with them. About 35 years ago, I had some contact with the chemical industry, and without asking for it, they sent me two gallon-sized containers that weighed almost nothing. A sample of their products that they wanted to promote, I screwed the top off one of them and the material floated out like smoke. It was fumed silica, which is now being added to toothpaste and can be included in foods. It makes salad dressings seem more creamy.
**CONTEXT:** What's your opinion on nanotechnology, where it's come from and how fast it's moving?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, so it's something being produced by ordinary processes of industry and social activities. But they're deliberately... manufacturing it in vast amounts and thinking of new ways to make clothing deodorant, antiseptic, control heat and moisture better, but these particles, even in clothes, the fine particles, if they contact sweaty skin, actually......can pass through the skin into the bloodstream in small amounts.
**CONTEXT:** You mentioned soot, and that reminds me of the chimney sweeps in the late 1800s in England who would get testicular cancer. Soot is an ultrafine nanoparticle in its own right, isn't it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it contains... estrogenic, as well as carcinogenic chemicals, but the particles themselves, because of their shape and size... the reason asbestos is carcinogenic is its fine-pointed crystalline structure. And more or less spherical particles, if they're as small as the point of an asbestos crystal. The body interprets the, I think it's probably related to viral immune processes. It starts an inflammatory process when the particle has a certain fineness or length to diameter ratio. A small particle or a very small particle activates the inflammatory process, which excites. A whole system of the cell in the activity, which if you have the biological energy you can segregate, isolate and tamp down that excitation and recover, but when it becomes either too frequent, too intense, or your energy level decreases. The balance shifts towards inflammation, degeneration, a production of fibrous tissues rather than functional tissues.
**CONTEXT:** You're talking about the inflammatory process that can be triggered by nanoparticles.

**RAY PEAT:** The leakiness is an intrinsic property of the cytoplasm when it's under stress. But they talk about it in terms of gaps because they have a membrane barrier theory. It's mechanistic again, isn't it?
**CONTEXT:** The article from the National University of Singapore called it nanomaterial induced endothelial leakiness, or nano-L. They recorded that this nano-L process accelerated the movement of cancer cells from the primary tumor and also caused circulating cancer cells to escape from the circulatory system.

**RAY PEAT:** Just giving the cell glucose to get its energy up can stop that leakiness. And one of the interesting things about cancer, the tumors that instead of looking at what's inside the cancer cells, someone looked at what's outside of the cells in the tumor. They found there was a thousand times more ATP in the fluid of a tumor than in normal tissues. The cells are leaking and they're leaking their necessary materials so fast that they... are constantly in this over-simulated condition.
**CONTEXT:** This would be an energy-depleted state too, right?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping testosterone and related steroids up, the neuro steroids are very protective and testosterone has just been identified as one thing that goes down in relation to Parkinson's. The pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA and testosterone are all nerve protective and restorative. Vitamin D is another steroid that is extremely protective to the nerve cells.
**CONTEXT:** What's your view on Parkinson's?

**RAY PEAT:** Our phosphate should be reduced in the diet. Along with the pro-inflammatory fatty acids, so more carbohydrate and sugar and any good source of calcium and magnesium, milk, cheese, green vegetables, well-cooked, but less beans, nuts and meat because of their high phosphate content.
**CONTEXT:** How much vitamin D should I take?

**RAY PEAT:** The nerve regeneration of peripheral as well as central, there have been... Many studies in animals showing that vitamin D and progesterone work together to restore nerves. I think it's a good idea to have a blood test for both vitamin D and progesterone and keep the vitamin D at least in the middle of the normal range. Fifteen milligrams per milliliter is good, fifty or sixty, and progesterone should be... In the luteal range, even for postmenopausal women, it's good to supplement it if it isn't naturally detectable.
**CONTEXT:** I'm dealing with peripheral neuropathy in my feet, caused by chemotherapy. Are there ways to mitigate the inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the serum tests for estrogen are meaningful if you don't have a good amount of progesterone because the... after menopause. Estrogen begins forming inside cells all through the body, fat cells, skin cells, breast, uterine cells, everywhere that you don't want it, it can be formed from adrenal precursors and the anti-inflammatory things, aspirin, progesterone and thyroid, vitamin D, and the calcium in the diet all help to minimize that inflammatory process of spontaneously forming estrogen in the tissues.
**CONTEXT:** Is this because progesterone is directly opposing estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Avoiding polyunsaturated fat is very important because it blocks the activation of thyroid in the T3.
**CONTEXT:** I've never subscribed to that. I always thought butter was probably better. Also with the... I'm interested in the iodine.

**RAY PEAT:** The active thyroid hormone T3 is itself directly anti-inflammatory, but even the synchroid, it does have the good function of suppressing TSH, so if you are taking enough to keep your TSH close to zero, that has an anti-inflammatory effect, but the main anti-inflammatory action of thyroid is through the T3.
**CONTEXT:** I think my body has a problem with uptake. I think that's always been a problem for me.

**RAY PEAT:** Aspirin, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium are important anti-inflammatory components of a healthy lifestyle. Other things that people often neglect are getting sunlight as much as possible and doing things that are fun. You've heard of the... Enriched environment, rat experiments, made their brains not only more intelligent but also bigger. That kind of entertaining environment causes rats to produce more progesterone and to have lower estrogen. So just doing things that are fun and interesting keep your hormones in the right direction.
**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned aspirin, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium as important anti-inflammatory components of a healthy lifestyle. What are those things that you constantly highlight?

**RAY PEAT:** So you don't want to over breathe.
**CONTEXT:** Speaking of breathing, one of the main effects of taking thyroid or having good thyroid function is producing carbon dioxide.
