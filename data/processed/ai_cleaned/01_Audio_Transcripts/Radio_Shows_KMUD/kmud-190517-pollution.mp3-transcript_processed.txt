**RAY PEAT:** University of Oregon biology specializing in reproductive physiology and biochemistry as it related to that. PhD in 1972 and since then a continuing related study. Around 1960 I decided that any knowledge should be useful and so anytime I find out anything interesting I try to do it connected to practical reality.

**CONTEXT:** Could you please go over your academic professional background before we get started?

**RAY PEAT:** I think some of it is the present diet and the present polluted environment full of carcinogens and estrogens but I I think it was actually starting a long time ago influencing prenatal conditions even so that their parents exposure is transmitted affecting the way they develop in utero and affects the whole maturing process. So early childhood diseases have increased so much, colitis for example, I don't think it is likely that it's all some change in the diet that is making them so allergic, so reactive to... fairly ordinary things in the environment, but for example, it's known that the polyunsaturated content of the mother's diet increases the allergies of the babies and so colitis in young children is probably a reaction to the mother's diet, maybe from the earlier exposures of the parents.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think about the rise in adolescent pathologies and cancers, and the potential link to diet and environmental factors?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, last month I think I mentioned the French study that thought they were going to demonstrate improved prenatal brain function by giving these extremely unsaturated fats to the mother during pregnancy and they showed just the opposite, that it retarded development and retarded burning. In the early 1970s they were already seeing that the polyunsaturated fats during pregnancy made animals develop smaller brains that learned more poorly.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned the concerns about mothers being prescribed fish oils and omega oils during pregnancy. Can you elaborate on the research you've seen regarding their impact on child development?

**RAY PEAT:** The sperm is turning over constantly, and the blood cells are in constant diffusion, and irritants accelerate the growth, and the polyunsaturated fats, for example, break down. The fish oil is always oxidized by the time it gets into the bloodstream. Very little of it reaches the tissues in its entire form. So you get these oxidized fragments that are toxic to rapidly multiplying cells, causing deformity, atrophy in the sperm-forming tissue, and derangement of the......development course of the blood cells leading to leukemia and lymphoma.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding cancers like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, thyroid cancer, myeloid leukemia, and testicular cancer, what is the link you see between these and environmental effects, particularly from chemicals and polyunsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** In those rapidly multiplying tissues, I think it's much faster than in the average cancer. I think that's why leukemia has been seen so often in children just a few years old, where the typical cancer, a brain cancer or pancreatic cancer, for example......usually takes 20 years or more from the carcinogenic primary exposure to the appearance of the fully developed tumor, sometimes 40 years. But you can definitely show that there's a cause connection to it, but it's long delayed. And that has been useful to the polluting industries to claim that you can't. So the cause and effect relationship, but animal studies make it clear that although there is a delay, it's an absolutely causal process.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that younger people might be more susceptible to certain insults due to their rapid cell turnover. Can you explain this further?

**RAY PEAT:** In some of those tissues they're probably more susceptible. Because of their extreme speed of turning over, a little deviation in the regulatory process can send them wildly off course. But generally the extremely high metabolic rate and quick cell division lets young organisms bypass. They can find a way around. the toxic problem and overcome it.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the sensational headlines surrounding Candida auris and its classification as a "superbug"?

**RAY PEAT:** Strongly suggests that it's an advertising campaign for new drugs.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding antibiotic resistance and the future of treating infections, what is your perspective on alternative approaches?

**RAY PEAT:** In Eastern Europe and Asia long before penicillin was discovered, people were finding that there are. Bacteria killing viruses, the bacteriophage, and that technology has really developed to a high degree that it's of no interest to the countries that have a highly developed pharmaceutical industry, but these viruses infect only bacteria, kill certain species, bacteria never develop resistance to them. And the viruses are perfectly harmless to mammals and people.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that some people have reported successful treatments with bacteriophages in Eastern Europe. Can you elaborate on this?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, some people have told their stories of being diagnosed as... incurably infected with super bacteria going to Eastern Europe, getting totally cured quickly.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the impact of air pollution, particularly particulates from sources like diesel engines, on overall health?

**RAY PEAT:** The West Coast is far clean as an interior coming across the ocean. It does rain out or settle out lots of material.

**CONTEXT:** You've experienced a persistent cough, referred to as the "Humboldt hack," in your area. What are your thoughts on potential causes like redwood allergies or mold?

**RAY PEAT:** The foliage, big forests do emit quite a lot of organic material including pollen and probably is cause of a lot of......allergy. I know there's a region in Texas famous for its cedar tree allergies. I imagine conifer forests have people who are sensitive to their pollen.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding plastics and their ubiquitous presence, what are your concerns from an estrogenic and endocrine disruption perspective?

**RAY PEAT:** Plastics are, in general, very hydrophobic. And so the things like the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are famous carcinogens, these concentrate on the surface of the particles. And so even the particles that are macroscopic, when they're ingested, they deliver a big dose, concentrated dose of these organic carcinogens that rebound to the surfaces. But then there's the smaller particle is toxic in a directly structural way. Extremely small nanoparticles pass right through the cells in the circulatory system and are taken up by cells all through the body. And if you think of the scale, you know they're extremely small compared to bacteria. Compared to proteins inside the cells, they're relatively huge. They're very foreign to the structure of the cytoplasm. And so they're necessarily disruptive when they get in cells. And that, to the degree that their size interferes with the functions of the cytoplasm, they turn on alarm reactions of different kinds. One kind of reaction is to make the cell leaky, giving up proteins. Like when the liver is irritated, it leaks its proteins and enzymes into the bloodstream. But ATP itself leaks out when cells are structurally irritated by these particles. And then the ATP is recognized as a danger signal. The environment, and so it tends to be a self-perpetuating reaction. The cell gets irritated, sends out ATP which alarms other cells. They leak ATP and then you get a storm of cells losing their energy and creating excitement in their environment.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned persistent organic pollutants like bisphenol A. What are your concerns about these compounds accumulating in the food chain, particularly in shellfish?

**RAY PEAT:** The plastic particles tend to be concentrated up the food chain since they aren't well detoxified. The bigger older organisms are the ones that are most polluted and dangerous. So years ago we stopped eating the large fish, orange ruffy and halibut for example, labeled very long time and accumulate huge amounts of toxins.

**RAY PEAT:** And that information is part of why I'm an advocate of milk because you start with moderately polluted vegetation the cow eats it and sends it to the rumen where bacteria and fungus various microorganisms break it down and process it eliminate many of the toxic materials on the microbial level. Then it's filtered into the animal's bloodstream and filtered again into the memory gland for levels of extremely efficient filtering. So milk is probably the... safest food by a white margin.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the toxicity of glyphosate, particularly in relation to its impact on animals?

**RAY PEAT:** Thirty or forty years ago I knew people who had studied biology at the Oregon State. University, a land-grant university which specializes in agriculture and really their education is highly guided by industries, by the pesticide and herbicide industry. They were telling me that Roundup is specifically toxic to plants so it can't hurt animals. And they simply were taught that... There are some kind of biological ultimate distinctions between plant cells and animal cells, but really we have so much in common that it's not at all surprising that Roundup is extremely toxic to animals too.

**CONTEXT:** What do you think about the reported decrease in sperm production in young men and its potential link to pollution and decreased energy?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, everything, many things are called phytoestrogens and pseudoestrogens and so on, but anything injurious... creates inflammation and the inflammation leads to the production of estrogen and so anything that is toxic is going to reduce a man's testosterone, sperm production and in general virility.

**CONTEXT:** Can you clarify your stance on phytoestrogens and how they interact in the body, particularly for women experiencing menopausal symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** The official concept of what's estrogenic is what sticks to the so-called estrogen receptor. But the estrogen receptor, even in the total absence of estrogen. If you injure the cell or cut off the oxygen supply, the estrogen receptor goes through its actions of acting like estrogen is present, so that it's somewhat of a coincidence that a substance binds to the estrogen receptor doesn't mean that it's going to activate estrogen-like processes. It can inactivate. The estrogen system, depending on what it does to that protein. So the estrogenic substances, really, a lot of them have been called phytoestrogens, but what they're doing is either decreasing or intensifying the cell's energy production. Estrogen, characteristically, acts like the... loss of oxygen, and so if you have something that, in effect, suffocates the cell, that's estrogenic. If you have a so-called phytoestrogen, it might stick to the estrogen receptor, but if it is an oxidant and activates, catalyzes the oxidative processes, then it's acting as an anti-estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What are your views on vaccines, particularly concerning potential side effects and the information available to the public?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, I think many of them are far better informed than the doctors who ran against them. Suzanne Humphreys, for example, I think she was a kidney specialist who noticed that... when her patients were vaccinated at admission, they got worse than the patients who weren't vaccinated. She asked the hospital to stop vaccinating her patients and had a fight with the hospital officials and decided to specialize studying what happens with vaccinations for several years. So she's really well informed on it. And... oh. The doctors I see ranting about the anti-vaxxers are generally either totally ignorant and incompetent or they're lying. It's just a very simple question. There have been national waves like an epidemic of narcolepsy in Finland and another country following a big wave of vaccinations. Well established that the aluminum hydroxide which is in more than 100 vaccines is one of the systemically toxic pro-inflammatory particles. It's added to the vaccine simply because it rouses a generalized systemic inflammation that makes the body react more intensely to whatever antigen. related to disease might be present, but that same generalized, unfocused inflammatory reaction caused by the particles is exactly what turns on autoimmunity and other degenerative processes.

**CONTEXT:** For parents concerned about vaccinating their children, what nutritional or herbal strategies might be supportive of the immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** In terms of, okay, so you asked what could be done early. I think... as appropriate as that is your nutrition. Dr Pete's a big advocate of getting very good whole nutrition. So your diet is very important and obviously things that lower your metabolic energy like the polyunsaturates to be avoided. You certainly want to be looking at keeping your bowel clean so you want to be avoiding bread, gluten etc those kind of sources. But from an energy point of view, things that support your thyroid and I'm not just saying this is going to protect you against smallpox, you know, if smallpox starts suddenly reappearing but basically I think the metabolic energy of our people has gotten to a point where we're on the edge of being sick and so I think the vitality of our civilization has definitely decreased with all the environmental toxins, the pollutants, the rubbish in the food chain and the kind of lifestyles that we've engendered by not working like we used to. I think it all promotes a weaker organism. So erbally in that regard, there are certainly things that you can do that would be supportive of biological energy production.

**CONTEXT:** How do you compare flax oil to fish oil, and what are your thoughts on bentonite clay for flushing toxins?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh much much better in terms of stability, but it is slightly more stable than fish oil. The fish oil luckily is very quickly degraded. The flax is a little more persistent and so it it can be more toxic in the long run. The clay is slightly......soluble in stomach acid and releases at least a little aluminum and other toxins. And the particles, being very fine particles, are susceptible to persorption when......especially if your intestine is irritated, the contraction can force these particles right into the bloodstream. And the particle size can... be as much as 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell and so particles getting into the circulatory system can cause considerable microscopic damage.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on highly sensitive personalities and excess cortisol in the bloodstream?

**RAY PEAT:** There are lots of things you can do, starting with oxidative metabolism, doing things that preserve your thyroid function. And when your thyroid is functioning efficiently, you can turn your cholesterol fairly massively into pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA, which are the main opponents of cortisol. It stops inflammation but it activates a lot of degenerative breakdown processes when it isn't backed up by large amounts of these three anti-inflammatory stabilizing steroids. So thyroid and good nutrition, adequate protein, vitamin A, vitamin D, all of the nutrients help you do the conversion to the DHEA....progesterone and pregnenolone to block and neutralize and reverse the effects of the cortisol.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on improving the liver's function to metabolize and clear waste from circulation?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh yeah, and all of the tissues apparently have taste receptors, especially for bitter, and so the bitters are acting on these particular receptors to have a calming, stabilizing effect all through the body, but the whole energy and the protein synthesizing system is involved in detoxifying it. It uses glucose or fructose, turning it into both vitamin C in most animals, but in humans, only to glucuronic acid, which is then attached to toxins for excretion. And if you're well-nourished, have the B vitamins, adequate carbohydrate and protein, then your liver is pretty efficient. It can catch toxic substances, especially hydrophobic materials, it has proteins that can catch massive amounts of these things out of the circulation, holding them for as much as 24 hours while the enzymes degrade it, either break it down into other substances or attach glucuronic acid or sulfate. To make it water soluble for excretion and polyunsaturated fatty acids can be processed and excreted in the same way to prevent the damage that oxidizing them does.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned bitters. How do they link to reducing inflammation, and what is the mechanism?

**RAY PEAT:** There's a protein, the same that we have in our tongues, the stomach and liver tissue, various lungs. The whole respiratory system can detect the bitter substance and in doing so it activates an anti-inflammatory process.

**CONTEXT:** What is your view on the use of supplemental digestive enzymes like lipase and protease?

**RAY PEAT:** It doesn't have any use. The traditional thing was basically dehydrated animal pancreas tissue, and those are so similar to our own enzymes that they really do work. But you have to be cautious that because they're... simply dehydrated, they are a potential source of infection. But I'm skeptical about the enzymes derived from fungus, because in the same way you can't absolutely purify them and so they're going to drag along some of the fungal antigens and you have to watch out for allergic reactions because... If you're sensitive to the fungus and the chins you might react to their enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the political will of governments to address environmental pollution and create a cleaner world?

**RAY PEAT:** I can mention a book that is very important on that issue called The Politics of Cancer by Samuel Epstein written in 1978 with publication date. And he shows that the knowledge of how to prevent most cancer has been around for almost a hundred years. Corporations that pollute run the government agencies and the agencies that you would think should be protecting the public, American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, many research organizations and universities are funded so generously by the polluting industries that they are working against the public, even though... the public pays them, pays the government and these foundations supposedly for their protection. Actually, they're simply perpetuating the polluting process.
