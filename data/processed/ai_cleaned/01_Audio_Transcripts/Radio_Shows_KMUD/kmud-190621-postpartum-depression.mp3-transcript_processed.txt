**RAY PEAT:** "For the last 10 or 15 years, the FDA has acted as though it's in the business of creating monopolies. They did it with the sedative or semi-anesthetic drug OxyBate. Several years ago and it went from costing a few dollars for a bottle of it to thousands of dollars for a course of treatment. Because it's been patented and the company's been allowed to use this as their standard and it's been protected? Yeah, and after that they declared that quinine was a new drug and assigned a new drug. approval to one company and the since they depend on fees to approve the drugs a large part of their existence sees the money coming in from the drug as sustaining their existence and that if Doctors for example wants to use a quinine bark or a natural nutritional substance for a therapy and It happens to compete with one of these new drug assignments It's in effect the doctors attempting to break a monopoly and in some situations doctors are actually losing their licences for using traditional medical reasoning and avoiding the so-called evidence-based medicine."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the FDA approval of brexanolone (allopregnanolone) for postpartum depression, highlighting its high cost and the fact that it's a naturally occurring metabolite. He questions why readily available progesterone or pregnenolone aren't used instead.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, what they mean by evidence is a study that cost maybe $150 billion and not just any researcher has that money to test, for example, a particular nutrient or hormone to treat a disease. It constitutes good evidence in this new paradigm, the monopoly paradigm. It's a study that no one but the giant corporations can afford. And so the only drugs that have legal approval by the FDA are monopoly drugs. And the extent to which the state licensing boards......are putting pressure on doctors to conform and follow guidelines. In some situations, it's just getting ridiculous that they're telling doctors, for example, not to consider any of the traditional signs of hypothyroidism in treating hypothyroidism, but to go only by the TSH, to ignore all of the metabolic......unfunctional signs that are recognized for 200 years as hypothyroidism. There's a kind of communism, right, where there's only one......there's only one way. Um... Well, it's strictly monopoly capitalism. Maybe totalitarianism. Okay, right, well, communism for the pure... the pure definition of the word, maybe not, but it's a very dictatorial. Yeah, okay, so, you know, you can't produce these drugs unless you can afford to play, and when you do you get the monopoly and the payback keeps the system going and keeps the monopoly going in place."

**CONTEXT:** The host is elaborating on the concept of "evidence-based medicine" and its implications for medical practice.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the newsletter I mentioned the movement to abolish the so-called basic science part of medical education the first two years where they actually study science. But just describe that a little too, you know, just for people to hear it because most people won't... subscribe to a newsletter and they probably won't understand, won't hear this. So, just speak a little bit about that, about the person who came up with this ridiculous statement and how, what it implies. Yeah, he has written articles pointing out that there have been over 350 reversals of traditional medicine done by these big gold standard corporate studies. And so he's seeming like a progressive, constructive person wanting to get truth into science. But he says that these big studies are the evidence that we have to take into account. And all we need is guidelines what to do, how to use these approved... well-documented, so-called scientific treatments. And if we have guidelines for all of the diseases, how to just follow a chart of reasoning laid out by the committees, government basically, for treating a disease. Everyone will treat the disease in the same way....becoming blind to the individual variations and their unique history. It's trying to reduce and abstract medicine to the point that no brain is necessary, only following guidelines."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks Dr. Peat to elaborate on a point made in his newsletter regarding the potential abolition of basic science in medical education.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a lot of it goes into the water. Oh, I see. And so, does the pufa remain in the leaves even though you're boiling them? Or does that mitigate itself too? Yeah, a lot of it remains tied into the proteins of the leaf. And when you eat it, your bile salts will cause you to absorb most of the pufa that is associated with the protein in the leaf. So you're saying no matter how much you boil it, that's one of the reasons why you don't eat green vegetables?"

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the preparation of green vegetables, specifically regarding PUFA content and whether boiling or steaming mitigates it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, someone tested that and found that just a tiny dose of roll... progesterone 20 milligrams tripled the amount of allopregnalone in the body. 20 milligrams, right, so there's absolutely no reason not to use orally progesterone or pregnenolone and if the sole purpose of treating patients, I guess, have been pre-identified as having post-pardon depression because they're still in the hospital, in this hospital situation. For a 60-hour infusion, that just seems, gosh, I don't know, it just seems like an expensive stay in a very expensive, you know, hotel, it's like a, I don't know, is this... Yeah, ordinary reasoning would say that if you want to increase the amount of allopragmental in the brain, why not take 20 milligrams of progesterone?"

**CONTEXT:** The host is reiterating the question about using progesterone or pregnenolone instead of the expensive allopregnanolone infusion for postpartum depression.

**RAY PEAT:** "In healthy women, the progesterone level in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Increases considerably during the time when the brain is being repaired after the stress of pregnancy. But the amount of cholesterol can be determining. Normally during this time of progesterone increase in the healthy woman after the birth, cholesterol... is well above normal and is the precursor for making the large amount of progesterone. But women with postpartum depression typically have a reduced level of cholesterol and so they just couldn't possibly make enough progesterone if the precursor isn't there. And vitamin A and thyroid are other limiting factors. So even if the cholesterol is there, but they're low thyroid. Or have a vitamin A deficiency, then they won't make the restorative amount of progesterone. And like that one experiment showed, 20 milligrams orally of progesterone is enough to triple the amount of allopregnanolone. A normal cycling woman produces about 30 milligrams of progesterone daily in the luteal phase. That would be a reasonable amount therapeutically in the postpartum time but the requirement depends if she's still under stress and producing or not eliminating estrogen as well as she should then it might take larger amounts and that depends on the things like your thyroid function. Cholesterol level vitamin A and stress hormones."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about progesterone supplementation postpartum to aid in gray matter recovery and what a reasonable amount and duration would be.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, I started thinking in relation to the previous question that it isn't just a matter of the thyroid and adrenals, but all of the hormones are involved in the energy process. And so the... importance of sodium and calcium in pregnancy, it isn't just for blood volume and bone building and such, but those are closely involved with thyroid in avoiding the adrenal stress hormone excess and keeping up the energy system."

**CONTEXT:** The host asks about potential treatments for gestational diabetes as a symptom of an energetic defect, linking it to the previous discussion on hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and people who have been creating turmoil just sit around and enjoy and smile. That's my own."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking if people with chronically low thyroid and overactive adrenals might create crises to maintain their hormonal state, and Dr. Peat agrees with the premise.

**RAY PEAT:** "It is used to make the steroid hormones, all of them from cholesterol, thyroid and vitamin A travel together on a protein in the blood, they're so closely associated and are taken up by the steroid producing cells together, so you just don't produce....steroid hormones, for example, without vitamin A, and it's used in protein synthesis, making hair and skin and so on, will fail if you're deficient in vitamin A. Bucose membranes thicken and stop producing bucose with a vitamin A deficiency. Someone sent me these books, a recent author, claiming that there is vitamin A toxicity. Rampant. And I looked through it and couldn't find any facts at all."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for Dr. Peat's views on chronic vitamin A toxicity, as proposed by a website.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many, many years ago some Arctic explorers ate polar bear liver and their skin got inflamed and started peeling off. And that has been cited in textbooks for I guess 80 years or so as proof that vitamin A is toxic but you know polar bears sometimes eat fish that have been poisoned by algae and their livers will store that for up to 24 hours at a very toxic level and they might have just gotten some fish toxin, algae toxin by way of the fish. So even that very famous basis for claiming vitamin A toxicity, there's no fact and when the drug companies were coming out with things like Retin-A, there were sudden news releases all around the country from medical schools reporting incidents in which people for example went blind from taking vitamin A. And one of them at the University of Oregon, I phoned the department and tried to get in contact with a professor who had told that to a newspaper. I couldn't get any personal verification. I think they were all just made up with the encouragement of the drug companies to create the desire for the safe, non-toxic....synthetic vitamin A's."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking for Dr. Peat's comment on the historical basis for claims of vitamin A toxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, and people who have a history of stress besides all of the essential nutrients, protein and vitamins and trace minerals and so on. Will have an increased requirement for sodium and calcium and the vitamin D to help assimilate the calcium."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing metabolic energy defects and their role in various conditions, prompting Dr. Peat to discuss essential nutrients.

**RAY PEAT:** "Like the other autoimmune diseases, it's much more common in women than men and animal models can be created with an estrogen excess. Estrogen activates a whole row of inflammatory processes. And thyroid and progesterone are things that have been... pretty successful. Women believed they were going to have to have a kidney transplant or something. When they took progesterone and thyroid, they found they had no more symptoms. So you could definitely see it as an estrogen excess symptom?"

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Dr. Peat's approach to this autoimmune disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it's very toxic at such small amounts, extremely small amounts, that interfering with glycine wouldn't do much at that tiny level. I think the mechanism is more likely related to... DNA regulation. DNA damage?"

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about the potential damage of glyphosate, specifically its similarity to glycine and potential displacement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, a lot of it remains tied into the proteins of the leaf. And when you eat it, your bile salts will cause you to absorb most of the pufa that is associated with the protein in the leaf. So you're saying no matter how much you boil it, that's one of the reasons why you don't eat green vegetables?"

**CONTEXT:** The host is clarifying the impact of PUFA in green vegetables, even after boiling.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, but the principle, two things stand out. Pro-opio melanocortin is the precursor protein for making melanocortin and beta-lipoprotein and the endorphins and ACTH. And so those are things that come up during the stress reaction. And so the melanocortin and its receptors are normally activated during stress. And again, if you take... one of the end hormone products and take it out of the context of the rest of the stress reactions, you're going to have wildly unpredictable effects. And the suppression of appetite is one of the things known to be associated with those receptors. And if a woman is lacking desire for a physical reason rather than pain......just social, there are probably serious metabolic problems that are going to be ignored if you just try to push up one single mental function. And you should be looking at the, for example, the DHEA is a great activator of libido, but it goes down under stress when cortisol rises. The cortisol has an anti-libido effect, suppressing the effect of DHEA, so you should be concentrating on lowering the stress and if anything, giving a boost to the anti-stress things with pregnenolone, progesterone or DHEA or thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** The host is asking about a new drug called Vyleesi, based on melanocortin, for increasing sexual arousal.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah. Alright, thanks very much for your time, Dr. Peete. It's three minutes to the top of the hour here and I'll let people know how to find you. Ok, thank you. Ok, so for people that have listened to the show this evening, Dr. Ray Peete's website is www.raypeete.com. He's got lots of articles that he's written, he produces a newsletter, it's fully referenced and keep your eyes and ears out. The show is going to be up on an Instagram page that's going to be dedicated to Dr. Pete, what he actually said, not what unfortunately some of the bloggers on the Ray Pete forum are just creating their own imaginations and creating a theory from it, but just to make sure that people get exactly what's been said, it'll be posted on the internet here, probably three or four months time, busy getting together and collaborating. I'm with a very kind person who's agreed to type up a lot of the stuff and to put it up and I'll be collating it with that person and probably in three or four months we'll have an Instagram page dedicated to Dr. Pete's philosophies, we can be reached Monday through Friday or in fact Monday through Sunday if you just want to leave a message or you want to write an email, it's andrew at westernbotanicalmedicine.com or 1-888-WBM-ERB. Thanks for listening and until the third Friday of next month, thanks for joining."

**CONTEXT:** The host is concluding the show and providing information on how to find Dr. Peat's work.
