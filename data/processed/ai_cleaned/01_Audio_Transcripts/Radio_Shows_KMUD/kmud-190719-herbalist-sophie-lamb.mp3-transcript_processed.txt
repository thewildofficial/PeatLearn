**RAY PEAT:** "After studying and teaching the humanities and linguistics and various things except biology, before 1968, then I went to graduate school in biology to get a PhD in 1972. Specialized in aging physiology of reproduction but in general studied physiology and biochemistry and since then have been doing short courses and counseling and such."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked to provide a rundown of his academic and professional background.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think just about anything harmful to the parents, especially the mother, and especially during pregnancy, almost any environmental harm is going to increase the rate of autism. For example, environmental estrogens and things that cause hypothyroidism, things that cause obesity are known to be causes of... autism but I think for example in Texas there was a study showing that Latino kids especially Mexican immigrants were at a much lower rate of autism than the well medicalized white residents and I think a major cause of... a major source of adversity during pregnancy is what John Goffman saw was the major cause of breast cancer and heart disease in the United States, namely medical radiation or medicalization in general in the case of autism, including too many x-ray exams for the mother, too many treatments in general, including bad... thyroid therapy, bad endocrine therapy and the use of many toxic drugs and touching has been identified as one of the things that makes kids emotional system and nervous system develop properly and there has been a kind of a culture of ignoring the babies in the... standard American culture and in Latinos, they are very touchy compared to the Anglo population, so I think there are lots of causes and enriching the environment, removing toxins and improving the thyroid and progesterone of the person's system, all of the endocrine system can be modified and improved too. Remedy, to some extent at least, the autistic."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about a safe approach to helping autistic children and what he sees as a cause.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The intestinal flora produce lots of toxins with the yeast in particular. Produce both alcohol and estrogen and the estrogen is I think more toxic than the alcohol."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the presence of gut organisms that metabolize carbohydrates producing ethanol and how that could impact a child with autism.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid is the essential thing for being able to store glucose....in the form of glycogen in the liver, in particular, but the muscles are a major reservoir, too, besides the liver, and the brain itself stores, when conditions are good, stores quite a bit of glycogen locally. And when you run out of glycogen in your brain, muscles, and liver, you mobilize free fatty acids out of stores, and the free fatty acids condition....create the condition of diabetes in the brain as well as throughout the body, it turns off brain metabolism by essentially poisoning the mitochondria, blocking the ability to use any glucose that your body produces by breaking down protein with the stress hormones."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the liver's ability to store glycogen and any impairment in that which would trigger insomnia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, those doctrines against them were distinctly created by the pharmaceutical industry when they came out with new diuretics around 1950. They convinced doctors that pregnant women had to use them because it would prevent weight gain and water retention in pregnancy. And just absolute fabulous confabulation of making up diseases that didn't exist so they could sell their product and in the process they destroyed many many pregnancies in the United States with their salt restriction plus diuretics and the sugar thing appeared around the same time. With the marketing of the polyunsaturated vegetable oils, those were defined as essential and so the food industry first promoted them as medicinal in great quantity, a hundred times more than any possible theoretical essentiality....would indicate. But they were promoted to lower cholesterol, but then a doctor showed that sugar raises cholesterol. And so the food industry created the cholesterol myth to sell their polyunsaturated oils and then to explain away heart disease. And the elevated cholesterol, which really is the result of hypothyroidism, almost all of it. The ban on sugar to lower, prevent heart disease was promoted all through the 60s and 70s. And again, the insulin industry and the... the drug, the alternatives to insulin were promoted along with basically a sugar-free diet, teaching people that sugar causes diabetes. Yeah, and then again, of course, then there's a whole sugar feeds cancer misdirection."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the undoing of instinctual cravings for sugar and salt.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah lots of stresses contribute but definitely not good foods like saturated fats and sugar."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about liver scarring and fish oil consumption from a physiological perspective.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "No, I think they're mildly harmful. Because? They... To the extent that they break down, they can be absorbed and release toxic things. Any minerals such as magnesium and trace minerals would be beneficial, but the substance, the fulvic acid and humic acid, are not in themselves safe."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the benefits of fulvic and humic acids for plant nutrition.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I've seen lots of people who either were able to stop their thyroid supplement or greatly reduce it, and that happens, one or two people, it happened in a week. They broke the pattern so quickly. They didn't need it after having been in very serious condition. Others take three to four years, for example, a fat person who is well saturated with unsaturated fats....has to get rid of a lot of that stored thyroid inhibiting fat before they can get away from a supplement. What about all the electromagnetic radiation that's certainly disruptive to thyroid activity that's nothing to do with diet? Yeah, and the environmental estrogens. There are so many things like tooth filling material. Packaging of food, just in almost any food, you'll get some of these estrogens which block the thyroid."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked why, if PUFA consumption is reduced, thyroid function doesn't fully recover without continued supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Red light has a variety of effects, all involving action on electrons, which are... out of their normal condition or orbit, especially cytochrome oxidase copper enzyme, the blue enzyme of the crucial enzyme of oxidative metabolism. Stress lowers that activity just going through the night. It lowers its ability to oxidise nutrients. Just a few minutes of exposure to red light will restore the electronic balance of the copper and restore the copper to its relation to the enzyme, activating the enzyme. But there are a lot of other effects related to inflammation. For example, radiation poisoning at a lethal dose can be neutralised....point that the animal will survive by exposing, within the first hour or so, to red light following the x-ray or gamma radiation."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the physiological benefits of red light compared to CO2.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the main problem is quite a few people are allergic to it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked about the benefits of drinking celery juice.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Oh, I try to get it uh all from fruit but when I don't have good fruit then I fill in with uh quite quite refined sugar and I try to get uh more than half of my calories from sugar."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked how much sugar he consumes daily and his sources.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "The hemoglobin depends on body temperature for one thing. Fiber is required for absorbing copper from your diet, and the copper is needed for......integrating the iron with the blood, with the heme, and getting your waking temperature up to close to normal, close to 98 degrees at waking and 98.6 during the day, and making sure that your arms and legs are warm, close to your body temperature. That's possible, too. Have a normal oral temperature and you'll have very cold feet and the blood is made in your long bones so they have to be warm and the thyroid is the main factor keeping the blood synthesis going and the copper absorption to use the iron and you can get a very high intake of iron in a safe way if you eat some liver and eggs every day and have orange juice with it."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked for his perspective on raising iron levels and hemoglobin for someone with low ferritin and saturation, despite dietary efforts.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "If your iron saturation is down around 5% or lower, then that might justify, have you tried oral supplements? I haven't at this stage. I've known people who had such terrible effects from iron injections that I think would be, if you're seriously low in saturation, then I think the first thing would be if the liver and eggs haven't worked. And oysters are another very good source. I have those as well."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked if he would recommend iron injections for low iron levels.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, checking your vitamin D level and your calcium intake. Those support your thyroid function and magnesium and calcium are necessary for the thyroid to work right. And you should check your pulse rate at the same time as your waking temperature but also... about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning and if your temperature is steady even after you've had some carbohydrate, fruit juice and such, then it might be something other than high adrenaline."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked what can be done for someone with a high temperature and pulse who still has chronic fatigue and other hypothyroid symptoms.

---

**RAY PEAT:** "I think there are lots of antiseptic agents that are safer than that. It isn't especially dangerous, but long-time use could promote cancer. Things like food fibers, any kind of fibrous food that goes through you without causing inflammation or gas will help to reduce that. Disinfect your intestine."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked if he has heard of chlorine dioxide and if it would help for reductive stress issues like autistic symptoms.
