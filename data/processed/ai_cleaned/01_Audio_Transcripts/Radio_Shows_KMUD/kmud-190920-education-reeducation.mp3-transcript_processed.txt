**RAY PEAT:** When serotonin was identified chemically as something in the body, it was seen to contract, constrict, smooth muscles in first the intestine, then blood vessels, uterus, and then it was discovered to exist in the brain. And in the first several years, up into the mid and late sixties, people were still looking at the actual research, and they would look for things that worked with it or antagonized it. And they saw that things like the ergot family, LSD and related things, were able to block it, prevent the actions of constricting muscles in all of the known tissues. By blocking serotonin, you're saying? Yeah, blocking the nerves, the main nerves that produce serotonin are just turned off by LSD and psilocybin and the best known psychedelics. But as that was being known in the 1960s, the government was also coming out and......starting to criminalize the psychedelic chemicals, which were in the news repeatedly as anti-serotonin agents. And when the government criminalized these, the drug companies were starting to see that they could form the basis of drug products. And... It was in their interest to say that those evil, illegal drugs are anti-serotonin. And naturally they make you insane and kill you and so on. Because the good stuff which makes you sane is serotonin. And that created a foundation of public opinion. To build the whole myth on the same way the government puts out stories politically and economically and such. To create a background of belief in which future events can be backed up. So that the government has been creating political myths, the chemical companies. That's how it happened. Use the government to support their economic sales myths.
**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the historical narrative and propaganda surrounding serotonin and its connection to psychedelics?

**RAY PEAT:** The animal research has the advantage that they can take fluids from anywhere in the animal or grind up its brain and extract, see what's actually in there, where you can't grind up a person's tissues. And if you stress......an animal, injure it in horrible ways, suffocate it, for example, you will increase some of the stress hormones, cortisol, estrogen, and serotonin. Our chronic stress increases serotonin in the brain as well as several other tissues. If you make an animal unusually happy. Comparing an average lab animal, or one which has been tortured deliberately, or one which has been put in a big vacation space with entertaining things to do, the one that is suffering from all kinds of mistreatment will have high cortisol and lower adrenaline, usually. The cortisol is driven up by the corticotropic release hormone, which is activated primarily by serotonin. So serotonin, in triggering the stress hormones, rises itself in these miserable animals. Their serotonin is higher. The happiest animals have the lowest serotonin as well as lower acetylcholine and generally a little higher adrenaline. They're very alert, learn very well, and have very low serotonin. If you give these exactly the same chemicals that you are giving, starting to increasingly young kids, if you give SSRIs to adolescent hamsters, for example, they become vicious and aggressive.
**CONTEXT:** What does animal research reveal about the relationship between serotonin levels and stress, aggression, and happiness?

**RAY PEAT:** Serotonin seems to be the crucial thing for putting that into effect, and anti-serotonin drugs are being... They're starting to be used. as anti-depressants, but they have been used to cure learned helplessness and so on.
**CONTEXT:** How does serotonin relate to learned helplessness, and what is the role of anti-serotonin drugs in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** About 35 or 40 years ago, a psychiatrist, psychologist, C.R. Cloninger, was defining personality types and relating people to animal studies, he was proposing that higher serotonin in the process of making people more depressed or anxious or aggressive, what the type of personality promoted by that was harm avoidance. Rather than a creative activity, the animals figured out different ways to avoid being hurt, fearful, anxious and so on.
**CONTEXT:** What was C.R. Cloninger's early theory regarding serotonin and personality types?

**RAY PEAT:** Look at the brains of people who commit suicide that they have found. Several different kinds of support for the idea that they were suffering from excess serotonin production.
**CONTEXT:** What do brain studies of individuals who have committed suicide suggest about serotonin levels?

**RAY PEAT:** They revised their theory and decided that it was in humans too caused by increased serotonin. Originally they had suggested it might be the loss of serotonin but they have changed their minds now.
**CONTEXT:** How has the understanding of the cause of learned helplessness evolved, particularly concerning serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** Psilocybin I think works very similarly to LSD on suppressing the serotonin nerves.
**CONTEXT:** How does psilocybin's mechanism of action compare to LSD's in relation to serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** They were seeing good results in treating alcoholism and depression and a lot of psychiatric things.
**CONTEXT:** What were the early positive findings from research into LSD and psilocybin?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the place that it operates is so at the heart of things that it's best to let it develop under its own rules for example the tryptophan which is turned into serotonin has a resonant aromatic electron system which is very responsive to light electromagnetic energy and oxidation reduction and if this is in practically all proteins this amino acid and so those proteins intrinsically you have their electronic uniqueness which makes them responsive to the interaction with other molecules and lets the whole molecule have the possibility of resonantly interacting with its environment so it's sort of like the nerve center of each protein molecule the structure of most cells, every cell in some condition is built on and uses to move the micro-tribacular, micro-architecture of the cell a framework of filaments and tubes that give the cell stiffness and movement and... these are increasingly being thought to be electronically or reductively interactive with mobile electrons giving the tube a special function in the structure, not just stiffness but also electronic interactions across the whole cell simultaneously. So again it's like the nerve system in a protein is tryptophanes nerve system and the cell is a microtubules containing these proteins and serotonin acts on these responsive proteins and microtubules and other systems in the cell with a special interaction so serotonin can stop the polymerization of the microstructure of a cell can interrupt it so that it can start de-differentiating and getting ready to divide and when something is so basic to the existence of a cell I think it's the worst thing you can do to try to intervene.
**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental role of serotonin and tryptophan within cellular structures and processes, and why is intervention with serotonin problematic?

**RAY PEAT:** Avoiding serotonin and promoting drugs is one thing because that's a factor in creating diabetes as well as the other things it does. But my experience with diabetes started with my father having a diagnosis of serotonin....extreme diabetes of the classical kind in which he had lost about 50 pounds of weight and wasn't very big to start with, and by looking at the old literature, medical literature from the beginning of this century, they found that eating certain foods, in this case it was primarily brewer's yeast. But he totally cured himself, lived about 35 years after that. And that got me interested, and I read that in the 19th century, England and France, there were two doctors who absolutely cured the mortally sick. Very, very profoundly diabetic people by letting them, first they thought they were just going to let them die happy by not starving them for sweets, but they let them eat as much sugar as they wanted and that happened to be almost a pound of sugar a day and instead of dying over a period of several days the conversion of protein. The sugar decreased and finally stopped and they were covered. They stopped wasting. Yeah, and what they had done was broken the pattern of stress simply by letting them follow their appetites. And that led to investigating what actually is the cause of diabetes, not eating sugar for sure. Sugar. The beta cells that make insulin are always regenerating and sugar promotes that regeneration and supports it. If you don't have sugar, they can be created as insulin producing cells and die and it's these pre-fatty acids. Which are killing the beta cells constantly. Right because if you don't have enough sugar, you break your muscle tissue down, you generate free fatty acids in an attempt to raise glucose.
**CONTEXT:** What is the role of serotonin in diabetes, and what historical and personal experiences inform your understanding of diabetes treatment, particularly regarding sugar and beta cell function?

**RAY PEAT:** Avoiding very long winters is important because of the stress of the long nights but I think altitude is very important because the high oxygen pressure at sea level is constantly creating stress in itself random tendency to oxidize fats spontaneously which disappears at a higher altitude when you find the right altitude for your particular adaptation then you're able to retain the right amount of carbon dioxide so that the oxidative processes run more smoothly without stress.
**CONTEXT:** How do factors like winter, altitude, oxygen pressure, and carbon dioxide levels influence thyroid function and overall metabolic stress?

**RAY PEAT:** It definitely impacts the liver but does acetaminophen impact steroid function? Nothing that occurs to me right now but through damage to your liver it undoubtedly will.
**CONTEXT:** Does acetaminophen impact steroid production or function, and what is its effect on the liver?
