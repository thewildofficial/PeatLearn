**RAY PEAT:** The idea of a membrane barrier on the surface of a cell is really a myth. Gilbert Ling spent 40-50 years disproving that myth. It's really the structure of the cytoplasm that creates the barrier between any cells inside and outside. And Russian researchers in the middle of the last century showed that the energy level of the cell is what governs its barrier function. In a high energy state, the cell has a lipid-loving quality, takes up fat. And when it's de-energized, a water-soluble dye will leak in it. That has been demonstrated for more than a hundred years on simple organisms as well as tissue culture. So it's really an old idea. But about 50 years ago, someone demonstrated in rats that the... Lipid-loving quality of the brain is what governs the so-called barrier function. The brain has to live in a very high-energy state. And in that high-energy state, it's more hydrophobic, more fat-loving. And these researchers put an emulsion of, I think it was soy oil. into the carotid artery of a rat and then measured the content of the blood coming out of the vein draining the brain. And they found that on a single pass through the brain, 17% of this fat was taken up from the blood. And if you imagine that when you're under stress, your blood becomes loaded with unbound fatty acids, free fatty acids that travel on the albumin in the blood. And hormones, as well as free fatty acids, travel on the albumin. And when you're under stress, the increased free fatty acids will displace those hormones. And the albumin delivers large amounts of free fatty acids or fat soluble hormones to the capillaries serving the brain. And the fact that the fat solubility is what governs the entry. That was well established, but people still resisted the idea that hormones could freely get into the brain without having a special transporter. But as long as they're able to be carried on albumin, albumin can deliver its burden right into the brain. And the water solubility......of tryptophan has been one of the arguments that people insist that the huge amount of tryptophan produced in your intestine and carried on your platelets can't get into the brain to influence your behavior, even though when people had a tumor, the......carcinoid tumor, I think it was called, that produces huge amounts of serotonin. They were characteristically having emotional turmoil. There would be a surge of serotonin, and their skin would show vasoconstriction and vasodilation alternating, and their emotions would... have extremes of ups and downs that went with these surges of serotonin, so there's a good medical history of the effect of intestinal serotonin getting into the brain, and serotonin itself powerfully breaks down barriers, including the blood-brain barrier, so-called, the lungs and the brain......happen to be the best equipped with enzymes that destroy serotonin, the monoamine oxidase is very concentrated in these capillaries, so normally when the blood passes through the lungs, it happens that the surge of oxygen changes the pH and carbon dioxide content and causes......serotonin to be released from the platelets, where it can be destroyed by these MAO enzymes in the lining of the lung, and the same thing should happen in the brain, the MAO should be detoxifying all the serotonin that reaches these capillaries in the brain....nutritional problem or too much stress where you're simply pouring out gigantic quantities of serotonin, or when your other hormones are disturbed, such as high estrogen, will inhibit the MAO, and the capillaries fail to detoxify the serotonin, so then the serotonin is free to enter the brain and disturb.
**CONTEXT:** How do you understand the blood brain barrier and its function?
**RAY PEAT:** In an old medical book from the early 19th century, I saw that the treatment for a burn or an ulcer to close up the weeping wound on the surface of the body, they used osmic acid, osmium tetroxide solution. And that was... to create what they called a false membrane. When the first electron microscopes started looking at cells, they didn't find the membrane that they had theorized had to be there. And meanwhile Gilbert Ling was demonstrating why the cell......behaves electrically as it does without needing a membrane. But within two or three years someone discovered that they could make use of this osmic acid false membrane creator. And they did produce a membrane on cells. Since then they've been able to produce a membrane consistent with the current theories. At first the membrane was very thick to suit the theory of the time but as the tendency towards this lipid bi-layer membrane took root they had to adjust their membrane making technology to suit this idea of a single bi-layer.
**CONTEXT:** Does the bilipid membrane, does that exist? In terms of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of it lining up to form this kind Barrier to either water or fat soluble components it is that Accurate or I mean I've always always kind of amazed me when I first started doing physiology and basic Physiology and looking at cells and all the cells and the lipid membrane and looking at cholesterol Do you is that lipid membrane is that a reality or is that again another very fluid? fluid relationship with the cell
**RAY PEAT:** When thyroid function goes down, serotonin goes up. And either removing the thyroid or giving serotonin or both will cause that energy failure that leads to a breakdown of the of the barrier function. and leaking of substance and eventually atrophy.
**CONTEXT:** What do you think is probably the main deficit there? Do you think that's a deficit in energy production based on thyroid or...?
**RAY PEAT:** One of the chronic effects of serotonin promotion is to interfere with cellular... respiration, and that should be under the control of thyroid, but that gradually is depleted, and glycolytic energy production tends to replace it, so you have to get back to reactivate oxidative metabolism while suppressing glycolysis and lactic acid production. And carbon dioxide is a main regulator of metabolism. It helps to keep serotonin under control, keep oxidation running, and suppress the production of lactic acid. And working on everything connected to the thyroid function will gradually wean you away from that....stimulation that comes from the SSRI.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. P, the lady withdrawing from SSRI is experiencing extreme sadness and the other mood-related changes that SSRIs are supposedly indicated for in the first place.
**RAY PEAT:** The body is not responding as it would normally in a healthy individual from the stimuli of thyroid hormone and then from there get to a place where they could slowly but surely use thyroid hormone along with adequate dietary sugars and withdrawal from polyunsaturates and all the other negative things that affect thyroid function to get to a place where they could regain. The proper control of their metabolism and vitamin D and calcium are usually helpful to get the thyroid going again.
**CONTEXT:** So do you think this particular person would be a good candidate to self-assess their metabolic rate, temperature and their pulses, and then see from there whether or not they look like they are either low thyroid or not responding?
**RAY PEAT:** You're probably producing less of it if you're... If you're working, anaerobically exercising, you're probably blowing off more CO2 than you would if you didn't do that. Yeah, there's evidence that too much exercise, when you get to the point of fatigue, serotonin is the signal that creates fatigue and it can lead to the chronic fatigue syndrome, which tends to go with inflamed muscles and many other symptoms. Probably the endorphins you're responding to when you say that exercise makes you feel good. I think there's some of those endorphins that are naturally produced as a part of a stress response to exercise like that, that probably dulls the pain of the exercise. And they have looked at the blood condition of intense, like soccer players or marathon runners, and find evidence of that. Breakdown of the blood brain barrier in all of these very high-stress athletics.
**CONTEXT:** So, uh, yeah number two call is seven zero seven ninety three three nine one one So let's get this first caller you're on the air call away from I'm in trinidad california. Welcome to the show. What's your question? My question is Is there any hope for getting off of the SSRI, Let the Pro? I have been on it for 17 years. I went on it in graduate school. I've tried to get off it a number of times over four months, weaning periods. And it triggers a withdrawal, deep sadness that's pretty out of control. And then most recently......a symptom I've never experienced before, which is almost like extreme highs and extreme lows.
**RAY PEAT:** Behind the original diagnosis, there was probably something like a vitamin D deficiency or low thyroid function. And so you want to make sure that you're not forgetting what led to the original prescription of the drug. Because the rheumatoid is just an inflammatory arthritis, so you'd characterize that inflammation as probably being related to things like serotonin, related to just basic energy deficit. Serotonin is elevated in all of the autoimmune so-called diseases and so order correcting the energy problem with calcium, vitamin D and thyroid is usually the basis for getting the original symptoms corrected then you can just taper off the prednisone.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. P, if somebody wants to withdraw from prednisone and its damaging effects and they've been put on it because they've got either, you know, inflammatory damage or changes and the pain etc. etc. for the reasons that they prescribe steroids, what would you suggest?
**RAY PEAT:** I've known several people who could accidentally got addicted to Glucocorticoid such as prednisone who used either Progesterone or Pregnetilone to taper off it and got off it in just a few weeks.
**CONTEXT:** Is there any... How would you feel about addressing the prednisone use directly with something like Pregnetilone or other hormones?
**RAY PEAT:** Very much so. Yeah, almost disregarding the cause of the stress. All of the stress hormones rise at night just because of the darkness, but any particular stress you're having will just make it worse for all of the stress hormones. And serotonin happens to activate every... pituitary hormone, and those all rise during the night. And calcium and sugar and thyroid are the three crucial things for minimizing that nocturnal rise of stress.
**CONTEXT:** So basically it sounds like my body is trying to tell me something. Yeah but from a calcium and vitamin D perspective the milk would definitely be a good idea and like Dr Pete says when your stress is rising during the night time due to the fast of not eating or drinking when you're asleep, milk is actually a very good, I mean prior to bedtime it's a very good idea to consume milk and or sweet milk or custard or you know that kind of product because of the calcium content and in the milk if it's fortified perhaps. The vitamin D content in the milk, but that's why it's so important to make sure you get A good source of vitamin D either Carlson labs to a 4,000 IU per drop vitamin D and vitamin D is just gaining more and more traction as a panacea for a lot of different inflammatory processes because of its utility in that
**CONTEXT:** I'm going under a lot of stress lately and certain health things have been flaring up aches and pains, various other things, and my mood has been pretty down. My question is though, it's kind of anecdotal, I've been craving a lot of milk, like middle of the night I'll wake up feeling funky and I want milk, or during the day if I want something refreshing I want milk. I heard Dr. Pete say vitamin D and calcium are both essential to thyroid function, so I'm wondering is there a chance that my stressed out state is depressing my thyroid, therefore my body is wanting more. Calcium and vitamin D.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it can be brought on by anything that... overwhelms your self-regulation, I think a diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** What do you say to that, Dr. Peat?
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think the experience of having fun or doing something meaningful powerfully overrides the toxic effects of lactic acid and serotonin and can push things back into shape. Just because that's how the organism builds itself, because doing meaningful things and having fun.
**CONTEXT:** I'm wondering if you think that it would be probably more ideal if you could get that same sort of enjoyment from something. That involves less energy expenditure, or if maybe the reliance on something like that is a symptom of something maybe unideal in the environment, that kind of makes you turn to something like that?
**RAY PEAT:** Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise.
**CONTEXT:** Um... Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise. Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks again, Dr. Peaton.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a CO2 bath is good almost for any condition, especially if you're at the point of making lactic acid. It'll help to recover quickly.
**CONTEXT:** So when you run, assuming you're healthy, I think you do increase your CO2, at least initially. I think you mentioned once you get to the point of fatigue, then you go over a level. Do you agree that initially, if you don't overdo it and everybody's got their own limit in terms of their health and their capacity for... exercise, that you do increase your CO2 initially. Do you agree with that?
**RAY PEAT:** Oh the oxygen consumption is by far the best.
**CONTEXT:** So the imperfect ways of diagnosing hypothyroidism, you know, you've gone through those pretty well. And you mentioned pulse. But to me, pulse is correlated to blood pressure. So... What would you say about a person who you know you're not sure about whether they have it but you know the thyroid problem or it's like minor but their blood pressure is 120 over 80 I've just given you and it's always 120 over 80 when they sit down they measure it's 120 you stand up you're supposed to stand up to see whether it's really an accurate measurement and it stays around 120 over 80 immediately after standing up that means their the blood pressure is stable consistently does that tell you anything that Since it's related to pulse that might be you know, also some information that would give you insight into whether or not someone's chronically hypothyroid
**RAY PEAT:** In my experience that would mean very good nervous system energy regulating things But I've known a few people who can't increase their pulse Even with exercise and it's me I can't do that. I can't do it.
**CONTEXT:** That would be a good argument for measuring your oxygen consumption because you can't have any other explanation for low oxygen consumption than a need for more thyroid.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the reason I say this is because I have a pulse around 60, I can maybe get it up to 70 sometimes when I go to the doctor. But I'm always 120 over 80 and I do the stand-up to double check it, I'm always. They say, wow, your blood pressure is right on the money. Yeah, but my pulse according, I didn't tell this, seems low. They said, no, you must be an athlete. It's typical. Cholesterol is another pretty good indicator. Actually, what a quick story. The doctor told me I had it like one, no, 330 was my total cholesterol. I'm about 60, right? The guy goes, oh, I want to put you on statins. I said, well, do you know that there's a guy from Stanford who said that it's salt, you know? And I said, no, I'm not going to take them, but I'll come back and see you. And so then what I did, I took some thyroid, but I also increased my salt. And I did a lot of things that you suggest. Came back, dropped like 100 over 150 points. The guy was like, wow, that's incredible. Can I see you again just to confirm it? He goes, how did you do that? And literally, you've been saying this for 30 years. And no one wants to listen, and I just did the basic things, nothing fancy, and what you said is exactly correct.
**CONTEXT:** So... What would you say about a person who you know you're not sure about whether they have it but you know the thyroid problem or it's like minor but their blood pressure is 120 over 80 I've just given you and it's always 120 over 80 when they sit down they measure it's 120 you stand up you're supposed to stand up to see whether it's really an accurate measurement and it stays around 120 over 80 immediately after standing up that means their the blood pressure is stable consistently does that tell you anything that Since it's related to pulse that might be you know, also some information that would give you insight into whether or not someone's chronically hypothyroid
**RAY PEAT:** One thing to keep in mind is that cancer cells have a very powerful intrinsic antioxidant system and what you want to do to restore health is to overcome that antioxidant system. And the Down syndrome involves probably the crucial genetic problem, it is a huge overdose of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase, a thing that is being sold in health stores, but when you add this extra gene... superoxide dismutase to animals or cells in culture, it creates accelerated aging, as in the Down's syndrome or in Alzheimer's disease, and the normal function of superoxide, it's just an oxygen molecule with an extra... electron, and it seems to be the active agent in the monoamine oxidase enzyme for destroying serotonin, and so the Down's syndrome platelet is unable to destroy serotonin, unable to hold it even, and so the person is saturated with free serotonin because... the system isn't able to destroy it at a normal speed.
**CONTEXT:** So in terms of the antioxidant myth, have you got anything to say about oxidants and antioxidants that would better describe them and then maybe we might not feel quite so, yeah. Confused about the antioxidant myth that is, you know, surrounding taking antioxidants per se for, you know, health benefits.
**RAY PEAT:** The amyloid protein accumulates in many conditions where you're simply hypothyroid for example or under stress. But it's possible that there are many other defects. The spectacular one is the failure of the platelet to oxidize serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** I use it on my skin because it irritates my digestive system to take it orally, but I think it is good to take a little bit of it.
**CONTEXT:** Dr. Pete, I was just wondering if it's mitigated by taking vitamin E Since it's very hard to calculate how much poofa you take in every day Why wouldn't you, over time, be taking these small amounts of vitamin E to further protect yourself? I'm just curious. Because you don't take vitamin E, right?
**RAY PEAT:** Until you increase your lactic acid, and that's the first sign that you're damaging yourself.
**CONTEXT:** So when you run, assuming you're healthy, I think you do increase your CO2, at least initially. I think you mentioned once you get to the point of fatigue, then you go over a level. Do you agree that initially, if you don't overdo it and everybody's got their own limit in terms of their health and their capacity for... exercise, that you do increase your CO2 initially. Do you agree with that?
**RAY PEAT:** I think the diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** I've always, I've long said for a long, long time now that a diagnosis is probably the worst thing that a person can get. I think, why do they call it a die, but I often think that as organisms, as energetic spiritual beings that we are, when we get a diagnosis of something that is quote-unquote terminal or just serious, I think it's the worst thing in the world to hear, because I think energetically it just whacks you for six and diagnosis is almost certain to be wrong in some of its explanations and it makes you think of yourself as a machine, needs fixing.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it can be brought on by anything that... overwhelms your self-regulation, I think a diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.

I think, why do they call it a die, but I often think that as organisms, as energetic spiritual beings that we are, when we get a diagnosis of something that is quote-unquote terminal or just serious, I think it's the worst thing in the world to hear, because I think energetically it just whacks you for six and diagnosis is almost certain to be wrong in some of its explanations and it makes you think of yourself as a machine, needs fixing.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it can be brought on by anything that... overwhelms your self-regulation, I think a diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** What do you say to that, Dr. Peat?
**RAY PEAT:** I think the experience of having fun or doing something meaningful powerfully overrides the toxic effects of lactic acid and serotonin and can push things back into shape. Just because that's how the organism builds itself, because doing meaningful things and having fun.
**CONTEXT:** I'm wondering if you think that it would be probably more ideal if you could get that same sort of enjoyment from something. That involves less energy expenditure, or if maybe the reliance on something like that is a symptom of something maybe unideal in the environment, that kind of makes you turn to something like that?
**RAY PEAT:** Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise.
**CONTEXT:** Um... Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise. Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks again, Dr. Peaton.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a CO2 bath is good almost for any condition, especially if you're at the point of making lactic acid. It'll help to recover quickly.
**CONTEXT:** So when you run, assuming you're healthy, I think you do increase your CO2, at least initially. I think you mentioned once you get to the point of fatigue, then you go over a level. Do you agree that initially, if you don't overdo it and everybody's got their own limit in terms of their health and their capacity for... exercise, that you do increase your CO2 initially. Do you agree with that?

**CONTEXT:** Um... Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise. Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks again, Dr. Peaton.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a CO2 bath is good almost for any condition, especially if you're at the point of making lactic acid. It'll help to recover quickly.
**CONTEXT:** So when you run, assuming you're healthy, I think you do increase your CO2, at least initially. I think you mentioned once you get to the point of fatigue, then you go over a level. Do you agree that initially, if you don't overdo it and everybody's got their own limit in terms of their health and their capacity for... exercise, that you do increase your CO2 initially. Do you agree with that?
**RAY PEAT:** I think the diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** I've always, I've long said for a long, long time now that a diagnosis is probably the worst thing that a person can get. I think, why do they call it a die, but I often think that as organisms, as energetic spiritual beings that we are, when we get a diagnosis of something that is quote-unquote terminal or just serious, I think it's the worst thing in the world to hear, because I think energetically it just whacks you for six and diagnosis is almost certain to be wrong in some of its explanations and it makes you think of yourself as a machine, needs fixing.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it can be brought on by anything that... overwhelms your self-regulation, I think a diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** What do you say to that, Dr. Peat?
**RAY PEAT:** I think the experience of having fun or doing something meaningful powerfully overrides the toxic effects of lactic acid and serotonin and can push things back into shape. Just because that's how the organism builds itself, because doing meaningful things and having fun.
**CONTEXT:** I'm wondering if you think that it would be probably more ideal if you could get that same sort of enjoyment from something. That involves less energy expenditure, or if maybe the reliance on something like that is a symptom of something maybe unideal in the environment, that kind of makes you turn to something like that?

I think, why do they call it a die, but I often think that as organisms, as energetic spiritual beings that we are, when we get a diagnosis of something that is quote-unquote terminal or just serious, I think it's the worst thing in the world to hear, because I think energetically it just whacks you for six and diagnosis is almost certain to be wrong in some of its explanations and it makes you think of yourself as a machine, needs fixing.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it can be brought on by anything that... overwhelms your self-regulation, I think a diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** What do you say to that, Dr. Peat?
**RAY PEAT:** I think the experience of having fun or doing something meaningful powerfully overrides the toxic effects of lactic acid and serotonin and can push things back into shape. Just because that's how the organism builds itself, because doing meaningful things and having fun.
**CONTEXT:** I'm wondering if you think that it would be probably more ideal if you could get that same sort of enjoyment from something. That involves less energy expenditure, or if maybe the reliance on something like that is a symptom of something maybe unideal in the environment, that kind of makes you turn to something like that?
**RAY PEAT:** Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise.
**CONTEXT:** Um... Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise. Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks again, Dr. Peaton.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a CO2 bath is good almost for any condition, especially if you're at the point of making lactic acid. It'll help to recover quickly.
**CONTEXT:** So when you run, assuming you're healthy, I think you do increase your CO2, at least initially. I think you mentioned once you get to the point of fatigue, then you go over a level. Do you agree that initially, if you don't overdo it and everybody's got their own limit in terms of their health and their capacity for... exercise, that you do increase your CO2 initially. Do you agree with that?

**CONTEXT:** Um... Work really should be a fun exercise, but if you don't have experience in the ordinary working activities, I think it's good to have the game type of exercise. Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks again, Dr. Peaton.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a CO2 bath is good almost for any condition, especially if you're at the point of making lactic acid. It'll help to recover quickly.
**CONTEXT:** So when you run, assuming you're healthy, I think you do increase your CO2, at least initially. I think you mentioned once you get to the point of fatigue, then you go over a level. Do you agree that initially, if you don't overdo it and everybody's got their own limit in terms of their health and their capacity for... exercise, that you do increase your CO2 initially. Do you agree with that?
**RAY PEAT:** I think the diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** I've always, I've long said for a long, long time now that a diagnosis is probably the worst thing that a person can get. I think, why do they call it a die, but I often think that as organisms, as energetic spiritual beings that we are, when we get a diagnosis of something that is quote-unquote terminal or just serious, I think it's the worst thing in the world to hear, because I think energetically it just whacks you for six and diagnosis is almost certain to be wrong in some of its explanations and it makes you think of yourself as a machine, needs fixing.
**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and it can be brought on by anything that... overwhelms your self-regulation, I think a diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.
**CONTEXT:** What do you say to that, Dr. Peat?
**RAY PEAT:** I think the experience of having fun or doing something meaningful powerfully overrides the toxic effects of lactic acid and serotonin and can push things back into shape. Just because that's how the organism builds itself, because doing meaningful things and having fun.
**CONTEXT:** I'm wondering if you think that it would be probably more ideal if you could get that same sort of enjoyment from something. That involves less energy expenditure, or if maybe the reliance on something like that is a symptom of something maybe unideal in the environment, that kind of makes you turn to something like that?
