**RAY PEAT:** Tryptophan and its metabolites, including serotonin, is essential for life. Every kind of organism is built with proteins containing tryptophan. And the very nature of life, as I see it, and as Albert Szent-Györgyi researched it, he, for the last 30, 40 years of his life, was demonstrating the electronic nature of life. The fluorescence, luminescence, electronic conductivity and such of living systems, the proteins interacting with water, producing excited electrons and light emissions, and tryptophan is the amino acid that gives proteins that basic property that, according to Szent-Györgyi, is the essential mechanism of life that lets it sense and move. He was a muscle researcher, among other things, and this electronic property is at the heart of both sensation and movement, and all of the other familiar properties of life, secretion, consciousness, and so on. So, when something goes wrong with tryptophan or its metabolites, it disturbs life at its deepest level. Cell division and all other functions depend on this excitability of tryptophan. And in the muscle protein myosin, for example, there's one particular tryptophan which is most sensitive electronically to light interactions such as phosphorescence. And this tryptophan interacts electrically or electronically with cysteine, which is an oxidizable sulfur protein. And these are sort of the electric motor of all the life processes. And they happen to be the essential things during the growth process of an organism. But if you keep the same ratio coming in in your diet and stop growing, they are no longer being consumed in proportion for growth. And so they become sort of free actors which can spread excitability and oxidizability randomly in the organism. So during the growth period of an organism, you need the full balanced range of amino acids. But when your body growth stops, all you need to maintain the renewal of your skin and intestine lining, lungs, all of the turnover of brain proteins that are being renewed and so on. That's a very small amount of growth that's going on compared to in your infancy and teens. Those amino acids are now at risk of becoming random excitatory inflammation-promoting processes. And it happens that gelatin is a major protein that is used for building frameworks, connective tissues, and it has a complete lack of these excitable protein cysteine, methionine and tryptophan. And so if it becomes a major dietary protein when growth is completed, then you reduce the risk of the inflammatory and degenerative diseases.

**CONTEXT:** How best can we avoid tryptophan ingestion in order to try and get an edge on the serotonin that would be formed from it?

**RAY PEAT:** By the age of 30 or 40 when growth is completed, the bulk of our energy is spent just in maintaining the body, but it has to function to be maintained and renewed. If you have a cast, for example, on your arm, muscles will atrophy because they aren't being used. So just to maintain what we have, we have to be active, and that includes mental or spiritual activity, keeping a freshness of perspective. This is the environmental enrichment, stimulation of everything, mental processes as well as varied physical activity.

**CONTEXT:** Do you think this could be mitigated through... lightweight bearing exercise for people of all ages and actually very much support its use for producing muscle mass, muscle burning glucose, being thyroid stimulatory and supportive? If these amino acids are being consumed and somebody's actually doing some work then would that warrant that diet remaining that way because obviously there's an ideal in life and you've mentioned the gelatin and it being completely absent from these inflammatory amino acids but in terms of a balanced diet that would contain some of these, would you recognize work doing work by lifting small weights and exercising your body is?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, the problem is that a lot of the plant-based proteins are either overloaded with phosphate, the same as meat, or they have potential allergens and defensive molecules that the plants have that no animal has.

**CONTEXT:** So you still advocate very simple amino acid type gelatin protein sources, and then obviously things from dairy. Cheese, milk and eggs as good quality clean proteins.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, but it's a tremendously important field for research to find what plants have the proper nutrients and don't have the toxins.

**CONTEXT:** Right. So like you say, they're nearly always conjugated with the oils, the liquid oils or the polyunsaturates from the nuts.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, then there's other sources, obviously tofu and soy protein has been implicated with having kind of estrogenic effects.

**CONTEXT:** As well as high phosphate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** So then that cancer metabolism is a lactic acid-producing physiology as a byproduct, okay. All right, so let's move on then to talk about proteins in terms of muscle building and that kind of thing, but most proteins contain tryptophan then which is converted to serotonin, and do you think... Is it possible to contain enough non-tryptophan containing proteins for continued muscle growth and repair?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the proteins other than gelatin that I know of will support proper growth and repair.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. And you can do it momentarily just by hyperventilating, blowing breathing so fast that your carbon dioxide is being lost. And that can push your blood pH very high to the point that you might faint or die. When you lose too much CO2, the increased pH tends to cause spasms, including blood vessel spasms, cutting off the circulation of your brain. Can you do the opposite of that? Because I know you're an advocate of increasing CO2.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, re-breathing in a paper bag, for example, you can correct out and lower the pH of your blood to the point that it can start weakening your muscles and causing too much vasodilation.

**CONTEXT:** Right, so it is possible to go the other direction equally and oppositely.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, a muscle weakness is the worst thing that happens.

**CONTEXT:** All right, nothing too much more serious than that because I know some people were really getting into CO2 baths and re-breathing CO2 in a kind of...

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, if you're just soaking it in through your skin since you're breathing in the ordinary air even though you're absorbing a really large amount of it through your skin, it's going to equalize with the air and so you can't overdose sitting in furious CO2.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, all right. Can I, I wanted to move on again just to reiterate this for some people perhaps. I'm not too sure the connection was made quite as clearly as this, but I was looking at some articles today just going through some material to see what else could be fleshed out with this evening's talk carrying on from last month. Statins, I'm going to go on about statins again but just to mention again that the brain actually creates its own cholesterol and cholesterol systemically is too big a molecule to get across the blood-brain barrier and I know I asked you last month about the blood-brain barrier and how physiologically intact it was and I know that you mentioned several components that wouldn't typically get across a blood-brain barrier could in certain instances and I think a little bit like the intestinal barrier.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, fairly large fats can massively go into the brain, escaping from the blood.

**CONTEXT:** Interesting. Okay, so you say fats and fairly large fats but you don't think that cholesterol will pass the blood-brain barrier, do you?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, I think it can, given the right circumstances.

**CONTEXT:** Wow. Okay, because what I wanted to say was that in so far as the literature is concerned, I'm not saying the literature has it right and you don't, but so far as the literature is concerned that molecules, they say, is too big to get across the blood-brain barrier and hence whatever the biological reason for however long we've been around, the brain, because it is such a both energy-hungry organ and because the white matter of the brain is principally... They say that 20% of the body's cholesterol is actually in the brain and presumably because of the white matter and presumably because of the insulating effect of cholesterol on the neurons and that the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase produces cholesterol and that statins. For those people, unfortunately, who might be using them, but hopefully they'll look to an alternative if they don't completely ban them, but they probably won't because they're making too much money from it, this, the statins do pass and cross into the blood-brain barrier, so… I imagine what they do to the brain is what they do to the muscles and if you're soaked in statins and do vigorous exercise the… …interference with cholesterol can cause your muscle to break down and simply dissolve and disintegrate and I'm afraid that same thing can happen in the brain, accounting for the depression, suicidality and such.

**RAY PEAT:** The old brain is sort of like a clump of atherosclerosis; it's got lots of cholesterol but it's bound to fatty acids and in the old brain free cholesterol is actually lower than in the young brain; it's the bound up interfering type of cholesterol that accumulates in the aged brain as in the aged blood vessels.

**CONTEXT:** But your brain is not like that is it? Avoiding vegetable oils for a long time probably helps.

**RAY PEAT:** Hansele was producing it with tryptophan simply in excess.

**CONTEXT:** Okay all right we have a we have a caller on the line so let's take this call a call away from what's your question?

**RAY PEAT:** It could be that you have hard water or have a water softener that puts sodium into the water.

**CONTEXT:** Yes, I know Barbara has water softeners in most of the houses. Do you have a water softener in your house?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, okay. That puts sodium into the water and so it will skew the hair test.

**CONTEXT:** Ah, okay. And then just one more on those. I have the ratio between the calcium and the potassium is very skewed as well. My calcium is 46 and the potassium is 1. I'm not sure that that could be from hard water rather than softened water, but I wouldn't worry about a hair mineral test, a serum test is much more useful.

**RAY PEAT:** Right. Yeah, there you go, it's basically anything that you're exposed to, like Dr. Pete mentioned in the first instance here, if you're showering and your water's been softened that way, then that could easily explain how the hair would take up those components and would show to be high in one and low in another, but obviously blood tests are the best way to do it.

**CONTEXT:** Did you have any particular reason for testing your hair or was this just curiosity?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin D, calcium and thyroid are likely involved. Vitamin D, calcium and thyroid. Have you had your vitamin D measured? Do you know what that is?

**CONTEXT:** Yes. The most recent one I've had done, I want to say it was around 50-ish.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, that's good. Then the amount of calcium in your diet works with both thyroid and vitamin D to keep your metabolic rate up and your blood sugar steady. Okay. Two grams a day of calcium is a good level. Do you drink any milk or do you take calcium supplement?

**CONTEXT:** I don't take a calcium supplement, but I do drink milk and I do eat high quality dairy. How much milk do you drink?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, I've increased that per Dr. Pete. For me, probably about 16 ounces and I'm drinking 2% milk. I think twice that much of 1% would be better. Two quarts of what? Ski under 1% helps to lose weight because of the high calcium content.

**CONTEXT:** And you said about, like, what did you say on the ounces?

**RAY PEAT:** From one quart to two quarts? Oh, okay, one to two quarts of, okay, more than 1%. Okay. And that tends to increase your temperature. And if your temperature doesn't rise quickly in the morning when you get up and eat breakfast, if it doesn't get up to 98.6, a half hour after breakfast, then you're likely to need a thyroid supplement too.

**CONTEXT:** Yeah, I do do the temperatures and pulses, and I tend to have low temperatures. And then I did try some Nature Throid. Um, a very like the like the lowest dosage. I forget the like quarter grain or something like that. But I started having um more negative effects with it. I started having like my anxiety was more increased and I sort of had to be like more aggressive like behavior like a real short fuse and that kind of stuff. So I quit taking that after about a month. But I'm

**RAY PEAT:** One of the effects of thyroid is to make your cells able to retain the magnesium that they need. And if your diet doesn't have enough magnesium, and two quarts of milk would give you a generous supply of magnesium, which would make the thyroid able to work more quickly. The normal function of thyroid is to increase your ability to relax both muscles and nerves.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. Okay, I appreciate your time. Thank you both so much.

**RAY PEAT:** Okay, keeping the parathyroid hormone under control is essential. And eating a lot of calcium, like two quarts of milk, and keeping your vitamin D serum level up to the middle of the range, like 50 mg per ml, that is a good basis. But if your thyroid hormone is low, then your prolactin will likely be high enough that the prolactin itself has a bone weakening effect. Prolactin is normally the hormone of lactation, and it takes calcium out of the bone normally to put into milk, but under stress it causes calcium to be lost from the bone. And prolactin tends to rise. Along with thyroid-stimulating hormone and the simplest way to normalize prolactin is to normalize your thyroid function and keep your thyroid-stimulating hormone at the lower end of the normal range.

**CONTEXT:** Okay, how do you keep the thyroid? How do you do that? If you can't do it... Just with a selection of foods, then a supplement.

**RAY PEAT:** A thyroid supplement? Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** And I do not like milk, so is there something else that I can do to get calcium?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, well, cooked greens are the food that's richest, other than milk, in calcium relative to phosphate. But if you grind up egg shells, that's a good, pure form of calcium carbonate, which is next best to milk.

**CONTEXT:** OK, how many ground up egg shells do you do per day?

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, a couple of grams would be good.

**CONTEXT:** OK, all right. Yeah, so you can just use your eggs. If you use eggs, you can just put them to one side. Gently wash out the membranes and stack them up for a week or so and then after a week you can put them on a baking tray and put them in the oven at about 150 and basically sterilize them that way and then put them in a coffee grinder and then they'll grind up very finely into a fine powder.

**RAY PEAT:** Unopposed cortisol is another bone dissolving hormone.

**CONTEXT:** And what is that?

**RAY PEAT:** Cortisol if it's even in the higher part of the normal range in a morning test if it isn't balanced with the adrenal DHEA and progesterone and other adrenal steroids that can contribute to osteoporosis and supplementing progesterone and DHEA and or pregnenolone can oppose that effect of cortisol.

**CONTEXT:** Okay. All right. Thank you very much, Dr. Pete.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen is a growth and carcinogenic factor in the prostate.

**CONTEXT:** Right. And as men get older, their estrogen no doubt rises, especially as testosterone is on the decline.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. And the men who live the longest with prostate cancer have the highest testosterone.

**CONTEXT:** What? The men that live the longest with prostate cancer have the highest testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** So in that, okay, yeah, so the testosterone in that point then is kind of protective, huh?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.

**CONTEXT:** So the best thing for you, talking about what Dr. Pete's been mentioning, if you can obviously maintain physical activity in terms of keeping your testosterone as high as you can from being a male, that's certainly very protective and anti-estrogenic. Estrogen being one of those hormones that rises in males especially in males that are obese or you know they have more fat than is good for them especially because that tissue tends to accumulate and or produce estrogen in its own right and then there are two herbs that I know there's more than that but the two that come to mind instantly are things like nettle root as an aromatase inhibitor and that has an effect blocking estrogen and then the saw palmetto extract. There's lots of information about alternative medicines for enlarged prostate but I think obviously keeping an eye on your PSA in conjunction with using some of those herbs that have been used for prosthetic enlargement and making sure that your estrogen is being opposed by testosterone and getting exercise.

**RAY PEAT:** One of their effects tends to increase the stress hormones and so an anti-stress program. I've known people to withdraw from several different addictive things including the SSRIs using progesterone and coffee and thyroid and a good high-calcium diet, for example.

**CONTEXT:** How long have you been using it for?

**RAY PEAT:** Many years.

**CONTEXT:** Thank you for watching. There's certainly scope there for lifestyle changes, but as Dr. Peet's mentioned, you know, in terms of anti-stress things, there are certainly components that in your diet are anti-stress and that support your thyroid and are anti-inflammatory and decrease the quote-unquote stress, which is on, you know, on... One of those, like, lifestyle changes that, like, go out and run or walk every day.

**RAY PEAT:** No, we're not running for sure, but in terms of gentle weight-bearing exercise and walking and reading and being in the sunlight, you know, or in a bright room, making sure you've got exposure to that good red light, etc., etc., especially in the winter now. We're coming with, you know, long nights and short days and the whole seasonal affective disorder being a fairly widespread thing in this part of the world, as thyroid gets low as the winter's coming. There's thyroid hormone and then there's opposing your estrogen as a female, which undoubtedly will have a beneficial effect. And keeping up vitamin D.

**CONTEXT:** Hormone replacement therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** No, not a big advocate of hormone replacement therapy. Well, the only hormone would be progesterone to oppose your estrogen. But if you're on any kind of hormone replacement that's estrogen based, then you really don't want to be doing that. It's completely... not what you're going to hear from your doctor perhaps, you know, or maybe some naturopath who's a little more current.
