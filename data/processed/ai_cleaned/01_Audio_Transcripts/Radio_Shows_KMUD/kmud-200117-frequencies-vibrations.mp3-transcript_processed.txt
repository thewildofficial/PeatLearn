**RAY PEAT:** "My dissertation topic was on reproductive aging."

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat is asked to outline his professional and academic background.

**RAY PEAT:** "I had a master's degree in humanities and after about ten years went back for a PhD in biology at the University of Oregon. In 1972, on reproductive aging was my dissertation topic."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing Dr. Peat's work with neonatal and children's health, and his food-based approach.

**RAY PEAT:** "Incidentally some of my experiments had to do with the electrical behavior of tissue under the influence of progesterone, estrogen, prostaglandins and so on."

**CONTEXT:** The host is introducing the topic of estrogen and its role in inflammation and excitotoxicity, contrasting it with the common perception of it being a "pro-life hormone."

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen as being an excitotoxic molecule."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing research on pulsed electromagnetic fields for breast cancer treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** "They weren't in that experiment paying attention to the effects of frequency. So it was just really giving some kind of excitation to the cells. But other people like the Rife tradition have been trying to identify particular frequencies that are more effective. Either exciting or calming the cells."

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 60s, people were trying to use direct current to control cancer growth. Professor Johns Hopkins published an article saying that he had regressed mouse memory tumors just using the application of direct current polarization. So just applying current, but not a... Not pulsing."

**RAY PEAT:** "It's known that cancer is electrically excited. It's like a wound that is stuck in an electrically excited, negatively charged condition."

**RAY PEAT:** "Cancer cells are not exactly strong. They're pretty weak, aren't they? They are very fragile in a lot of ways and so I think some of the work that's been done, either vibrational or electrically, certainly has validity in disrupting that cell stability because they don't particularly have very stable membranes in terms of the normal architecture of the cell. And being electrically charged and excited, I think, makes them more susceptible to vibrating energy fields, such as in that experiment."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the historical understanding of frequency measurements and the shift from "cycles per second" to Hertz.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 60s doctrine, there are still people arguing that cell phones aren't causing brain damage or cancer and so on. But that argument that cells are pretty immune to various frequencies started back in the late 40s when radar was accidentally killing people who stood in front of the radar antenna. And... The authority opinion at that time was that it was only by overheating your brain or other organs that electromagnetic injury could harm you. And in the 1960s, that was the dogma that neither sound nor electromagnetic energy below a certain... frequency and energy could have any effect on the units of the cell, such as chromosomes or mitochondria."

**RAY PEAT:** "And a person was working with muscle cells in culture and measuring the activity of ATPase, which controls the disposition of energy in the cell. And they found that... I think it was the pitch of 440, which was very powerful at activating that muscle enzyme. And they showed that the conventional theory of the cell was impossible for that low frequency, moderately low energy. But the dogma says that the energy concentration per... micron or any unit of space is too low to do such things as causing chemical changes. But the person demonstrating the effect showed that, in effect, the cell structure was acting as an antenna concentrating, gathering energy from several microns of space. and concentrating it so that it could act on the enzyme. That's the essential difference."

**RAY PEAT:** "At that time, the conventional opinion was that it would be impossible to make a magnetic resonance imaging device because of that same idea that the cell is organized randomly. But it took the interaction between Gilbert and Lenin. And his organized water explanation of cell function and Raymond Damadian who realized that if Gilbert Ling was right about how water behaves, you can make pictures of the water in cells electromagnetically. So it is the invention of the MRI device. It really changed the possibility of explaining cell function."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the potential dangers of 5G technology and the body's sensitivity to electromagnetic fields.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's part of the reason that they denied that Gilbert Ling had an accurate description of the cell because if his picture of the cell is right, then radiation, electromagnetic energy and so on is very relevant to the cell function."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the use of ultrasound for wound healing and bone regeneration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ultrasound is a very effective wound treatment. Around 1970 or earlier, someone discovered that putting ultrasound on infected tonsils caused them to recover and become normal and inflamed, and that gradually over the next 10 or 20 years. They found that bone healing was accelerated and soft tissue wound healing was accelerated, similar to what happened in the tonsil."

**RAY PEAT:** "Part of that is thought to be the activation of cell regenerating signals such as nitric oxide and estrogen that accelerate stem cell growth. Multiplication, the early stages of healing."

**RAY PEAT:** "The imaging of bone density or osteoporosis can be done with ultrasound. You can tell the strength of a bone as well as its density if you use ultrasound. And since ultrasound stimulates bone repair, it would be reasonable if doctors would evaluate aging women's bones using ultrasound, but they x-ray them and x-rays actually weaken the bone and accelerate osteoporosis. So it would be a good change of technology to use to switch over to ultrasound."

**RAY PEAT:** "A friend of mine who is... for a year or more had had liver enzyme elevation and signs of hepatitis or developing cirrhosis, had a very prolonged ultrasound examination of her liver. And a couple of weeks later went back for another exam and her liver had completely recovered. I suspect it was from that very... half an hour or so of looking around with an ultrasound imaging device."

**RAY PEAT:** "Yeah, so the mechanism by which that would have had an anti-inflammatory effect, I guess if we just look at something like hepatitis as an inflammation of the hepatocytes, inflammation quenching activity then of ultrasound would be... a relative positive mechanism by which that could have happened."

**RAY PEAT:** "Ultrasound is just generally a good healing modality whether it's for bones or tissue soft tissue or, you know, even yeah."

**RAY PEAT:** "The only place it shouldn't be used it's around the head because it tends to emulsify that tissue if it's too energetic you don't want emulsified brain cells."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about meditation and its effect on breathing rate and CO2 levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "Meditation, obviously we all think about meditation as being relaxing, calm and regenerating but what the gentleman is saying about co2 I think most people tend to hyperventilate too much and if you can just relax and stop hyperventilating you retain more co2 and that has an anti-inflammatory everywhere in the body so you'd advocate meditation correct yeah yeah definitely"

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks what can help reduce the need for sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** "How much sleep are you getting and what do you want to reduce it to because I know Dr. P definitely advocates a good 10 hours if you're not getting into the deepest phase of sleep called slow wave sleep or deep sleep your tissue isn't being repaired adequately and so you need more hours of it and so if you do things that will deepen your sleep then you can reduce it to the normal six to eight and a half hours and thyroid hormone and vitamin D are two of the most important things for maintaining deep sleep."

**CONTEXT:** The caller asks if Vitamin D can increase serotonin and worsen sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** "Serotonin and histamine are both brain excitatory signals and that's why antihistamines are used for improving sleep. They're both antiserotonin and antihistamine drugs that do improve sleep. But you can do the same thing with good nutrition, lots of calcium, vitamin D and thyroid."

**RAY PEAT:** "Histamine is... Basically, an inflammation signal and insomnia, you are having, in effect, an inflamed brain. And you can quiet it by getting the energy production up with thyroid and sugar and all of the nutrients. But the antihistamine chemicals are everything that works in a different direction from adrenaline. Adrenaline is antihistamine but it is also excitatory. So insomnia usually involves both adrenaline and antihistamine. The adrenaline is attempting to turn off the histamine but if you get your energy up you turn off both of them and let the brain relax."

**RAY PEAT:** "Relaxation is not negative, I just want to people to understand this, when you say it allows your brain to relax, that's exactly what thyroid hormone will do through the correct utilization of sugar, and then when you said that during the night time is when most inflammation of the brain will happen, and this is because of a lowered energy state, adequate thyroid and adequate sugars prior to sleep or in the post six hours to sleep and or during the night time will keep those inflammatory mediators down and reduce that inflammation and most aging changes occurring during the hours of sleep and darkness."

**RAY PEAT:** "Darkness is not good for you obviously it's something we can't avoid perhaps if we're in bed at night time with the lights off in a dark place but the dark is not good for us the light is actually what's very energetically stimulating for us and supportive etc."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about the biological effects of infrasound.

**RAY PEAT:** "The infrasound frequencies are something around 50 per second... 30 per second, or even as low as 10 per second. If you're growing cells in culture, they always lose some of their properties that they had in situ in the organism. And one of the tricks to make cell culture more lifelike is to give it some kind of pulsation because... Cell physiology depends on the fact that the blood is rhythmically pulsing through the system. And the pulse rate is in the infrasonic frequency. And there are many other frequencies that every cell in the body normally receives stimulation, so it's nervous....pulses, as well as blood heartbeat pulsations."

**RAY PEAT:** "I don't know that anyone has clearly demonstrated it, but you can use equivalent pulsations to show that you... are changing the cell physiology in vitro."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing how pulsed electromagnetic field therapy can affect inflammation by interrupting signal pathways.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think normal activity has some of those effects, anti-inflammatory effects. If you're forced into inactivity, you develop a generalized inflammation in probably all of the tissues and free activity, work that is productive using your muscles, walking, for example, rather than sitting, the normal activity of muscles lowers the stress hormones, and increases the constructive hormones such as progesterone and DHEA and testosterone, and normal activity in itself is an anti-inflammatory process, and I suspect that these certain frequencies are imitating the normal rhythm of proper activity."

**CONTEXT:** A caller with fibromyalgia asks about the relationship between their condition and power lines.

**RAY PEAT:** "Fibromyalgia... I think a lot of doctors are coming around to recognize the importance of hormone balance, a good thyroid function, vitamin D and keeping up the constructive hormones or steroids like. Progesterone, testosterone and DHEA."

**RAY PEAT:** "Especially as you're female, I don't mean this in any negative way but because you're exposed in an unopposed way after your menstruation has stopped to estrogen that is very important for you to make sure you get adequate progesterone because it's the antagonist of the inflammatory estrogen and that in fibromyalgia. uh no doubt that estrogen excess or estrogen dominance certainly has a role to play in that tired waterlogged muscles of which estrogen is a main cause."

**RAY PEAT:** "You don't have any... any way to combat the estrogen you're still producing you're every cell in your body is still manufacturing or can manufacture and secrete estrogen but your ovaries no longer function and so therefore you're not getting progesterone exposure which is very important to offset that."

**RAY PEAT:** "Cortisol is a bone destroyer and progesterone is the main antagonist of cortisol."

**CONTEXT:** A caller asks about Helga Clark's device for toning bacterial frequencies.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think she used just a simple low voltage direct current stimulator and that device can be used productively but I don't think she understood enough to use it productively."

**CONTEXT:** The host is discussing the use of hydrogen peroxide as a supplement.

**RAY PEAT:** "That sounds just like MMS which is actually... sodium hypochlorite which is... regular household bleach. It was a fad and I can't believe it's still on the internet it's absolutely all over it and I'm kind of amazed that it's still going and it's still got such a strong following but... I would say that I would not I would not get involved with it."

**RAY PEAT:** "There was a study in Italy that identified it as a probable carcinogen."

**CONTEXT:** A caller diagnosed with osteoporosis asks about pulse waves and music therapy for bone growth.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin K is very important along with vitamin D and calcium intake. Vitamin K......prevents the removal of calcium from the bone and keeps it out of the soft tissues. The combination is much more effective than either one alone."
