**RAY PEAT:** My dissertation was on reproductive physiology and the changes aging makes in the energy metabolism of the reproductive organs.

**CONTEXT:** Could you outline your academic and professional background?

**RAY PEAT:** The professor, the main professor in female reproduction, Arnold Soderwald, had been working in the field way back in the 40s. He was one of the early people to test the effects of vitamin E on reproduction. In the 1930s and 40s, it was considered a sex-promoting vitamin or almost a hormone. He was one of the people that showed that its effect on increasing fertility took place by being an anti-estrogen. The older an animal got, the earlier it became infertile. He found that increasing the dose of vitamin E steadily with aging, he kept the animals from miscarrying well into old middle age. I continued that research and found that it was partly acting by way of improving the production of progesterone as well as lowering the effect of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned your professor's work on vitamin E and reproduction. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** I found a bottle of the very old stuff in the freezer in the lab in 1968 or so. It had been there for decades, and it was a very, very viscous material and a light amber color. I tested it against some of the quinones, comparing benzoquinone, for example, reacting it with vitamin E and doing a combination staining experiment. I got chemical reactions that showed that the sensitivity of the quinone reaction was very vivid in that old sample, and the newer samples, so-called pure vitamin E, I haven't been able to see that same reaction that I got around 1970 using the very old stuff.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned an old sample of vitamin E you tested. What was different about it?

**RAY PEAT:** That was bought from Sigma Chemical Company, but it was fairly typical at the time. It was very highly refined. It was the highest grade available at the time. But at that time, all vitamin E was fairly brown colored and very, very thick. And I think some of the studies suggested that it was a waxy, highly saturated, long-chain fatty acid that was part of the endurance-promoting antioxidant effect, not the simple tocopherol itself.

**CONTEXT:** What was the nature of that older, more viscous vitamin E?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, lots of it now. Even 10 or 20 years ago, the majority of it was highly diluted with soybean oil. Highly unsaturated, exactly what my professor found was the antagonistic effect; it protected against the pro-aging effect of the polyunsaturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** Does the form of vitamin E matter for its effectiveness?

**RAY PEAT:** I think so.

**CONTEXT:** So, if vitamin E is thin and liquid, it's probably not good, but if it's thick and viscous, that's better quality?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the mixture of the isotopes, the non-rhythmic, natural forms, alpha and gamma, are probably the most important, but I think the mixture as it occurs in nature is much better than any of the synthetics. DL-alpha has been sold for a long time because it's cheap to make synthetically.

**CONTEXT:** What makes a good quality vitamin E supplement?

**RAY PEAT:** It's very full of polyunsaturated fat. I tried some of it in the 1970s, and it caused a choking sensation when you took just a little bit of it.

**CONTEXT:** Wheat germ oil was a main source for vitamin E, right? Would you advocate for that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. In the 1940s, the anti-estrogen quality that was identified from the 1930s, an anti-clotting and anti-estrogen effect was very clearly identified. But with the rise of the estrogen industry starting in 1940, that property, the idea that vitamin E could be very pro-fertility, it was the main fertility vitamin and at the same time purely anti-estrogenic, that really put a crimp in the estrogen advertising idea. And they were, I think, a major factor in creating the doctrine that vitamin E's action is as an antioxidant. The vegetable oil industry, at the same time, was trying to sell the idea that seed oils are edible. And in feeding them to animals, they were finding that animals became sterile on a high intake of the various seed oils, polyunsaturated.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the anti-estrogen effect of vitamin E and its relation to the estrogen industry and the vegetable oil industry. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, but when they had a really high proportion, they became sterile, and the brain deteriorated. The gonads and the brain were the first to deteriorate. My professor, for example, identified that as an estrogen-promoting effect. That has continued to be confirmed, that estrogen increases the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the body and increases their activity at any one moment, and those fats simultaneously are increasing the effect of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** So, estrogen and polyunsaturated fats have a synergistic, negative effect?

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, so the anti-estrogen effect was identical to the anti-PUFA effect, but both the food, the seed oil industry, and the estrogen industry found it very convenient to sell the idea that vitamin E is merely an antioxidant. So from the 1940s on, D-alpha-tocopherol was identified as how to measure the value of vitamin E because it was the most antioxidant. But it turns out that the gamma and others have very distinct, more important biological activities, including opposition to estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** So, the focus on D-alpha-tocopherol as the primary measure of vitamin E's value was a convenient narrative?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the random... No, I'm hearing all of you now. I'm nowhere near my radio. What I was possibly asking is what advice would you have for somebody who realizes that there is damage? I think when the brain has any inefficiency from whatever cause, it's more susceptible to interference from being around a broadcast station, for example. The healthier the brain is, the higher its threshold is to that kind of pollution. And the healing influence of the natural hormones proceeds at any age and in any starting condition. In traumatic brain injury, for example, they found that progesterone and vitamin D are both of them extremely helpful for facilitating repair, keeping down the inflammatory processes that would amount to something like a scar formation rather than a creation of new functioning nerve circuits.

**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking about the relevance of EMFs and frequencies for organic brain damage, specifically traumatic brain injury. What is your perspective?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's correct. If you look online, you'll find lots of articles published by credible universities and scientists engaged in traumatic brain injury as a subject, specifically mentioning progesterone being very supportive and very anti-inflammatory.

**CONTEXT:** So, progesterone and vitamin D are helpful for brain function and repair?

**RAY PEAT:** You can find vitamin D and progesterone online. Correct. You can find both of those in a good health food store too, so... As a supplement to take. Yeah, there's nothing restricted about them. And there might be three or four doctors in the country who are willing to prescribe those things, but it isn't necessary to have a prescription for them.

**CONTEXT:** Where can one obtain progesterone and vitamin D?

**RAY PEAT:** It's the same molecule that your brain manufactures. The brain has the highest concentration of any tissue in the body of progesterone. It's an essential brain stabilizing molecule.

**CONTEXT:** Where does progesterone come from?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, and the same things that will protect you against any injury, from radiation to trauma or bacterial toxins, they can be used to protect against the aluminum particulate matter and the other random proteins that are contaminating vaccines. Aspirin is an important one, progesterone and the youth-associated steroids, pregnenolone and DHEA, and progesterone in particular are protective against the whole range of inflammatory processes.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding vaccination, what dietary or supplemental measures can mitigate the effects of adjuvants?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the day or two before and the following vaccination, I think probably 500 milligrams per day would be good. And that would require some vitamin K as well, vitamin K2.

**CONTEXT:** What dosage of aspirin would you recommend, and would vitamin K be necessary with it?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, vitamin K is another generally protective factor. Calcium, sodium, magnesium, these have a basic anti-inflammatory function when you get them through good foods.

**CONTEXT:** Are there other general protective factors you recommend?

**RAY PEAT:** No. No, earlier we were... I'm sorry, I'm asking Dr. Peat. Oh. Oh, well, the stabilizing hormones and the nutrients and physical factors, thyroid hormone, progesterone, pregnenolone, carbon dioxide, for example, all tend to stabilize around the 70 to 90 millivolt resting potential. But the high-energy state really is quiescent. So the voltage is not active, it's quiescent.

**CONTEXT:** The caller is asking if your earlier discussion on energies referred to zero-point energy and cellular voltage in the 70-90 millivolt range.

**RAY PEAT:** No, the cell. In Ling's view, it is a unit, a unified phase, which doesn't have the properties of a random solution, a single, unified, functional sort of a personality that goes through basic changes.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding Dr. Ling's association-induction hypothesis and the concept of NPUs within red blood cells, should health be analyzed at the NPU level rather than the cellular level?

**RAY PEAT:** There is an anti-milk lobby that makes a lot of publicity. And that's one of their current ploys, to direct people away from milk. But if you look at the consumption of milk over the last 50 years, there's a tremendous decrease, even in children. More and more, they're shifting to so-called vegetable-based milk substitutes. And that, during this time, looking at the population, you see a tremendous increase in premature puberty in girls, and a great increase in gynecomastia, the development of breasts in boys and men.

**CONTEXT:** What is your perspective on the potential estrogen load of milk, especially from cows that are constantly in estrus?

**RAY PEAT:** No, they get a drying off period. One of the reasons milk tends to have an overall protective effect against estrogen is that the estrogens that are in milk are in a detoxified form. Estrone sulfate, for example, is the least harmless form of estrogen. Not at all comparable to the estrogens that are in the soy milk substitute.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that cows have a drying-off period. What about the estrogens in milk?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the pitch affects enzyme activity. Yeah, I can believe it completely without having to see any proof, it's just the concept of or just hearing a baby cry is enough to put anyone on edge. Yeah, or people that get in road traffic, you know, situations where they're just being loud and obnoxious or, you know, all of that, I can't see that as being as being creative or healing in any way. So always see it as being inflammatory and destructive. It's all part of that screaming and shouting cycle.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that pitch affects enzyme activity. Do you have any thoughts on the impact of vocalizations like shouting or screaming?

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, the brain is in control of your digestive system. That was Pavlov's basic research, seeing how the brain manages the whole digestive process. And if you have negative thoughts, anxiety, you'll have digestive problems. The spices that stimulate salivation, for example, will stimulate secretion in your stomach and small intestine and make everything digest optimally. But some spices happen to be allergenic for some people, so you have to be cautious. Well, you have to experiment and find out. And also, just like chili or capsicum, that increases blood flow, so that can improve digestion.

**CONTEXT:** How do spices help our digestive system and nutrient uptake?

**RAY PEAT:** Well, bitter herbs are very useful at increasing the digestion, the digestive enzymes and increasing absorption of nutrients and increasing stomach acid. And of course, people that are low thyroid will have a decrease in all of the enzymes and the digestive secretions needed for absorbing nutrition. The bitters work on multiple levels of stimulating your nerves. And some of them actually improve mitochondrial energy production. Some of them have systemic sedative and stabilizing effects. It can be very important to your general health.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the role of bitter herbs in digestion and nutrient absorption, especially for those with low thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Things like gentian, wormwood, any of the... We've started giving our daughter Centauri. Yes, Centauri. Which is a little bitter. It's a little clover.

**CONTEXT:** Are there specific bitter herbs you recommend?

**RAY PEAT:** The research of Robert Becker in biological electrical activity, he found that organisms are responsive to extremely weak electromagnetic signals, pulsations in the Earth's electromagnetic field. Older research in the 40s and 50s were finding that all sorts of organisms govern their metabolic rate by changes picked up from the electromagnetic field. Currently, the doctrine is that it's simply the light and dark changes that are queuing in the expression of certain genes appropriate for night or daytime. But in this older research, they would put the organism in sealed chambers, out of sight of the outside changes of night and day. And some of the changes persisted even in holes in the ground, mine shafts. And plants, for example, that folded their petals during the night, some of these plants were taken down, and they could still detect the changes of day and night until they were 60 feet below the surface. So there are some very penetrating electromagnetic fields that are crucially important for the cycles of plants. The current dogma that it's nothing but daylight and nighttime are really trying to cover up that extreme sensitivity to weak fields and how important it is that we're being bombarded with polluting electrical rhythms.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the physical mechanism by which electromagnetic fields might have a healing effect, referencing older research?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the research of Robert Becker in biological electrical activity, he found that organisms are responsive to extremely weak electromagnetic signals, pulsations in the Earth's electromagnetic field. Older research in the 40s and 50s were finding that all sorts of organisms govern their metabolic rate by changes picked up from the electromagnetic field.

The current dogma that it's nothing but daylight and nighttime are really trying to cover up that extreme sensitivity to weak fields and how important it is that we're being bombarded with polluting electrical rhythms.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned the potential for electromagnetic fields to influence biological processes. Can you elaborate on the historical research in this area?

**RAY PEAT:** The research of Robert Becker in biological electrical activity, he found that organisms are responsive to extremely weak electromagnetic signals, pulsations in the Earth's electromagnetic field.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Robert Becker's research on biological electrical activity. Can you expand on that and the sensitivity of organisms to electromagnetic signals?

**RAY PEAT:** Any kind of stress will bring on these stabilizing proteins, and I suspect that those are behind the various reductions of the inflammatory. Another acute stress-induced protective factor is hypoxia-induced factor. That tends to come up at the same time as the heat shock proteins, and these help nerve cells, for example, to get through intense stress, which could be glucose deprivation or oxygen deprivation, either one.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned heat shock proteins and hypoxia-induced factor as protective mechanisms in ischemic stroke. How do these relate to stress and cellular survival?

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's... actually, we can probably skip this one. This is part and parcel of hypoxia-induced neuronal cell death. They've mentioned here that there was various signal molecules that were involved in inflammation and various proteins that were secreted in response to inflammation, and that this pulsed electromagnetic fields could mitigate the effects of this.

**CONTEXT:** You're referring to an article on hypoxia-induced neuronal cell death. What was the key finding regarding pulsed electromagnetic fields?

**RAY PEAT:** I think I'm probably more interested in how the mechanism by which sound waves and this is again it kind of harks back to Rife therapy and disrupting cancer cells or indeed bacteria that Rife was experimenting with and how the frequency and I think we have to make analogies here to things like the Clifton suspension bridge swaying in the wind because of the harmonics that were produced by the wind blowing through the cabling. And how that frequency and that resonance became very destructive and involved of bridge failing but how these electromagnetic fields generate this disruptive event to become healing you know in terms of inflammation and how that actually works.

**CONTEXT:** You're interested in the mechanism by which sound waves and electromagnetic fields might cause disruptive or healing effects, drawing an analogy to the Clifton suspension bridge. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** Each enzyme probably has its own responsive frequency, but that was contrary to standard biochemical cell function, and so it was totally neglected. The ATP was found to respond to musical frequencies, that's another violation of standard physical chemical.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that ATP responds to musical frequencies, which contradicts standard biochemical understanding. Can you explain this further?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea that anything stimulating your appetite, your nerves, your brain is in control of your digestive system. That was Pavlov's basic research, seeing how the brain manages the whole digestive process. And if you have negative thoughts, anxiety, you'll have digestive problems. The spices that stimulate salivation, for example, will stimulate secretion in your stomach and small intestine and make everything digest optimally.
