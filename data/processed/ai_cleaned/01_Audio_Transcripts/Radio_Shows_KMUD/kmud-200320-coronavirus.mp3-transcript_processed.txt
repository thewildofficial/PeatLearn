**RAY PEAT:** My PhD is in physiology and biochemistry, specializing in reproductive and aging biology, with a particular focus on the nervous system and how nutrition interacts with those changes. While I haven't focused on virology, this virus directly impacts my areas of expertise: inflammation, aging, and cellular respiration.

**CONTEXT:** Could you introduce yourself and your background for our listeners?

**RAY PEAT:** Influenza, and common colds caused by coronaviruses, are essentially the same type of virus. The primary issue with influenza is the massive inflammation that arises as the body's immune response to the virus. This can lead to severe complications like viral pneumonia, which can then be secondarily infected by bacteria. When a person has a confirmed influenza virus, it's common to find other viruses, like common cold viruses and other respiratory pathogens, present as well. It's difficult to definitively attribute the severity solely to one specific virus when multiple pathogens are involved.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that the main issue with influenza is inflammation. Can you elaborate on how other pathogens might play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** The majority of people experiencing severe illness or death from this virus are older, typically over their mid-50s, with the highest mortality rates observed in those over 70. Reports indicate that 99% of those dying with the coronavirus were suffering from other serious conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and stroke symptoms, which significantly increased their likelihood of dying from stress. These weakened conditions also make individuals more susceptible to other pathogens. Therefore, even with a positive test for a specific virus, it's not conclusive that it's the sole contributing factor, especially when other pathogens are present.

**CONTEXT:** You've noted that older populations are disproportionately affected. What factors contribute to this vulnerability?

**RAY PEAT:** Virologists analyzing the gene sequencing of this virus have identified that the genetic lineage of the strain found in Wuhan, China, traces back to the United States. The analysis of base substitutions in the DNA chain indicates that the virus evolved through several stages, with the Wuhan strain appearing as the fourth or fifth descendant. This suggests an earlier origin in the United States.

**CONTEXT:** You've brought up some interesting points about the genetic sequencing of the virus. Can you explain what this analysis suggests about its origin?

**RAY PEAT:** In 2015, a news item in *Nature* magazine reported on research connected to the CDC at Fort Detrick, Maryland, where scientists were working on producing a vaccine for a coronavirus. The goal was to develop a vaccine in advance of a natural epidemic, as the typical 12-18 month vaccine development timeline often means the vaccine is ready after the flu season has passed. This approach was conceptually flawed, as noted by a scientist in 1976 regarding swine flu vaccine development, who was subsequently fired. The swine flu pandemic of 1976, which never materialized as a pandemic, resulted in deaths and paralysis from the vaccine itself. The *Nature* report from 2015 was later accompanied by an editorial note stating that citing it as evidence of a virus escaping from the CDC's Fort Detrick lab was improper. However, the CDC had patented a coronavirus in 2003 for research purposes. Furthermore, in August of the previous year, the CDC ordered the closure of the virus lab at Fort Detrick due to a deterioration of their escape protection systems and a malfunctioning water filtering system, citing the danger of an escaped virus. This closure occurred just two months before the outbreak.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a news report from 2015 regarding coronavirus vaccine research. Can you elaborate on that?

**RAY PEAT:** In July or August of the previous year, it was reported that the CDC had ordered the closure of the virus lab at Fort Detrick due to a deterioration of their escape protection systems and a malfunctioning water filtering system, citing the danger of an escaped virus. This closure happened just two months before the outbreak. Additionally, American soldiers participating in international military athletic contests held in Wuhan the previous summer performed poorly, ranking 35th out of all participating countries. This was a stark contrast to their usual high performance, and Chinese commentators noted the amateurish quality of the American competitors.

**CONTEXT:** You've also raised concerns about the timing of the Fort Detrick lab closure and its potential connection to the outbreak. Can you explain that further?

**RAY PEAT:** The phylogenetic tree of the virus's genome, based on genetic changes over time, indicates a historical timeline that predates the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests that the virus's sequence originated prior to its appearance there. While some top virologists have recently stated that this particular virus was impossible to anticipate or engineer, the earlier genetic analysis points to a different narrative.

**CONTEXT:** You've highlighted the significance of the virus's genetic makeup and its evolutionary timeline. What does this suggest about its origin?

**RAY PEAT:** The mortality rate is highly skewed and not an accurate reflection of the virus's true lethality. As testing expands and more people are tested, the mortality rate per infection decreases. For example, in China, initial reports showed a 2.7% mortality rate, but as testing increased, it dropped to 0.6%. Experts like John Ioannidis suggest the actual mortality rate could range from 0.025% to 5%. In areas like Italy and Iran, reported mortality rates were higher (5% to 10%), but this was likely based on those seeking hospital treatment, who are the most severely ill. As larger populations are tested, like in South Korea and China, the mortality rate approaches 0.6%. If the entire population were tested, the mortality rate would likely be much lower, potentially around 0.025%, approaching the mortality rate of the common flu, which is about one in a thousand.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the statistics surrounding the outbreak. Can you explain why the reported mortality rates might be misleading?

**RAY PEAT:** The statistical skewing is similar to what has happened historically with cancer diagnosis and mortality. For instance, an advertisement claimed that widespread use of X-ray machines could lead to a 97% cancer cure rate. If 40% of the population is projected to die from cancer, but you diagnose it in 100% of the population at a certain age, even if only 1% dies, it appears as a high cure rate. This is especially true if you treat individuals who would never have developed symptomatic cancer. However, if the treatment itself is harmful, increasing the diagnostic rate and treatment can paradoxically increase the mortality rate. Following recommendations for regular cancer checkups starting in 1945, cancer mortality steadily increased for 40 years. The introduction of the PSA test led to a radical increase in diagnoses. Since the population remained the same, the mortality rate should have stayed constant, but it surged, strongly suggesting that the treatments were causing deaths. Furthermore, medical mistakes in hospitals contribute to a significant number of deaths annually, estimated between 200,000 and 440,000 in the United States. When diagnostic tests lead more people to hospitals, they are more likely to be subjected to these medical errors.

**CONTEXT:** You've drawn parallels between the current situation and historical trends in cancer diagnosis. Can you elaborate on the concept of statistical skewing in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** The Spanish flu of 1918 was extremely virulent, causing an estimated 50 to 100 million deaths. While the end of World War I and malnutrition played a role, the virus itself, a highly virulent form of H1N1, had a genetic ability to rapidly infect mammalian cells. The limited tissue samples available for analysis, compared to the millions of deaths, make definitive conclusions challenging. At that time, flu was believed to be a bacterial infection, and camphor injections were a common treatment. Interestingly, about 50 years ago, a derivative of petroleum, purified and made water-soluble, was found to be an anti-influenza agent. This research may have stemmed from the use of natural camphor during World War I. Drugs like amantadine, rimantadine, and memantine (known for Alzheimer's treatment) are broad-spectrum antivirals that are genetically safe. This contrasts with other recommended antivirals like acyclovir, ribavirin, and chloroquine, which can interfere with human DNA and are considered genotoxic. Widespread preventive use of these could lead to genetic damage in millions, particularly the young.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned the Spanish flu of 1918. What are your thoughts on its origins and the treatments available at the time?

**RAY PEAT:** Amantadine and its relatives, like memantine, are considered genetically safe and moderately effective against a wide range of viruses. Aspirin, if it were patented, would be considered a superior antiviral due to its effectiveness against influenza, herpes, rhinoviruses, and various hepatitis viruses.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the safety and efficacy of certain antiviral drugs. What is your perspective on their use, particularly in relation to camphor-based treatments?

**RAY PEAT:** The transmission of this virus is primarily through droplets from the oral or nasal cavity, which can be considered a point source, similar to pollution. Mandatory mask-wearing when around others could potentially halt the spread. Handwashing is also crucial, as people frequently touch their faces, unconsciously touching their nose, rubbing their eyes, and bringing fingers near their mouth. Soap is highly effective against this type of virus on the skin, but it is not safe to ingest.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding transmission, why isn't mandatory mask-wearing considered a more effective preventative measure?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea that forming organizations is the best way to counter negative impacts from the ruling class is a valid point. Social distancing, in this context, could be seen as a method to disrupt and suppress organizations. Regarding the governor of California's projection that half the population will be infected, this is within the historical range of flu seasons. The reason for flu season, from winter to late spring in temperate zones, is the decrease in sun exposure, leading to vitamin D deficiency and increased susceptibility to viruses. By summer, rising vitamin D levels enhance viral immunity, ending the flu season.

**CONTEXT:** You've previously mentioned the importance of forming organizations. How does social distancing relate to this, and what are your thoughts on projections of widespread infection?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin D is crucial for immune function. While the recommended daily intake is typically 800-1000 IU, some individuals use much higher doses, such as 20,000 IU per day. Blood tests can reveal vitamin D levels, which can vary significantly between individuals. A level of 50-60 pg/mL is considered a safe range. Many people have levels below this, which can be associated with fatigue, muscle weakness, and high blood pressure. Vitamin D, along with adequate calcium, interacts with the immune system in a similar way to certain drugs used in China to treat coronavirus infections, such as Sinanserin (a serotonin blocker) and Losartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker). These anti-inflammatory substances, along with normal progesterone levels and aspirin, work to counteract inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** You've discussed the role of vitamin D in immune health. Can you elaborate on recommended dosages and its interaction with other bodily systems?

**RAY PEAT:** Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker that blocks the AT1 receptor. There's some confusion regarding ACE inhibitors and the virus's interaction with the ACE2 enzyme. While some believe that increasing ACE2 increases susceptibility, the opposite is true. ACE2 is a defensive, anti-inflammatory enzyme that breaks down angiotensin, producing angiotensin 1-7, which has protective and anti-inflammatory effects. The old textbook idea that ACE enzymes simply make angiotensin is an oversimplification.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned Losartan and its role in blocking the AT1 receptor. Can you explain the interaction between ACE inhibitors, ACE2, and the virus?

**RAY PEAT:** Herbs like Pleurisy Root have documented antibacterial effects for pleurisy. Echinacea root is an anti-inflammatory, whereas the flowers have antiviral action but can be too stimulating. Elderberry is also recognized for its benefits against this virus. Thyme and other herbs from the Labiatae (mint) family exhibit antibacterial properties due to monoterpenes and terpenes. The primary focus should be on managing inflammation, and volatile herbs can help control secondary bacterial infections.

**CONTEXT:** Given the show's title, can you discuss the role of herbs in addressing viral infections and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** The economic recovery depends on getting money directly to consumers, not just corporations. Milton Friedman's proposal for a minimum basic income could have helped stabilize the economy and retain industry domestically. While it might not fully recover industries now, it addresses the fundamental need to stimulate consumer spending.

**CONTEXT:** What are your thoughts on the economic fallout from the pandemic and government stimulus measures?

**RAY PEAT:** The historical average for flu deaths in the United States is around 44,000 annually. If we extrapolate that approximately 10% of these deaths were previously attributed to coronaviruses (though this is a different strain), it would suggest a much lower number of deaths than currently reported. Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg also made a similar point, estimating that based on historical curves, Germany would have expected around 2,000-2,500 deaths, while the reported number was 200. Another database indicates that in 2017, 85,000 people died from pneumonia in the US, with 58,000 of those being over 70. Similarly, in China in 2017, 161,000 died from pneumonia, with 125,000 over 70. Old age often leads to sepsis and pneumonia as primary causes of death. Aging affects the inflammatory system similarly to this virus, increasing angiotensin receptors and decreasing the protective ACE2 enzyme system. Therefore, measures that protect against the virus's effects also protect against aging. The lung fibrosis caused by these viruses can be reversed by addressing the inflammatory system.

**CONTEXT:** You've compared current flu death statistics to historical flu deaths. Can you elaborate on the numbers and the role of pneumonia in these figures?

**RAY PEAT:** It's not necessary to seek a doctor's prescription for Losartan unless you are severely ill in the hospital. Most people will experience only mild symptoms. Access to aspirin, herbs like echinacea, elderberry, astragalus, and bicalamide, as well as antihistamines like loratadine and cyproheptadine (also known as periactin), is generally available. Vitamin D, vitamin B1, and aspirin are beneficial for moving the system in a corrective direction.

**CONTEXT:** Considering the potential benefits of Losartan and other treatments, what is your recommendation for individuals who are concerned about contracting the virus?
