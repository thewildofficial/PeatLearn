**RAY PEAT:** Cataracts can disappear when the eye's metabolic condition is corrected. A supply of energy is essential to maintain the transparent structure. Lactic acid increases as carbon dioxide decreases, during a typical energy deficiency. Deficient thyroid, and the resulting excess of cortisol relative to pregnenolone and progesterone, define the energy deficiency. Increased lactate relative to CO2 in the cell alters cell pH and electrical charge, causing swelling. Swelling and increased water content characterize the cataract. High altitude is inversely related to cataracts, despite the known role of sunlight in causing cataracts; this is a strong confirmation of the protective role of carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental metabolic issue underlying cataract formation?

**RAY PEAT:** The lens of the eye is a fairly dense, tough, transparent living structure, which can develop opaque areas, cataracts, as a result of old age, poisoning, radiation, disease, or trauma. Most of the oxidative metabolism of the lens is in or near the epithelial layer that surrounds it. Old-age cataracts most often begin in this region. Although the efficient oxidative energy metabolism occurs near the surface of the lens, there is a constant flow of fluid through the lens, entering it mainly in the front and back, and leaving on its “sides” or equator. Oxygen and nutrients are supplied to the lens by way of this circulation of fluid, entering mostly from the aqueous humor in front, but also from the vitreous humor behind the lens. When the flow of nutrients and energy is impaired, the organized state of the protein and water system in the cell is damaged, and an excess of water is taken up by the cells, as the protein content decreases. The loss of organization causes light to be dispersed, with a loss of transparency.

**CONTEXT:** How does the lens maintain its structure and transparency, and what happens when this process is disrupted?

**RAY PEAT:** The lens’s circulatory system is very interesting, because of what it says about the nature of living substance. In the absence of blood vessels, it provides its own flow of nutrients. This flow is reminiscent of the flow of substances through the dentine channels of the teeth, through the axons of nerves, and, in some ways recalls the flow of fluids in plants. The flow of material through lens cells, dentine canals, and nerve axons should allow us to gain a perspective in which these observable processes become a model for other biological situations in which “transport” occurs: kidney, intestine, or the skin of frogs, for example, in which water, ions, and other solutes are moved in considerable quantities.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the lens's internal fluid circulation in understanding biological transport?

**RAY PEAT:** When cells metabolize, they create gradients. In the cell, electrical, chemical, osmotic, and thermal gradients, for example, are constantly being produced or maintained. The whole substance of the cell is involved in its life processes. When the term “cell” (hollow space) came into use instead of “corpuscle’ (little body), a mind-set came into existence that discounted the importance of most of the living material, and claimed that it was a mere “random solution.” Random solutions don’t do much. The wonderful “membrane,” under the direction of the nucleus (and its set of instructions), took care of everything. Whenever assimilation or excretion took place, it was explained by inventing a property possessed by the cell “membranes.” Therefore, we have physiology textbooks that have an unfounded explanation for everything. "Membrane physiology" is the modern equivalent of the Ptolemaic epicycles.

**CONTEXT:** How has the prevailing view of cell physiology obscured the understanding of cellular processes?

**RAY PEAT:** We know that glucose can be metabolized into pyruvic acid, which, in the presence of oxygen, can be metabolized into carbon dioxide. Without oxygen, pyruvic acid can be converted into lactic acid. The production of lactic acid tends to increase the pH inside the cell, and its excretion can lower the pH outside the cell. The decrease of carbon dioxide that generally accompanies increased lactic acid, corresponds to increased intracellular pH. Carbon dioxide binds to many types of protein, for example by forming carbamino groups, changing the protein conformation, as well as its electrical properties, such as its isoelectric point. With increased pH, cell proteins become more strongly ionized, tending to separate, allowing water to enter the spaces, in the same way a gel swells in an alkaline solution. The Bohr-Haldane effect describes the fact that hemoglobin releases oxygen in the presence of carbon dioxide, and releases carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen. When oxygen is too abundant, it makes breathing more difficult, and one of its effects is to cause carbon dioxide to be lost rapidly. At high altitude, more carbon dioxide is retained, and this makes cellular respiration more efficient.

**CONTEXT:** Explain the metabolic pathway from glucose to lactic acid and carbon dioxide, and the role of carbon dioxide in protein structure and function.

**RAY PEAT:** The importance of carbon dioxide to cell control process, and to the structure of the cell and the structure of proteins in general suggested that degenerative diseases would be less common at high altitude. Wounds and broken bones heal faster at high altitude, but the available statistics are especially impressive in two of the major degenerative conditions, cancer and cataracts. The two biggest studies of altitude and cataracts (involving 12,217 patients in one study, and 30,565 lifelong residents in a national survey in Nepal) showed a negative correlation between altitude and the incidence of cataract. At high altitude, cataracts appeared at a later age. In Nepal, an increase of a few thousand feet in elevation decreased the incidence of cataracts by 2.7 times. At the same time, it was found that exposure to sunlight increased the incidence of cataracts, and since the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is increased with altitude, this makes the decreased incidence of cataracts even more important.

**CONTEXT:** What is the epidemiological evidence linking altitude and sunlight exposure to cataract incidence?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the typical causes of cataracts, aging, poisons, and radiation, decrease the formation of carbon dioxide, and tend to increase the formation of lactic acid. Lactic acid excess is typically found in eyes with cataracts. The electrical charge on the structural proteins will tend to increase in the presence of lactic acid or the deficiency of carbon dioxide, and the increase of charge will tend to increase the absorption of water.

**CONTEXT:** How do factors that cause cataracts relate to carbon dioxide and lactic acid levels?

**RAY PEAT:** The lens can survive for a considerable length of time *in vitro* (since it has its own circulatory system), so it has been possible to demonstrate that changes in the composition of the fluid can cause opacities to form, or to disappear. Oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide which occurs naturally in the aqueous humor, can cause opacities to form quickly, but they will also disappear quickly in a solution that restores metabolic energy. The lens regulates itself powerfully; for example, it will swell when put into a hypotonic solution, but will quickly adapt, returning to approximately its normal size.

**CONTEXT:** What experimental evidence supports the idea that cataracts are reversible and influenced by the fluid environment of the lens?

**RAY PEAT:** Several years ago, I saw what appeared to be oxidant-induced cataracts. Two women had a very sudden onset of cataracts, and I asked about their diet and supplements; it turned out that one of them had begun taking 500 mg of zinc daily a few months earlier, and the other had begun taking 600 mg of zinc and 250 mg of iron, on her doctor’s recommendation, just a couple of months before the cataracts appeared. For some reason, there have been many nutritional supplements sold as cataract remedies in the form of eye drops. I suppose a trace of the material could diffuse through the cornea into the aqueous humor, where it might make a difference in the lens’s nutrient supply, but it seems more reasonable to treat the body as a whole, nourishing every part in a balanced way.

**CONTEXT:** What are some potential dietary factors that might contribute to or prevent cataracts, and what is the rationale for a systemic approach to treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Besides living at a high elevation or breathing extra carbon dioxide, the most certain way to increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the eye, and to prevent an excess of lactic acid, is to make sure that your thyroid function is adequate. One man who took thyroid, USP, and vitamin E told me that his cataracts had regressed, but I haven’t known other people who tried this. If a person already has distinct cataracts, it might be worthwhile to experiment with a relatively high degree of hypercapnia, for example, breathing a 5% mixture of CO2 in air. Carbon dioxide, at higher levels than are normal at sea level, has a profound effect on free radicals, reducing the free radical activity in the blood to approximately zero, before reaching the level that produces acidosis.

**CONTEXT:** What are the most effective strategies for increasing carbon dioxide levels in the eye and preventing lactic acid buildup?

**RAY PEAT:** There are several situations in which carbon dioxide affects the hydration, water content, of biological materials, that I think give an insight into its effects on the lens. Hydrophilic glycoproteins are involved in each case. These are proteins with attached chains of sugar molecules that make them associate with a large amount of water. In the cornea, increased carbon dioxide strongly protects against swelling. The bulk of the cornea is a connective tissue that is relatively simple and passive compared to the compact cellular structure of the lens, and it is conventional to describe the thin layers of cells on the inside and outside of the cornea as being responsible for the water content of the underlying substance. However, even when the epithelial cells are removed, it has been demonstrated that carbon dioxide is able to prevent corneal swelling. (M.V. Riley, et al., “The roles of bicarbonate and CO2 in transendothelial fluid movement and control of corneal thickness," *Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 36(1)*, 103-112, 1995.)

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide influence the hydration of tissues like the cornea, and what does this suggest about its role in the lens?

**RAY PEAT:** Bronchial mucous secretions are an even simpler system, so it is very interesting that carbon dioxide is recognized as the most powerful regulator of their behavior. (This has important implications for “cystic fibrosis,” or mucoviscidosis.) Goodman and Gilman (page 1068, *Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 2nd Edition*, Macmillan Co., 1956), say "Among inhalants, steam and carbon dioxide have been found to be excellent expectorants. Relative humidity above 85 per cent liquefies sputum, decreases its viscosity....” "Carbon dioxide is the most effective agent of all. It not only lowers the viscosity of tenacious sputum, thereby facilitating expectoration, but it decreases the volume of sputum by promoting its active resorption by bronchial mucosa." "A five to ten per cent concentration of carbon dioxide is adequate and well tolerated if administered at intervals." "Oxygen has been shown to be an antiexpectorant and has effects opposite to those of carbon." Oxygen tends to displace carbon dioxide from tissue, and is a source of free radicals.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of carbon dioxide in regulating bronchial secretions, and how does it compare to oxygen's effects?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the best-known free radical scavenging substances that has been widely used as a drug is iodide. It has been used to treat asthma, parasites, syphilis, cancer, Graves’ disease, periodontal disease, and arteriosclerosis. Diseases that produce tissue overgrowth associated with inflammation--granulomas--have been treated with iodides, and although the iodide doesn’t necessarily kill the germ, it does help to break down and remove the granuloma. Leprosy and syphilis were among the diseases involving granulomas that were treated in this way. In the case of tuberculosis, it has been suggested that iodides combine with unsaturated fatty acids which inhibit proteolytic enzymes, and thus allow for the removal of the abnormal tissue. In experimental animals, iodide clearly delays the appearance of cataracts. (Buchberger, et al., 199l.) Inflammation, edema, and free radical production are closely linked, and are produced by most things that interfere with energy production. Endotoxin, produced by bacteria, mainly in the intestine, disrupts energy production, and promotes maladaptive inflammation. The wide spectrum of benefit that iodide has, especially in diseases with an inflammatory component, suggests first that it protects tissue by blocking free radical damage, but it also suggests the possibility that it might specifically protect against endotoxin.

**CONTEXT:** What is the therapeutic role of iodide, and how might it relate to cataract prevention?

**RAY PEAT:** There are subtler differences in transparence that probably have a variety of causes, but differences in water content or hydration might be involved in the lower transparency that has been seen in women's lenses. Estrogen, which tends to produce edema and hypotonic body fluids, also increases prolactin production. Prolactin is involved in water and electrolyte regulation, and it has been found to accelerate the development of experimental cataracts. (M. C. Ng, et al, 1987.) These hormones are associated with the calcification of soft tissues, and cataracts contain very high levels of calcium. (Avarachan and Rawal, 1987; Hightower and Reddy, 1982.) Estrogen is strongly associated with free radical processes, calcium mobilization, and acetylcholine release, all of which are involved in the process of excitotoxicity. Alvarez, et al., (1996) have shown a possible involvement of acetylcholine in calcium mobilization in the lens. Serotonin is another regulatory substance strongly associated with prolactin and estrogen, and it also can be involved in disrupting the metabolism of the lens. This is one of the potential dangers in using supplemental tryptophan. (Candia, et al., 1980.)

**CONTEXT:** How do hormonal factors like estrogen and prolactin, and neurotransmitters like serotonin and acetylcholine, influence lens metabolism and potentially contribute to cataract formation?

**RAY PEAT:** Old age commonly involves some changes in the color of tissues--loss of pigment from hair and skin, with appearance of new pigment (age pigment, lipofuscin), which may appear as “liver spots.” But there is also a tendency of the toenails, fingernails, teeth, and lenses to turn yellow or brown. Some of this dark material seems to be age pigment, derived from unsaturated fatty acids, but other components have been identified, for example, tryptophan from damaged proteins. The Maillard reaction (similar to the browning that occurs in bread crust) has often been mentioned in relation to aging, and involves the combination of protein amino groups with sugars. But the browning of the lens tends to be associated with the general age related drying of the lens, it isn’t irregularly distributed, and it doesn’t significantly harm vision. When I first heard about the age-related browning of the lens, I thought that the experience of colors would be affected, so I devised a test in which the relative darkness of blue and yellow could be judged in comparison with a graded strip of shades of grey. After people of ages ranging from 10 to 80 had given exactly the same matches, I realized that the nervous system probably corrects for the “yellow filter” effect of the brown lens. The browning of tissues will be the subject of another newsletter.

**CONTEXT:** What is the nature of age-related browning in tissues, including the lens, and how does the nervous system adapt to these changes?

**RAY PEAT:** Among the interesting causes of cataracts: Tamoxifen and hypotonic fluids, sodium deficiency; toxicity of tryptophan; oxidants (metals, hydrogen peroxide, PUFA); diabetes, photosensitizers and sunlight; excess calcium, deficient magnesium. Excess cortisol. Radiation. Arachidonic and linoleic acids in other situations have been found to block cells' regulation of their water content. Hypothyroidism tends to increase the activity of serotonin, estrogen, prolactin, calcium, and the tendency of tissues to retain water, and to decrease the level of ATP. Among the factors that probably have a role in preventing cataracts: Thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone, vitamin E, iodide, pyruvate. Increasing the carbon dioxide lowers the cell’s pH, and tends to resist swelling. Palmitic acid (a saturated fat that can be synthesized by our tissues) is normally oxidized by the lens. Calcium blockers experimentally prevent cataracts, suggesting that magnesium and thyroid (which also act to exclude calcium from cells) would have the same effect. Thyroid hormone is essential for maintaining adequate carbon dioxide production, for minimizing lactic acid, cortisol and prolactin, for regulating calcium and magnesium, for avoiding hypotonicity of the body fluids, and for improving the ratio of palmitic acid to linoleic acid.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key factors that contribute to cataract formation, and what are the most promising factors for prevention?
