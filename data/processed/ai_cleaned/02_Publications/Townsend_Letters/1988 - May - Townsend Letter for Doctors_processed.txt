**RAY PEAT:** The "deleterious effects of unsaturated oils" have been clearly established and are recognized by everyone working in the field. They are not "supposed" and are not merely "discussed" subject to disproof "by others." Many people are now investigating a variety of theories that attempt to explain the specific nature of the toxicity.

**CONTEXT:** Charlotte Gerson criticizes Dr. Peat for his statements regarding linseed oil and its supposed dangers, claiming these effects are not established.

**RAY PEAT:** The opinions credited to Budwig by Erasmus suggest ignorance of organic chemistry and biochemistry. If someone takes Dr. Budwig’s ideas seriously, they should invite her to explain them herself.

**CONTEXT:** Charlotte Gerson defends Dr. Johanna Budwig and Udo Erasmus, suggesting Dr. Peat's criticisms are unfounded and based on a lack of understanding of their work.

**RAY PEAT:** Without knowing more about the publication details of the new version of the book, Fifty Cases, and the letter that Max Gerson supposedly wrote to Schweitzer, I wouldn’t want to analyze all of the ideas ascribed to him. The original book, which I believe was reprinted several times without changes, even after his death, was a coherent scientific document. Posthumous “new editions” always raise questions.

**CONTEXT:** Charlotte Gerson presents information from a later edition of Dr. Gerson's book and an unpublished letter, suggesting Dr. Peat's critique of Gerson's work is based on an incomplete understanding of his later findings regarding linseed oil.

**RAY PEAT:** I am aware that linseed oil has been used by Mexican physicians to treat cancer at least since 1939, and that it can be toxic to cancer cells (though probably less toxic to normal cells), and that its laxative action is plausibly effective in treating constipated cancer patients. My primary criticism is that people who get on the big marketing bandwagon (whether the product is linseed oil or germanium or iron supplements) so often — as in the Udo Erasmus book — appear to systematically lead attention away from the possible dangers of their product.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat clarifies his position, acknowledging some potential benefits of linseed oil but emphasizing his concern about marketing practices that downplay potential risks.
