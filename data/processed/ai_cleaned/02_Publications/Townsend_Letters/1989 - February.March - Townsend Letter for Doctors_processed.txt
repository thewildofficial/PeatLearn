**RAY PEAT:** Linoleic acid, and related oils, in the amounts recommended by Udo Erasmus, are known to cause: impaired brain development and learning; damage to skin and bones; accelerated aging and age-pigment accumulation; damage to the circulatory system; increased cancer incidence; suppressed immunity; endocrine dysfunction.

**CONTEXT:** What are the known negative effects of consuming high amounts of linoleic acid and related oils, as recommended by certain sources?

**RAY PEAT:** Research showing the toxic effects of unsaturated oils goes back more than 60 years. These substances inhibit many enzymes (e.g., in digestion, in immunity, in clot removal, in thyroid function), they disrupt mitochondrial energy production, and they interfere with communication between cells.

**CONTEXT:** What is the scientific basis for the toxicity of unsaturated oils, and how far back does this research extend?

**RAY PEAT:** For nearly 20 years, mainline medicine has advocated the use of unsaturated oils “to protect the heart.” A few scientists, like Hans Selye, kept telling the (contrary) truth. Now big business has many people in “alternative medicine” falling for the false establishment story.

**CONTEXT:** What is the prevailing medical advice regarding unsaturated oils and heart health, and how does this contrast with dissenting scientific opinions?
