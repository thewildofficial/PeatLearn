**RAY PEAT:** The bulk of our active T3 hormone is produced in the liver, as part of a quickly adaptive system for adjusting the metabolic rate in relation to nutritional status, but the pituitary is also able to convert T4 to T3, and a high level of T4 will cause suppression of TSH secretion, even if the liver is failing to produce the active T3, as in aging, stress, cirrhosis, and various other diseases. Thyroxin can literally make hypothyroidism worse. In this case you have suppression without a compensating absorption of active hormone.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion is about thyroid suppression and the conversion of T4 to T3.

**RAY PEAT:** Although a little thyroid substance is a normal dietary factor, and digestion of the glandular colloid converts the protein into the hormones in the same kind of process that occurs in normal secretion from the living gland, I agree with Morstein that it is important to restore the gland’s normal function as far as that is possible. I think many of her suggestions derive from the endocrinology course I taught at NCNM in the 1970's, but I think some of the details are wrong. Normalizing the thyroid is now a pretty well defined physiological process, and the biggest problem is ideological, rather than technical. Many cultural forces, especially the drug companies, have made it hard for people to discuss thyroid endocrinology.

**CONTEXT:** The conversation continues on the topic of thyroid function and the challenges in normalizing it.

**RAY PEAT:** When a tendon in the wrist swells, it can cause numbness in the hand, by pressing on a nerve which passes through the carpal tunnel with some tendons. The tunnel is formed by a ligament that holds the tendons in place, and swelling of the ligament itself can contribute to compression of the nerve. Even the connective tissue that forms the nerve sheath itself can swell. Many people with undiagnosed hypothyroidism complain that they “have poor circulation,” and that their hands and feet go to sleep easily. I think these are two separate (but related) problems. Low thyroid people often have cold hands and feet, and they often have nerves that are over-sensitive to compression. Poor oxygenation is involved in edema, both as cause and consequence but swelling can cause compression and nerve injury in a way that is exacerbated by certain postures or repetitive actions, and this compression can be relieved by surgery. But if the tissue was susceptible to swelling because of the general hormonal environment, other problems will follow. Pinched nerves and arthritis commonly follow treatment of the carpal tunnel syndrome by surgery or local cortisone injections.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion shifts to carpal tunnel syndrome and its connection to hypothyroidism and swelling.
