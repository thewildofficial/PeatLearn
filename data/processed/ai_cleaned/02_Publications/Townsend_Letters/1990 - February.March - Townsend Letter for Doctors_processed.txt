**RAY PEAT:** The essential fatty acids are not essential. The literature on this subject is misrepresented. The independent essentiality of the omega-3 EFA family is established, although the clinical effects of its deficiency are still being investigated. Citing only selected references from the 1940s and 50s in the face of vast literature built up over the past half century of modern biochemistry and clinical investigation is inexcusable. Those who do not read or understand the literature are condemned to repeat it. From this unwarranted position, it is natural to consider toxic effects and conclude that EFAs should not be consumed at all.
**CONTEXT:** A critique of Ray Peat's position on the non-essentiality of fatty acids.
