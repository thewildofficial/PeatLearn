**RAY PEAT:** The gerontologist, V.V. Frolkis, recently found that mice lived 43% longer than animals on the standard diet when they periodically had activated charcoal added to their food. This is the clearest evidence I have seen that “bowel toxins” make a major contribution to the aging process. Although I think carrot fiber would have a similar effect, there might be important differences in the substances bound by wet cellulose and by microporous carbon. Analysis of the substances bound to the charcoal after it has been excreted should give us important new knowledge about aging. Besides endotoxin, I think the charcoal might protect against microbial estrogen and glucocorticoids, carbon monoxide, cyanide, and unsaturated oils. Absorption of heavy metals is probably decreased by all types of “fiber.”

While Bogomoletz and Metchnikof saw the bowel toxins as the factor which drove the aging process, I see bowel toxins rather as a relatively late-acting factor that accelerates a process which develops for other reasons. Once our detoxifying mechanisms begin to fail, bowel toxins pass the bowel with relative ease, and rapidly destroy the remaining systems of defense and detoxification. The altered hormonal environment and weakened digestion of an aging organism create a new balance between the animal and the bowel flora, sometimes allowing the proliferation of more toxic flora. The accumulation of iron and other heavy metals, and of unsaturated fats, and the progressive loss of copper under the influence of the stress of darkness, are probably the central events in the process of aging.
