**RAY PEAT:** "My first research in endocrinology had to do with their estrogen metabolism, and ways to normalize it. ... Since his mice had too much estrogen, I supposed that their livers were deficient in something needed to eliminate estrogen, since the liver normally is a powerful regulator of estrogen, using a certain system of “detoxifying” enzymes. (As it turns out, the thyroid hormone is the basic regulator of this detoxifying function.)"

**CONTEXT:** The discussion begins with research on mice susceptible to breast cancer and their estrogen metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "As I studied estrogen in other situations, two features of its action stood out - it interferes with respiration, and it causes cells to take up water. Its other effects seem to follow from these. In the 1920s, it was found that hypotonicity, an excess of water, stimulates cell division (while hypertonicity inhibits it). Around 1940, Hans Selye found that estrogen’s systemic effect mimics the shock phase of the stress reaction. In shock, deficient circulation of blood and thus deficient oxygenation of tissue are the main problem, and Selye considered the adrenal steroids to be crucial in resolving the problem, and creating adaptation to the stress. But the adrenal steroids can have their own undesirable consequences."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation shifts to the effects of estrogen on cellular respiration and water balance, linking it to stress and shock.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sharks, besides being primitive and not suffering from cancer, are physiologically unique in another way: their body fluids are osmotically in balance with seawater, making them hypertonic to other animals’ body fluids. The mineral content of sharks' blood is not very different from that of other animals. The osmotic difference is made up by a very high concentration of urea (and of trimethyl ammonium). In general, animals that live in water are able to get rid of ammonia easily, because it is very soluble in water, and the excretion of nitrogen as urea and uric acid is considered to have evolved to avoid the toxicity of the large amount of ammonia that would otherwise accumulate in land animals. Therefore, it seems that sharks’ urea evolved as a kind of osmotic buffer (rather than as an excretory product), keeping them in osmotic balance with ocean water, without having to deal with internalization of the extremely high (3.3%) sodium content of ocean water."

**CONTEXT:** The unique physiology of sharks, particularly their osmotic balance with seawater due to high urea concentration, is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another kind of fish, the salmon, which return to fresh water for reproducing, show the other extreme of adaptation to an osmotic problem. After living ‘isotonically’ in the hypertonic ocean environment, keeping their mineral content and osmolarity lower than sea-water’s, they suddenly have to readapt to the extremely hypotonic fresh water. The secretion of prolactin and glucocorticoid steroids seems to facilitate this sudden adaptation, but those hormones also seem to produce an explosively rapid kind of aging. I think their condition is similar to the “Cushingoid” symptoms that frequently appear in middle-aged people."

**CONTEXT:** The osmotic adaptation of salmon to freshwater environments and its potential link to aging is explored.

**RAY PEAT:** "Highly energized cells can resist the osmotic stress of too much water in their environment, and tired cells can’t. Removing the stress, by making the surrounding fluid isotonic or slightly hypertonic, can protect the cells’ energy level, and give them a rest. Until about 1940, the use of hypertonic solutions in therapy was fairly common. Books still mention the use of urea, USP, as a diuretic to treat brain swelling, but I haven’t heard that it is still used this way in the United States. Veterinarians sometimes use hypertonic urea to treat uterine inflammation and infected wounds. Early in this century it was often mentioned as a safe disinfectant and promoter of healing for wounds. It was sometimes used as a powder, and was sprinkled pure onto skin grafts or between bone fragments in repairing fractures. Although it caused some pain, people generally thought it accelerated healing while preventing infection. (Typically, 5 grams of powder would be closed into the wound; milder treatments would probably have been possible, but wartime conditions didn't foster subtlety in medical research.) (Symmers, Lancet, December 4, 1915.)"

**CONTEXT:** The concept of cellular energy and osmotic stress is introduced, along with the historical use of hypertonic solutions like urea for therapeutic purposes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hypertonic sodium chloride (Clifford White, Lancet, October 30, 1915) was also used to treat infected wounds, and its success in treating war wounds led to its use as a vaginal douche in treating various inflammations and infections, including infections associated with child-birth, salpingitis, cellulitis, gonorrhea, vaginitis, and erosions of the cervix, and in preparing a cancerous cervix for surgery. Irrigation of the abdomen with the saline solution gave good results in acute infections that required abdominal drainage. White used a solution containing 1/2 ounce of sodium chloride and 1/16 ounce of sodium citrate in a pint of water. M. Englaender (Med. Kin. January 2, 1916) used intravenous injections of 100 ml. of 2% NaCl to treat a variety of infections and inflammations."

**CONTEXT:** The use of hypertonic sodium chloride for wound treatment and various infections is detailed, citing historical medical literature.

**RAY PEAT:** "In Russia, Gubin (Russky Vrach 14(38)) treated sciatica with two glasses of warm water containing 1.4 teaspoonfuls of NaCl, placed in the rectum; it caused profuse sweating and diuresis."

**CONTEXT:** A specific application of hypertonic sodium chloride in Russia for sciatica is mentioned.

**RAY PEAT:** "I have known many people with food allergies (or with lingering cold or flu symptoms) who said that although their abdomens were distended and uncomfortable, they were so thoroughly constipated that no laxatives worked. When their bowels did move, they sometimes described ribbon-shaped faces, Occasionally I saw their X-rays, in which an opaque “meal” showed up as a very thin and intermittent filament. It appeared that the wall of the bowel was enormously swollen. One woman complained that enemas were useless, because when a quart of water was injected, nothing returned from the bowel, though she would have to urinate more than usual. The colon was obviously drinking the water. I suggested that she try a hypertonic glucose and salt enema, with an aspirin added, neutralized by a little soda, and she immediately had good results."

**CONTEXT:** A practical application of hypertonic solutions for severe constipation and abdominal distension is described, involving a hypertonic glucose and salt enema with aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** "People with less complete obstruction can get the same effect by drinking a hypertonic solution of epsom salts and sodium chloride, with an aspirin. Although this osmotic deflation of inflamed tissue is crude, I think it helps to promote real recovery, by reducing the reactivity of the tissue, and allowing it to recover its normal energy patterns."

**CONTEXT:** A similar osmotic approach using oral intake of hypertonic epsom salts and sodium chloride with aspirin is suggested for less severe cases.

**RAY PEAT:** "In PMS, edema is a common problem, and it used to be thought that edema of the brain was responsible for the irritability or depression or other nervous symptoms, and diuretics such as ammonium compounds and urea were commonly used. (Premenstrual salt cravings are the result of the estrogen-disturbed water balance, and salt-restriction for PMS is as inappropriate as it is for pre-eclampsia or toxemia of pregnancy.) Alkaloids are often active in modifying the water content of physical systems, as well as of cells. The alkaloids that are often used in treating PMS seem to favor improved oxygenation and elimination of edema. I suspect that these drugs, and the natural hormones progesterone and pregnenolone, act in the same direction as hyperosmolarity."

**CONTEXT:** The role of hyperosmolarity and its relation to PMS, edema, and hormonal influences like progesterone and pregnenolone is discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "For several years, I have been interested in the biological effects of ammonia, and compounds that are metabolically close to it. There is clear evidence of ammonia’s antiviral effect, which simulated extensive research by drug companies seeking patentable antiviral amines. Most simple substances have regulatory functions in themselves, besides participating in other systems. Besides viral immunity, I think ammonia is involved in regeneration and nerve modulation. Urea, inosine, GABA, the polyamines, and betaine derivatives (e.g., gamma-butyrobetaine) are closely related to ammonia metabolism, and combinations of them will probably have many useful biological effects."

**CONTEXT:** The biological effects of ammonia and related compounds, including their antiviral, regenerative, and nerve-modulating properties, are highlighted.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sodium chloride, glucose, and other substances can be used at high concentrations for their osmotic effects, but they also have chemical and metabolic effects that aren't necessarily desirable. Both osmotic and biochemical effects should be taken into account in a given therapy."

**CONTEXT:** A concluding remark emphasizes the importance of considering both osmotic and biochemical effects when using substances like sodium chloride and glucose in therapeutic contexts.
