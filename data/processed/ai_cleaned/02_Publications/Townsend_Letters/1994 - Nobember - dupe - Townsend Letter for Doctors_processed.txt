**RAY PEAT:** I believe that idea [that progesterone cannot be taken orally] was a simple fabrication of someone in the drug industry in the 1940s to promote their own new synthetic progestin, because I could never find the source for the idea, which simply began appearing in the literature without supporting data, when new products needed promotion.

Human milk from healthy women contains significant amounts of progesterone, which makes milk an important part of the infant's endocrine system. Associated with fat droplets, progesterone enters the blood by the chylomicron pathway, permitting it to avoid inactivation or excretion.

When taken in the powdered or micropulverized form (even if the powder is packed in oil) progesterone doesn't enter the blood as chylomicrons, and so is quickly processed into a water-soluble metabolite, which is excreted. This metabolite cross-reacts with active progesterone in the usual analysis of blood levels, and creates some medical confusion, since symptoms and measurements don't relate in the usual ways.

**CONTEXT:** The editor's review of a book on hormone replacement stated that progesterone "cannot be taken orally."

**RAY PEAT:** I have the patent on that form [oral progesterone dissolved in vitamin E], and some manufacturers have unscrupulously implied that they are using my formula. I have tested several such preparations, in preparing my patent infringement case. Recently I have examined some of the products of a Portland company (a company which has led many people to think I am involved in their business). What I found was that the progesterone had rapidly gone out of solution, forming bizarre hair-like crystals, which gave the solution a slightly stringy texture. Natural progesterone in natural vitamin E remains stable in solution, and I believe the only explanation for the bizarre crystallization that I and others have observed would be the use of synthetic polymer-substances in the solution. In that form, it doesn’t infringe my patent, but it would seem to be mislabeled and misrepresented.

**CONTEXT:** The author is discussing the stability and formulation of oral progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** The FDA has erroneously classified progesterone with synthetic progestins, and hasn’t made any attempt to help the public separate promotional fictions from physiological facts. In fact, they have themselves created additional fictions about progesterone, ascribing properties of the synthetic progestins to progesterone itself, resulting in tremendous injury to the public health. (If that agency strictly followed the rules of administrative law, it might not be perceived as the servant of the industry which it is supposed to regulate.) The ineffectiveness of oral progesterone is one of the fictions that needs to be corrected, and the popular and alternative medical press is where that correction can be achieved.

**CONTEXT:** The author is addressing the regulatory classification of progesterone and its implications for public understanding.

**RAY PEAT:** If she ever rewrites the book, I hope she will consider the evidence that thyroid hormone plays a major role in rebuilding bones, and that unsaturated oils (via prostaglandins and a variety of other hormonal derangements) and estrogen (via promotion of prolactin) have a role in causing osteoporosis. Oral progesterone dissolved in vitamin E is a powerful protectant of every system and tissue, including the bones, but it is important to understand its wonderful effects in the contexts of physiology and ecology. I think the properties of natural progesterone provides us with a scientific paradigm, similar to the concept of “adaptogens” in medicine, but even more basic, involving physical self-ordering processes. Increasingly, our health will depend on understanding this paradigm of life’s resistance to harm.

**CONTEXT:** The author is offering further insights into bone health and the broader physiological role of progesterone.
