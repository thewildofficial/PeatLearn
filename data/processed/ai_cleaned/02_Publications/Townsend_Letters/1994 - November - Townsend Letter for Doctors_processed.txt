**RAY PEAT:** The goals of both health care and education, I think, are to maximize abilities and pleasures, minimizing disabilities and displeasures. The World Health Organization has defined health in terms of decreasing dysadaptations, and improving our adaptation to our surroundings.

As Felix Meerson (described in my monograph “Resistance of the heart”) has shown, the brain is the preferred organ of adaptation, because adaptation on the level of learning has no biological costs, in the sense of limiting our structure and function. As soon as we submit to a cultural stereotype or a textbook answer, we give up our creative capacity to adapt mentally, and begin to avoid problems, questions, and mysteries, because adaptation at any level other than creative imagination is a bodily stress; the acceptance of authority commits a person to wielding any authority they have, or helplessly adapting to the authority of others. Full health requires the responsible and creative use of the mind. This is why I think it is necessary to consider the reform of health care and education together, as a single project of cultural reform.

**CONTEXT:** What led you to doubt the experts and reform educational systems?

**RAY PEAT:** The academic sciences and humanities are similar in their fear of responsibility for knowledge. Everyone marches in step, assigns the right textbooks, and holds the acceptable assumptions, so that they can keep their job. Ultimately (and frequently enough to keep people in line) the board of trustees exercises its power to herd the university faculty in the desired direction.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental issue with current educational institutions?

**RAY PEAT:** What this means is that competence is defined as a) enrolling in the institutions presently established by governmental authority; b) jumping through ten to forty hoops per year, for a certain number of years; the size and height of the hoops are set by the authorities in consultation with the experts; c) in certain cases, one or two flaming hoops may be required, to exalt the authority of the profession. Art Pearl, a professor of education, used to argue that students should be awarded their degrees when they enroll in college, since the degrees don't stand for any special competence now, and the recognition of that would make people think about the actual qualifications needed for doing a job. If we compare education to the rites of initiation many cultures have, then symbolizing entry into adulthood with a college degree, earned by a feat of endurance, isn’t so strange, but the ritual could be modified so that it didn’t interfere with learning the things people really want to learn.

**CONTEXT:** How is competence currently defined in education, and what is a more meaningful approach?

**RAY PEAT:** By law, these tests are not sufficient evidence of competence, and only those who hold accredited professional degrees may take them. If people without degrees were allowed to take the licensing exams, it might be discovered that the endurance-training had a detrimental effect on the students’ problem-solving abilities. Several years ago, it was discovered that students’ IQs decreased with each additional year they spent in certain schools. In a study of graduate students, it was found that there was an inverse relationship between their academic standing and their distance from the mean IQ, in either direction, that is, the mean IQ is excellent academically.

**CONTEXT:** What is the impact of the current educational system on students' abilities?

**RAY PEAT:** If we are concerned with what people know and are able to do, then we can find ways to help them develop the knowledge and ability that they want. However if that goal is a fraud, and we really want a nation of obedient, submissive, rigid and uncritical people who don’t rock any boats, then we should just worry about keeping guns and drugs out of the schools (remember the math graduate student who murdered his professor?) and otherwise keep the educational system as it is, with emphasis on form, rather than outcome.

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying intention of the current educational system, and what would a focus on actual ability entail?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of testing for competence (with varying degrees of generality, relating to specific tasks or ability to respond to novelty) would fundamentally change our educational institutions, but its influence would extend into the workplace. Many jobs would disappear if everyone's competency improved. In medicine, people talk about payment for keeping the patient well, instead of for alleviating or curing disease, but keeping the public healthy is going to require a major social effort to keep food, water, air, homes, travel and workplaces safe. If people become aware of their potential for creative adaptation and problem solving, the whole direction of the economy must change, because status and style-dependent consumption derive their importance from the absence of intrinsic interest in many of our activities.

**CONTEXT:** How would a focus on competence testing impact society and the economy?

**RAY PEAT:** Active criticism is an old idea that is close to “imaginative science.” B.G. Niebuhr is considered to have founded German historiography with his concept of criticizing the source documents. Goethe used the phrase “tatige skepsis” (active doubt, constructive criticism) to describe Niebuhr’s method. William Blake emphasized that criticism and imagination must be combined to correct error; doubt by itself is futile, imagination is vulnerable without organized and active criticism. More recently, Salvador Dali’s concept of “critical paranoia” advocated the same intelligent use of the brain, to discover what is true, important, and interesting in ambiguous situations. Meerson, the investigator of stress physiology, speaks of adaptive culture as the first level of protection against harmful conditions.

**CONTEXT:** What is the essence of active criticism and its relation to adaptation?

**RAY PEAT:** For about 50 years, the concept “psychosomatic” has been trivialized to mean “it’s just imaginary.” But now, the studies of the physiology of helplessness show that a seemingly small difference in experience and attitude can cause a very great difference in the ability to mobilize biological energy and various aspects of immunity, such as Natural Killer cell activity. There is now general agreement on the distinction between the demobilized state of helplessness and the state of active adaptation. If everyone could be “vaccinated” against helplessness, there would be a general improvement in health and ability to learn. But irrational institutions keep making helpless people. A culture which promoted a responsible, creative use of critical intelligence would minimize the experience of helplessness; and at the same time it would shift our adaptive habits upward, toward seeking reasonable imaginative solutions to problems that now are often perceived as stresses and threats.

**CONTEXT:** How does the concept of "psychosomatic" relate to helplessness and biological energy?

**RAY PEAT:** After my experience at Blake College, in which the essence of the institution was to support the inclination of students and teachers toward being responsible for knowledge, I found that it was often possible to reinterpret institutional rules to create a similar temporary environment within the existing conventional universities.

**CONTEXT:** How can a more responsible educational environment be fostered within existing institutions?

**RAY PEAT:** The greatest impediment to doing this is probably the fear of unemployment; subscribing to the current academic idiocy, or the current cliché of the marketplace, is felt to be necessary to fit in. In questions of health and education our culture is at a critical point. Things could be reinstitutionalized to give all power to the drug, insurance and communication industries, or they could begin to be de-institutionalized to expand the scope for intelligent individual activity.

**CONTEXT:** What are the primary obstacles to fostering intelligent individual activity in health and education?

**RAY PEAT:** Art Pearl's suggestion that students be automatically granted degrees can be seen as the student’s equivalent of tenure. If teachers were much more secure about their jobs, there wouldn't be so much pressure to conform. There are foolish and wicked teachers, and good and wise teachers. If students know there are objective standards of achievement, they won’t be under the teachers’ power; teachers will be challenged by the needs and curiosities of the students. Students will necessarily become conscious of the need to examine and question the source of information. Little kids naturally have that inclination, which is the inclination of good scientists and artists.

**CONTEXT:** How can student-teacher dynamics be improved to foster critical thinking and genuine learning?

**RAY PEAT:** The Japanese have relatively high levels of achievement in education. They also invented crawl-in hotel “rooms,” stuffers to pack people into subways, and snap-on apartments. Their achievement comes at the price of exhaustion, misery, and diseases of stress. They represent one of our potential futures. The other potential future takes into account our health and happiness, and defines health as having the capacity for creative mental adaptation.

**CONTEXT:** What are the contrasting potential futures for society based on educational and societal priorities?
