**RAY PEAT:** Progest-E Complex, made under my patent, has never deviated from its 10% progesterone content, so it contains 2,850 mg of progesterone per ounce, and I don't know of any test that has found otherwise.

**CONTEXT:** A correction regarding the progesterone content of a specific product.

**RAY PEAT:** The toxic state of tissue is of primary importance whether in cancer or gallstones. Without dehydration, gallstones cannot form and I believe that the common factors in all chronic ill health are dehydration, toxicity and chemical (nutritional) imbalance. Bacterial clean-up is a result, not a cause, of such a dry, toxic and nutrient-imbalanced state. Of course, individual constitution and toxic/nutritional history make necessary the evaluation of each person on an individual basis.

**CONTEXT:** Explanation of the underlying causes of illness, linking dehydration, toxicity, and nutritional imbalance to the formation of gallstones and other chronic health issues.

**RAY PEAT:** The philosophies of Pasteur versus Béchamp are a most important fundamental foundation in thinking upon which to place the evidence of what we find. In short, Pasteur believed that microbes are from external sources, unrelated to tissue state and need a solution from without (i.e. drugs — the basis of the pharmaceutical industry). Béchamp believed and proved that microbes originated from within, when the climate was toxic, and reverted to non-pathogenic microbes when tissue returned to health. This philosophy is the basis for health and responsibility. Pasteur renounced his beliefs and agreed with Béchamp on his death bed, but that is not commonly known nor reported, Béchamp for some strange reason, despite his impressive titles and works, has been largely ignored and deleted from records where he should have been found.

**CONTEXT:** A discussion on the contrasting philosophies of Pasteur and Béchamp regarding the origin of microbes and disease, emphasizing Béchamp's "terrain theory" and its implications for health.

**RAY PEAT:** I find the author's comments most interesting and if these are seen in the light of being the result and not cause of illness, this work would complement works of people like Béchamp, Lida Mattman and many others who also identify microbes at the site of “tissue activity.” The herbs he mentioned are most interesting and beneficial in that they aid tissue detoxification and immune capacity and therefore enhance and shorten the tasks of ‘pathogenic’ microbes. I agree also, that the quality of herb is of vital importance.

**CONTEXT:** A commentary on the author's perspective, aligning it with Béchamp's theories and highlighting the role of herbs in supporting detoxification and immune function.

**RAY PEAT:** Some may ask how the Australian Barry (?sorry cannot recall his surname) ‘infected’ himself with H. pylori when he was identifying its association with stomach ulcers. In my experience the stomach lining is badly affected by chronic dehydration and mercury poisoning from fillings. I wonder what this experiment would have produced in a non-toxic (realistically in the 1990's low-toxic), well hydrated individual. Sorry Barry — not being personal — only discussing the parameters of possibilities. How do children pick up ‘infection’ from peers if there is no contagion? Well, there is an opportunity to ‘catch detoxification agents’ if relevant to your tissue. Resonance is the key. Why do only certain office staff ‘catch’ the cold going around? Why not everyone? Resistance is the usual understanding but examining resistance brings one back to the terrain theory of Béchamp. Also, how can some have “TB’ of the lung in the absence of the tuberculus bacillus? If we are going to keep to the laws of good science then ‘contagion laws’ apply to all.

**CONTEXT:** A critical examination of the concept of contagion, suggesting that "catching" an illness is related to an individual's internal state and susceptibility, aligning with Béchamp's terrain theory.

**RAY PEAT:** Alas, health for all would topple society as we know it. The food industries, banking and finance systems, petro-chemical industry, pharmaceutical industry and indeed, government revenue etc. all rely on the premise of Pasteur. The sickness industry, massive and international, is nothing to do with health. I am certainly not against society etc. and the sickness industry offers the only help some will accept — I am not pointing fingers or involved in criticism, but simply state that the choice for health is individual and cannot be truly made unless based on the necessary information (Informed Choice). There are many who do not choose health and that is their prerogative. Information is plentiful but putting it together in context to get a clear picture is not easy. Your publication serves as an excellent forum in this respect.

**CONTEXT:** A commentary on the societal and economic implications of the prevailing "sickness industry" which is based on Pasteur's germ theory, contrasting it with the individual's choice and responsibility for health based on informed understanding.
