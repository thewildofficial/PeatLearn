**RAY PEAT:** The common bean contains phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), a lectin that can cause effects similar to viral infections and autoimmune diseases. PHA can lead to the appearance of large mononuclear cells in the blood, suppress DNA synthesis in thymic cells, cause a slight leucopenia, and induce hepatic necrosis. Other legumes like lentils, broad beans, fenugreek, peas, chickpeas, lupinus, and soybeans also exhibit similar activity. Even a single exposure to these plant toxins can have effects that remain microscopically visible for up to two weeks.

**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of common bean toxins and other plant toxins on the body?

**RAY PEAT:** In states of aging, stress, and malnutrition, the intestinal barrier function is compromised. Deficiencies in Vitamin A and magnesium allow macromolecules to enter the bloodstream from the intestine.

**CONTEXT:** How do aging, stress, and malnutrition affect the intestinal barrier?

**RAY PEAT:** Injury to the bowel can manifest as "flu-like" symptoms. There are observations that viruses associated with respiratory illnesses can appear in the intestine before they are detected in the respiratory tract. Research suggests that in conditions like a cold, a specific type of contraction in the small bowel can occur, and codeine has been found to be effective in blocking these symptoms. Additionally, naloxone, a morphine antagonist, has shown the ability to restore normal responses in a stressed bowel. The connection between fatigue states and prior infections, such as influenza, has also been noted.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between bowel injury, flu-like symptoms, and the nervous system?

**RAY PEAT:** Bacterial toxins, whether originating in the intestine or from food supplements, can be absorbed in larger quantities through the intestinal wall during periods of stress, malnutrition, and aging. Endotoxin, a component of bacterial cell walls, can suppress mitochondrial respiration and induce a physiological state similar to shock, which can also be triggered by endogenous hormones. I believe endotoxin may play a role in conditions like the premenstrual syndrome and potentially some breast conditions.

**CONTEXT:** How do bacterial toxins, particularly endotoxin, affect cellular respiration and hormonal balance?

**RAY PEAT:** Mitochondrial damage, often seen in severe stress, is characterized by a depletion of antioxidant reserves and a reduced capacity to convert cholesterol into protective steroid hormones. This mitochondrial dysfunction is more prevalent in hypothyroidism, as thyroxine helps inhibit lipid peroxidation and counteracts the effects of adrenaline, thereby preventing or minimizing "catecholamine toxicity." Since beans and lentils are potent anti-thyroid agents, their consumption can lead to decreased aerobic capacity and reduced peak oxygen consumption, which aligns with observations in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) if it's linked to chronic exposure to dietary legumes.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between mitochondrial damage, hypothyroidism, and the consumption of legumes?

**RAY PEAT:** Hypothyroidism impairs the body's ability to retain magnesium. Studies showing that magnesium supplementation improved pain, energy levels, and emotional state, while increasing intracellular magnesium in CFS patients, suggest a potential role for hypothyroidism in the development of CFS.

**CONTEXT:** How does hypothyroidism relate to magnesium levels and chronic fatigue syndrome?

**RAY PEAT:** A hallmark symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is post-exertional malaise, characterized by pain, weakness, and an exacerbation of other symptoms like fever and swollen lymph nodes. This can be explained by increased absorption of bowel toxins, which occurs when the intestine experiences relative ischemia (reduced blood flow) during intense adrenergic stimulation.

**CONTEXT:** How can post-exertional malaise in CFS be explained by bowel toxin absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** When an allergen is consumed, it can remain in the intestine without causing immediate issues. However, exertion, emotional stress, hunger, or even nighttime can lower blood sugar, triggering a surge of adrenaline. Adrenaline constricts blood flow to the intestine, allowing allergens to be absorbed through the compromised tissues. If blood sugar remains low despite adrenaline, white blood cells can release inflammatory substances like histamine. Simultaneously, adrenaline stimulates the release of glucocorticoids. These hormonal responses can lead to night sweats and neurological symptoms. Glucocorticoids initially promote, but at high levels, can degrade the body's detoxifying enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which allergens are absorbed during stress and low blood sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Certain conditions, such as bowel infections or an immature intestinal lining, can permit the passage of large amounts of allergens into the bloodstream. It's concerning that in some regions, physicians and nutritionists advise mothers to introduce beans to infants as early as six months, and in parts of Africa, "bean milk" is given to babies from birth instead of milk.

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of immature intestinal barriers and early introduction of legumes to infants?

**RAY PEAT:** The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated as a potential cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Interestingly, research has shown a striking similarity between Burkitt's lymphoma cells and human lymphocytes stimulated by bean extracts. This suggests a possible link between Burkitt's lymphoma and a bean-rich diet, although other factors are undoubtedly involved, as not everyone who consumes beans develops the disease. Intestinal parasites, common in tropical regions, can cause inflammation of the bowel, leading to increased absorption of antigens.

**CONTEXT:** What is the observed similarity between EBV-affected cells and bean-stimulated lymphocytes, and its potential implications?

**RAY PEAT:** Given that the bowel becomes inflamed during influenza, it's plausible that some of the symptoms associated with "the flu" are actually caused by the absorption of toxins from the gut.

**CONTEXT:** What is the potential role of bowel toxins in influenza symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** The variations in post-influenza syndromes are likely influenced by the types of bacteria or foods present, either chronically or at the time of uncompensated stress or inflammatory disease. Research suggests that while conditions like rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis are linked to streptococcal antigens, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be caused by antigens from gram-positive lactobacilli, which are part of the normal gut flora. Migraine, SLE, CFS, thyroid issues, and certain types of porphyria are more common in women of reproductive age and are often exacerbated by premenstrual hormonal changes. One theory is that women in this age group harbor a specific vaginal flora, including large numbers of gram-positive lactobacilli, which could contribute to these conditions. My own experience of developing migraines after consuming lactobacillus-rich products led me to avoid them, initially attributing the symptoms to lactic acid. While lactic acid can be a metabolic burden, especially with estrogen excess, the idea that our immune response to systemic bacterial antigens is significant warrants further consideration.

**CONTEXT:** How do bacterial antigens, particularly from lactobacilli, potentially contribute to autoimmune and inflammatory conditions like SLE and migraine, especially in women of reproductive age?

**RAY PEAT:** I've previously discussed the use of antibiotics, carrot fiber, and charcoal for relieving the premenstrual syndrome. Charcoal has also been noted to extend lifespan in studies. Anecdotal evidence suggests charcoal can promote normal growth in pigs, similar to antibiotics used in animal agriculture. Charcoal's effectiveness likely stems from its ability to bind and remove toxins, and its potent catalytic action in the oxidative destruction of toxic chemicals, essentially mimicking the protective enzymes found in the intestinal wall and liver.

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of charcoal in detoxification and promoting health, and how does it compare to antibiotics?

**RAY PEAT:** Our body's natural defenses against environmental toxins include a protective mucus layer, IgA antibodies on mucous membranes, the brush border of intestinal cells for protein digestion, enzymes in the intestine and liver for detoxifying smaller molecules, and binding proteins like albumin and metallothionein. These mechanisms prevent toxins from entering the body. When toxins bypass these barriers, survival depends on adaptive factors like catatoxic steroids and antioxidant systems. The monooxygenase enzyme system, responsible for metabolizing exogenous toxins, also processes endogenous substances such as steroids, prostaglandins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which influence allergic reactivity. An imbalance in this system can lead to the depletion of protective steroids.

**CONTEXT:** What are the body's natural defense mechanisms against environmental toxins, and how do they relate to steroid hormone production?

**RAY PEAT:** Some research suggests that allergic reactions themselves may function as an immunological defense against toxins. However, when the intestine and liver are damaged, cholesterol production can be significantly reduced, leading to insufficient levels for producing catatoxic and anti-inflammatory steroids. Many individuals experiencing allergic fatigue have dangerously low blood cholesterol levels, often between 90 and 130 mg%. Consuming fruit, due to its fructose content, can help restore liver cholesterol synthesis.

**CONTEXT:** How does impaired liver and intestinal function affect cholesterol production and the synthesis of protective steroids, and what role does fruit play?

**RAY PEAT:** Undercooked and raw plant materials are generally significant sources of toxins and allergens. Legumes have become more prominent in the American diet due to a shift in dietary ideology emphasizing "healthful" eating, often coupled with compulsive exercise and the use of trendy but potentially toxic supplements like tryptophan and manganese. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) tablets can sometimes be contaminated with iron or other catalysts, leading to the production of toxic free hydroxyl radicals. In vegetarian diets low in preformed Vitamin A (retinol), carotene can become toxic. The conversion of carotene to retinol requires adequate liver function, including sufficient thyroid hormone, and excessive carotene can be anti-thyroid and anti-steroidogenic. A deficiency in retinol can impair barrier functions, immune responses like antibody formation, and the synthesis of protective steroids.

**CONTEXT:** What are the risks associated with raw plant materials, legumes, and certain supplements, particularly in the context of vegetarian diets and Vitamin A deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** Some women experiencing premenstrual fatigue notice that the premenstrual phase lengthens over time, eventually leading to chronic fatigue. I've found this to be one of the more easily correctable "PMS" issues. As people age and experience prolonged illness, fatigue problems tend to involve multiple bodily systems. Individuals with higher amounts of stored "toxic fat" need to be more cautious when increasing metabolic and physical activity. The use of Vitamin E, short-chain saturated fats, and other agents that inhibit lipid peroxidation is crucial.

**CONTEXT:** What are the challenges in addressing chronic fatigue in older individuals and those with significant "toxic fat" stores, and what protective measures are recommended?

**RAY PEAT:** Sixty years ago, chronic fatigue was often dismissed as a "nervous breakdown," with patients advised to rest and avoid medical attention. Sometimes, a change in activity, environment, work, or social circle can be beneficial. Dietary changes can also have social and ideological implications and might be easier to implement during a vacation. However, often the solution involves simply avoiding certain plant materials and food supplements, correcting hormonal imbalances, or modifying the intestinal environment.

**CONTEXT:** How has the understanding and treatment of chronic fatigue evolved, and what are the common approaches to resolving it?
