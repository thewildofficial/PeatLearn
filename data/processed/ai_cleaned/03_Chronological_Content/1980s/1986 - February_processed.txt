This is a general principle for the brain and other tissues: the high energy state is relaxed. Epilepsy is an example of a very low energy state of brain cells. Insomnia is a low energy state, and is usually cured by the right dose of thyroid hormone, with adequate glucose and other nutrients. Insomnia is extremely common in aging people, and is the main problem at menopause. Inflammation is another example of a low energy state. Specific patterns of symptoms can be produced by reflexes, and these reflexes can be stuck in place by an energy deficiency. Focussed activity and an alert readiness to respond are prevented by a low energy state, which can cause us to get stuck in inappropriate activity, ranging from worry to "auto-immune" conditions. The inhibited state of nerves has not been a popular field for research in our culture, but the knowledge gradually accumulates. Another type of inhibition has been described recently, where acetylcholine hyperpolarizes central neurons by acting on an M1 muscarinic receptor.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the relationship between energy levels and nerve function, particularly in conditions like insomnia and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** A red hot object radiates lower energy, longer waves than a very hot star does, and a warm person radiates slightly longer, lower energy waves than does the red hot object. The peak of our radiant emission is long infra-red, and we are fairly transparent to that wave-length, so we are black body emitters, regardless of our skin color. It has been calculated that 70% of our metabolic energy is spent as radiation. If we are surrounded by large amounts of mass at our own temperature, we will absorb about as much as we lose. Several years ago, lab rats were kept at a constant temperature, with constant 12-hour light periods, and were found to experience a decline in thyroid function during the winter. I had noticed a similar effect in hamsters: atrophy of the thymus gland in the late autumn. Since long-wave infra-red and longer wavelength microwaves can penetrate walls to some extent, it could be that the absence of that kind of radiation during the winter is the stressor which causes these changes and the mitochondrial damage which occurs in the winter. It could be that some of the therapeutic effects of natural hot springs are caused by gently appropriate radiation from the large masses of hot earth in the vicinity. I think these longer waves might also have an anti-free radical effect, possibly by acting on solvated electrons.

**CONTEXT:** How does our body's radiation emission relate to metabolic energy, and could environmental factors like winter radiation levels impact thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** The removal of trees from the Mexican hill where the Monarch butterflies migrate for the winter is lowering the humidity to such an extent that the butterflies might not be able to survive, even though their own trees are not removed. This effect of trees on humidity is very important, but it is usually overlooked. The concept of "desertification" is widely accepted when it is applied to another continent (the Sudan, for example), but not when it might relate to a local resource which supports the area's biggest industry. When a region doesn't go directly from a conifer forest to a desert, it may be replaced by deciduous shrubs and trees. The ultimate outcome of this replacement is unknown, but I think we are already seeing some of the effects. Conifers are good at conserving water; they transpire sparingly in the hot, normally dry summers of the Pacific coast region, but they do transpire a little in the winter. Humid air is lighter than dry air; a massive forest allows ocean air to circulate over the land in winter, yet a conifer forest does not extravagantly increase the humidity in the summer. A deciduous forest, leafless in winter, allows dense cold dry air to accumulate, which diverts the humid ocean air. In the summer, however, their intense transpiration tends to intensify the entry of air from the ocean, with the result that rainfall tends to become seasonally reversed, and some of the winter moisture is dumped further south. People who defend the lumber industry's practices say that the forces controlling weather are too big to be influenced by human activity, but several studies show otherwise. For example, the absence of vegetation in the city of St. Louis causes such intense summer heating and updrafts that corn production has doubled in an area down-wind from the resulting increase in the summer rainfall.

**CONTEXT:** What are the ecological impacts of deforestation, particularly concerning humidity, air circulation, and rainfall patterns, and how might these differ between conifer and deciduous forests?

**RAY PEAT:** A study in Israel, where there has been no publicity about a connection between caffeine and breast disease, found that using caffeine or avoiding it had no effect on breast disease. A letter in JAMA says, "most reports show no significant correlation between fibro-cystic disease and methylxanthine intake." He says, "there was considerable evidence to suggest that caffeine has antineoplastic effects." He also says that "caffeine intake had a significant association with tumor differentiation.... Since poor tumor differentiation is linked with decreased survival, the question is raised whether caffeine may have had a beneficial effect in these women." All of the experiments in cell culture similarly suggest that caffeine might be beneficial.

**CONTEXT:** What does research suggest about the relationship between caffeine intake and breast disease, and does it have any potential anti-cancer effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Several years ago, a "mutation" was discovered in a regional primate center which was said to be equivalent to human cystic fibrosis. A researcher there couldn't believe that an identical mutation could have appeared at the same time in five or six apes; he believed that their symptoms resulted from poisoning from the large amounts of unsaturated vegetable oil they were being fed. He was fired immediately; the new "gene" would have brought in large amounts of research money. A recent study of young adults with cystic fibrosis found that they had low serum levels of both selenium and vitamin E. This seems to support the ex-scientist's theory.

**CONTEXT:** What is the potential link between unsaturated vegetable oils and cystic fibrosis, and what micronutrient deficiencies have been observed in individuals with the condition?

**RAY PEAT:** As sulfite is removed from foods, pressure will increase for wider use of radiation to extend shelf life of many foods. Proponents are saying that some public education will be necessary, because radiation causes instantaneous changes which modify flavor and texture of foods, making people think they are not fresh; people must be informed, they say, to realize that the spoiled taste and consistency actually means greater freshness, since their shelf life has been extended by many weeks. Radiation, of course, stimulates oxidation of fats, among other changes (called "unique radiolytic products," URP), and rancid fat is toxic and carcinogenic.

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of using food irradiation for shelf-life extension, and what are the potential health risks associated with this process, particularly concerning fat oxidation?
