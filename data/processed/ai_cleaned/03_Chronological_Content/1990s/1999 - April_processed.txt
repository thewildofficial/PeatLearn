**RAY PEAT:** Cancer is the result of ordinary physiological Carbon Monoxide Stress and processes which become autonomous because of regulatory weaknesses in the organism. Respiration is essential for the maintenance of the higher forms of life, and it is a respiratory defect, on both the cellular and the organismic levels, which allows cancer to persist and develop.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental cause of cancer according to your understanding?

**RAY PEAT:** The heme group, because it serves many respiratory functions--hemoglobin, mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, steroid synthesizing enzymes, formation of thyroid hormone, detoxifying enzymes--is regulated in relatively primitive ways within each cell, and in more complex ways at higher organismic levels. When the cell needs more respiratory energy, some fuel is diverted into the production of porphyrin which is then turned into heme, which would normally provide for the efficient production of energy and protective factors. When the efficient energy-producing system is blocked, by injury, oxygen deficiency, toxins, or by the lack of one or more essential nutritional factors, heme production is activated. Excess heme is destroyed by the enzyme heme oxygenase, which converts heme into biliverdin and carbon monoxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does the body's regulation of heme relate to the development of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Both of these factors [carbon monoxide and biliverdin] have effects on the cell which are characteristic of cancer. Estrogen, radiation, chemical carcinogens and other forms of stress, activate the heme oxygenase enzyme. Estrogen causes both porphyria and jaundice and is associated with increased formation of carbon monoxide. It inhibits many types of liver function, including detoxification. The inhibition of carbon monoxide by cancer cells can account for cancer's self-sustaining, "hereditary," property, without invoking genetic mutations which are now known to be consequences, rather than causes of cancer. The production of carbon monoxide and biliverdin can account for many of the structural and biochemical abnormalities of cancer cells, and for their induction of abnormalities in adjacent cells.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of estrogen and the heme oxygenase pathway in cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** "Genetic" theories of cancer have now reached a dead end, and the epigenetic, developmental theory of cancer remains as the only plausible explanation.

**CONTEXT:** What is your view on the prevailing genetic theories of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** In studying the pigments of cellular respiration (enzyme cofactors, including vitamin B2 and the cytochromes), Otto Warburg (1926) found that heme is essential for cellular respiration, and that carbon monoxide, the respiratory poison, bound to heme, could block respiration. He also found that light could reverse the effects from the carbon monoxide, thus restoring respiration. Despite the fact that his work is described in all biochemistry textbooks, until very recently the toxicity of carbon monoxide was ascribed by medical texts only to its effects on hemoglobin, preventing the delivery of oxygen to cells, rather than to its effects on the respiratory pigments in the mitochondria, as demonstrated by Warburg. Of the thousands of publications on the toxicity of carbon monoxide in recent decades, its effects on mitochondrial metabolism have hardly been investigated, because of the perspective that it was a poison coming from outside the body, and that its effect on hemoglobin was sufficient to cause death, so the question of its effect on the mitochondrion was medically irrelevant.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on Otto Warburg's findings regarding carbon monoxide and cellular respiration?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the reason Warburg didn't explore the role of carbon monoxide in cancer was simply that, during his lifetime, it wasn't recognized as something which is produced in the body. Warburg had no reason to suspect that carbon monoxide would be produced by the cell exactly when the cell's respiratory apparatus was challenged. But since about 1971, carbon monoxide has been recognized as a normal product of the degradation of heme, approximately at the same time that it has become clear that respiratory distress on the cellular level stimulates both the synthesis and the degradation of heme.

**CONTEXT:** Why did Warburg not connect carbon monoxide to cancer during his lifetime?

**RAY PEAT:** Unfortunately, after Warburg's death, there were no prestigious advocates of his theory, and his death coincided with America’s "war on cancer," which consisted of giving huge public funding to the "cancer genetics" establishment, people who were congenitally hostile to the concept that cancer had knowable or controllable causes. Industry and medicine found it convenient to argue that people were responsible for their own diseases, in the sense that they inherited them, as a kind of mechanistic karma. Mutations in the inherited genes were, by definition, "random," which gave them the virtue of being impossible to pin down to a specific, legally actionable, cause. The genetic, and thus "essential," nature of cancer justified the concept of treating it by killing cells. (The procedure William Blake described 200 years ago as "curing the pox by cutting out the spots.") The doctrine of genetic causality indicated that only capital punishment could deal with the traitor-genes. Although these essentialists at first had rejected the idea that viruses could integrate themselves within our genes, after several years they realized that this idea meant that the infectious disease establishment could join forces with the genetics establishment. The new, highly funded (oncogene establishment had absolute control over cancer research, and that direct control spread indirectly, like a malignancy, throughout academic and commercial biology.

**CONTEXT:** What was the impact of the "war on cancer" and the focus on genetics?

**RAY PEAT:** Most people in the contemporary medical industry are so fond of the idea of DNA-mutation, followed by "clonal selection," to explain cancer, that they are able to ignore the many types of evidence that show cancer to be a process of deterioration in a mass of cells, rather than a progression of a single cell through stages of DNA mutation.

**CONTEXT:** What is the prevailing view of cancer in the medical industry, and why is it flawed?

**RAY PEAT:** This obsessive belief that "DNA causes everything" goes back to Weismannism, and the Neo-Darwinism that he founded by presenting his--purely arbitrary--arguments to eliminate the inheritance of acquired traits from the theory of evolution, and--opposing Darwin--to claim that Natural Selection was the only force in evolution. Weismannism, in its absolute rejection of the environmental adaptationism of Darwin and Lamarck, was almost a reversion to Preformationism. In its insistence on the "isolation of the germline," or the immortality of the germline which was passed on in the germ cells of the gonads, Weismannism subscribed to the Preformationist belief that all future generations are contained in the germ cell, and its adherents tried to justify this by asserting that the soma, all the rest of the individual outside of the germ cells, was nothing more than a mortal shadow of the essential (genetic) immortal being, since the body was produced precisely by the deletion of the information contained in the germ cell. (This doctrine was behind the denial that animals could be cloned from the nucleus of body cells. Even after frogs, sheep, and cows were produced in this way, there were some people who couldn't accept the results as facts. The doctrine that "telomeric shortening" causes aging came straight out of Weismannism.) Of course those ideas were false, nothing but an absurd application of Rationalist philosophy to biology to eliminate Darwin's "materialism," but the doctrine's importance is undeniable, since its direct influence can be seen in every university biology course and textbook of the 20th century. It is this essentialist commitment of the cancer establishment that has made Warburg's work practically disappear from the academic gullet. His demonstration that the cancer metabolism could be reversed by vitamins was a threat to the entire foundation of twentieth century essentialist medicine.

**CONTEXT:** How does Weismannism and its influence on evolutionary theory relate to the current understanding of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Because of my interest in the effects of light on the hormones and respiratory energy production, and my long-standing interest in Warburg's view of oxygen’s role in evolution and cancer, and my awareness that porphyrins were at one time thought to be cancer hormones, it seemed obvious to think of carbon monoxide as a cancer hormone.

**CONTEXT:** What led you to consider carbon monoxide as a "cancer hormone"?

**RAY PEAT:** I happened to become acquainted with Leonell Strong, who developed the strains of cancer-prone mice that have been used in breast cancer research. Although he was a geneticist and bred the mice that demonstrated the inheritance of cancer, he also showed that simple therapeutic measures would not only prevent cancer in a susceptible individual, but would also prevent cancer in many generations of the treated animal's descendants. Besides Strong, who showed individual and hereditary avoidance of cancer, many other workers have demonstrated that "established" cancer cell lines can be induced to revert to normal tissue. Inheritance isn't indelibly fixed.

**CONTEXT:** What did Leonell Strong's work reveal about cancer and inheritance?

**RAY PEAT:** While the genetic, metabolic, and adaptive processes seem to be on very different "levels," if we are to think about them in realistic and productive ways, it's necessary to follow the ways in which they are integrated, and to see gene regulation and metabolic responses to the environment as a continuous physical-chemical process. The myth of the isolated immortal germline, and its derivative, the "Central Dogma" of molecular genetics, that sees information flowing only from the genes into the proteins, have kept most researchers from looking elsewhere for regulatory principles.

**CONTEXT:** How should we approach the integration of genetic, metabolic, and adaptive processes?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of inheritance as a rigidly fixed system has made it easy to think of biology in terms of the "lock and key" analogy, in which an enzyme and its substrate, an antibody and its antigen, an organism and its niche, a gene and its inducer, etc., have a specific, fixed, mechanical relationship. However, even the simplest organisms have qualities that can seem more like a locksmith who with a little time can figure out how to open locks without a key. All biological systems are simultaneously regulated on more than one level, in a coherent and unified way.

**CONTEXT:** How does the "lock and key" analogy fail to capture the complexity of biological systems?

**RAY PEAT:** The cell’s framework, the "cytoskeleton," was demonstrated early in the 20th century, but the dogmatic view of the cell as "liquid enclosed by a membrane" caused it to be ignored by most biologists until the 1970s. The cytoskeleton is strongly influenced by respiratory distress and the hormones that are so closely associated with oxidative processes, estrogen and the porphyrin derivatives in particular. The microtubules make up the apparatus that spares the cell from the effects of carbon monoxide. Under the influence of estrogen, microtubules, for example, change their physical state and appear to dissolve. Experiments show that increasing amounts of estrogen cause progressively more severe disruptions of the mitotic apparatus, producing lopsided cell divisions. (When these abnormal "mitotic figures" are found in breast tissue, it means that cells are being killed by an excess of estrogen, but these dying cells are usually taken as "evidence of cancer.") Biliverdin, produced along with carbon monoxide in the breakdown of heme, causes changes in other parts of the cytoskeleton, including the proteins in the nucleus which help to regulate the movements of nucleic acids. Carbon monoxide, and other substances such as nitric oxide which also function as respiratory poisons, suppress energy production by the mitochondria, and this activates enzymes which cut DNA molecules, producing either DNA rearrangement, or apoptotic cell death. All of these well established observations show the steps by which physiological reactions can lead to chromosomal and genetic abnormalities.

**CONTEXT:** How does the cytoskeleton and its regulation by estrogen and heme metabolites contribute to cancer development?

**RAY PEAT:** The steps toward cancer include chronic irritation, recognized for centuries as a cause of cancer; an inflammatory reaction activates enzymes that release estrogen. (Histamine, free fatty acids, prostaglandins, calcium and other products of inflammation are further promoted by estrogen, and synergize with it.) Estrogen activates other inflammatory "acute phase" and stress-shock proteins, including heme oxygenase, which produces carbon monoxide and biliverdin. These are powerful protective and antioxidant factors making cells resistant to apoptosis and regulation. Biliverdin (F. Paradisi, 1975) activates beta-glucuronidase, one of the main enzymes involved in the local release of estrogen. In later stages, anemia and hemolysis are associated with CO and biliverdin production from the release of heme. (Anemia is seen in most patients with advanced cancer.) Biliverdin, combined with estrogen and hypoxia, alters the cytoskeleton, producing chromosome imbalances, causing mutations and activating the "oncogenes."

**CONTEXT:** What are the sequential steps leading to cancer, involving inflammation, estrogen, and heme metabolites?

**RAY PEAT:** The respiratory defect of cancer interferes with the production of carbon dioxide. CO2 suppresses lactic acid formation, and is essential for all normal cell processes; it appears to be an important factor in producing cellular differentiation (Dictyostelium). Estrogen promotes lactic acid formation, and promotes porphyrin synthesis, providing the material for forming heme and carbon monoxide. Besides causing porphyria, estrogen causes many other liver diseases, including cholestasis, the failure to release bile; the inhibition of carbon monoxide formation has been found to promote bile flow. Estrogen promotes the formation of the enzyme heme oxygenase, which forms carbon monoxide from heme. Carbon monoxide increases the formation of cortisol, by stimulating ACTH release from the pituitary. The stress response is self-sustaining on several levels. For example, stress increases the absorption of bacterial endotoxin from the intestine, which increases the estrogen level and synergizes with biliverdin and cortisol. While estrogen does cause direct DNA damage, its clearest effect in carcinogenesis is on the cytoskeleton which regulates cell division, and defective cell division, rather than "gene mutation," is one of the important steps in the progression of cancer (Rubin, Duesberg). Cancer cells are protected against the body's ability to destroy them, by the antioxidant functions of carbon dioxide and biliverdin.

**CONTEXT:** How do carbon dioxide, estrogen, and the stress response interact in the context of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** The multilevel physiological nature of cancer calls for a multilevel physiological approach to its prevention and cure. This would include antiestrogen regimes, antiinflammatory and antihistamine factors (histamine interacts closely with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide), adequate nutrition, carbon dioxide, and specific anti-carbon monoxide therapies (such as light, alcohol, and possibly the minerals which convert porphyrin into compounds that inhibit the production of carbon monoxide), and methods to decrease nitric oxide formation and to restrain cortisol production, since these promote the formation of carbon monoxide. One of the most interesting approaches to inhibiting carbon monoxide production is to use vitamin B12, as hydroxocobalamin, as an antidote to nitric oxide, preventing the nitric oxide from stimulating the formation of heme oxygenase. Wherever carbon monoxide mediates a biological malfunction, as in acquired immunodeficiency, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, vitamin B12 seems to have a place as a detoxicant. Progesterone and thyroid have several desirable properties that make them generally useful in cancer prevention and therapy. The shorter-chain saturated fatty acids contained in coconut oil have several beneficial effects. Aspirin and vitamin E have a variety of actions that tend to improve respiration. Things that protect the bowel, such as raw carrots, have far-reaching effects on hormones and immunity. Eggs contain many protective and therapeutic factors, in spite of their excess of toxic unsaturated fats resulting from an unnatural diet; egg lecithin, for example, isn't immunosuppressive, as soybean lecithin is. The last experiments of Leonell Strong, in which he found that certain combinations of nucleosides could cause the disappearance of cancer from the progeny of the treated animals, should be taken seriously. They relate to the heritable effects of hormone balance ("hormonal imprinting"), and so have implications far beyond the prevention of cancer.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key elements of a multilevel physiological approach to cancer prevention and cure?
