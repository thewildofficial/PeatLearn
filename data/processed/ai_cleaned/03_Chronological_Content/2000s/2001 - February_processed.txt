**RAY PEAT:** The senile brain accumulates a variety of mineral deposits, and the argument has been made that dietary aluminum is the cause of Alzheimer's disease. It would be good to eliminate added aluminum from our public water systems and from our foods, but there is good evidence that other processes are behind the accumulation of aluminum and other minerals in our tissues.

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying cause of mineral accumulation in tissues, particularly in the brain?

**RAY PEAT:** When I began studying the physiology of estrogen, I found that the biochemical changes it caused were the same as those of aging, oxygen-deprivation, and radiation injury. In my experiments, I found that both aging and estrogen stimulation caused a great increase in the availability of reactive electrons, which I measured by their reaction with a dye. These electrons come from an interactive system that involves the proteins (cysteine) and glutathione, and the various cofactor-catalysts such as ascorbic acid and NADH (NAD is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; the name reveals its connections to the vitamin, niacin/nicotinamide, and to the "energy molecule," ATP, adenosine triphosphate, but biochemists are seldom concerned with those links; the H indicates the reduced, electronically energized form of the molecule).

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen relate to aging and cellular energy processes?

**RAY PEAT:** The cell's reductive system, centering on NADH and NADPH (the extra P, phosphate, in this molecule allows it to be regulated separately from NAD), is closely involved in fat synthesis. If estrogen serves as a redox (reduction and oxidation) link between NADH and NADP, fat synthesis will be an additional drain on the available NADH. In the 1950s, several endocrinologists gathered evidence to show that estrogen can function as a catalyst in the oxidation and reduction of the pyridine nucleotides, NADPH and NADH. But in the 1960s, the doctrine that estrogen's effects were mediated exclusively by the "estrogen receptor" began replacing all other ideas about estrogen chemistry and physiology. J. G. Liehr, and a few others, are still demonstrating that estrogen can function as a catalyst in "redox cycling" (alternate reduction and oxidation), which generates toxic free radicals, and can potentially serve as a drain on the NADH systems. In functioning as a redox catalyst, estrogen oscillates between an oxidized and a reduced molecular form. In this context, the ratio of the different forms of estrogen takes on an entirely different meaning than simply their different effects on the so-called estrogen receptors. Since the doctrine of the estrogen receptor became a medical preoccupation, most attention has been given to estradiol, since it is the "strongest" estrogen in some tests, though estrone, the oxidized form, is usually present in the blood in much larger quantities. The quantity of the oxidized form of estrogen is increased in certain degenerative conditions, such as uterine cancer, which is a strong argument against the idea that, as a "weaker estrogen," it would moderate the effect of estradiol. In my dissertation, I gave a few other arguments regarding the wasteful consumption of NADH. There is now good evidence for the existence of estrogen-stimulated extramitochondrial NADH oxidases, in addition to the NADH oxidase function of age pigment, that I have discussed in an earlier newsletter.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's role in redox cycling impact cellular energy and its relationship to different estrogen forms?

**RAY PEAT:** Until the late 1970s, the fact that estrogen causes increased absorption of calcium was offered as proof that it prevents osteoporosis, but then it turned out that the increased retention of calcium was occurring only in the soft tissues, where calcification is a normal trend with aging. In fact, bone loss begins in a woman's twenties, and continues fairly steadily during the period in which the actual level of estrogen is rising. Arteries and tendons tend to calcify with aging, the brain and pineal gland, kidneys and other organs retain more calcium and gradually lose functions, and cells die with a calcium overload. Estrogen's stimulation of iron absorption was ignored by people who wanted to sell iron pills (often 18 mg per day) to women who lost iron (maybe 5 mg per month) by menstruation. After menopause, women absorb iron so fast that their body's iron load generally catches up with men's within a few years, at which time their incidence of heart attacks becomes similar to men's. If estrogen is a major factor in the promotion of iron absorption, women's accelerated iron retention after menopause argues for the existence of a more estrogenic state than when they were younger. Since progesterone falls sharply at menopause, the effect of the unopposed estrogen is going to be very strong, even as the absolute quantities of estrogen are declining. When progesterone falls, the effects of cortisol, as well as estrogen, are increased, because progesterone antagonizes both of those hormones. Under the influence of cortisol, fat cells produce estrogen, and this effect is normally inhibited by progesterone and thyroid. Calcification of soft tissues and iron retention accelerate at menopause. The body accumulates calcium, but it isn't going into the bones. The body accumulates iron, and it too goes into the soft tissues. Increased iron storage in the liver is associated with insulin resistance, and increased iron in any tissue is associated with increased lipid peroxidation in stress. Calcium and iron tend to be deposited together, and the mitochondria are usually the starting points for their deposition. Iron overload has been implicated in heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and many other degenerative diseases, including the brain diseases.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen influence calcium and iron metabolism, and what are the implications for aging and disease?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen, and the free fatty acids that are liberated under its influence, increase the permeability of blood vessels, allowing water, proteins, etc., to leak out into the tissues. Tumor necrosis factor, induced by estrogen, reduces the "blood brain barrier" function, promoting brain inflammation. The "blood brain barrier" means that water soluble molecules are excluded, while oil soluble molecules enter freely. Highly charged particles such as metal ions are normally efficiently excluded from the brain, in proportion to their water-solubility.

**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of estrogen and associated factors on vascular permeability and brain inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen's toxicity to the developing brain was established in the 1950s and 1960s. Maybe it's a kind of progress, that the claimed benefits of estrogen have aged with the drug industry: in nothing left to do but to prevent senile dementia. The virologist, Gajdusek, wanted to argue that his virus, and not the accumulation of aluminum, was responsible for kuru and other brain degenerative diseases, and so he did a survey of brains of demented people from regions with different types of soil, and showed that the mineral deposits in the environment showed up in the brains. He argued that this showed that the minerals were just the consequence of the disease, rather than the cause of the brain degeneration. He observed that the deposits consisted mainly of calcium in regions that didn't have large amounts of other metals, so he argued that a particular metal such as aluminum couldn't be responsible for brain degeneration. But he didn't consider that factors other than viruses might be responsible for the brain mineralization that he saw.

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical perspective on estrogen's neurotoxicity and the debate surrounding mineral accumulation in the brain?

**RAY PEAT:** Although women are generally more prone to Alzheimer's disease than men do, the lack of estrogen is currently blamed for both of the problems. Why would Alzheimer's disease be so different from the other predominantly female diseases that have been linked to excess estrogen? Why would women's brains be different from men's? Why would their nerve cells degenerate without estrogen, while men's don't? Obviously women's brains and nerves aren't very different from men's and there simply isn't any sensible reason to believe that â€œestrogen deficiency" is responsible for Alzheimer's disease, or for osteoporosis, or for heart disease, or any of the other problems that have been blamed on the "menopausal estrogen deficiency." The mass media find and publicize the things they want to believe, or want the public to believe. "Coffee causes heart disease," "estrogen prevents Alzheimer's disease," they say. How do they make the argument? Using plausible sounding terms that hide the real situation is the general technique. I don't want to give science reporters disproportionate blame, because specious argumentation is habitually practiced by many of the professors and researchers who provide the raw material for the news reports. In literature, "poetic diction" is intended to put the reader into a certain frame of mind, to be receptive to the poet's purpose. Many scientists rely on something like "poetic diction."

**CONTEXT:** What is the critique of the prevailing narrative linking estrogen deficiency to age-related diseases in women?

**RAY PEAT:** For example, a San Francisco study by Kristine Yaffe and co-authors found that "free estrogen," "the active form of the hormone," was higher in more of the people who had better cognitive function. Yaffe, et al., also found that dementia is associated with both depression and osteoporosis. There isn't really such a thing as "free estrogen," which is defined in terms of a particular laboratory situation that doesn't correspond to anything in the body. The laboratory measurement of "free estrogen" is describing both a physiological and a physical fantasy. "Protein bound estrogen" is an active form of estrogen, and the estrogen bound to albumin probably accounts for most of estrogen's activity. Free fatty acids, which compete with estrogen for binding to the steroid-binding globulin, probably modify the properties of the more abundant albumin so that it binds more estrogen in its active form, causing estrogen to move from other proteins, lipoproteins, and red blood cells onto the activated albumin. The presence of fats bound to the albumin makes the albumin more lipophilic, fat-loving, and molecules are taken up into cells--especially brain cells--according to their solubility in fats. For fatty molecules, there is no "blood brain barrier." The fact that albumin has variable lipophilicity makes it an effective mechanism for the transport and delivery of oil soluble molecules. Yaffe, et al., in associating depression and osteoporosis with dementia, are arguing that estrogen deficiency is the cause of all three conditions. They offer some hypothetical mechanisms for how estrogen might prevent Alzheimer's disease. Observing that brain cells die in people with Alzheimer's disease, they mention that estrogen stimulates "dendritic sprouting" in brain cells, as if that could compensate for the loss of cells (it doesn't). They observe that estrogen delivers more tryptophan to the brain, increasing the production of serotonin, and that it inhibits the monoamine oxidases and other enzymes that inactivate transmitter substances, increasing the activity of adrenaline, serotonin, and other transmitter substances. They suggest that increased circulation caused by estrogen might protect the brain. Here, Yaffe, et al., have invoked the serotonin myth and other myths, including the nitric oxide myth, to substantiate the estrogen myth. Serotonin doesn't "cure depression," and both serotonin and nitric oxide impair circulation and are toxic to brain cells. Both of them poison mitochondrial respiration. Estrogen increases the viscosity of blood, and impairs circulation and oxygenation in many other ways.

**CONTEXT:** What is the scientific critique of the concept of "free estrogen" and the proposed mechanisms by which estrogen might benefit cognitive function?

**RAY PEAT:** The actual level of estrogen rises all through the reproductive years, and at menopause, the reduction in antiestrogenic factors, such as progesterone, thyroid, and DHEA, leads to increased effects of estrogen. The increased burden of unsaturated fatty acids that accumulate with aging clearly promotes the effects of estrogen and interferes with the production of the antiestrogenic hormones. These unsaturated fats cause progressive slowing of the metabolic rate, with particularly sharp decreases around puberty and menopause. As they interfere with the production of energy, they tend to increase cellular energy requirements, by promoting excitatory cellular processes. Estrogen and PUFA create insulin resistance, and the resulting state of "diabetes" and stress de-energizes tissues, with the mitochondria that are damaged by unsaturated fatty acids, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), serotonin, etc., failing to meet the tissuesâ€™ energy needs. Stress, endotoxinemia, and increased estrogen tend to activate TNF, which has a role in brain degenerative diseases and osteoporosis and multiple organ failure. Much research has focussed on a search for a single substance that is responsible for the inflammatory conditions of Alzheimer's disease, but inflammation and aging are processes that involve many causes and mediators, with each individualâ€™s history causing variations in the details.

**CONTEXT:** How do unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and estrogen interact to promote metabolic dysfunction and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** "Diabetes," or the inability to oxidize glucose vigorously, is simply a description of the metabolic aspect of cellular degeneration. The neurological impairment that is so commonly associated with officially diagnosed diabetes is simply one aspect of a general cellular malfunction that follows from chronic energy deprivation. Exactly the same processes occur in the sudden organ failure produced by shock, or the gradual organ failures--lungs, liver, kidney, heart, thymus, brain--that occur in aging. In general, there is a failure of circulation that exacerbates the metabolic and functional failures. Diabetes, of both the insulin dependent and the non-insulin dependent types, is commonly associated with increased cortisol. In diabetes, inflammatory conditions, and under the influence of increased cortisol, brain cells are deprived of glucose. Increased cortisol is a normal response to the cell-damaging effects of stress or inflammation, but cortisol itself causes the death of nerve cells and immune cells through excitotoxicity, by blocking glucose metabolism. Estrogen increases cortisol production in a variety of ways, acting both through the pituitary and directly on the adrenal glands. Estrogen promotes excitotoxic processes, by opposing progesterone and thyroid, by directly exciting nerve cells, and by increasing the activity of excitatory nerve transmitters. It also increases serotonin, which blocks energy production by its effect on mitochondria, as well as by impairing circulation.

**CONTEXT:** How does diabetes relate to cellular degeneration, and what is the role of cortisol and estrogen in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** At puberty, there is a sudden increase in the incidence of depression, especially in girls. Increased adrenaline, like increased cortisol, is a feature of depression, stress, and inflammation; mobilizing fats, it can become part of a vicious circle, in which free fatty acids cause insulin resistance, activating the stress reactions. Increased serotonin is a feature of inflammation, shock, stress, and depression, and, like histamine, is tied very closely to estrogen's effects. Estrogen does have some of the effects mentioned by Yaffe, et al., but these effects should make a person wonder whether estrogen isn't an important factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease, rather than being its main preventive agent. In Alzheimer's disease, there is a distinct decrease in blood pressure, and orthostatic hypotension is a common feature of dementia. Estrogen's relaxing effect on the blood vessels has been shown to allow blood pooling in the veins, producing orthostatic hypotension. Estrogen, acting directly and through mediators such as serotonin, decreases the heart's pumping efficiency. Blood viscosity is increased in Alzheimer's disease, and estrogen is known to increase blood viscosity. Nitric oxide, a third cultic substance along with serotonin and estrogen, is invoked as a normalizer of brain circulation and protector of nerve cells from peroxidation. Whether a substance is an antioxidant or pro-oxidant depends on its environment, and both nitric oxide and estrogen are pro-oxidants, promoters of lipid peroxidation and other forms of cell damage, under a variety of physiological situations.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between puberty, depression, stress, and the role of estrogen, serotonin, and nitric oxide in neurodegenerative processes?

**RAY PEAT:** If authors are criticizing a well known doctrine, it is reasonable for them to assume that their readers know the arguments in favor of that doctrine, and to concentrate on their critical points. But Yaffe, et al., are arguing in favor of a well known doctrine. They fail to present the actual research situation. For them to ignore the work of people like Brawer, Desjardins, Schipper, and Liehr, who have explored the cytotoxic and neurotoxic effects of estrogen, amounts to simple propaganda. When such material is published in the mass media, such as JAMA, its effect can be considered as equivalent to fraud, since these media don't publicize alternative views. While there has been some publicity about a recent study that found that treating Alzheimer's patients with estrogen for 12 weeks didn't improve their mood or mental ability, there has been relative silence about all the studies that show actual deterioration of mentality or mood in association with increased estrogen. In old men, higher estrogen was found to be associated with lower mental ability (Barret-Connor, et al., 1999). Although estradiol is the most potent estrogen, estrone is the main estrogen in the circulation in terms of its quantity, and women's mental performance was found to be lower when the estrone was higher (Yaffe, et al., 1998).

**CONTEXT:** What is the critique of studies promoting estrogen's benefits for cognitive function, and what is the evidence regarding estrogen's negative impact on mental ability?

**RAY PEAT:** Antiendorphin, antiexcitotoxic, anticholinergic, antiserotonergic, antiprostaglandin, and antiglucocorticoid drugs have been used with good effect in various degenerative nervous diseases, but all the so-called "anti" drugs are imprecise antagonists, and have many side effects. The natural antagonists and nutrients are usually helpful. Protein, sodium, magnesium, carbon dioxide/bicarbonate, progesterone, thyroid, vitamins, etc., can be curative in many brain diseases, but are seldom tried because of cultic medical ideas about nutrition, hormone tests, and the nature of cells and disease. To the extent that unsaturated fats, heavy metals, and estrogenic substances (such as soybean products; tofu, for example, was recently implicated in dementia) can be avoided, the interactive processes of cell damage can be retarded. Natural restorative processes can maintain tissue integrity if the destructive processes are slowed.

**CONTEXT:** What are the effective natural antagonists and nutrients for brain health, and what factors should be avoided to prevent cell damage?
