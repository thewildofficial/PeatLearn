**RAY PEAT:** The problem is, partly, that medicine is not a biological science. It is a profession, meaning that whatever it professes to know has the legal status of truth.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental issue with the medical establishment's approach to public health issues like prenatal drug exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** Problem-centered ecological health education would be a step toward solution of the problems of public health.

**CONTEXT:** What kind of educational approach is needed to address public health problems?

**RAY PEAT:** I'm afraid it is purely because these are all self-administered substances, and the blame can be placed on the user, rather than on any powerful institutions.

**CONTEXT:** Why are substances like cocaine the focus of concern regarding prenatal exposure, rather than other factors?

**RAY PEAT:** The legal responses to the "crack baby scare" clearly did much more harm than good to both the mothers and the children. Making substance abuse during pregnancy a crime kept mothers from prenatal medical care, thereby endangering the fetus far more than would be the case with drug use, and discouraged them from seeking drug treatment.

**CONTEXT:** What were the negative consequences of criminalizing substance abuse during pregnancy?

**RAY PEAT:** ...the fact remains that recent studies on cocaine use by pregnant women clearly demonstrate that the pharmacological impact of cocaine has been greatly exaggerated, that many other factors impact on fetal and newborn development, and that legal responses to maternal cocaine use have made every aspect of the problem worse.

**CONTEXT:** What do recent studies reveal about the impact of cocaine on fetal development and the effectiveness of legal responses?

**RAY PEAT:** Through the 1950s and 1960s the U.S Atomic Energy Commission and the medical profession collaborated in keeping the public from knowing the dangers of prenatal exposures to harmful influences, including drugs, diet, and radiation. Childhood cancer and brain defects were produced in millions of children as a result. Fetotoxic drugs are still in “use by physicians.

**CONTEXT:** What was the role of institutions in obscuring the dangers of prenatal exposures?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea that fetal damage could result from the mother's malnutrition was rejected as an impossibility. The food industry didn't want to have to test their GRAS (generally recognized as safe) additives for fetal safety, and it didn't want women to get the idea that they should avoid junk foods, such as pasta and bread, during pregnancy. People at the Harvard School of Public Health said that it was nonsense to think that foods could be nutrient-deficient--"if the soil doesn't have the chemicals plants need, the plants won't grow; therefore, all crops are fully nutritious." The chemical composition of plants was supposedly determined strictly by their genes, so the soil couldn't determine their nutrient content. The fetus, like a plant, was supposed to be genetically determined, but unlike a plant, it was said to live like a parasite on the mother, taking everything it needs from the mother's tissues, rather than from the mother's dietetic intake. If the mother was alive, her nutritional condition couldn't have anything to do with the fetus.

**CONTEXT:** How was the concept of maternal malnutrition's impact on fetal development dismissed by the medical and food industries?

**RAY PEAT:** Probably in reaction against the biological evidence that maternal malnutrition produced defective offspring, the American medical establishment adopted the concept that "fetal malnutrition” existed, and was caused by a defective uterus or placenta, not by anything the mother might have eaten or failed to eat. In Italy and Germany in the 1970s, a slightly saner concept was emerging, in which it was proposed that a malnourished fetus could be fed by infusing amino acids into the amniotic fluid, or that the mother and fetus might benefit from intravenous glucose and amino acids. The use of progestins to stimulate placental development was also suggested in Europe. (Farad and Picas, 1976.)

**CONTEXT:** What alternative concept did the medical establishment adopt regarding fetal malnutrition, and what saner concepts were emerging in Europe?

**RAY PEAT:** Poor, illiterate, drug using women are now being charged with "giving cocaine to their fetus" when they use the drug. What this means is that there are elements in our judicial system which are saying that illiterates and derelicts must be held to a higher standard than doctors of medicine were when these women were children--and to a higher standard than that of the present state licensing boards which have nothing to say to physicians who prescribe reducing diets and diuretics and teratogenic drugs, and even x-rays, to pregnant women.

**CONTEXT:** What is the disparity in standards applied to poor women using drugs versus medical professionals?

**RAY PEAT:** If the cost to the public of caring for cocaine babies is the important issue, then we should consider the cost of preventing the damage in the most direct way, but that requires knowing what the real causes of the damage are.

**CONTEXT:** If the cost of caring for affected infants is the concern, what is the most direct way to address it?

**RAY PEAT:** The evidence that these babies’ defects are caused by cocaine is fairly odd. Being scientifically careful about evaluating the evidence in this situation is important, considering the history and the context.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's assessment of the evidence linking cocaine to infant defects?

**RAY PEAT:** In the late 1960s, most of the publications on the dangers of LSD and marihuana were fraudulent. While typical LSD users took about 100 micrograms of the drug, experiments using doses that were the human equivalent of tens of thousands of micrograms were used to argue for the drug's dangers. Those doses would have killed people, in a short time.

**CONTEXT:** What was the nature of publications regarding the dangers of LSD and marihuana in the late 1960s?

**RAY PEAT:** In humans, as little as 20 milligrams of cocaine injected intravenously is said to have been fatal, and the average lethal eral dose is 500 milligrams. Injected cocaine is much more powerful than oral doses. In animal studies, doses equivalent to thousands of milligrams per day in humans are injected into rats before harmful effects are seen in the fetuses. Drugs injected intravenously or injected into the peritoneal cavity are very rapidly and completely absorbed, and the only doses that caused measurable. fetal harm in rats were doses that, on a weight basis, almost certainly would have caused nearly instantaneous death in humans.

**CONTEXT:** How do the doses of cocaine used in animal studies compare to potentially lethal doses in humans, and how does this relate to fetal harm?

**RAY PEAT:** Cocaine suppresses appetite. When pregnant animals are fed the same limited amount of food consumed by cocaine-treated animals, their undernourished offspring show most of the same effects seen in the litters that were exposed to cocaine.

**CONTEXT:** What experimental finding suggests that malnutrition, rather than cocaine itself, might be responsible for observed fetal effects?

**RAY PEAT:** The human placenta passes a smaller percentage of cocaine to the fetus than the rat placenta does, and the liver of the human fetus is more effective at detoxifying cocaine, so any effects of cocaine on rat fetuses are probably going to be larger than any effect on the human fetus.

**CONTEXT:** How do human placental transfer and fetal detoxification of cocaine differ from rats, and what does this imply for extrapolating animal study results?

**RAY PEAT:** Behavioral disturbances in the offspring are considered to be a very sensitive indicator of a chemical's teratogenicity, but some researchers have concluded that cocaine might not be a behavioral teratogen. (Riley and LaFiette, 1996) Others have described it as "not a_ potent neuroteratogen.” (Chen, et al., 1996)

**CONTEXT:** What is the scientific consensus on cocaine's potential as a behavioral teratogen?

**RAY PEAT:** The effects of cocaine that are supposedly seen in humans seem not to be produced by cocaine in lab animals. Intrauterine growth retardation, microencephaly, abruptio placentae, spontaneous abortion, sudden infant death syndrome, and mental retardation are commonly said to be the consequences of prenatal exposure to cocaine. Many things can contribute to those problems, but malnutrition is the most common cause, and is the one that American medicine goes to great lengths to avoid mentioning. Prenatal x-rays, diuretics, and pregnancy weight-contro] diets are other important causes.

**CONTEXT:** What common claims about cocaine's effects on fetuses are not replicated in lab animals, and what are the actual primary causes of these issues?

**RAY PEAT:** How is it that cocaine and starvation can produce the same symptoms? I think the evidence indicates that cocaine isn't the cause of the pregnancy problems that are blamed on it. But, since cocaine suppresses the appetite, it does have some role in the problems of gestation caused by malnutrition.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's conclusion regarding the role of cocaine in pregnancy problems, and how might it indirectly contribute?

**RAY PEAT:** Most crack smokers are poor, very few eat well, and nearly all of them smoke. Smoking causes damage to the fetus that is much easier to demonstrate than the theoretical damage caused by cocaine. The media are filled with the cocaine-baby issue. "Have you ever seen a cocaine baby?" But do we hear them asking "Have you ever seen a baby born to a smoker?" Or, "have you seen the babies of malnourished women?”

**CONTEXT:** What other factors, often overlooked, contribute significantly to fetal damage, and why is cocaine disproportionately highlighted?

**RAY PEAT:** To pretend that any effects produced in pregnant rats, by a dose of cocaine which is many times larger on a weight basis than the supposedly lethal human dose, are relevant to public health, is crude propaganda, and presumably has the purpose of supporting political, judicial or military actions that are completely unrelated to public health or morality.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's critique of using animal studies with exaggerated doses of cocaine to inform public health policy?

**RAY PEAT:** Putting the medico-legal propaganda in its best light, it is scientifically atrocious. But the actual moral issue is that it is not used for any constructive purpose. One nutritious high protein meal every day would probably solve the "cocaine baby problem,” but it appears that neither the government nor the medical establishment is interested in solving the problem.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's assessment of the scientific and moral implications of the "cocaine baby" narrative, and what simple solution is being ignored?

**RAY PEAT:** Novocaine (procaine) was introduced as a substitute for cocaine, but it has been found to have protective effects on the organism, as an adaptogen. Lidocaine and other local anesthetics have many important protective effects. In this context, some experiments that hint at a fetus-protecting effect of cocaine deserve further investigation.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential protective effects of other local anesthetics, and what is suggested regarding cocaine's potential in this regard?

**RAY PEAT:** Cocaine was displaced from medical use, first by the proprietary synthetic local anesthetics, and then, in the 1930s, by the proprietary amphetamines.

**CONTEXT:** What substances replaced cocaine in medical use?

**RAY PEAT:** As a stimulant, cocaine increases the metabolic rate, which in turn can lead to the wastage of protein, to provide energy. Conventional first aid for a cocaine overdose includes providing glucose and thiamine, to provide energy. The same nutritional support, but preferably with additional protein, is obviously appropriate for protection of the fetus. The presence of increased amounts of ammonia in the urine indicates malnutrition in both adults and newborns, and might be a useful indicator for nutritionally stressed pregnancies. Supplementing both dietary protein and carbohydrate might be the simplest treatment for many types of gestational stress, including preeclampsia and "recreational" cocaine use.

**CONTEXT:** How does cocaine affect metabolism, what is the conventional first aid for overdose, and what nutritional support is recommended for fetal protection and gestational stress?

**RAY PEAT:** The Andean people who use coca regularly appear to suffer no harmful effects. Coca chewing prevents the hypoglycemia that can be produced by extremely high altitude. It is common to keep a wad of the leaf in the mouth all day. The dental health of coca-chewers is so good that a Bolivian company has marketed a toothpaste containing coca leaf. (But it is probably the high altitude itself that is mainly responsible for their good teeth.) The coca leaf has been used medicinally in South America for improved fertility, prolongation of virility into old age, prevention of altitude sickness, and various other purposes. The association of coca chewing in these cultures with magic and gods with erect phalluses (Z/ Tio, Supay) probably affected the herb's treatment by the anti-erotic cultures.

**CONTEXT:** What are the observed effects and traditional medicinal uses of coca leaf in Andean cultures?

**RAY PEAT:** At very high altitude, fertility is limited by the availability of oxygen. Altitude itself tends to increase the'ratio of progesterone to estrogen, as a protective adaptation involving increased carbon dioxide in the tissues. Cocaine increases the production of the pituitary gonadotrophin, LH (luteinizing hormone), which increases ovarian progesterone production. In men, LH increases testosterone production. Chewing coca leaves has been found to sharply increase the amount of progesterone in saliva. Increased progesterone would increase the ability to maintain pregnancy under stressful conditions.

**CONTEXT:** How does altitude affect fertility, and what hormonal mechanisms are involved with cocaine use and coca leaf chewing that could relate to pregnancy maintenance?

**RAY PEAT:** Used moderately, for health purposes, there would seem to be no problem with cocaine, and there seems to be a physiological rationale even for its use during pregnancy under some conditions. The use of progesterone, thyroid, and nutrition would obviously be better ways to protect fetal development.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's perspective on moderate cocaine use for health purposes, and what are considered superior methods for fetal protection?

**RAY PEAT:** Smoking during pregnancy is a much bigger public health issue than cocaine use. Ranking with smoking, in terms of damage done to developing babies, are prescribed diuretics, inappropriate drugs for epilepsy during pregnancy, weight-control diets for pregnant women, x-rays of the developing fetus, and--probably the biggest problem of all--poverty and malnutrition.

**CONTEXT:** What are the most significant public health issues impacting fetal development, and how do they compare to cocaine use?

**RAY PEAT:** The decline in the urinary urea to ammonia ratio represents a simple measure of nutritional status in the adult. We examined the relationship of this ratio to nutrient-related fetal growth retardation. Levels of ammonia and urea nitrogen were measured in the first voided urine and cord blood from 15 term infants exhibiting a wide range of growth. Analysis by multiple regression with neonatal ponderal index as the primary dependent variable revealed a significant correlation between lowered ponderal index and decreased urinary urea and ammonia. The correlation was primarily a function of increasing ammonia levels, with no relationship between fetal leanness and urinary urea. Comparable cord artery and vein ammonia suggest that placental ammoniagenesis was not a major determinant of observed elevations in urinary ammonia. Confirmation of the striking correlation between increased urinary ammonia and lowered neonatal ponderal index may afford a simple test for the identification of nutrient-related growth retardation. (Wolfe HM, Sokol RJ, Dombrowski MP, Bottoms SF, Norman GS)

**RAY PEAT:** Cocaine exposure during the brain growth spurt failed to produce cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in rat pups. (Chen WJ, McAlhany RE Jr, Maier SE, West JR)

**CONTEXT:** What was the finding regarding cocaine exposure and cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in rat pups?

**RAY PEAT:** "Maternal hypoglycemia lowered the DNA content in normal but not diabetic embryos... ." (Kawaguchi M, Tanigawa K, Tanaka O, Kato Y)

**CONTEXT:** What effect did maternal hypoglycemia have on embryonic development in rats?

**RAY PEAT:** "Female Fischer rats injected with cocaine in a "binge" pattern (15 mg/kg, IP, three times a day, at 1-h intervals) for 1 day had significantly higher levels of progesterone than saline-treated controls (p < 0.001)." "Progesterone plasma levels were also increased after a single dose of cocaine (15 mg/kg)." "Thus, acute cocaine induced increases in progesterone plasma levels in intact female rats are probably due to an increase in secretion rates of progesterone rather than an acceleration of its biotransformation." (Quinones-Jenab V, Perrotti LI, Ho A, Jenab S, Schlussman SD, Franck J, Kreek MJ)

**CONTEXT:** What effect does cocaine have on progesterone plasma levels in female rats?

**RAY PEAT:** Brief communication: effect of coca-leaf chewing on salivary progesterone assays. (Vitzthum VJ, von Dornum M, Ellison PT)

**CONTEXT:** What is the observed effect of coca-leaf chewing on salivary progesterone levels?

**RAY PEAT:** "Cocaine (0.8 mg/kg) stimulated a significant increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) within 10 to 20 min (P < .01) and LH reached peak levels (59-60% above base line) within 30 min after cocaine administration in both males and females, Plasma cocaine levels averaged 289 +/- 23 and 346 +/- 73 ng/ml] at 10 min after iv. cocaine (0.8 mg/kg) administration in males and females, respectively. Follicle stimulating hormone levels were unchanged in midluteal females. Male testosterone increased by 50% above average base-line levels 50 min after the LH peak (80 min postcocaine). These data are consistent with our previous findings that cocaine increased LH and enhanced luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-stimulated LH in early follicular females." (Mello NK, Sarnyai Z, Mendelson JH, Drieze JM, Kelly M)

**CONTEXT:** What are the acute effects of cocaine on anterior pituitary hormones, specifically LH, FSH, and testosterone, in male and female rhesus monkeys?

**RAY PEAT:** "Despite extensive adverse publicity, tobacco use continues in approximately 25% of all pregnancies in the United States, overshadowing illicit drugs of abuse, including cocaine. The societal cost of maternal smoking is seen most readily in underweight newborns, in high rates of perinatal morbidity, mortality and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and in persistent deficits in learning and behavior." "In light of the fact that nearly all crack cocaine users smoke cigarettes, the identification of specific developmental effects of cocaine may prove difficult to detect. Although scientists and the public continue to pay far more attention to fetal cocaine effects than to those of nicotine or tobacco use, a change of focus to concentrate on tobacco could have a disproportionately larger impact on human health." (Slotkin TA)

**CONTEXT:** How does tobacco use during pregnancy compare to cocaine use in terms of prevalence and impact, and where should public health focus shift?

**RAY PEAT:** "The evidence provided by Spear and colleagues (1989a, 1989b), however, indicates that this deficit is relatively transitory and is not found in animals after perhaps [5 days ." "The available evidence would appear to indicate that significant, biologically meaningful deficits on these tasks are not found over a wide range of doses. There are a number of reasons for these failures to find effects." (Riley EP, LaFiette MH)

**CONTEXT:** What is the nature and duration of behavioral deficits observed in rat pups exposed to cocaine prenatally, and why might these effects not be consistently found?

**RAY PEAT:** Abruptio placentae was a common cause of perinatal death in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1974-1975 with a frequency of 5.5/1000 births. This disorder had its peak frequency at term. No abnormalities were found in the placentas to explain the placental abruptions but there were other clues to their genesis. There was a strong association of the fatal abruptions with severe poverty in the mothers. These poor mothers were both undernourished and malnourished during pregnancy. Their fetuses and neonates who died had multiple evidences of undernutrition including a relative undergrowth of adrenals, spleens and livers and a relative acceleration of lung maturation. These findings support observations in more prosperous nations that poor nutrition of the gravida may have an important role in the genesis of abruptio placentae. (Naeye RL, Tafari N, Marboe CC)

**CONTEXT:** What was a common cause of perinatal death in Addis Ababa, and what was its association with maternal nutritional status?

**RAY PEAT:** In a series of 12,587 deliveries in patients of low socio-economic class, there were 356 stillbirths; prospective analysis of these showed that 42.1% occurred in the 4.7% of cases in which the mother had received no antenatal care. When booked and unbooked patients were compared it was found that the rate of stillbirths due to infection and anoxia was significantly higher among unbooked patients, who also accounted for more intra-uterine deaths due to abruptio placentae and congenital abnormalities. We speculate that diet and nutrition might play a major part in the causation of these intra-uterine deaths. (de Jong G, Pattinson RC, Odendaal HJ)

**CONTEXT:** What is the impact of antenatal care and socioeconomic status on stillbirths, and what role might diet and nutrition play?

**RAY PEAT:** "The decidual necrosis was correlated with maternal cigarette smoking and low pregnancy weight gains in the abruption placentae cases. The fetuses and neonates who died had a pattern of growth retardation characteristic of antenatal undernutrition, indicating that poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy may have contributed to the genesis of the abruptio placentae." (Naeye RL, Harkness WL, Utts J)

**RAY PEAT:** "Despite treatment during the major periods of organogenesis and brain development, few congenital abnormalities were observed. There were, however, dose-dependent effects on maternal weight gain, maternal food and water consumption, fetal weight, maternal and fetal fatalities, fetal edema, abruptio placentae and cephalic hemorrhages. Despite suppression of maternal weight gain, there was preservation of fetal weights at cocaine doses up to and including 80 mg/kg/day, suggesting some protection of fetal growth.” (Church MW, Dintcheff BA, Gessner PK)

"Cocaine hydrochloride was administered to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats as a single intraperitoneal dose or as two doses 1-4 hours apart. A single dose administered on day 16 of gestation was teratogenic in a dose-dependent manner, with 40 mg/kg being a no-effect dose and 50 mg/kg the lowest teratogenic dose; 80 mg/kg was lethal to the dam.”

"Periconceptional maternal use of cocaine (odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CT) 0.40-1.4). ..." "Risks were not substantially altered after adjustment for maternal age, race/ethnicity, vitamin use, education, and household income. Increased NTD risk was also not generally associated with paternal drug use. The authors could not discern whether the decreased risks observed for these maternal exposures reflected a true association or were due to reporting bias, a disproportionate number of drug-exposed NTD cases among spontaneous abortuses that could not be ascertained, or some other bias.”

**CONTEXT:** What was the observed association between periconceptional maternal cocaine use and the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs)?

**RAY PEAT:** "Despite treatment during the major periods of organogenesis and brain development, few congenital abnormalities were observed.
