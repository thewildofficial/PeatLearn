**RAY PEAT:** The eyes and the lungs are sensitive tissues that are easily harmed by inappropriate environmental exposure. They are especially sensitive in infancy and old age.

**CONTEXT:** What are the most sensitive tissues in the body to environmental harm, and when are they most vulnerable?

**RAY PEAT:** Retinal injury is caused by ordinary light, when the eyes are sensitized by melatonin, prolactin, and polyunsaturated fats. Bright light isn’t harmful to the retina, even when it is continuous, if the retina isn’t sensitized.

**CONTEXT:** What factors sensitize the retina to light damage?

**RAY PEAT:** Melatonin and prolactin are induced by stress, and darkness is a stress because it impairs mitochondrial energy production.

**CONTEXT:** What physiological states induce melatonin and prolactin, and what is the metabolic consequence of darkness?

**RAY PEAT:** The polyunsaturated fats which accumulate in the brain and retina damage mitochondria.

**CONTEXT:** How do polyunsaturated fats affect cellular function, particularly in the brain and retina?

**RAY PEAT:** Iron, which accumulates prenatally, and then again with aging, reacts with unsaturated fats during stress to destroy cells.

**CONTEXT:** What role does iron play in cellular damage, especially in conjunction with unsaturated fats and stress?

**RAY PEAT:** The popular supplements melatonin, tryptophan, fish oils, St. John’s wort, and the various omega-3 oils, all increase the risk of retinal light damage and macular degeneration. Serotonin uptake inhibiting antidepressants are suspected to be able to cause it.

**CONTEXT:** Which common supplements and medications can increase the risk of retinal light damage and macular degeneration?

**RAY PEAT:** Processes similar to those that damage the over-sensitized retina can occur in other cells, as a result of stress. The substances that sensitize the retina to light-damage, can also increase the incidence of new or metastatic cancers.

**CONTEXT:** Can the mechanisms that damage the retina also affect other cells, and what is the potential consequence for cancer development?

**RAY PEAT:** Iron supplements and the use of supplemental oxygen, especially with a vitamin E deficiency exacerbated by excessive unsaturated fats in the diet, are still commonly used exactly when they can do the most damage.

**CONTEXT:** When are iron supplements and supplemental oxygen particularly harmful, especially in the context of diet and vitamin E status?

**RAY PEAT:** Otto Warburg’s argument that a “respiratory defect” was behind all kinds of cancer, and the idea of free radical damage as a common factor in disease and aging, helped to create a more general way of locking at the nature of disease that superceded medicine’s theories of disease pathogens and genetic mutations, which created thousands of “disease entities,” none of which had much to do with the individuality of the patient or his environment.

**CONTEXT:** How did the concepts of "respiratory defect" and free radical damage offer a more unifying understanding of disease compared to traditional pathogen and genetic mutation theories?

**RAY PEAT:** The understanding that plants and animals have much biochemistry in common has gradually changed the assumptions of the science establishment, which until recently insisted that only “ionizing radiation” could affect animals or other organisms that lacked chlorophyll--and insisted that ionizing rays acted only on the DNA. Visible light, the textbooks said, was not “chemically active,” and so couldn’t possibly affect animals’ cells. In animals, coloration was seen mainly as decoration and disguise, rather than as a functional part of their biochemistry.

**CONTEXT:** What was the prevailing scientific view on the chemical activity of visible light in animals, and how has this view evolved?

**RAY PEAT:** Chemically, the meaning of “a pigment” is that it’s a chemical which selectively absorbs radiation. Old observations such as Warburg’s, that visible light can restore the activity of the “respiratory pigments,” showed without doubt that visible light is biochemically active. By the 1960s, several studies had been published showing the inhibition of respiratory enzymes by blue light, and their activation by red light. The problem to be explained is why the science culture simply couldn’t accept crucial facts of that sort.

**CONTEXT:** How does the chemical definition of a pigment relate to the biochemical activity of visible light, and what is the significance of studies showing light's effect on respiratory enzymes?

**RAY PEAT:** The retina, of course, was allowed (in the views of mainline science) to respond to ordinary light, but the few people who studied the biological effects of seasonal or daily cycles of light have until recently stayed very close to the nerve pathways leading from the retina to the pineal gland, because those pathways could be described in terms of an evolutionarily specialized “third eye.” Even with a doctrine of a genetically special-ized link between the retina and a little of the animal’s physiological chemistry, the great, slow-witted science establishment has done its best to avoid thoughts of any deep interaction between an organism and its environment, by insisting that the organism runs according to a genetically determined “clock” which is located in a few cells in a certain area of the brain, and that nervous impulses from the retina have only the small privilege of “setting the clock.”

**CONTEXT:** How has mainstream science historically viewed the retina's response to light, and what has been their approach to understanding the biological effects of light cycles?

**RAY PEAT:** It didn’t matter to the academic and medical worlds that a professor, Frank A. Brown, had long ago disproved the idea of an innate genetic “clock,” because philosophy is much stronger than evidence. Leibniz had said that everything in the world runs on its own inner clock, without needing to perceive its surroundings, and this idea that everything in the world is a “windowless monad” resonated through the world of science, because it justified the pompous authoritarian attitudes of the experts who knew that anything that wasn’t already in their heads couldn’t be considered knowledge. If an organism’s “essence is contained in its genes,” then it clearly doesn’t interact in any meaningful way with most of its environment. This is the sort of culture that imbued research on the biology of light cycles.

**CONTEXT:** Why has the scientific establishment resisted evidence that contradicts the concept of a purely genetically determined internal clock, and how has this philosophical stance influenced research on light cycles?

**RAY PEAT:** When I moved from Mexico, first to Montana and then to Oregon in 1966, I became very conscious of how light affects the hormones and the health. (For example, in Montana I experienced an interesting springtime shedding of body hair.) Many people who came to cloudy Eugene to study, and who often lived in cheap basement apartments, would develop chronic health problems within a few months. Women who had been healthy when they arrived would often develop premenstrual syndrome or arthritis or colitis during their first winter in Eugene.

**CONTEXT:** What personal observations led you to understand the impact of light on hormones and health, particularly in the context of moving to a cloudier climate?

**RAY PEAT:** The absence of bright light would create a progesterone deficiency, and would leave estrogen and prolactin unopposed. Beginning in 1966, I started calling the syndrome “winter sickness,” but over the next few years, because of the prominence of the premenstrual syndrome and fertility problems in these seasonally exacerbated disorders, I began calling it the pathology of estrogen dominance. In the endocrinology classes I taught at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, I emphasized the importance of light, and suggested that medicine could be reorganized around these estrogen-related processes. If the sparrows of Times Square mated in the winter because of the bright lights, it seemed clear that bright artificial light would be helpful in regulating human hormones.

**CONTEXT:** How does the absence of bright light affect hormonal balance, and what term did you coin for this seasonally exacerbated condition? What was your suggestion for reorganizing medicine based on these observations?

**RAY PEAT:** In our lab at the University of Oregon, our hamsters would try to hibernate, even though they were in temperature-controlled laboratories with regular cycles of artificial light. (The ceiling lights provided only dim illumination inside their cage boxes, so they were probably in a chronic state of light deprivation, which probably increased their sensitivity to the weak environmental cues that Frank Brown had investigated, possibly microwaves that easily penetrated the lab walls.) During the winter, when they were infertile, I found that their thymus glands practically disappeared. The mechanism seemed to include the increase of pineal gland activity (probably increasing melatonin synthesis) in the winter, under the intensified activity of the “sympathetic nervous system” (with increased activity of adrenalin and other catecholamines), and the melatonin was apparently a signal for suppressing fertility during the stressful winter. In some animals (Shvareva and Nevretdinova, 1989), estrogen is increased during hibernation, contributing to the reduction of body temperature.

**CONTEXT:** What observations were made with hamsters in the lab regarding hibernation, infertility, and thymus gland atrophy, and what hormonal mechanisms were implicated?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1994 A.V. Sirotkin found that melatonin inhibits progesterone production but stimulates estrogen production, and it’s widely recognized that melatonin generally inhibits the thyroid hormones, creating an environment in which fertilization, implantation, and development of the embryo are not possible. This combination of high estrogen with low progesterone and low thyroid decreases the resistance of the organism, predisposing it to seizures and excitotoxic damage, and causing the thymus gland to atrophy.

**CONTEXT:** How does melatonin affect progesterone and estrogen production, and what are the broader metabolic consequences of melatonin's inhibition of thyroid hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** Cyclical exposure to melatonin can have an effect on the reproductive system opposite to that of chronic exposure, and the way exogenous melatonin is delivered to the animal can have unexpected effects on the actual amount of melatonin circulating in the blood (Wright and Alves, 2001). The actual amount of melatonin in the tissues, its relation to the normal cycling of the animal, and the influence of temperature, are often disregarded in melatonin research, making it hard to interpret many of the publications.

**CONTEXT:** What are the complexities in interpreting melatonin research, particularly regarding its effects on the reproductive system and circulating blood levels?

**RAY PEAT:** There is a lot of talk about melatonin’s function as an antioxidant, but, like so many other “antioxidants,” melatonin can act as a pro-oxidant at physiologically relevant concentrations; some studies have found that it, like estrogen, increases the activity of the pro-oxidative free radical nitric oxide (which acts like melatonin on pigment cells, causing them to lighten). The promoters of estrogen are also making claims that estrogen is a protective antioxidant, though that isn’t true of physiological concentrations of the estrogens, which can catalyze intense oxidations. The market culture seems to guide most research in these substances.

**CONTEXT:** What is the dual nature of melatonin's effect on oxidation, and how do estrogen's antioxidant claims compare to its actual biochemical activity?

**RAY PEAT:** Almost any kind of stress increases the formation of melatonin.

**CONTEXT:** What is a common trigger for increased melatonin production?

**RAY PEAT:** In some animals, melatonin has been shown to be responsible for whitening of the hair during the winter. In some species it acts directly on the pigment cells, but in other species it seems to inhibit the action of the melanocyte stimulating hormone.

**CONTEXT:** How does melatonin influence hair color in animals, and what are the proposed mechanisms?

**RAY PEAT:** In snowy climates, it’s “ecologically” rational for animals to turn white in the winter, for camouflage. But tadpoles also turn white in the dark, or under the influence of melatonin, and the biological meaning of that isn’t so clear. It’s possible that being white would reduce their loss of heat through radiation, but I think it is more likely that it relates to an increased ability of weak radiation to penetrate their tissues, rather than being stopped near the surface by the melanin in the skin. The absence of melanin makes them more sensitive to light. Bright light suppresses their melatonin, and makes them turn dark brown or black, and this protects them from bright sunlight.

**CONTEXT:** What is the ecological rationale for winter coat whitening in animals, and what is the potential biological significance of this phenomenon in tadpoles, particularly regarding light sensitivity and heat regulation?

**RAY PEAT:** In the retina, melatonin increases the sensitivity of the cells to dim light. It, along with prolactin, another nocturnal hormone, helps to produce dark adaptation of the eyes.

**CONTEXT:** How does melatonin, in conjunction with prolactin, affect the retina's sensitivity to light?

**RAY PEAT:** Melatonin increases the concentration of free fatty acids during the night (John, et al., 1983; John and George, 1976)), so it’s interesting that one of the long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), also increases the light sensitivity of the retina.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between melatonin, free fatty acids, and retinal light sensitivity, particularly concerning DHA?

**RAY PEAT:** Melatonin lowers body temperature, causes vasoconstriction in the brain, heart, and other organs, and slows reactions. An antagonist to melatonin acts as an antidepressant, reducing “behavioral despair” resulting from stress. (Dubocovich, et al., 1990.) So, in the behavioral sense, melatonin reduces sensitivity, yet it increases the eyes’ sensitivity to light, causing them to be injured by light that would otherwise be harmless.

**CONTEXT:** What are the systemic effects of melatonin, and how does its effect on behavior contrast with its effect on retinal light sensitivity?

**RAY PEAT:** Since a hibernating animal under the influence of melatonin can become very cold, the light-sensitizing function of melatonin is probably related to the biological need to be roused out of the torpor occasionally. (Hibernators apparently have to warm up occasionally to sleep in the ordinary manner.) Melatonin is said to intensify dreaming, which is part of the process of arousal from sleep.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed connection between melatonin's light-sensitizing function and the arousal of hibernating animals?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the stress-related hormones increase during the night. One of the ways these hormones of darkness act is to increase the sensitivity to light, in a process that is an important adaptation for organisms in dim light. In the night, our ability to see (and respond to) dim light is increased. But dark-adapted eyes are very sensitive to injury by bright light. Light that ordinarily wouldn’t harm the eyes, will do serious damage when the eyes are dark adapted.

**CONTEXT:** How do stress-related hormones that increase at night contribute to light sensitivity, and what is the consequence for dark-adapted eyes when exposed to bright light?

**RAY PEAT:** In thinking about the effects of stress and oxygen deprivation, I read the studies demonstrating that the formation of the oxygen-wasting age pigment, lipofuscin, is increased by estrogen, by oxygen deprivation (in carp living below the ice, or even in fetuses), by metals such as iron, by x-rays, and by highly unsaturated fats.

**CONTEXT:** What factors have been shown to increase the formation of lipofuscin, the "age pigment"?

**RAY PEAT:** Free fatty acids that are mobilized from storage tissues in the night and in the winter also tend to increase with aging, as the ability to tolerate stress decreases. Poor circulation and lipofuscin tend to be associated, in a vicious cycle. This means that the retina becomes easier to injure by light in old age, for some of the same reasons that the infant’s retina is susceptible.

**CONTEXT:** How do mobilized free fatty acids, aging, and stress tolerance relate to retinal vulnerability to light injury?

**RAY PEAT:** The fetus accumulates a very large amount of iron, and it absorbs melatonin from the maternal circulation. Prolactin is sometimes elevated in the newborn. Premature babies are often given extra oxygen, which tends to cause vasoconstriction by placing carbon dioxide. Melatonin’s ability to cause vasoconstriction means that stress makes supplemental oxygen more toxic. Synthetic glucocorticoids are often given to premature babies, adding to the risk of retinal damage.

**CONTEXT:** What factors in fetal development and neonatal care can increase the risk of retinal damage, particularly concerning iron, melatonin, oxygen, and glucocorticoids?

**RAY PEAT:** When the mother has been given iron supplements during pregnancy, along with unsaturated oils in the diet, the baby is likely to be born with a vitamin E deficiency and suppressed thyroid function, increasing the probability that it will be jaundiced, leading to treatment of the jaundice with exposure to very bright light.

**CONTEXT:** How can maternal iron supplementation and dietary unsaturated oils during pregnancy contribute to infant jaundice and subsequent light treatment for it?

**RAY PEAT:** Although Yandell Henderson had already, in 1928, explained the need for carbon dioxide to be used with oxygen for resuscitating infants or adults, medical researchers and hospital workers could never accept the idea, probably because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Animal studies that supplemental oxygen causes vasoconstriction, reducing the tissues’ supply of glucose as well as oxygen. In combination with too much light, especially blue light, it damages the retina. At hyperbaric pressures, oxygen causes seizures, as well as damage to the lungs and other tissues.

**CONTEXT:** Why has the medical establishment historically resisted the use of carbon dioxide with oxygen for resuscitation, and what are the dangers of supplemental oxygen, especially when combined with light or at hyperbaric pressures?

**RAY PEAT:** The contribution of bright light to retinal damage in babies has been denied in several recent publications, and these articles undoubtedly provide useful material for defense lawyers to use when hospitals are sued for causing blindness. One publication based on experiments with kittens concludes that bright light does not harm the newborn’s retina, but the comparison is between continuous light and intermittent light, rather than between bright light and dim light. Twelve hours of total darkness, rather than sparing the eye by reducing its exposure to light, would sensitize the eye. The only reason such appalling things can be published is that their conclusions protect the hospitals.

**CONTEXT:** What is the scientific and legal context surrounding the denial of bright light's contribution to retinal damage in infants, and what is the flaw in studies that compare continuous versus intermittent light?

**RAY PEAT:** A few good studies of the effect of bright light on the retina, and the fact that dark-skinned people with more protective pigment in their eyes have a lower incidence of retinopathy of prematurity, make it clear that the ordinary laws of physics and chemistry actually do apply to the infant eye.

**CONTEXT:** What evidence supports the role of bright light in retinal damage in infants, and what does the lower incidence of retinopathy in dark-skinned individuals suggest?

**RAY PEAT:** Light and stress, especially with excess iron, damage the retina when the cells contain too much PUFA, since these fats react with light and free radicals. The nocturnal/stress hormones, especially prolactin and melatonin, make the retina more sensitive to light, and more easily damaged. Darkness that sets up the problem, since eyes adapt to excess light, but are more vulnerable in darkness.

**CONTEXT:** How do light, stress, iron, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) interact to damage the retina, and what role do nocturnal/stress hormones play in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** The use of lasers to operate on eyes produces intense inflammation of the eye, but even at low dose the diffusing light causes retinal/macular damage.

**CONTEXT:** What are the risks associated with laser eye surgery, even at low doses?

**RAY PEAT:** [Enzyme name] is one of the enzymes inhibited by blue light, and activated by red light, thyroid, and progesterone. It's a copper enzyme, so it's likely to be damaged by excess iron. It is most active when it is associated with a mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin, that contains saturated palmitic acid; the substitution of polyunsaturated fats lowers its activity. Mitochondrial function in general is poisoned by the unsaturated fats, especially arachidonic acid and DHA.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between blue and red light, thyroid, progesterone, copper, iron, and mitochondrial function, particularly concerning cardiolipin and unsaturated fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Creating a “deficiency” of DHA, even when an oil of known toxicity is used to replace the omega-3 oils, prevents retinal damage from light. Despite evidence of this sort, Mead Johnson is going ahead with the marketing of its baby formula containing added DHA which is industrially extracted from algae. (Although the researchers who claim that DHA is beneficial haven’t answered my letters, a representative of the company that manufactures it did answer my question about the actual composition of the oil, and acknowledged that they don’t have any idea what the minor ingredients might be.)

**CONTEXT:** How can creating a deficiency in DHA prevent retinal damage, and what is the concern regarding DHA in infant formula?

**RAY PEAT:** When animals are made “deficient” in all the exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and arachidonic acid as well as linolenic and DHA, they become remarkably resistant to all sorts of stress and toxins.

**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of a deficiency in all exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids on an animal's resistance to stress and toxins?

**RAY PEAT:** The polyunsaturated fats make the lungs more sensitive to excess oxygen or hyperventilation, they make the eyes more sensitive to light, and they make the brain more sensitive to fatigue.

**CONTEXT:** How do polyunsaturated fats affect the sensitivity of the lungs, eyes, and brain?

**RAY PEAT:** The use of synthetic glucocorticoid hormone is standard in treating very premature babies, although it is known to contribute to eye damage. This is because it is considered necessary to improve the lung function of premature babies with respiratory distress. But there is no clear evidence that it is beneficial for lung function in the long run, and very clear evidence that it damages the brain and other organs. There is widespread agreement regarding the use of the glucocorticoids prenatally to accelerate lung development in women who seem likely to deliver prematurely. Natural cortisol is a factor that promotes lung development prenatally. But cortisol is also a signal produced by a stressed fetus, that triggers the birth process. Cortisol, or the synthetic glucocorticoid, inhibits progesterone production, and stimulates estrogen production, activating uterine contractions and other processes that terminate the pregnancy.

**CONTEXT:** What are the risks associated with the use of synthetic glucocorticoids in premature infants, and how do they relate to lung development, brain function, and pregnancy termination?

**RAY PEAT:** Apparently, it doesn’t occur to many people that administering the glucocorticoid triggers premature birth, creating the problem they are intending to treat.

**CONTEXT:** What is the paradoxical effect of administering glucocorticoids in the context of premature birth?

**RAY PEAT:** Recognizing causal connections between premature birth and respiratory distress and retinopathy of prematurity, it would be obvious that the greatest effort should be made to prevent the problems by improving the health of pregnant women. Hospitals, however, are invested in high technology systems for treating these problems, and even though their results are dismal, they can’t make money by getting pregnant women to eat enough protein to prevent preeclampsia, which is a major cause of premature birth, or by treating the problems with salt, magnesium, progesterone, thyroid, and aspirin when the women haven’t had a good diet.

**CONTEXT:** Why is there a disconnect between recognizing the causes of premature birth and implementing preventive measures, and what are the economic factors influencing hospital practices?

**RAY PEAT:** Historically, preeclampsia has been blamed on the mother’s or fetus’s “bad genes,” and that cultural bias was the setting in which these high technology prenatal and neonatal systems developed. High technology “neonatology” derives from the same ideology that motivated Josef Mengele’s genetic research in Auschwitz. The idea of genetic determination is still motivating resistance to reasonable preventive approaches.

**CONTEXT:** How has the concept of "bad genes" and genetic determinism influenced the development of high-technology neonatal care and resistance to preventive strategies?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid, i.e., T3, is very effective in accelerating lung development in the fetus, and it doesn’t have any of the harmful effects of the synthetic glucocorticoids. It normalizes the hormones, increasing progesterone and decreasing estrogen, which are needed for full-term gestation, the opposite of the glucocorticoids’ effects. While the cortisol-like drugs damage the brain and other organs, thyroid and progesterone protect them.

**CONTEXT:** How does thyroid hormone (T3) compare to synthetic glucocorticoids in promoting fetal lung development, and what are their respective effects on hormonal balance and organ protection?

**RAY PEAT:** Old organisms, like newborns, are easily injured by all sorts of inappropriate excitation. As in premature babies, the aged eyes, lungs, and brain are especially sensitive to damage by stress. But all organs are subject to the same kinds of damage. Medical treatments for respiratory distress and macular degeneration in old people are often the same as those used so inappropriately for babies. The good health practices that can prevent the inflammatory and degenerative diseases can often make it possible for damaged tissues to recover, even in old age.

**CONTEXT:** Why are both newborns and the aged particularly vulnerable to damage from inappropriate excitation, and what is the commonality in medical treatments for age-related and infant conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** The pituitary hormones, especially prolactin and TSH, are pro-inflammatory, and darkness increases TSH along with prolactin, so to compensate for a light deficiency, the pituitary should be well-suppressed by adequate thyroid. Armour thyroid or Thyrolar or Cynoplus, Cytomel, would probably be helpful. (Eye-drops containing T3 might be a way to restore metabolic activity more quickly.) Limiting water intake (or using salt generously) helps to inhibit prolactin secretion. The saturated fats protect against the body's stored PUFA, and keeping the blood sugar up keeps the stored fats from being mobilized. Aspirin (or indomethacin) is generally protective to the retina, analogously to its protection against sunburn. Adequate vitamin E is extremely important. There are several prescription drugs that protect against serotonin excess, but thyroid and gelatin (or glycine, as in magnesium glycinate) are protective against the serotonin and melatonin toxicities. Copper and magnesium deficiencies predispose to retinal damage. Red light is protective, blue light (or u.v.) is harmful, so wearing orange lenses would be helpful. Progesterone and pregnenolone, by reducing the stress reactions, should be helpful--in the eye diseases of infancy and old age, as they are in the respiratory distress syndromes.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of pituitary hormones like prolactin and TSH in inflammation, and how can thyroid hormone, dietary adjustments, and specific supplements mitigate these effects and protect the retina?
