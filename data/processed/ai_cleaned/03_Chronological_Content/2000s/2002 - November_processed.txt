**RAY PEAT:** Proliferation is the natural "primordial" tendency of all cells. Oxidative metabolism is crucial in maintaining the relative quiescence that makes it possible for multicellular organisms to exist and to preserve their organization. The extracellular matrix, and the materials that pass through it, constitute the "field" within which cells develop and function.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental biological tendency of cells and what is crucial for maintaining the organization of multicellular organisms?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen, by altering the cell matrix, alters the developmental field itself. Simply by creating a thickened barrier, it makes it difficult for cells to maintain their proper place in the organism, and some of them, in the energy-deprived state, revert to the primordial proliferative state.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen contribute to cellular dysfunction and a reversion to a proliferative state?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid hormone, the regulator of oxidative metabolism, is the basic hormone making possible the respiration which generates and sustains the multicellular state.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of thyroid hormone in cellular respiration and the multicellular state?

**RAY PEAT:** The simple idea of antagonism between hormones, for example between catabolic and anabolic steroids, or between progesterone and estrogen, is firmly based on experiments, but there is an attitude in medical endocrinology, based on the names of the substances, that insists on a “synergy” between estrogen (“the hormone of estrus, creating a readiness to copulate”) and progesterone (“the hormone of pregnancy”). Sequential, coordinated action isn’t the same as synergy. Hunger can lead to satiety, but no one denies that these are contrasting conditions. Hundreds of biological actions created by estrogen are reversed by progesterone, and vice versa.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental difference between hormonal synergy and sequential action, and how do estrogen and progesterone interact?

**RAY PEAT:** Shock, capillary leakage, excessive clotting of the blood, epilepsy, goiter, hyperactivity, and countless other biological problems are created by an excess of estrogen, and normalized by progesterone. The problem of cancerization by estrogen, and its opposition by progesterone, was clearly defined by Alejandro Lipschutz more than fifty years ago, but a series of deliberate actions by the drug industry, and its “regulatory agencies,” has prevented a rational and coherent approach to the use of hormones in preventing and curing cancer.

**CONTEXT:** What are the adverse effects of estrogen excess, and how does progesterone counteract them, particularly in relation to cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** For over fifty years, estrogen has been widely promoted for the prevention and treatment of various cancers, and throughout the 20th century agents of the drug industry claimed that it was not carcinogenic, and prevented the US government from classifying it as such. During the same period, and for many of the same commercial reasons, natural progesterone has occasionally been claimed either to cause cancer, or to be ineffective in its treatment. While billions of dollars were spent in “cancer research,” the useful basic knowledge about the prevention and cure of cancer was ignored. Not just ignored, but suppressed: Medical journals of all sorts have simply declined to publish favorable research on progesterone, and medical conferences on female endocrinology that claim to be open to all views are not open to favorable reports on progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** How has the pharmaceutical industry influenced the perception and research of estrogen and progesterone in relation to cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Some researchers have observed that only about one percent of medical research is scientifically sound, but that view ignores the fact that the “valid one percent” is certainly going to be misinterpreted, unless the reader understands that the medical journals are intensely subjective and biased in what they choose to publish, and that they exclude the research that would provide the essential contexts for evaluating the things that are published. To find an adequate context in which to interpret current research, we have to go back at least fifty years, to a time when the science journals were relatively independent.

**CONTEXT:** What is the critical flaw in evaluating medical research, and where can one find a more reliable context for understanding scientific findings?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of “genetic determination,” which I have written about many times, has been useful to the drug industry. If moderate amounts of estrogen didn’t cause mutations of certain genes that were thought to distinguish normal cells from cancer cells, then how could it be carcinogenic? And if cancer cells are “genetically committed,” then only lethal cytotoxic methods could be considered as therapies.

**CONTEXT:** How has the concept of "genetic determination" been exploited by the drug industry in the context of cancer research?

**RAY PEAT:** The history of estrogen and progesterone research offers an alternative view of cancer, and of physiology itself. In the 1940s, Hans Selye demonstrated that progesterone produced very deep anesthesia, and that its actions were essentially instantaneous. Estrogen’s characteristic actions, too (such as the uptake of water by tissues, and nervous excitation) were so rapid that it was clear that the effects were produced without the activation of special “genes.” But these quick actions were generally ignored, because their existence wasn’t compatible with the doctrine of genetic determination.

**CONTEXT:** What did Hans Selye's research on progesterone and estrogen reveal about their mechanisms of action, and why were these findings often disregarded?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen acts at many different levels, modifying the state of water, of proteins and fats, of the immune, circulatory, and nervous systems. It isn’t just a “carcinogen,” or just a “female hormone.” Many substances, processes, or conditions (cholera toxin, x-rays, oxygen deprivation) imitate many of estrogen’s effects.

**CONTEXT:** What are the multifaceted effects of estrogen on the body, and what other factors can mimic these effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Energy generates order, and maintains it. Destruction of order degrades the ability of cells to produce energy.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between energy, order, and cellular function?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone (and related substances), too, act on many levels of organization at the same time. The interactions of proteins and water are changed immediately, with circulatory and nervous and bioelectrical responses coinciding with changes of cells' functions, including changes in the proteins of the "receptor systems." The functional changes that can be seen in the first minutes of progesterone's actions lead to metabolic changes and then to more basic structural changes.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone exert its effects on cellular organization and function?

**RAY PEAT:** Stabilization and activation of mitochondria by progesterone, and a shift away from glycolysis (Joe and Ramirez, 2001: GAPDH inhibition), are exactly the opposite of estrogen’s toxic effects on the mitochondria (by increasing NO, for example), and activation of glycolysis.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone's effect on mitochondrial function and glycolysis differ from that of estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** On the molecular level, progesterone and estrogen have different structural effects, that account for their globally opposite regulatory effects. Their systematically different effects on energy production lead to global differences in the regulation of cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones, and cellular organelles, which contribute to macroscopic shifts in the distribution of substances throughout the organism, including water, fats, and the materials such as collagen and glycoproteins that make up the extracellular matrix.

**CONTEXT:** What are the molecular differences between progesterone and estrogen, and how do these differences lead to their opposing regulatory effects?

**RAY PEAT:** If progesterone is to be named “the hormone of gestation,” then estrogen might be called “the hormone of miscarriage.”

**CONTEXT:** How can progesterone and estrogen be characterized in terms of their roles in pregnancy and its potential failure?

**RAY PEAT:** The characteristic metabolic end-product of progesterone-dominated metabolism is carbon dioxide. During gestation, the fetus is exposed to large amounts of progesterone and carbon dioxide. The very high concentration of progesterone during gestation keeps tissues from retaining excess estrogen, even when estrogen is present in the blood stream. The very high concentration of carbon dioxide has many protective effects, including protection against the formation of lactic acid.

**CONTEXT:** What is the primary metabolic end-product of progesterone-dominated metabolism, and what are its protective effects during gestation?

**RAY PEAT:** Every tumor is a biologically unique substance, but it is biologically compatible with its host. This is analogous to the tissue compatibility of twins which share a single placenta, even though they may be genetically different fraternal twins.

**CONTEXT:** How can tumors be understood in terms of their biological compatibility with the host?

**RAY PEAT:** The characteristic metabolic end-product of estrogen-dominated metabolism is lactic acid. Increasing lactic acid displaces carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** What is the characteristic metabolic end-product of estrogen-dominated metabolism, and how does it affect carbon dioxide levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide combines spontaneously with amine groups, as in the lysine residues of proteins, and this influences the interactions of the proteins with other substances, for example, inhibiting glycation of proteins; protein glycation occurs during stress and aging, and degrades the functions of proteins and cells and systems. These changes are believed to contribute to the hardening of connective tissues with aging.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide interact with proteins, and what are the implications for aging and connective tissue health?

**RAY PEAT:** The fibrosis of aging is associated with a generalized state of inflammation, producing catabolism and atrophy of most systems, with isolated regions escaping the general cachexia, and regenerating their cells and tissues in disorganized ways, producing many abnormalities that could be diagnosed as “precancerous,” a few of which develop into tumors.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between fibrosis, inflammation, aging, and the development of precancerous conditions and tumors?

**RAY PEAT:** A.V. Everitt's book on the pituitary and aging mentions some studies that relate to progesterone and aging. Uterine collagen aging, which increases under the influence of estrogen, is lowest in the old rodents that have been bred the most often, and this is probably partly the result of progesterone's action on collagenase and fibroblasts, as well as its ability to displace estrogen from the tissues. Leo Loeb showed that excess estrogen and aging both produced similar increases in collagen. Alejandro Lipschutz found that chronic estrogen treatment produced fibrosis of practically all tissues, and that cancer later developed in those fibrotic tissues. Then he tested various steroids, and found that progesterone had the strongest antifibromatogenic action, and that pregnenolone was next in effectiveness. (Brief intermittent exposures to estrogen didn’t produce the harmful effects, and now it’s known that progesterone decreases the tissues’ retention of estrogen.) Lipschutz’ 1950 book on steroid hormones and tumors summarizes his work.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of progesterone in mitigating collagen aging and fibrosis, as demonstrated by studies on rodents and the work of Leo Loeb and Alejandro Lipschutz?

**RAY PEAT:** Contemporaries of Loeb and Lipschutz, Joseph Needham, C.H. Waddington and J.W. Orr, argued that cancer evolves through a series of developments in the tissues, rather than in single cells.

**CONTEXT:** What alternative perspective on cancer development was proposed by researchers like Joseph Needham, C.H. Waddington, and J.W. Orr?

**RAY PEAT:** A few years later, Hans Selye showed that the partial isolation of tissue itself (for example, growing inside a small glass tube implanted in a rat) caused a tremendous acceleration of the aging process in the isolated cells and matrix. An impermeable sheet of plastic implanted in an animal tends to cause a cancer to develop, if it is folded to form a concavity. The thickened connective tissue matrix that develops with aging, irritation, and stress creates innumerable areas in which cells are similarly cut off from full contact with their normal environment.

**CONTEXT:** How did Hans Selye's experiments with tissue isolation and implanted materials shed light on the aging process and cancer development?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen treatment at menopause produces alkalosis and hyperventilation. Alkalosis stimulates peroxidation and various other harmful stress-products. Prenatally, if estrogen excess doesn't kill the fetus, it retards its brain growth, because many of its metabolic actions are powerfully antigestational--actions that are used medically in the contraceptive pills and abortion pills.

**CONTEXT:** What are the consequences of estrogen treatment at menopause and estrogen excess during prenatal development?

**RAY PEAT:** All cancer cells produce lactate even in the presence of oxygen, and this increases their intracellular alkalinity, promoting swelling, calcium uptake, and proliferation. Continued exposure to lactic acid increases collagen formation and fibrosis.

**CONTEXT:** How does lactate production by cancer cells contribute to their proliferation and the development of fibrosis?

**RAY PEAT:** I think of high altitude as analogous to the protected gestational state. (Both progesterone and carbon dioxide are increased in people adapted to high altitude.) Respiratory acidosis, meaning the retention of carbon dioxide, is very protective, and is an outstanding feature of life in the uterus. Even at the time that an embryo is implanting in the uterus, adequate carbon dioxide is crucial. Many of the mysteries of embryology and developmental biology have been explained by the presence of a high level of carbon dioxide during gestation. For example, an injury to the fetus heals without scarring, that is, with complete regeneration instead of the formation of a sort of collagenous plug. Over the last fifty years, several people have discovered that simply enclosing a wound (for example an amputated finger tip) in an air-tight compartment allows remarkably complete regeneration, even in adults, who supposedly have lost the power of regeneration. (Exposure of tissues to air causes them to lose carbon dioxide.)

**CONTEXT:** How is the high-altitude environment analogous to the gestational state, and what is the significance of carbon dioxide retention for protection and regeneration?

**RAY PEAT:** High altitude sickness is now treated with acetazolamide (which causes carbon dioxide retention, and respiratory acidosis), or with direct inhalation of carbon dioxide. Sleep apnea, which has been treated for many years with progesterone, is now being treated with acetazolamide, in recognition that it is caused by alkalosis. Both progesterone and acetazolamide increase the carbon dioxide content of the tissues, by decreasing sensitivity to carbon dioxide, yet they both stimulate respiration by increasing sensitivity to oxygen deprivation: (Wagenaar, et al., 2000.) Drugs similar to acetazolamide, sulfonamides that inhibit carbonic anhydrase, have recently been discovered to stop the growth of a wide variety of tumors.

**CONTEXT:** What are the therapeutic applications of acetazolamide and progesterone in managing conditions related to carbon dioxide levels and alkalosis, and what is the significance of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in cancer treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide, progesterone, and the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors stabilize and protect cells in very general ways. For example, they all inhibit epileptic seizures. All of them are involved in regulating calcium, preventing bone loss and hypercalcemia. In cancer, hypercalcemia is very common, and it is important to be able to correct it, because uncontrolled calcium is profoundly dangerous. (In “Homeostasis” and other newsletters I have written about the regulation of calcium.)

**CONTEXT:** What are the general cellular stabilizing and protective effects of carbon dioxide, progesterone, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, particularly concerning calcium regulation and epilepsy?

**RAY PEAT:** Increased intracellular calcium is excitatory, and interferes with mitochondrial energy production. Prolonged oxygen deprivation increases intracellular calcium (Smith, et al., 2001). When a cancer cell interacts with other cells, it can disturb their calcium regulation, and this can cause the cell to break its contacts with other cells (Tsuji, et al., 2002), and increased intracellular calcium can cause a cell to reorganize its intracellular structure, and to be transformed into spontaneously proliferating cells (Furst, et al., 2002). The intracellular architecture which is depolymerized by calcium excitation forms a link between the extracellular matrix and the regulation of genes in the nucleus. Generally, things (estrogen, prolactin, alkalinity, swelling, cadmium, iron) that increase intracellular calcium increase cellular proliferation. Drugs that decrease intracellular calcium are increasingly being seen to stop the proliferation of cancer cells.

**CONTEXT:** How does increased intracellular calcium affect cellular energy production, cell-to-cell communication, and proliferation, and what factors contribute to its increase?

**RAY PEAT:** Increased intracellular calcium also increases the formation of collagen, and drugs that decrease intracellular calcium decrease collagen secretion.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between intracellular calcium and collagen formation?

**RAY PEAT:** If cancer consists of a spontaneous process of healing and regeneration that goes wrong because of changes in its environment, because it has lost contact with its “formative field,” then the only reasonable approach to the prevention and treatment of cancer is to restore that formative field. The conditions of gestation, for mammals, constitute a formative field in the highest degree that we know.

**CONTEXT:** How can cancer be viewed as a disordered process of healing and regeneration, and what is the key to its prevention and treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** During gestation, after organs have differentiated, nerve cells extend their fibers from the brain to innervate muscles and other tissues. The special conditions of life in the uterus support this process, but something similar can happen during adult life, when damaged nerves regenerate. A major difference between injury to the fetus, and injury to an adult, is that the wound regenerates perfectly without a scar in the fetus, but in the adult, regeneration is often impaired, and a connective tissue scar replaces normally functioning tissue.

**CONTEXT:** What are the differences in nerve regeneration and wound healing between a fetus and an adult, and what role do the uterine conditions play?

**RAY PEAT:** The intestinal nerves of stressed animals have been found to fragment; before the axons actually break, they form beads. The surface tension of an axon has to be very low, for it to remain stable with such an extreme ratio of surface to volume: the diameter of an axon is similar to that of a bacterium. Ordinary water, with its high surface tension, breaks up into drops rather than forming a filament. If something increases the surface tension of a nerve, it tends to round up; the glial cells and Schwann cells that surround the axons of fast-acting nerves provide pregnenolone and progesterone to the axon, and the extreme lipophilicity of progesterone lowers the surface tension of cytoplasm. Progesterone powerfully improves nerve cell regeneration. During stress, cells run out of oxygen and produce lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide, and the lipophilic and acidic gas is replaced by the hydrophilic lactate.

**CONTEXT:** How does stress affect nerve integrity, and what is the role of progesterone in maintaining nerve cell stability and promoting regeneration?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide protects nerves and muscles against excessive excitation. It inhibits lactic acid formation, and lipid peroxidation (measured in the blood) can be completely suppressed by a pCO2 of about 90 mm, which isn't high enough to produce acidosis.

**CONTEXT:** What protective mechanisms does carbon dioxide provide for nerves and muscles, particularly in relation to excitation and lipid peroxidation?

**RAY PEAT:** Hospital respirators are normally set to hyperventilate patients, and the use of supplemental oxygen tends to make hyperventilation worse, making breathing and circulation more difficult. Carbogen, 95% oxygen with 5% carbon dioxide, is available, but is seldom used. Hyperbaric oxygen is both safer and more effective when carbon dioxide is added, but the amount of carbon dioxide needed varies with the pressure. More people would recover from brain and spinal cord injuries if physicians understood nerve and respiratory physiology.

**CONTEXT:** What are the issues with standard hospital respiratory support, and how can the addition of carbon dioxide improve oxygen therapy and recovery from neurological injuries?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the most commonly recognized features of estrogen excess is leakiness of the capillaries. Simple hyperventilation is enough to cause capillaries to leak, and this involves many related events, including decreased carbon dioxide, and increased release of serotonin. Edema, fibrosis, and inflammation (resulting from capillary leakage) contribute to a change in cellular energy production, and along with the actions of serotonin and other regulatory substances released during the alkalosis of stress, cells are stimulated to multiply.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen excess lead to capillary leakage, and what are the downstream effects on cellular energy, inflammation, and proliferation?

**RAY PEAT:** The excitation of cells produced by a deficiency of carbon dioxide increases their need for energy. If their energy production is suppressed (as by estrogen, serotonin, and edema), they will either adapt or die.

**CONTEXT:** How does a deficiency in carbon dioxide lead to cellular excitation and increased energy demand, and what are the potential outcomes when energy production is suppressed?

**RAY PEAT:** In the isolation of a degenerating extracellular matrix, with a defective energy supply, some cells will react as though they are going to repair a wound or regenerate tissue, proliferating and degrading the damaged matrix, but instead of encountering healthy tissue, they sometimes encounter only more damaged tissue, and other cells in the simplified, proliferating state. Without finding the stable field of a healthy organism, they will continue to adapt and develop, but with reference to a field that has no function. Eventually, that kind of disoriented adaptation can produce a malignant tumor.

**CONTEXT:** How can a degenerating extracellular matrix and defective energy supply lead to disorganized cellular proliferation and the formation of malignant tumors?

**RAY PEAT:** A 1951 Symposium on Steroids in Experimental and Clinical Practice (held in Cuernavaca), edited by Abraham White, has a chapter by Roy Hertz, et al, "Observations on the effect of progesterone on carcinoma of the cervix," that follows up on the antitumorigenic effects of progesterone discovered by Lipschutz, and the chapter includes some very interesting photographs of cervical tumors before and after treatment, and they reported that "In eleven of the 17 treated patients visible and palpable evidence of regressive alteration of the tumor mass could be demonstrated. This consisted of (a) distinct reduction in size of the visible portion of the cancer as well as reduction of the palpable extent of the mass, (b) reduction in vascularity and friability of the visible lesion with a clearly demonstrable epithelization of previously raw surfaces and (c) markedly increased pliability of the previously rigid and infiltrated parametria." [That is, the bloody messes started healing, and the woody lumps began to feel like normal tissue.] Despite the amazingly favorable results, they conclude "We do not consider the regressive changes observed to be sufficient to indicate the use of progesterone as a therapeutic agent in carcinoma of the cervix." This conclusion is especially interesting, considering that two pages later, Escher, et al., say that the highly ambiguous effects of estrogens on breast cancer "are of value to advanced-cancer groups." I think it’s likely that the institutional sponsorship of the symposium influenced those conclusions.

**CONTEXT:** What were the findings of Hertz et al. regarding progesterone's effect on cervical carcinoma, and why was their conclusion to not recommend progesterone as a therapeutic agent noteworthy?

**RAY PEAT:** Hertz, et al., gave the women 250 mg of progesterone in 5 ml of vegetable oil i.m., usually daily, for ten to 170 days. They didn't mention any side effects of sedation or anesthesia. Hans Selye found that large doses of progesterone caused profound anesthesia in rats, but this effect has never been reported in humans, because the pharmaceutical forms of progesterone don't permit adequate doses. Using progesterone dissolved in tocopherol (at 10% or 20% concentration), it takes only 100 mg to semi-anesthetize some people, and very profound anesthesia can be produced by larger doses. (In this form, a very large dose can kill a rat, though it stimulates the respiratory center at lower anesthetic doses.)

**CONTEXT:** What dosage and administration of progesterone were used by Hertz et al., and how does this compare to the anesthetic effects observed by Hans Selye in rats, and what is the significance of progesterone formulation in tocopherol?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is barely soluble in ordinary vegetable oils, and publications rarely mention that the formulations which contain 250 mg/ml also contain the "bacteriostat," benzyl alcohol, which is the actual solvent, but which is so soluble in water that the progesterone crystallizes immediately after intramuscular injection. (I have previously written about the history of medical progesterone, and the fraudulent claims and doctrines that have shaped its use.)

**CONTEXT:** What are the formulation issues with injectable progesterone, and how do these affect its efficacy?

**RAY PEAT:** Although my observations show that progesterone is much more effective in treating many kinds of cancer than most of the published literature indicates, journal editors "know" otherwise. When I applied for the patent on the formulation of progesterone in vitamin E, the patent examiner told me that I must remove any mention of cancer if I wanted my application to be approved. The "evil mutant cell" theory of cancer, and the official description of progesterone as a "gestational hormone" or progestin, combine to create an attitude that doesn't want to think very long about progesterone's general regulatory functions in the organism.

**CONTEXT:** Why is progesterone's effectiveness in treating cancer often underestimated, and what are the underlying reasons for this suppression of information?

**RAY PEAT:** Synthetic “progestins” have some of the properties of progesterone, and many studies have shown that they can be curative when used against several kinds of cancer. But the prevailing cancer culture has led to their use in combination with cytotoxic chemicals, and/or radiation, rather than with the factors that would really synergize with their “progestational” actions: The factors that would correct the formative, organismic field.

**CONTEXT:** What is the limitation in the use of synthetic progestins for cancer treatment, and what approach would be more synergistic with their actions?

**RAY PEAT:** Since part of progesterone’s therapeutic action is its ability to raise the concentration of carbon dioxide in the tissues, other techniques that increase carbon dioxide should be used at the same time. Thyroid’s action is crucial for the production of carbon dioxide, and for the avoidance of lactic acidosis, adrenalin excess, and other processes that lower carbon dioxide concentration. (And, of course, thyroid is essential for the synthesis of progesterone, and for restraining the synthesis of estrogen, and accelerating its elimination from the body.)

**CONTEXT:** What other therapeutic strategies should be employed alongside progesterone to enhance its cancer-fighting effects, and what is the role of thyroid hormone in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone, thyroid, and carbon dioxide all protect against the cancer-promoting actions of calcium, and they do this by increasing respiratory energy, which favors intracellular magnesium over calcium. Adequate magnesium in the diet is extremely important. It is counterproductive to eat a calcium-deficient diet, since that tends to increase the intracellular calcium at the expense of calcium taken from the bones.

**CONTEXT:** How do progesterone, thyroid, and carbon dioxide protect against cancer-promoting calcium effects, and what is the importance of magnesium and calcium balance?

**RAY PEAT:** The immense power of the pharmaceutical industry, and its controlled government agencies, creates a situation in which the work of people like Lipschutz and Needham is written out of the culture. With the loss of a meaningful context, individuals with an authoritarian inclination will believe that science consists of comparing the latest therapeutic products or technologies with the earlier products or technologies. Some of the newer products and technologies will be sold as “alternative medicine,” by a different branch of industry. But if the newer alternatives still conform to the view of cancer and life that was created to sell the old products, they can never make a real difference.

**CONTEXT:** How does the influence of the pharmaceutical industry and government agencies lead to the suppression of important scientific work, and what is the consequence of losing a meaningful scientific context?
