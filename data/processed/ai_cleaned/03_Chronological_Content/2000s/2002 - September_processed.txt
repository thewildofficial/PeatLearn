**RAY PEAT:** The food and drug industries, and many physicians, are promoting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with double bonds farthest from the acidic end of the molecule. These fats, found in fish, algae, and many vegetables, are the most easily oxidized. With stress, such as premature birth, and with aging, these fats produce free radical decomposition products at a high rate, contributing to "shock lung" and multiple organ failure.

**CONTEXT:** What are the dangers of certain fatty acids?

**RAY PEAT:** After my dissertation on aging and oxygen metabolism, and seeing progesterone's effects, I met a woman disabled with an inflammatory muscle and joint disease. Her emaciated face and arms contrasted with huge hips and thighs, a pattern typical of extreme and prolonged estrogen influence. Her movement problems began at 21 when her physician-father injected her and her mother with estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Can you describe a case that led you to investigate estrogen's effects on oxygen metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** Her physician-father had complex medical studies done. A pulmonary oxygen diffusion test showed her and her mother had oxygen diffusing capacity "95% below normal." I believe this meant they were in the lowest 5% of the population, as another interpretation would be incompatible with life. Around that time, I read a study where a large estrogen dose in mice caused a similarly radical decrease in oxygen diffusing capacity within 40 minutes.

**CONTEXT:** What was the significance of the pulmonary oxygen diffusion test in this case?

**RAY PEAT:** In the late 1960s, I was interested in athletes using a gelatin-oxygen drink for blood oxygenation and performance. Physicians dismissed it, stating blood is always fully oxygenated leaving the lungs. However, a 1968 study showed blood oxygenation declines with aging, often to about 50%. Despite the mouse study, I found no human studies on estrogen's effects on oxygen diffusion, likely due to authoritarianism and a need to absolutize textbook information.

**CONTEXT:** What was your initial research into oxygenation and the resistance you encountered?

**RAY PEAT:** About 15 years later, I visited an 82-year-old friend in Toluca, Mexico. He was breathing heavily, with a purplish face, diagnosed with emphysema. Being very fat, I suspected an estrogen-provoked diffusion problem. I left his daughter progesterone and pregnenolone. Upon my return, his color was better, and his humor had returned. Two weeks after starting the supplements, his color was normal, he was working, and insisted on showing me the city, making me pant at the altitude.

**CONTEXT:** Can you share another experience that reinforced your hypothesis about estrogen and oxygen diffusion?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s, Gilbert Ling found that increased carbon dioxide prevents excitable cells from depolarizing as much as in a normal atmosphere. This principle is used to treat epilepsy with added carbon dioxide and to diagnose it by inducing seizures with hyperventilation, which displaces too much carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide forms carbamino groups with proteins, and increased oxygen pressure displaces carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide affect cellular function?

**RAY PEAT:** The binding of acidic carbon dioxide to proteins shifts electrons, making them more acidic. This alters protein interactions with water, sodium, potassium, and calcium. Under relatively acidic conditions with abundant carbon dioxide, protein electrons are slightly "retracted," inhibiting free radical production and making cells more resistant to radiation or excitatory damage.

**CONTEXT:** What is the biochemical mechanism by which carbon dioxide protects cells?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide, along with carbonic acid, regulates the body's water handling. Its association with cells affects hormone and neurotransmitter regulation. For instance, carbon dioxide causes cells to bind serotonin; a loss of carbon dioxide releases serotonin, increasing blood vessel permeability and fluid leakage.

**CONTEXT:** What are some other effects of carbon dioxide on cellular processes?

**RAY PEAT:** In the lungs, this serum leakage creates a barrier to oxygen diffusion. Hypoxic cells release lactic acid and other inflammatory mediators, and capillary walls thicken, impeding blood circulation. While often overlooked in the brain and heart, these effects are evident in the lungs, leading to waterlogged lungs, increased weight, and a condition called "shock lung" or "wet lung" after stressful death.

**CONTEXT:** How does this fluid leakage in tissues, particularly the lungs, impact oxygen transport?

**RAY PEAT:** The antiexcitatory action of carbon dioxide is opposed by oxygen, making oxygen an excitatory agent in this context. High-pressure oxygen causes seizures, and even at normal pressure, lungs are more susceptible to damage with more oxygen. The lungs' delicate membranes are directly exposed to air, making them vulnerable to excessive carbon dioxide loss in the presence of too much oxygen.

**CONTEXT:** How does oxygen interact with carbon dioxide's effects, and what are the implications for the lungs?

**RAY PEAT:** At high altitudes, after adaptation to lower oxygen pressure, tissues retain more carbon dioxide. This prevents excessive cellular activation, reducing lactic acid production. Carbon dioxide also improves blood circulation, reducing the heart's workload. Even at maximum exertion, the heart relies more on oxygen than glycolysis at high altitudes, unlike sea-level metabolism which is more like cancer metabolism due to the high oxygen/carbon dioxide ratio.

**CONTEXT:** What are the metabolic advantages of higher carbon dioxide levels, as seen at high altitudes?

**RAY PEAT:** Some individuals with respiratory issues at sea level hyperventilate at high altitudes, losing even more carbon dioxide. This can lead to lung and brain edema, and seizures. Lung edema worsens breathing and strains the heart. Supplemental carbon dioxide has repeatedly proven effective in treating altitude sickness. Acetazolamide, the current standard treatment, causes carbon dioxide retention. Despite its success, there's a reluctance to acknowledge that altitude sickness stems from carbon dioxide insufficiency. The same drug is used for sleep apnea, contradicting the notion that it's caused by excess carbon dioxide rather than alkalosis from insufficient carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does altitude sickness relate to carbon dioxide levels, and what are the implications for treatments like acetazolamide?

**RAY PEAT:** Lactic acid indicates metabolic inefficiency. Athletes, especially at sea level, exhibit low efficiency during strenuous exercise. Despite available oxygen, intense glycolysis produces lactic acid, which seems to limit oxygen utilization. High oxygen pressure, by depleting carbon dioxide, likely triggers this less efficient, lactic acid-producing glycolysis.

**CONTEXT:** How does exercise metabolism, particularly at sea level, relate to oxygen and carbon dioxide balance?

**RAY PEAT:** "Hypoxemia of exercise," where blood isn't fully oxygenated during strenuous activity, mirrors the chronic hypoxemia in "respiratory distress syndrome." Women athletes are more prone to exercise hypoxemia than men. In the luteal phase, when progesterone is dominant, women breathe more effectively than in the estrogen-dominated follicular phase. Since estrogen, like exercise, increases capillary leakage, this is understandable. Stress, including exercise or illness, significantly raises estrogen and other inflammatory mediators, even in men.

**CONTEXT:** How does exercise and hormonal balance affect oxygenation, particularly in women?

**RAY PEAT:** Both exercise and estrogen dominance promote the release of fatty acids from tissues. Unsaturated fatty acids increase capillary permeability, and the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids correlates with lung malfunction and respiratory distress. Medium-chain saturated triglycerides from coconut oil can be used intravenously without causing the respiratory distress seen with unsaturated vegetable oils.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of fatty acids in capillary permeability and lung health?

**RAY PEAT:** Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), cause mitochondrial breakdown, thyroid suppression, vascular permeability, brain edema, and increased radiation sensitivity.

**CONTEXT:** What are the specific detrimental effects of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids?

**RAY PEAT:** DHA is the most unstable PUFA. Despite a powerful marketing campaign promoting DHA in baby formula and for adults, claiming we evolved on n-3 rich diets, our tissues have lower n-3 than n-6 fats.

**CONTEXT:** What is the current marketing trend regarding DHA, and what is the scientific reality?

**RAY PEAT:** The low ratio of n-3 fats like DHA to n-6 fats like arachidonic acid is likely because n-3 fats are highly unstable and break down rapidly, producing lipid peroxides, free radicals, and ethane, which can be measured in breath. Stress accelerates this breakdown, increasing ethane levels in respiratory distress, premature babies, and older individuals.

**CONTEXT:** Why is the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids often low in tissues, and what is the implication of their instability?

**RAY PEAT:** Mead Johnson plans to add DHA to baby formula, citing its importance for eye and brain development. However, animals fed DHA-deficient diets are less susceptible to eye damage. More broadly, animals deficient in all "essential fatty acids" are highly resistant to injury, shock, and poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** What is the claim about DHA for infant development, and what is the counter-evidence?

**RAY PEAT:** Since all PUFAs inhibit thyroid function, and thyroid hormone is crucial for brain and lung development, increased PUFA consumption will lead to more hypothyroidism, resulting in premature babies with lung disease. High PUFA concentrations in the lungs, combined with oxygen exposure, create an inflammatory reaction. This likely explains why respiratory distress in prematurity often appears after a few days. Increased DHA use could be an ideal way to increase infant lung disease.

**CONTEXT:** How do polyunsaturated fats and thyroid function interact, and what are the consequences for infant lung development?

**RAY PEAT:** Unsaturated fats and estrogen increase serotonin and nitric oxide (NO) release. NO is produced during inflammation and, like ethane, can be detected in exhaled breath during lung inflammation. NO, as a pro-inflammatory free radical, stimulates PUFA peroxidation. Both NO and serotonin inhibit mitochondrial respiration, shifting metabolism towards glycolysis.

**CONTEXT:** What is the link between unsaturated fats, estrogen, and inflammatory mediators like serotonin and nitric oxide?

**RAY PEAT:** The processes damaging lungs in aging, stress, and prematurity are similar. Examining factors causing premature birth can illuminate the general problem of "lung stress."

**CONTEXT:** How can understanding premature birth help us understand lung stress in general?

**RAY PEAT:** Preeclampsia, or pregnancy-induced hypertension, affects about 10% of pregnancies and is a major cause of maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity.

**CONTEXT:** What is preeclampsia and its significance?

**RAY PEAT:** Thomas Brewer demonstrated 50 years ago that protein deficiency is the primary cause of preeclampsia. Protein deficiency leads to a generalized inflammatory condition with increased serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** What did Thomas Brewer identify as the main cause of preeclampsia?

**RAY PEAT:** Women with preeclampsia have abnormally high levels of serotonin, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key biochemical markers found in women with preeclampsia?

**RAY PEAT:** A study of over 3000 women (Clausen et al., 2001) found a strong association between high sugar and PUFA consumption and preeclampsia. Women with insufficient protein intake often substitute sugar and fat for protein, aligning with Brewer's findings. Crucially, PUFAs, not saturated or monounsaturated fats, were identified as the problem. Eclampsia and preeclampsia are caused by oxidative stress from excessive unstable fats. Increased serotonin and NO are expected outcomes of high PUFA intake, especially with dietary protein deficiency.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors were linked to preeclampsia in a large study, and how do they relate to protein intake?

**RAY PEAT:** Protein deficiency, like excess PUFAs, causes thyroid deficiency. Thyroid supplementation during gestation accelerates fetal lung maturation and prevents respiratory distress syndrome.

**CONTEXT:** How does protein deficiency and PUFA excess impact thyroid function, and what is the role of thyroid hormone in fetal development?

**RAY PEAT:** Adequate protein and saturated fats during pregnancy prevent many pregnancy and infancy issues. However, since PUFAs are stored in tissues for years and mobilized during stress, consistent correct eating is vital long before pregnancy. Vitamin E requirements remain high for years after excess PUFA intake.

**CONTEXT:** What are the long-term implications of dietary fat choices during pregnancy and beyond?

**RAY PEAT:** The diet that protects the developing fetus also protects adults from various stresses and prevents many severe aging symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** What is the broader implication of the protective diet for pregnancy?

**RAY PEAT:** Supplemental thyroid, pregnenolone, and progesterone can partially compensate for dietary deficiencies by maintaining a better balance between carbon dioxide and lactic acid, and by inhibiting stress mediators like NO, serotonin, and estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** How can certain hormone supplements help mitigate the effects of dietary deficiencies?
