**RAY PEAT:** Girls' thyroid glands usually enlarge during puberty, and in pregnancy it’s entirely normal for the gland to enlarge and to become more active. Eighty years ago, when iodine deficiency was more common in the US and Europe, the idea of a “colloid goiter” was common. In certain regions, many people had enlarged thyroids that contained a large amount of colloid--colloid is the viscous protein (thyroglobulin) solution formed in tiny compartments in the thyroid gland, which can be broken down by “digestive” (proteolytic) enzymes of the cells that have secreted it, forming the thyroid hormones, and allowing them to be released into the blood stream. The hormones are formed as the accumulated protein is broken down; the hormone itself isn’t stored in the gland.

The reason for the enlargement of the gland during puberty and in pregnancy, and during some kinds of stress, is that the colloid is formed faster than it is digested by the thyroid gland and secreted into the blood. If something, such as an excess of estrogen, is blocking the production of the thyroid hormone, the gland is likely to enlarge, because the pituitary secretes more thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) when there is a deficiency of thyroid hormone.

In vitro experiments show that estrogen activates the formation of the colloid, but inhibits its breakdown into the hormones. Progesterone, on the other hand, activates the process of proteolytic digestion and so increases the release of hormones from the gland, decreasing the accumulation of the colloid.

Therefore, when progesterone is deficient or estrogen is present in excess, the colloid tends to accumulate (even to the point of causing a visible enlargement of the gland, a “colloid goiter”), at the same time that the person may be hypothyroid, because the hormone isn’t being released from the stored colloid, into the blood stream. But, largely because no one wants to suggest that estrogen can be pathogenic, an enlarged thyroid gland is now likely to be diagnosed as “Hashimoto’s thyroiditis” (or Hashimoto’s struma, or goiter, or disease).

Hashimoto's disease is clearly defined as the infiltration of the gland with lymphocytes, “causing destruction” of the gland’s active tissue and leading to hypothyroidism. The only way to know that the gland is being invaded by large numbers of lymphocytes is by biopsy, but the condition is normally diagnosed by pure guesswork, without any biopsy. Sometimes “antithyroid antibodies” found in the blood are used to diagnose Hashimoto’s disease, but the presence of those antibodies in the blood doesn’t mean that they originated in the thyroid gland, and even though they have very specific names (e.g., “antithyroglobulin,” “antithyroperoxidase”) related to the thyroid gland, they aren’t even specific for the thyroid gland. It has been suggested that similarities in molecular structure between thyroglobulin and connective tissue proteins could account for the finding of “antithyroid antibodies” more frequently in rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren’s syndrome than in Hashimoto’s disease and Graves’ disease (Ruggeri, et al, 2002).

In the last 60 years, most of estrogen’s toxic effects have been hushed up by the drug industry, and estrogen’s central antirespiratory and antithyroid actions are unknown to most contemporary endocrinologists. But endocrinologists often do know that estrogen causes the thymus gland to atrophy, and that the thymus gland is intimately involved in maintaining normal immune functions.

The degenerating thymus gland undergoes invasion by lymphocytes and the replacement of active tissue by fibrous tissue, under the influence of estrogen or stress. The process of cellular invasion in the thyroid gland probably develops more slowly than that in the thymus, because estrogen’s effect on the thymus is very rapid.

The cells that make up the thymus are extremely varied, but a large portion of them are able to phagocytize other cells. This self phagocytosis probably contributes to the gland’s ability to shrink with such great rapidity. When other organs are damaged, the removal of debris can be delayed for days, as phagocytic cells gradually enter the tissues from the blood stream.

Hypothyroidism is an important cause of thymic atrophy, and a thyroid supplement can stimulate regeneration of the thymus.

This correction of the thymic portion of the “immune system” by the thyroid hormone is probably involved in the observation that the “antithyroid” autoantibodies decrease under the influence of supplemental thyroid hormone, but the supplement also affects the thyroid gland, by decreasing the thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH. Excess production of TSH causes an inflammation-like stress, that contributes to the production of the colloid goiter and eventually to disordered structural changes in the thyroid gland. A more efficient production and use of thyroglobulin will decrease the tendency of the over-stimulated gland to produce a defective globulin that is antigenic.

So, rather than ignoring the frequency of the simple colloid goiter and calling everything “Hashimoto’s autoimmune thyroiditis,” if we look at the mechanisms involved in the production of autoantibodies, we will tend to see “thyroiditis” as, usually, the last stage in the development of a simple colloid goiter. The autoantibodies, in a healthy person, are probably part of a corrective repair process, rather than a simply pathogenic factor.

There is an almost obligatory medical genuflection toward “genetic causation” of disease, and especially of thyroid disease, autoimmune disease, and other chronic or degenerative diseases. The fact that thyroid disease and autoimmune diseases are from five to ten times more frequent in women than in men somehow hasn’t increased medical interest in the pathogenic role of estrogen, and it doesn’t prevent platoons of medical researchers from making claims to have discovered “which chromosome carries the disease.”

This medical bias means that even the physicians who recognize that hypothyroidism is a condition that should be corrected are not likely to believe that it is important to modify the treatment according to changes in the patient’s condition. Many doctors assume that a person never recovers from thyroiditis, but the evidence is clear that simply giving supplementary thyroid usually gradually corrects the problem. If other protective measures are taken, recovery will be quicker and more complete. When the diet is optimal, the TSH is likely to be “abnormally low,” below 1.0 on the standard scale, even without use of a thyroid supplement. Keeping the level of TSH low contributes to the reduction of the generalized inflammatory state that characterizes hypothyroidism and autoimmunity. TSH should be considered to be one of the stress-related pro-inflammatory anti-respiratory hormones, along with serotonin, histamine, estrogen, parathyroid hormone, and prolactin.

The diet should be relatively free of antithyroid foods, especially legumes and polyunsaturated fats, and the foods of the cabbage family, such as broccoli, should be well cooked, and used no more often than once a week. The polyunsaturated fats interfere with the thyroid hormone, disturb the thymus and other immune functions, and increase the antigenicity of tissues.

A high protein diet, of about 100 grams of good protein daily, is protective, and protein deficiency is a common cause of hypothyroidism. But too much emphasis on the muscle meats, including fish fillets, chicken breast or legs, and the usual steaks and chops, can be antithyroid by providing too much tryptophan. That can be offset by using gelatin liberally (chicken soup and ox-tail soup contain lots of gelatin from the bones and connective tissues), because gelatin contains no tryptophan. Whey, which is sold as a protein supplement, and egg whites contain too much tryptophan, and can be antithyroid if used excessively.

Using large amounts of seaweed can cause hypothyroidism and can injure the thyroid cells, contributing to thyroiditis. Seaweed and other iodine-containing food supplements are often sold to improve thyroid function, but they usually have the opposite effect. An iodine deficiency used to cause goiters in some regions, but in the last 50 years most people in the US and Europe have been getting an excessive amount of iodine.

**CONTEXT:** What are the current trends in TSH reference ranges and what is the optimal TSH level for feeling well?
**RAY PEAT:** “We can recall when a TSH of 7.0 or below was considered normal. Years later, the TSH cutoff was 6.4, meaning that anything below that level was considered normal. Still later, the cutoff was moved to 5.5. Now, some labs are reporting a level of 4.2 as being the cutoff level, above which the patient may be hypothyroid.” “‘...at our clinic, a TSH over 3 is considered suspicious...” (p. 75)

“Some doctors prefer the lower limit of a corrected TSH to be 1.0. Others are comfortable with a TSH of 0.5. Some thyroid specialists at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco like to see the corrected level around 0.2. (slightly below the normal range of 0.4-5.0}. That figure is generally considered by many nonuniversity doctors to be too low, suggesting to them that the patient is on too much thyroid medication.

“At our clinic, we have patients who do not feel well until they take enough medication to lower their TSH level to 0.1.” (Page 79) R.L. Shames and K.H. Shames, Thyroid Power, 2001.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of endotoxins and intestinal bacteria in autoimmune problems, and how can this be addressed?
**RAY PEAT:** Endotoxin or other material absorbed from intestinal bacteria contributes to a variety of autoimmune problems, including thyroiditis (Penhale and Young, 1988). Combining an indigestible fiber, such as raw carrot, with mild germicides, such as vinegar and coconut oil, can improve the hormonal environment, while reducing the immunological burden.

These results suggest that excessive consumption of iodine in the United States may be responsible for the increased incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis.”

In the CBA, 12 of 20 (60%) goitrous children and 0 of 12 (0% P less than 0.05) healthy children were positive for TGI.” “We conclude that endemic iodine goitre is not associated with Hashimoto's lymphocytic thyroiditis. Nevertheless, autoimmune growth factors such as TGI may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of thyroid growth in this condition.”

Screening for thyroid dysfunction in adults residing in Hokkaido Japan: in relation to urinary iodide concentration and thyroid autoantibodies [Article in Japanese] Konno N, Itzuka N, Kawasaki K, Taguchi H, Miura K, Taguchi S, Murakami S, Hagiwara K, Noda Y, Ukawa S. “The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and its relation to thyroid autoantibodies (TAA) and urinary iodide concentration (UI) was studied in apparently healthy adults in Sapporo (n = 4110) (Sapporo group), and in five coastal areas of Hokkaido (n = 1061) (coastal group) which produce iodine-rich seaweed (kelp). The frequency of above normal UI (high UI in the morning urinary samples of coastal group was 10.8%, significantly higher than that of Sapporo group (6.4%) (p < 0.001). Frequency of positive TAA in both groups were similar. In Sapporo group TAA was positive in 6.4% of males and 13.8% of females with an age-related increase.” The overall prevalence of hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.15 mU/L) in coastal group (0.6%) was similar to that in Sapporo group (1.1%), while that of hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.0 mU/L) in coastal group (3.8%) was significantly higher than that in Sapporo group (1.3%) (P < 0.001). The frequency of high UI correlated significantly with that of hypothyroidism with negative TAA (r = 0.829, P < 0.05), but not with positive TAA, or with that of hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism was more prevalent in TAA negative subjects with high UI than with normal UI. Moreover, serum TSH and thyroglobulin levels were higher and free T4 level was lower in former than in latter group. “These results indicate that 1) the prevalence of TAA negative hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient areas may be associated with the amount of iodine ingested, 2) this hypothyroidism is more prevalent and marked in subjects consuming further excess amounts of iodine, and 3) excessive intake of iodine should be considered an etiology of hypothyroidism in addition to chronic thyroiditis in these areas.”

Schmitt TL, Steiner E, Klingler P, Lassmann H, Grubeck-Loebenstein B. “In view of the known association between familial AD and thyroid autoimmune disease, the expression pattern and cellular processing of APP in human thyroid cells were investigated.” “The results of these studies demonstrated that APP isoforms 770 and 751 were expressed in fresh thyroid extracts as well as in cultured thyroid epithelial cells, with APP 770 being the predominant form. Compared to other types of cells, such as lymphocytes and fibroblasts, thyroid epithelial cells produced larger amounts of APP.” “Interestingly, thyroid epithelial cells also contained larger C-terminal APP fragments of 21, 35, and 41 kDa From the sizes of these fragments it could be deduced that they contained the entire amyloid beta sequence and were thus potentially amyloidogenic. The 41-kDa fragment was unique to thyroid cells. These fragments may be released into the circulation after thyroid cell damage. Increased/altered thyroid APP expression in familial AD may induce alterations in thyroid epithelial cells and cell damage, and thus explain the frequent occurrence of thyroid autoimmunity in this disease.”

**RAY PEAT:** Injury to the thyroid apparently precedes the development of “autoimmune thyroiditis.” There is evidence that tissue injury precedes the appearance of “autoantibodies” in other conditions, too.

Many people with metabolic problems, including hypothyroidism, are being told that they have ‘“‘a genetic disease.” This belief encourages both physicians and their customers to commit themselves to inappropriate treatments, and to misinterpret the results of tests.

Eating seaweed or other foods or supplements containing iodine can cause both hypothyroidism and thyroiditis. The iodate sometimes used as an oxidizing agent in breads have probably contributed to thyroid disease in the industrialized countries.

Dental x-rays, which can cause cancer of the thyroid, brain, and eye, certainly have increased the incidence of thyroiditis and hypothyroidism. The radioactive isotopes that are often foolishly used for supposedly “diagnostic” purposes probably contribute to the incidence and severity of hypothyroidism and thyroiditis.

Besides iodine, radioactive isotopes, and x-rays, other environmental toxins, including mercury and dioxins can cause thyroiditis, but diet and estrogens are probably the causes of most thyroid problems.

A generalized inflammatory state, rather than specific “autoimmunity,” is responsible for thyroiditis and other “autoimmune degenerative” diseases.

A “respiratory defect” is behind the inflammatory condition.

Correcting a thyroid deficiency tends to gradually normalize the antibodies.

Other thyroid disorders found in the BC group included 2 cases of Graves’ disease, 2 of thyroid carcinoma, and 1 of subacute thyroiditis, whereas in the control group only 1 case of Graves’ disease and none of the other disorders were found. Mean free T3, free T4, and TSH concentrations showed no difference between BC patients and controls. The prevalence of thyroperoxidase antibody was higher in BC patients than in controls (23.5% vs. 8%; P < 0.005), whereas the prevalence of thyroglobulin antibody was not different. In BC patients the presence of thyroid antibodies was more frequently associated with clinically detectable autoimmune thyroiditis (14 of 26, 51.8%; p = 0.03) and was more common in the younger group.” “In conclusion, 1) the present study provides evidence that the overall prevalence of thyroid disorders is increased in patients with breast cancer, and 2) thyroid autoimmune disorders, especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis, account to a large extent for the increased prevalence of thyroid disease in patients with breast cancer.”

We have found that fatigue, regardless of the underlying disease, is primarily associated with hypersensitivity to inorganic mercury and nickel. The lymphocyte stimulation by other metals was similar in fatigued and control groups. To evaluate clinical relevance of positive in vitro findings, the replacement of amalgam with metal-free restorations was performed in some of the patients. At a six-month follow-up, patients reported considerably alleviated fatigue and disappearance of many symptoms previously encountered; in parallel, lymphocyte responses to metals decreased as well. We suggest that metal-driven inflammation may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and indirectly trigger psychosomatic multisymptoms characterizing chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and other diseases of unknown etiology.

Serum concentrations of autoantibodies against glomerular basement membrane (GBM), collagen IV, and laminin were significantly higher in females 2-4 weeks after induction.” “These findings indicate that: (i) in this model of lupus nephritis, susceptibility to glomerulonephritis is strongly influenced by sex-related genes; and (i) among the variety of autoantibodies occurring in this model of SLE, both anti-GBM and anti-RTE autoantibodies play a key role in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis.”

Wilder RL. “Hormones, particularly those involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal and -adrenal axes (HPG and HPA), play important roles in various animal models of autoimmunity such as systemic lupus erythematosus in mice and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and rats, and the streptococcal cell wall, adjuvant and avridine arthritis models in rats. Intimately linked to the subject of hormones and autoimmunity are gender, sex chromosomes and age.” “Oestrogens stimulate higher corticosteroid responses in females. The animal model data have major implications for understanding autoimmunity in humans. In particular, adrenal and gonadal hormone deficiency is likely to facilitate T-cell dependent diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, while high oestrogen levels or effects, relative to testosterone, are likely to promote B-cell dependent immune-complex-mediated diseases such as lupus nephritis.”

Gartner R, Gasnier BC, Dietrich JW, Krebs B, Angstwurm MW. “In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases.” “We conclude that selenium substitution may improve the inflammatory activity in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, especially in those with high activity.”

Christie JE, Whalley LJ, Bennie J, Dick H, Blackburn IM, Blackwood DH, Fink G. “A systematic endocrine investigation in dementia, depression and control subjects showed that plasma growth hormone (GH) was higher in the morning and plasma TSH concentrations were higher throughout the day in Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) than in age-matched depressed patients (MDD), and plasma TSH concentrations were also higher throughout the day in female ATD compared with age-matched female control subjects. The increased plasma TSH concentrations could not be due to reduced negative feedback because plasma T3, T4 and rT3 were in the normal range.”

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of iodine in endemic goiter and Hashimoto's thyroiditis?
**RAY PEAT:** Clin Endocrinol (Oxf) 1989 Oct;31(4):453-65. Thyroid autoimmunity in endemic goitre caused by excessive iodine intake. Boyages SC, Bloot AM, Maberly GF. Eastman CJ, Li M, Qian QD, Liu DR, van der Gaag RD. Drexhage HA. “By interacting with the immune system, iodine excess may trigger the development of autoimmune thyroid disease such as lymphocytic Hashimoto's thyroiditis (LT).” “Affinity chromatographically purified IgG was tested for thyroid growth-stimulating activity (TGI) by two different methods....” “Thyroid growth-stimulating immunoglobulins (TGI) were the major autoantibodies found in children with goitres caused by iodine excess. In the CBA, 12 of 20 (60%) goitrous children and 0 of 12 (0% P less than 0.05) healthy children were positive for TGI.” “We conclude that endemic iodine goitre is not associated with Hashimoto's lymphocytic thyroiditis. Nevertheless, autoimmune growth factors such as TGI may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of thyroid growth in this condition.”

Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi 1994 May;69(3):614-26. Screening for thyroid dysfunction in adults residing in Hokkaido Japan: in relation to urinary iodide concentration and thyroid autoantibodies [Article in Japanese] Konno N, Itzuka N, Kawasaki K, Taguchi H, Miura K, Taguchi S, Murakami S, Hagiwara K, Noda Y, Ukawa S. “The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and its relation to thyroid autoantibodies (TAA) and urinary iodide concentration (UI) was studied in apparently healthy adults in Sapporo (n = 4110) (Sapporo group), and in five coastal areas of Hokkaido (n = 1061) (coastal group) which produce iodine-rich seaweed (kelp). The frequency of above normal UI (high UI in the morning urinary samples of coastal group was 10.8%, significantly higher than that of Sapporo group (6.4%) (p < 0.001). Frequency of positive TAA in both groups were similar. In Sapporo group TAA was positive in 6.4% of males and 13.8% of females with an age-related increase.” The overall prevalence of hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.15 mU/L) in coastal group (0.6%) was similar to that in Sapporo group (1.1%), while that of hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.0 mU/L) in coastal group (3.8%) was significantly higher than that in Sapporo group (1.3%) (P < 0.001). The frequency of high UI correlated significantly with that of hypothyroidism with negative TAA (r = 0.829, P < 0.05), but not with positive TAA, or with that of hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism was more prevalent in TAA negative subjects with high UI than with normal UI. Moreover, serum TSH and thyroglobulin levels were higher and free T4 level was lower in former than in latter group. “These results indicate that 1) the prevalence of TAA negative hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient areas may be associated with the amount of iodine ingested, 2) this hypothyroidism is more prevalent and marked in subjects consuming further excess amounts of iodine, and 3) excessive intake of iodine should be considered an etiology of hypothyroidism in addition to chronic thyroiditis in these areas.”

Thyroid epithelial cells produce large amounts of the Alzheimer beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and generate potentially amyloidogenic APP fragments. Schmitt TL, Steiner E, Klingler P, Lassmann H, Grubeck-Loebenstein B. “In view of the known association between familial AD and thyroid autoimmune disease, the expression pattern and cellular processing of APP in human thyroid cells were investigated.” “The results of these studies demonstrated that APP isoforms 770 and 751 were expressed in fresh thyroid extracts as well as in cultured thyroid epithelial cells, with APP 770 being the predominant form. Compared to other types of cells, such as lymphocytes and fibroblasts, thyroid epithelial cells produced larger amounts of APP.” “Interestingly, thyroid epithelial cells also contained larger C-terminal APP fragments of 21, 35, and 41 kDa From the sizes of these fragments it could be deduced that they contained the entire amyloid beta sequence and were thus potentially amyloidogenic. The 41-kDa fragment was unique to thyroid cells. These fragments may be released into the circulation after thyroid cell damage. Increased/altered thyroid APP expression in familial AD may induce alterations in thyroid epithelial cells and cell damage, and thus explain the frequent occurrence of thyroid autoimmunity in this disease.”

Schmitt TL, Steiner E, Klingler P, Lassmann H, Grubeck-Loebenstein B. “In view of the known association between familial AD and thyroid autoimmune disease, the expression pattern and cellular processing of APP in human thyroid cells were investigated.” “The results of these studies demonstrated that APP isoforms 770 and 751 were expressed in fresh thyroid extracts as well as in cultured thyroid epithelial cells, with APP 770 being the predominant form. Compared to other types of cells, such as lymphocytes and fibroblasts, thyroid epithelial cells produced larger amounts of APP.” “Interestingly, thyroid epithelial cells also contained larger C-terminal APP fragments of 21, 35, and 41 kDa From the sizes of these fragments it could be deduced that they contained the entire amyloid beta sequence and were thus potentially amyloidogenic. The 41-kDa fragment was unique to thyroid cells. These fragments may be released into the circulation after thyroid cell damage. Increased/altered thyroid APP expression in familial AD may induce alterations in thyroid epithelial cells and cell damage, and thus explain the frequent occurrence of thyroid autoimmunity in this disease.”

Correlation between levels of antimicrosomal antibodies and radiation dose obtained from incorporated radioactive iodine was not estimated.”
