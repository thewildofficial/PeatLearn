**RAY PEAT:** "I think comparing the doctor-patient relationship with the teacher-student relationship can be useful, and it might suggest ways that both of them could be made more productive, with implications for the nature of learning and knowing."

**CONTEXT:** The author is drawing a parallel between the doctor-patient and teacher-student dynamics to explore more productive learning and knowing.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I taught English composition, instructors were told that they must grade according to a standard scoring system for errors of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and diction. Our success was seen in terms of the number of freshmen who had dropped out by the end of the year, as evidence that the department had “high standards.” Knowing that system, most students chose to write in the style of the first grade “See Spot run” readers, hoping that they could handle the mechanics of writing if they reduced the complexity and content of their essays. It didn’t work, and they didn’t improve during the weeks when their mistakes were being brought painfully to their attention. Since I hated reading their meaningless efforts, I told them that I was going to grade them on content, rather than punctuation and spelling, and that they should try to write about something that was important to them. Only their success in communicating something would be graded. Their papers became more readable, and the interesting thing was that the mechanical things improved immediately. (The intention to communicate something is the real source of structure in language.) I had another teacher score some of their compositions, and he confirmed that they had improved according to the department’s ấy. The attempt to steer a person can make it hard for them to move, because it inactivates their own guidance system."

**CONTEXT:** The author is describing a personal experience teaching English composition, contrasting a rigid, error-focused grading system with a content-focused approach that led to improved writing and mechanics. This illustrates how focusing on the intention to communicate fosters structure and improvement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Professors of medicine see themselves as models of the authority that their students will need to apply in dealing with patients, and the physicians trained in the authoritarian style are likely to see their patients as recipients of their medical knowledge, rather than as occasions for listening and learning something new."

**CONTEXT:** The author is critiquing the authoritarian model in medical education, where physicians are trained to be authorities rather than active listeners and learners from their patients.

**RAY PEAT:** "Students entering these disciplines must expect to be disciplined. This means that they learn not to ask silly questions about the fundamental assumptions of their profession. Their common sense of meaning, their original guidance system, must be inactivated to keep them from asking questions such as “is that a disease or a theory?” Some patients find that their physician has little patience for their questions, but most patients don’t want to ask questions, because they have been taught to respect the authorities."

**CONTEXT:** The author is explaining how disciplinary training in certain professions can suppress critical questioning and independent thought, leading to a passive acceptance of established assumptions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Our nervous systems are made up of physiology and culture. That can be a philosophical problem, because our experience is governed by our composition. In people like Heraclitus, physiology was in the foreground, and in people like Plato, culture was in the foreground. (Heraclitus understood that things are always becoming, Plato believed that change wasn’t real.) To change someone’s mind, it’s necessary to change the way they experience themselves and the world, and that requires changing their substance."

**CONTEXT:** The author is discussing the interplay of physiology and culture in shaping experience and the challenge of changing one's mind, which requires altering underlying substance.

**RAY PEAT:** "The terms “conditioned reflex” and “conditioning” were introduced into psychology by the behaviorist J. B. Watson, who mistranslated and misrepresented Pavlov’s ideas, and who insisted that the ideas of consciousness, volition, and self should be eliminated from the science of psychology."

**CONTEXT:** The author is highlighting the misrepresentation of Pavlov's work by Watson, particularly regarding the exclusion of consciousness and volition from psychology.

**RAY PEAT:** "The orienting reflex, the alertness provoked by something new, was described by Sechenov in 1863, and explored by Pavlov (who also called it the “what is that? reflex” and the “exploration reflex”) who considered it to be our most basic and most powerful reflex. The fact that novelty powerfully arouses our exploratory systems means that we have a mental image of our familiar environment, and that a change in that environment requires us to investigate the properties of the new thing, to see whether it can be explained by the things we already know, or whether it requires us to change our basic ideas about our place in our surroundings. For Pavlov, the study of psychology or physiology without consciousness was simply crazy."

**CONTEXT:** The author is explaining Pavlov's concept of the orienting reflex as a fundamental exploratory mechanism that drives learning and adaptation by prompting investigation of novelty.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov said that he studied nutrition to understand consciousness and the nervous system, because eating is our closest interaction with the world. Our brain is part of our digestive system. But eating has become highly institutionalized and influenced by our cultural beliefs. If people begin to think about the meanings of eating, they are beginning a process of cultural and philosophical criticism."

**CONTEXT:** The author is referencing Pavlov's view that nutrition is key to understanding consciousness and the nervous system, emphasizing the profound connection between eating and our interaction with the world, and how critical thought about eating can lead to broader cultural critique.

**RAY PEAT:** "Helping people with physical problems (such as obesity, headaches or joint or nerve pain, or named diseases) and helping people who want to understand something about the world beyond themselves, are structurally similar, but in the issues of health the questions and the potential answers are more clearly present and immediate."

**CONTEXT:** The author is drawing a structural similarity between helping individuals with physical health issues and those seeking broader understanding, noting that health problems offer more immediate and tangible questions and answers.

**RAY PEAT:** "A goal-directed system is one that senses its actions and makes adaptations so that its actions can be refined to achieve a purpose. Between 1932 and 1935, a student and colleague of Pavlov’s, P.K. Anokhin, developed this idea of self-regulating systems, and originated the concept of feedback, in describing the ways organisms guide themselves and their adaptations. Building on Pavlov’s work, and investigating the origins of innate reflexes, he found principles that would explain the origin of organs and their functions, and that would also apply to the interactions between individuals. The functional system on any level, in embryology, psychology, or society, is a sequence of interactions with a useful result. Movement towards a goal is adaptive, and the system is shaped by the adaptations it makes in moving toward the goal. Resources are mobilized to meet needs, changing the system as it moves towards its goal."

**CONTEXT:** The author is explaining the concept of goal-directed, self-regulating systems, crediting P.K. Anokhin with developing this idea and the concept of feedback, emphasizing how organisms adapt and mobilize resources to achieve a purpose.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since there is always novelty in the real world as contexts change, the exploratory function is causing us to continually revise our understanding. Every question forms a functional system, and our brain adapts as we find answers."

**CONTEXT:** The author is highlighting the role of the exploratory function, driven by novelty, in continuously updating our understanding and how the brain adapts by forming functional systems in response to questions and answers.

**RAY PEAT:** "The “field” idea in biology (wholes shaping themselves) can be understood by considering its opposite, the belief that cells are guided by their genes (producing a mosaic of parts). That idea, in its extreme form, claimed that cells contained an internal map and an internal clock telling them when and where to move and how to change their form and function as they matured and aged. In reality, cells communicate with surrounding cells and with the material between cells. The existence of long-range ordering processes between atoms, molecules, and cells threatened some of the central dogmas of the sciences."

**CONTEXT:** The author is contrasting the "field" idea in biology, where wholes shape themselves, with the gene-centric view of cells as guided by internal maps and clocks, asserting that cells actually communicate and that long-range ordering processes challenge established scientific dogmas.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although Norbert Wiener popularized some aspects of the “teleological” approach to regulatory systems in the 1950s, and saw analogies between the teleological machines and the way the brain functions in Parkinson’s disease, by 1950 the digital approach to information processing, storage, and transmission was displacing analog devices in computation and engineering, and was compatible with theories of intelligence, such as neo-Kantianism, that believed that human intelligence can be defined precisely, in terms of discrete rules and operations. Field thinking in embryology, cancer theory, psychology, and other sciences effectively disappeared--or “was disappeared,” for ideological reasons."

**CONTEXT:** The author is explaining how the rise of digital information processing and neo-Kantian theories of intelligence led to the decline of "field thinking" in various scientific disciplines, attributing this shift partly to ideological reasons.

**RAY PEAT:** "Wiener’s goal-directed machines, like Anokhin’s functional systems, worked in space and time, and the idea of steering or guidance assumes a context of time and space in which the adjustments or adaptations are made. Analog computers and control systems in various ways involved formal parallels with reality. The components of the system, like reality, occupied space and time. Digital computers, with their different history and functions, for example their use for creating or breaking military codes, didn’t intrinsically model reality in any way. Information had to be encoded and processed by systems of definitions. A sequence of binary digits has meaning only in terms of someone’s arbitrary definitions."

**CONTEXT:** The author is contrasting analog and digital computing, highlighting how analog systems, like Anokhin's functional systems, inherently model reality by operating in space and time, while digital systems rely on arbitrary definitions and do not intrinsically model reality.

**RAY PEAT:** "Parallel with the development of electronic digital computing machines, binary digital theories of brain function were being developed, by people who subscribed to views of knowledge very different from those of Anokhin and Wiener. (Anokhin argued against the idea that nerves use a simple binary code.) These computer models of intelligence justify educational practices based on authoritative knowledge and conditioned (arbitrary) reflexes. Neo-Kantianism has been the dominant academic philosophy in the U.S., turning philosophy into epistemology to exclude ontology. "Operationism" and logical positivism share with neo-Kantianism its elimination of ontology (concern with being itself)."

**CONTEXT:** The author is linking the development of digital computing models of brain function to educational practices based on authoritative knowledge and conditioned reflexes, and critiquing neo-Kantianism, operationism, and logical positivism for their exclusion of ontology.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1960s, Ludwig von Bertalanffy developed a theory of systems, defining a system as an “arrayed multitude of inter-linked elements.” Although it was intended as a description of biological systems, it reduced the teleological factors, needs and goals, to a kind of mechanical inner program, such as “regulatory genes.” “Following old modes of thought, some called this orderliness of life ‘purposiveness’ and sought for the ‘purpose’ of an organ or function. However, in the concept of a ‘purpose’ a desiring or intending of the goal always appeared to be involved--the type of idea to which the natural scientist is justly unsympathetic” (von Bertalanffy)."

**CONTEXT:** The author is discussing Ludwig von Bertalanffy's systems theory, noting its reduction of teleological factors to mechanical programs and the inherent difficulty in discussing "purpose" within a strictly scientific framework.

**RAY PEAT:** "His system theory was highly compatible with programmed digital computers, that could define the interactions of “elements,” but unlike Anokhin’s definition of functional systems, it lacked a pattern-forming mechanism. In Anokhin’s view, the system is formed by seeking its goal, and perceiving its progress toward the goal."

**CONTEXT:** The author is contrasting von Bertalanffy's systems theory with Anokhin's, highlighting that while von Bertalanffy's theory aligns with digital computers, it lacks the pattern-forming mechanism inherent in Anokhin's concept of functional systems, which are shaped by goal-seeking and progress perception.

**RAY PEAT:** "Carl Rogers’ approach to person-centered processes recognized that the interacting therapist and client or teacher and student were a formative system, rather than just an occasion for one to inform the other."

**CONTEXT:** The author is referencing Carl Rogers' perspective that the interaction between therapist and client, or teacher and student, constitutes a formative system, rather than a one-way transmission of information.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the Synectics group, they learned to identify the types of deeply involved interaction that would lead to the best inventions. As in Anokhin’s functional systems, resources are mobilized or generated as they are needed. Like Anokhin, they showed that the process of creating something new can be understood and controlled."

**CONTEXT:** The author is discussing the Synectics group's findings on deeply involved interaction leading to inventions, drawing parallels to Anokhin's functional systems where resources are mobilized as needed, demonstrating that creative processes can be understood and controlled.

**RAY PEAT:** "Every meaningful interaction involves formative systems."

**CONTEXT:** The author is stating a fundamental principle that all meaningful interactions are formative systems.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stimulation of sensory nerves can cause cells to move into the stimulated area, causing the organ to grow. Environmental enrichment causes brains to become larger, and to metabolize at a higher rate. All of these processes, from the level of energy production to the birth of new cells and the creation of new patterns in the brain, are called up in the formation of a functional system."

**CONTEXT:** The author is illustrating how sensory stimulation and environmental enrichment can drive cellular growth, increased brain metabolism, and the formation of new neural patterns, all within the framework of a functional system.

**RAY PEAT:** "The studies of organismic coherence by Mae-Wan Ho and Fritz Popp appear to support the idea that even the alignment of molecules in cells is responsive to the state of the entire organism. The reason this seems implausible to most biologists is that cells are commonly still seen as analogous to little test-tubes in which chemical processes occur as the result of random collisions between molecules floating in water. But Sidney Bernhard’s study of glycolysis showed that the reactive sugar molecules are passed individually from one enzyme to the next, in an orderly manner. In this system, the flow of energy, a series of oxidations and reductions changing glucose into other substances, effectively “pulls” the molecules through the system, contributing to order on a molecular level. Function creates structure, which supports function."

**CONTEXT:** The author is citing studies by Mae-Wan Ho and Fritz Popp on organismic coherence, suggesting that molecular alignment in cells is influenced by the organism's state, and contrasting this with the prevailing view of cells as test tubes with random chemical processes. Bernhard's study of glycolysis is presented as evidence of orderly molecular passage driven by energy flow, demonstrating how function creates structure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Self-regulating systems are self-ordering systems. When a person is allowed to function freely as a goal-directed, questioning system, the formation of patterns in the brain will be spontaneous and appropriate, and orderly. Knowing is the ability to hold patterns in awareness. Knowing is not being stored like money; it is a process of self-regulation and learning."

**CONTEXT:** The author is defining self-regulating systems as self-ordering and emphasizing that allowing individuals to function freely as goal-directed, questioning systems leads to spontaneous and orderly pattern formation in the brain. Knowing is presented as an active process of holding patterns in awareness, not passive storage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Korzybski was right in warning about the dangers of letting names become “elements.” This perception led Paolo Freire to emphasize the educational importance of critically giving things their appropriate names, rather than just “banking” the names given by an authority. “To exist, humanly, is to name the world, to change it. Once named, the world in its turn reappears to the namers as a problem and requires of them a new naming. Human beings are not built in silence, but in word, in work, in action-reflection.” “. . . to speak a true word is to transform the world.” “‘Problem-posing’ education, responding to the essence of consciousness--intentionality--rejects communiques and embodies communication” (Freire, 1993)."

**CONTEXT:** The author is referencing Alfred Korzybski's warning about the misuse of language and Paulo Freire's educational philosophy, which emphasizes the power of naming and critical engagement with the world to foster transformation and authentic communication.

**RAY PEAT:** "Having the power to assign names is a source of power and wealth. The pharmaceutical industry has been accused of inventing new diseases to sell new drugs for treating them. Old definitions of cancer are hard to change, when the medical profession has invested so much in treatments--radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy--which conflict with newer biological understanding of cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The author is discussing the power dynamics associated with naming and how this can be exploited, citing the pharmaceutical industry's alleged creation of diseases for profit and the resistance to changing established medical definitions, particularly in cancer treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The person who is learning is critically interacting with both nature and culture, with practical issues and theories."

**CONTEXT:** The author is describing the learning process as a critical engagement with both the natural world and cultural constructs, encompassing practical matters and theoretical frameworks.

**RAY PEAT:** "Applying this to practical problems of health and nutrition, a first step is to begin to think about which things are theories or deductions from theories, which are habits, and which things are felt needs or appetites, and to get in the habit of watching processes or things--such as “signs” and “symptoms”--develop through time. With practice, people can begin to see themselves as functional systems in their main activities, such as eating, and to watch how their needs influence their actions, and what effects different ways of eating have on their other actions, such as sleeping and working. Do appetites govern the timing of meals and the choice of foods? How does the time of day or time of month affect appetites? People often watch for effects of foods, but usually only for a few minutes or hours after eating. Some foods can produce symptoms days after they were eaten, and the activation of the digestive system by a recent meal can cause a reaction to something eaten previously."

**CONTEXT:** The author is providing practical advice for health and nutrition, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between theories, habits, and felt needs, and observing how these influence actions, particularly in relation to eating patterns and their delayed effects on the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "Our traditional cultures, and advertising and schools give us definitions and expectations relating to foods and symptoms and physiology, and they teach us to think of our bodies in terms of an “immune system,” “endocrine system,” “digestive system,” “nervous system,” and “circulatory system,” which are mainly anatomical concepts that are more useful to the drug companies than to the consumer of culture. Both conventional and alternative approaches to medicine and health are likely to let those arbitrary ideas of systems cause them to overlook real, but unnamed, processes."

**CONTEXT:** The author is critiquing how cultural influences, advertising, and education instill rigid, anatomical concepts of bodily systems, which are often more beneficial to pharmaceutical companies than to individuals, leading to the neglect of actual, unnamed physiological processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "When the organism is seen as a mosaic of parts, rather than as a system of developing fields, medical treatments for one part, such as the “circulatory system,” are likely to cause problems in other “systems,” because the “parts” being treated don’t exist as such in the real organism, with the result that the treatments are seldom biologically reasonable."

**CONTEXT:** The author is explaining how viewing the organism as a collection of isolated parts, rather than as interconnected developing fields, leads to medical treatments that often create problems in other systems because the treated "parts" are not discrete entities in reality, rendering the treatments biologically unsound.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides learning to perceive one’s own physiology and becoming aware of the processes of perceiving and Knowing so that they can be improved, it’s important to seek information to expand the interpretive framework, and to look for new contexts and implications. Reading with a critical imagination is as important for science as it is for literature or advertising. Good literature often opens expansive new ways of seeing the world, and good science writing can do that too, but too often scientific publications have ulterior motives, and should be read the way advertising propaganda is read."

**CONTEXT:** The author is advocating for a critical approach to learning and information consumption, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness in perception and knowing, seeking new contexts, and reading scientific literature with a critical imagination, akin to analyzing advertising.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some publications now require authors to state their conflicts of interest (such as receiving money from a drug company while testing a drug) and editors and publishers, who choose which studies will be published, seldom reveal their conflict of interest. As Marcia Angell shows, choices can turn statistical randomness into statistical significance. Private ownership of journals permits control of their content. Besides being aware of the conflict of interest and the frequent insignificance of “statistical significance,” it’s possible to recognize some features of the style of argument which is often used in science propaganda. A deductive style, rather than a descriptive and inductive style is extremely common in technical writing, and it should always lead the reader to question the principle from which deductions are made."

**CONTEXT:** The author is highlighting issues of bias and manipulation in scientific publications, including undisclosed conflicts of interest and the use of deductive reasoning to promote specific agendas, urging readers to critically examine the underlying principles.

**RAY PEAT:** "“Membranes are made from Essential Fatty Acids, therefore those fatty acids are nutritionally essential.” But cells can multiply in a culture medium that provides no fats. In biology, the most popular “principles” are simply dogmatic beliefs about genes and membranes."

**CONTEXT:** The author is critiquing a common biological principle regarding essential fatty acids, pointing out its flawed logic and the prevalence of dogmatic beliefs in biology, particularly concerning genes and membranes.

**RAY PEAT:** "In physics, where testable inferences can be drawn from arbitrary assumptions or doctrines, predictions that may be made based on different assumptions are often ignored for ideological reasons. This ideological quality of physics can permeate the other sciences when they use reductionist explanations."

**CONTEXT:** The author is discussing the ideological influences in physics, where certain assumptions are favored over others despite contradictory evidence, and how this reductionist approach can spread to other sciences.

**RAY PEAT:** "Korzybski felt he was helping humanity to escape “word magic” and to advance to a mathematical view of the world. But the same processes that caused people to “confuse words with things” can cause people to confuse mathematical descriptions with reality."

**CONTEXT:** The author is referencing Korzybski's aim to combat "word magic" but warns that the same tendency can lead to confusing mathematical descriptions with reality itself.

**RAY PEAT:** "“Chaos theory,” which was a faddish excitement about the ability to generate unpredictable output from a simple rule (which could be endlessly repeated by a computer), has been suggested to explain many things in biology, including heart rate variability. It doesn’t. Instead, it has probably had a slightly harmful effect, by distracting attention from real biological pattern-forming processes."

**CONTEXT:** The author is critiquing "chaos theory" as a faddish concept that distracts from genuine biological pattern-forming processes, particularly in explaining phenomena like heart rate variability.

**RAY PEAT:** "Real substance can sometimes be modeled by descriptions of randomness, but substances at all levels have intrinsic pattern-forming tendencies, and context-dependent histories. Water, for example, has structure and structural memory that can affect even simple chemical reactions, and gases have..."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asserting that while randomness can model some aspects of reality, substances inherently possess pattern-forming tendencies and context-dependent histories, using water as an example of a substance with structure and memory.

**RAY PEAT:** "When reading science articles, or listening to lectures, and even while privately thinking about experiences, it can be useful to watch for the improper use of assumptions. Our understanding has been shaped by the assumptions of our culture, and these assumptions present an attitude toward the nature of the world, in some cases even about the ontology that our philosophers have said is beyond our reach. “Evolution is shaped by random mutations,” “nuclear decay is random,” “the universe is expanding,” “entropy only increases,” “DNA controls inheritance,” “membrane pumps keep cells alive,” and all of the negative assumptions that have for so long denied the systematic generation of order."

**CONTEXT:** The author is advising readers to be vigilant for the misuse of assumptions in scientific discourse and personal thought, as these assumptions, often culturally ingrained, shape our perception of reality and can deny the systematic generation of order.

**RAY PEAT:** "Every communicative interaction is an opportunity for the discovery of new meanings and potentials."

**CONTEXT:** The author is stating that all communicative interactions offer the potential for discovering new meanings and possibilities.

**RAY PEAT:** "Aristotelian motto: If the knower and the known form a functional system they are substantially the same."

**CONTEXT:** The author is presenting an Aristotelian principle that when the knower and the known are integrated into a functional system, they are fundamentally alike.
