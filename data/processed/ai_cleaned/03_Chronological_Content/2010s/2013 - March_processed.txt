**RAY PEAT:** Our tissues produce carbon monoxide as a normal part of cell breakdown. All kinds of stress that damage tissues increase its formation. Carbon monoxide increases with aging, and increases stress hormones. The enzyme which produces carbon monoxide is induced by carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide can inhibit the oxidative production of energy, and can increase the rate of non-oxidative, growth supporting energy production. Carbon monoxide can either stimulate tissue growth or cause atrophy, and can either inhibit or exacerbate inflammation, depending on the surrounding conditions. Inhibiting its production or accelerating its removal can have therapeutic effects.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of carbon monoxide in cellular processes and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1970s, the idea that senescence was a genetically "programmed" function was very popular—a newer form of the doctrine of the essential corruptibility of matter, of Freud's death instinct, and of Hayflick's numerical limit of cells’ ability to replicate. W.D. Denckla's version of programmed aging proposed that the pituitary gland was the agent of this programmed aging. He based his idea on the observation that when animals were kept on a semi-starvation diet, starting before puberty, their puberty was delayed and they lived longer than normal, and on later studies that showed that when animals' pituitary glands were removed before puberty, they lived much longer than normal, and all of their tissues and systems aged at a much slower rate. The implication was that if the gland is present and causes aging, its evolutionary purpose is to cause aging, as well as the other processes such as reproduction. The particular function that Denckla focused on as an index of aging was oxygen consumption, which decreases by more than 70% between puberty and old age. He showed that the decrease of oxygen consumption was much less when the pituitary gland was removed, if the animal was given the amount of thyroid hormone that it would normally produce. He found some fairly specific pituitary extracts that decreased oxygen consumption, inhibiting the effects of the thyroid hormone, but he never identified a particular pituitary hormone as the antirespiratory aging hormone, or the mechanisms responsible for the extract's effects.

**CONTEXT:** What was Denckla's theory of programmed aging and the pituitary's role?

**RAY PEAT:** The pituitary's functions are largely directed toward activating glandular tissues, and in doing that it stimulates cell division in the various glands. It's accepted that dividing cells revert to the non-oxidative metabolism, but the mechanism by which the pituitary hormones stimulate cell division isn't generally recognized. The pituitary hormones, ACTH, FSH, LH, TSH, prolactin, growth hormone, POMC and MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone) stimulate the production of carbon monoxide in the cells that they stimulate, by activating the enzyme heme oxygenase. This enzyme degrades the heme molecule, which is released from hemoglobin and other proteins in injured tissues, and which in the free state is toxic (Kumar and Bandyopadhyay, 2005). In degrading heme, this enzyme releases free iron atoms and biliverdin, as well as carbon monoxide. Although free iron atoms can cause harmful oxidation, biliverdin, and the bilirubin that's produced from it, can have beneficial antioxidant effects.

**CONTEXT:** How do pituitary hormones relate to carbon monoxide production and cellular metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** Cells get their energy from the "flow" of electrons from molecules such as sugar and fat, which function as chemical reductants, ultimately to oxygen, which is reduced by them; reduction is the opposite of oxidation, so that's just another way of saying that the fuel molecules are oxidized by oxygen. During cellular stress, such as the release of free heme or free iron, the reducing energy can be misdirected in harmful ways, leading to the cell's death, unless there are molecules, "antioxidants," which can interrupt those processes. Sulfur-containing molecules, in solution (glutathione and other sulfhydryls and disulfides) and sulfur amino acids in the cell's protein structure, are energetically in balance with the flow of energy, from fuel to oxygen, and they act as a buffer or stabilizer of the degree of reduction-oxidation, the redox state. If the sulfur system becomes either too oxidized or too reduced, the cell dies. Molecules such as vitamin E and vitamin C and bilirubin function as protective antioxidants, but they don't interfere with the oxidations of the crucial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. Carbon monoxide has the ability, in certain situations, to function as a protective antioxidant, even while it may be inhibiting the respiratory function, but those situations are very limited. For example, in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen, carbon monoxide protects the lungs from oxygen's otherwise lethal effects, while the high concentration of oxygen protects the respiratory enzyme from complete inhibition by the carbon monoxide. In situations of cell excitation, it can shift the cell's balance toward reduction, by limiting oxidation, creating functional hypoxia. Hypoxia stimulates many cellular reactions, including cell division, in which the cell's structural proteins shift toward a more reduced state of their sulfur atoms. I think it's likely that the antioxidative, antirespiratory, effect of carbon monoxide produced by the enzyme, heme oxygenase, which is activated by the pituitary hormones, is responsible for the activation of cell division in the various glands and other tissues activated by the pituitary.

**CONTEXT:** Explain the role of redox state, antioxidants, and carbon monoxide in cellular energy production and cell division.

**RAY PEAT:** From the 1930s until the early 1960s, there was considerable interest in the factors that activated or inhibited cell division by shifting the redox balance of the cell toward a more reduced state, for example by using cyanide or pure carbon dioxide to inhibit the respiratory enzyme, or by treating the tissue with glutathione (GSH) or other reduced sulfur compounds. Blocking the respiratory enzyme allows the energy of glycolysis to increase the ratio of NADH to NAD, and the NADH can increase the ratio of reduced glutathione, GSH, to the oxidized disulfide, GSSG. In the 1950s, Daniel Mazia and Katsuma Dan demonstrated that as cells prepare to divide, with the formation of the mitotic spindle, there is a sudden increase in the reduced sulfur (sulfhydryl, SH) in the cell, and that cell division could be stopped by interfering with the reduction of the sulfur group. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi and Francis Knock believed that the regulation of the sulfur system was a reasonable approach to controlling cancer. Warburg and Szent-Gyorgyi viewed growth and cell division as the basic condition of life, and that cancer was simply a loss of the ability to redirect energy from growth to organization, for which a more oxidized state of the cell was necessary. By the 1970s, it was widely recognized that cancer had a very effective antioxidant protection against destruction by oxidizing agents. However, in the 1960s, increased interest in the membrane doctrine and DNA research suddenly displaced more traditional types of cell biology and biochemistry. For the membrane doctrine, the material between the genetic substance in the nucleus and the external membrane was a solution of molecules dissolved in water, in which things happened by random diffusion. Learning the Michaelis-Menten equation that describes enzyme actions in a test-tube had the psychological effect of making people assume that random diffusion also governed processes in cells. The coherent chemistry and function of the proteins of the cell, such as could be seen in the mitotic spindle, presented a very different model of the cell. In 1971 the War on Cancer reinforced the molecular genetics approach to understanding cell biology. For the rest of the century, interactions of the environment with cellular metabolism were of little interest except when they affected the genes and the membranes.

**CONTEXT:** What was the historical understanding of cell division regulation and the shift in scientific focus?

**RAY PEAT:** In the last few years there has been a surge of interest in endogenously produced carbon monoxide, probably motivated by the idea that if it's an endogenous substance, it presents opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry. In certain circumstances, its antimetabolic or anti-inflammatory effects can seem protective in ways that could be therapeutically useful, but even those limited benefits have been disputed (Nutter, et al., 1994); the biliverdin and bilirubin produced along with carbon monoxide by heme oxygenase probably account for most of the potentially useful anti-inflammatory effects that have been described. In situations of deadly stress, the ability of increased levels of carbon monoxide to prevent cell death is what makes its involvement in cancer so interesting. The complexity of the balance influenced by carbon monoxide (Wagener, et al., 2003) seems to be routinely ignored.

**CONTEXT:** What is the current interest in endogenous carbon monoxide and its potential therapeutic applications?

**RAY PEAT:** The phosphorylation system gets most of the attention in studying cell regulatory systems, but some systems that are regulated by phosphorylation are also regulated by the cell's redox state. (Other regulatory systems include pH, the hydration potential, osmolarity, ionic strength, and electrical fields.) An important factor in the regulation of cell functions is a complex of proteins called NF-kappaB, which activates processes of immunity, inflammation, and cell survival. Sulfhydryl reduction is involved in its activation. Ethyl alcohol, which tends to shift the redox balance toward increased NADH and GSH, activates NF-kappaB, and this can be protective for cells in some situations (Ward, et al., 1996), but it's this activation that makes alcohol harmful to the liver, contributing to inflammation, fibrosis and cancer. Alcohol's liver toxicity is associated with an increased reductive state, higher NADH/NAD, and its toxicity is prevented by agents such as fructose, which protectively lower the NADH/NAD ratio (Khan and O'Brien, 1995, Niknahad, et al., 1995). The reductive activation of iron is an important factor in the toxicity in this case (Khan and O'Brien, 1995). The fact that fructose can protect against cyanide toxicity (Niknahad, et al., 1994), seems likely to be another illustration of the importance of the redox balance. Increased estrogen can exacerbate liver damage caused by alcohol, by increasing NFkappaB; testosterone has a protective effect, by decreasing NFkappaB (Lee, et al., 2012).

**CONTEXT:** How does the cell's redox state interact with other regulatory systems like NF-kappaB, and what are the implications for alcohol toxicity and hormonal influences?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon monoxide activates NF-kappaB, and this is closely related to the ability of cancer cells to avoid the normal dissolution of greatly stressed cells, i.e., to their "immortalization." Cancer's unique antioxidant capacity and its reluctance to undergo the normal apoptotic dissolution when it's unable to participate constructively in normal tissues could be explained by its increased expression of heme oxygenase and its production of carbon monoxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon monoxide contribute to cancer cell immortality and resistance to apoptosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Several things in the medical culture divert attention from these associations. First, antioxidants tend to be considered as necessarily benign, including the endogenous antioxidants that are produced in response to stress. Second, estrogen has a special status in the medical culture, and estrogen can not only induce NFkappaB and heme oxygenase, but those can also increase the formation of carbon monoxide. There is a historical reluctance to consider that "antioxidants" and estrogen could be intrinsically involved in degenerative processes, including cancer.

**CONTEXT:** What are the cultural and scientific biases that hinder understanding of the role of antioxidants and estrogen in degenerative processes?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon monoxide has the properties ascribed to Denckla's "death hormone," being increased directly by pituitary hormones (and also by the hormones stimulated by the pituitary), and being able to decrease oxygen consumption. It also seems to cause exactly the changes that Warburg investigated in cancer cells, and attributed to a "respiratory defect." Cancer cells might originate among old cells with a very low metabolic and respiratory rate, but as they develop the properties of cancer they may begin to metabolize at a very high rate (though not necessarily). Their "respiratory defect" is that oxygen is no longer able to inhibit glycolysis, allowing them to consume glucose and amino acids at a continuously high rate. Warburg believed that cancerization was an adaptive survival strategy of cells to escape the factors interfering with respiration and leading toward atrophy and death.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon monoxide relate to Denckla's "death hormone" and Warburg's observations on cancer metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** An enzyme that activates glycolysis, PFKFB4, is normally increased by oxygen deprivation and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), but it is also increased by heme oxygenase (Li, et al., 2012). Gluconeogenesis is normally inhibited by heme, which is removed by heme oxygenase. Lactic acid produced by glycolysis activates an enzyme (thioredoxin) that increases cellular sulfhydryl reduction, and increases HIF and also stimulates the formation of new blood vessels by inducing VEGF (Milovanova, et al., 2008), the permeability and growth factor which is essential for the growth of cancer, and which is induced by heme oxygenase. While interfering with the functions of mitochondria, heme oxygenase also stimulates the growth of new mitochondria, along with new blood vessels.

**CONTEXT:** What are the metabolic pathways influenced by heme oxygenase in the context of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and angiogenesis?

**RAY PEAT:** Besides slowing the decrease of oxygen consumption, removing the pituitary gland has also been shown to have beneficial effects on the extracellular material. The presence of the pituitary gland accelerates the aging (thickening, hardening, crosslinking) of collagen in the extracellular matrix, and several factors, including lactic acid and estrogen, contribute to that. Very little effort has been made to investigate the factors involved in extracellular aging, relative to its importance for understanding the aging process and the degenerative diseases. Since oxygen and nutrients reach cells by diffusing through the extracellular matrix, a thickened matrix can contribute to the tissue atrophy from which some cells emerge as cancer cells. Recent studies have confirmed the role of collagen crosslinking in promoting cancer growth and invasiveness (Baker, et al., 2013).

**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of the pituitary gland on the extracellular matrix and its implications for aging and cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Stresses activate adaptive hormones, especially cortisol, by acting on the hypothalamus to increase CRH, corticotropin release hormone, to activate the pituitary to release ACTH, which activates the adrenals. Carbon monoxide is one of the factors, produced by stress, which activates the secretion of CRH (Navarra, et al., 2001). Intense exercise increases the production of carbon monoxide temporarily, but regular activity, like calorie restriction (Morgan, et al., 1999; Usuki, et al., 2004; Kang, et al., 2005; Mahlke, et al., 2011), seems to limit its increase with aging.

**CONTEXT:** How do stress, exercise, and calorie restriction influence carbon monoxide production and hormonal responses?

**RAY PEAT:** The level of heme oxygenase increases with aging (Iijima, et al., 1999; Usuki, et al., 2004; Kang, et al., 2005; Hirose, et al., 2003), reducing the amount of heme available for necessary enzyme functions (Bitar and Shapiro, 1987). The heme synthetic pathway is an energy drain on cells (Atamna, 2004); in breast cancer, for example, which has a high heme oxygenase activity, the heme pathway is 20 times more active than normal (Navone, et al., 1990). Carbon monoxide activates the heme synthetic pathway (by way of erythropoietin), in another potential vicious circle (Cronje, et al., 2004).

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between aging, heme oxygenase, and the heme synthetic pathway?

**RAY PEAT:** The overproduction of heme oxygenase and carbon monoxide in cancer (Al-Owais, et al., 2012) might be dismissed as an effect, rather than a cause, of cancer, except for its role in making cancer cells resistant to natural cell dissolution, apoptosis (Liu, et al., 2004; Banerjee, 2012), chemotherapy (Miyake, et al., 2010), and radiation (Zhang, et al., 2011), and the fact that inhibiting heme oxygenase inhibits cancer growth (Fang, et al., 2012).

**CONTEXT:** Why is the overproduction of heme oxygenase and carbon monoxide in cancer significant beyond being a mere effect?

**RAY PEAT:** Heme oxygenase is induced by all kinds of cancer promoters—viruses (Marinissen, et al., 2006; Martin, et al., 2007), radiation, heavy metals, prostaglandins, estrogen, PUFA, and reactive fragments of fatty acids such as acrolein (a toxic 3-carbon fragment) and HNE (a toxic 9-carbon fragment). Increasing the activity of heme oxygenase can produce harmful effects, and inhibiting its production can, according to animal studies, produce beneficial effects, for example stopping the growth of cancer, or alleviating seizures (Parfenova, et al., 2004) and symptoms related to liver cirrhosis (Carter, et al., 2002; Tieppo, et al., 2009). The products of heme oxygenase can cause DNA damage, meeting the conventional requirement for being considered a carcinogen (Ishikawa, 2010), but more plausible metabolic routes to cancer have been suggested (Polo, et al., 1992).

**CONTEXT:** What are the various factors that induce heme oxygenase, and what are the potential benefits of inhibiting it?

**RAY PEAT:** Many experiments with cells and tissues have demonstrated clearly that light causes carbon monoxide to be released from the respiratory pigment, but there has been little application of this principle to humans. Most of the signs of stress reach their peak in the early morning, following the same diurnal curve as cortisol. In prolonged darkness, great changes in mitochondrial shape and function have been demonstrated. It's likely that at least part of this is caused by carbon monoxide, since its peak formation is in the early morning, and its lowest rate of formation is in the early evening (Levitt, et al., 1994). Blue light and ultraviolet light increase its formation, but orange and red light, which penetrate most deeply into the tissues, can release it from the respiratory pigment.

**CONTEXT:** How does light exposure influence carbon monoxide production and its diurnal rhythm?

**RAY PEAT:** Several things associated with aging involve some specific effects of heme oxygenase, such as incontinence of the anal and urethral sphincters, malfunction of the esophageal sphincter, loss of tone of the bladder (detrusor) muscle, when the enzyme is increased in those muscles, and reduced curiosity, when the enzyme is increased in the brain. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia all involve increased heme oxygenase in the brain, and in Alzheimer's disease the enzyme is associated with amyloid plaques. These conditions involve some degree of edema in the brain, and the inhibition of heme oxygenase has been found to reduce edema following brain injury (Sharma, et al., 2003). Heme oxygenase increases the leakiness of capillaries (by increasing VEGF), and the presence of heme increases the local production of heme oxygenase. Multiple sclerosis is known to involve disturbance of the capillaries in the brain, and increased heme oxygenase. The frequency of microhemorrhages throughout the body increases with age, along with VEGF and heme oxygenase (Cullen, et al., 2005, 2006). It has been suggested that amyloid is produced as a sealant for the brain's capillaries, compensating for the increased leakiness (Atwood, et al., 2003). The amyloid-beta induces a proteolytic enzyme that degrades the extracellular matrix, increasing the risk of larger hemorrhages (Lee, et al., 2003).

**CONTEXT:** What are the specific age-related conditions linked to increased heme oxygenase activity, particularly in the brain and vasculature?

**RAY PEAT:** Caffeine, vitamin E, and niacinamide are known to reduce the activity of heme oxygenase. Sodium bicarbonate taken before strenuous exercise reduces the expression of heme oxygenase (Kirk, et al., 2012) and improves endurance. A severe deficiency of vitamin B1 increases the expression of heme oxygenase. Testosterone can restore a youthful balance between heme and heme oxygenase, increasing heme, decreasing heme oxygenase (Bitar and Weiner, 1983). In newborn animals, D-penicillamine (an amino acid that is fairly safe to use as a heavy metal chelator) has lowered heme oxygenase (Oroszlan, et al., 1983). Apigenin, a chemical in guavas and oranges, with anti-inflammatory effects, inhibits heme oxygenase (Abate, et al., 2005). Avoiding exposure to toxic heavy metals, minimizing dietary polyunsaturated fats, and being in brightly lighted environments as much as possible, will help to avoid unnecessary carbon monoxide formation.

**CONTEXT:** What are practical recommendations for reducing heme oxygenase activity and carbon monoxide formation?
