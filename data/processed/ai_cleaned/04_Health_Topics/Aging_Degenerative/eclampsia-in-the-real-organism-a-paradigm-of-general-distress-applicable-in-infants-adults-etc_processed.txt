**RAY PEAT:** The word eclampsia, in its original sense, meant "shining out," referring to the visual disturbances that often precede seizures. While commonly associated with pregnancy, it could also apply to similar seizures in young children. The professional medical use of "eclampsia" and "preeclampsia" has become overly technical, often obscuring the underlying physiological processes. "Toxemia," meaning poisons in the blood, has been used synonymously with preeclampsia, referring to a syndrome of high blood pressure, albumin in the urine, and edema, sometimes culminating in convulsions. Eclampsia itself is reserved for the convulsions that follow preeclampsia when no other cause is identified.

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical and etymological understanding of the term "eclampsia"?

**RAY PEAT:** Metaphoric thinking, using comparisons and models, is our natural way of understanding. Language and culture evolve through the adoption of insightful comparisons. However, institutions focused on power and control often resist this free development of ideas.

**CONTEXT:** How does Ray Peat view the development of language and understanding in relation to medical terminology?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea that a mother's diet has no influence on her baby's health, a doctrine that persisted even into the late 20th century, is fundamentally flawed. The concept of the "insulated fetus," which would receive sufficient nutrients even if the mother were starving, has been challenged by the recognition that substances like smoking, alcohol, and drugs can harm the fetus. However, a comprehensive understanding of diet's impact on pregnancy physiology is still lacking in medical culture. This is rooted in a simplistic view of causality, where "genes make the organism," and genetic defects in the baby are seen as causing maternal illness. This is demonstrably false.

**CONTEXT:** What is Ray Peat's critique of the prevailing medical understanding of fetal development and maternal health during pregnancy?

**RAY PEAT:** The notion that a baby's cerebral palsy could cause maternal complications and premature labor, a concept still taken seriously over 50 years after Freud's sensible argument to the contrary, highlights a persistent misunderstanding of causality.

**CONTEXT:** How does Ray Peat address the historical misattribution of causality in pregnancy complications?

**RAY PEAT:** Medical literature often lists factors associated with eclampsia, such as young or old maternal age, first or many pregnancies, diabetes, twins, obesity, excessive weight gain, and kidney disease. Some have attributed eclampsia to genetics, citing its familial incidence, but this overlooks the fact that poverty and malnutrition also run in families. The inclusion of obesity and "excessive weight gain" as risk factors distracts from the fundamental role of malnutrition. The medical culture's reduction of "nutritional adequacy" to gross body weight, and the attempt to restrict weight gain, has paradoxically expanded the problem of eclampsia into more affluent populations.

**CONTEXT:** What are the commonly cited risk factors for eclampsia, and how does Ray Peat interpret them?

**RAY PEAT:** John C. W. Lever, in the mid-19th century, observed that most eclamptic women had protein in their urine and described a woman suffering from extreme poverty and malnutrition who delivered a premature, low-weight baby. S. S. Rosenstein and L. A. A. Charpentier documented changes in serum and low serum albumin as causes of eclampsia, respectively. Robert Ross, M.D., further established malnutrition as the cause of proteinuria and eclampsia.

**CONTEXT:** What historical medical observations support the link between malnutrition and eclampsia?

**RAY PEAT:** A chain of causality begins with a diet deficient in protein, which impairs liver function. This leads to an inability to store glycogen, inactivate estrogen and insulin, and activate thyroid hormone. High estrogen and low protein increase blood clotting tendency. Estrogen also hinders the liver's albumin production. Low thyroid function causes sodium loss, leading to tissue edema and decreased blood volume. Hemoconcentration and impaired circulation increase blood pressure. Blood sugar instability, rising cortisol, and viscous blood contribute to seizures. Women who die from eclampsia often show signs of intravascular clotting and prior organ damage.

**CONTEXT:** Can you outline the physiological cascade leading to eclampsia, according to Ray Peat?

**RAY PEAT:** Nutritional deficiencies, particularly B vitamins, can cause liver underactivity and estrogen dominance. Vitamin A deficiency impairs protein utilization and progesterone production, mimicking estrogen's effects. Anything that causes thyroid deficiency exacerbates these problems. Thyroid therapy has shown remarkable success in treating and preventing eclampsia.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond protein deficiency, what other nutritional factors contribute to eclampsia, and what is the role of thyroid?

**RAY PEAT:** Extensive intravascular clotting, if not fatal, can cause localized brain damage, similar to multiple sclerosis, or affect other organs, including the placenta and fetus. Some cases of "post-partum psychosis" may result from multiple strokes. When large clots form in the liver or placenta, fibrinogen consumption can appear faster than production, possibly due to reduced liver blood supply. The undernourished liver can induce seizures through various mechanisms, including clots, hemorrhages, hypoglycemia, and brain edema, suggesting that eclampsia should not be strictly differentiated from other seizure causes.

**CONTEXT:** How does Ray Peat explain the neurological and organ damage associated with eclampsia, and how does it relate to clotting?

**RAY PEAT:** My childhood migraines, characterized by visual disturbances followed by nausea and pain, were often triggered by food or skipped meals, and I noticed a correlation with the premenstrual period, similar to epilepsy. I found that consuming a quart of ice cream could halt the progression of my migraine symptoms, suggesting a link to situations involving similar visual events, such as eclampsia and epilepsy.

**CONTEXT:** What personal experiences led Ray Peat to investigate the connection between visual disturbances and metabolic issues?

**RAY PEAT:** A pregnant woman experiencing sudden blindness, a symptom I recognized from my migraines, was advised to eat fruit. Her vision returned shortly after, demonstrating the critical role of glucose, especially for a fetus in its sixth month. This experience reinforced the idea that metabolic support, particularly glucose, can alleviate such symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** Can you provide an example of how metabolic intervention helped alleviate symptoms related to eclampsia?

**RAY PEAT:** "Morning sickness" in early pregnancy, often dismissed as unrelated to eclampsia due to the fetus's small size, can be effectively treated with salty carbohydrates like soda crackers. This remedy also helps with premenstrual nausea, which, like migraine nausea, is eased by salt and carbohydrate. Spasms in the small intestine, associated with estrogen-induced nausea, have been observed in X-ray studies.

**CONTEXT:** How does Ray Peat connect "morning sickness" and premenstrual symptoms to metabolic imbalances?

**RAY PEAT:** Hypoglycemia is a significant consequence of liver malfunction. Consuming orange juice, Coca-Cola, or ice cream can provide substantial relief. Sodium aids sugar absorption and is crucial for restoring blood volume. The World Health Organization recommends Pepsi for rehydrating infants with diarrhea, where hypovolemia is also a concern.

**CONTEXT:** What are the immediate metabolic interventions for hypoglycemia and hypovolemia?

**RAY PEAT:** Refeeding starving individuals shares similarities with correcting liver malfunction and hormone imbalances from prolonged malnutrition. High-quality protein sources like egg yolk, potato juice, milk, or meat are important. Supplementation with thyroid containing T3 is often necessary. Intravenous albumin, hypertonic glucose and sodium solutions, and magnesium are beneficial. Triiodothyronine directly promotes cellular magnesium absorption. Hypertonic glucose with minerals reduces protein breakdown during stress.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key nutritional and therapeutic strategies for addressing severe malnutrition and its metabolic consequences?

**RAY PEAT:** Katherina Dalton observed that women with PMS, who benefited from progesterone, were prone to "toxemia" during pregnancy and menopausal issues. These women often experienced continued menstruation during early pregnancy, indicating estrogen dominance, which increases miscarriage risk. Progesterone treatment during pregnancy not only resolved toxemia signs but also resulted in healthier, brighter babies with significantly higher IQs compared to those from "toxemic" pregnancies.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between PMS, progesterone, and pregnancy outcomes, according to Katherina Dalton's observations?

**RAY PEAT:** Marian Diamond's research on rats demonstrated that increased estrogen exposure during pregnancy reduced cerebral cortex size and learning ability, while progesterone enhanced brain size and intelligence. Zamenhof's studies suggest these hormonal effects are largely mediated through glucose metabolism and oxygen availability.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen and progesterone influence brain development and intelligence, based on animal studies?

**RAY PEAT:** If women with "toxemic" pregnancies had babies with IQs averaging 130 instead of the typical 85, the societal impact of proper prenatal care would be immense. Healthy gestation also influences character strength, reasoning ability, and the absence of physical defects, all strongly correlated with birth weight.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential long-term cognitive and developmental benefits of optimal prenatal nutrition?

**RAY PEAT:** Government data indicates that up to half of all underweight babies have an IQ below 70, and 75% of individuals disabled before age 18 have neurological abnormalities, often linked to low birth weight. Studies show abstract verbal reasoning and perceptual-motor integration are more closely related to birth weight than IQ. Prenatal malnutrition "substantially compromises" the development of at least a million babies annually in the U.S., with miscarriages also linked to poor nutrition.

**CONTEXT:** What statistical evidence supports the link between prenatal nutrition, birth weight, and long-term developmental outcomes?

**RAY PEAT:** Muscle fatigue leads to swelling, sodium and water uptake, and soreness. Energy depletion causes cells to absorb water and sodium while losing potassium. An excess of potassium in the blood, especially with low sodium, disrupts nerve, muscle, and secretory cell function, potentially causing cardiac arrest. Cellular energy depletion can result from exertion, insufficient food or oxygen, or hormonal deficiencies. Sudden cell swelling decreases blood volume and increases viscosity.

**CONTEXT:** How does cellular energy depletion and electrolyte imbalance contribute to physiological stress?

**RAY PEAT:** During the night, stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol increase blood viscosity and clotting tendency. In rats, serum protein concentration rises significantly overnight, likely due to water moving out of circulation. Even moderate stress can deplete the body's regulatory capacity, leading to hypovolemia and shock in cases of extreme tissue damage or blood loss.

**CONTEXT:** How do stress hormones and fluid shifts affect blood viscosity and volume?

**RAY PEAT:** C. A. Crenshaw's work on traumatic shock revealed that death from hemorrhagic shock is primarily due to the body's depletion of internal salt water into cells. During shock, reduced blood circulation leads to oxygen deprivation and waste buildup in cells. When fluids are reintroduced, this waste is released into the bloodstream, increasing acidity and potentially causing cardiac arrest. I believe a hypertonic Locke's solution with glucose and sodium bicarbonate, omitting potassium and adding magnesium, would be more effective than Ringer's lactate. Triiodothyronine could also help by facilitating the movement of potassium, magnesium, and phosphate back into cells, restoring blood volume and reducing lactic acid production.

**CONTEXT:** What is the physiological basis of shock, and what are the proposed therapeutic interventions?

**RAY PEAT:** Albumin has been used to restore blood volume in preeclampsia. Synthetic polymers with similar osmotic properties might also be useful in shock and eclampsia. However, simply increasing protein intake can rapidly restore blood albumin levels. Studies show that women with preeclampsia and eclampsia have significantly lower serum osmotic pressure and albumin levels compared to normal pregnant women. Increasing protein intake in the later stages of pregnancy can improve osmotic pressure.

**CONTEXT:** How does albumin and protein intake relate to blood volume and osmotic pressure in pregnancy?

**RAY PEAT:** The physiology of heart failure, characterized by a shift from glucose to fatty acid oxidation and a decreased energy supply, shares similarities with eclampsia. Estrogen, which is elevated in men with heart attacks, can reduce heart stroke volume and is linked to free unsaturated fatty acids. This partly contracted state of the heart mirrors the partially contracted blood vessels causing hypertension and reduced tissue perfusion in shock and eclampsia. Aspirin's ability to protect against heart disease and its potential to mitigate excesses of unsaturated fatty acids and estrogen suggest its utility in pre-eclampsia, particularly in preventing fetal growth retardation. However, aspirin's interference with blood clotting makes its use around childbirth risky; early correction of the underlying problem is preferable.

**CONTEXT:** How does the physiology of heart failure and the role of estrogen relate to the mechanisms of eclampsia?

**RAY PEAT:** Besides protein and other nutritional deficiencies, excess estrogen and low thyroid function can impair the liver's albumin production. Hypovolemia also reduces liver function and albumin synthesis. Patients with the lowest albumin levels have the poorest survival rates, indicating that hepatic inefficiency and resulting hypovolemia are significant issues, likely contributing to multiple organ failure. Diets low in sodium and protein may cause more deaths than documented. The common practice of salt restriction for age-related hypertension is as irrational as salt restriction in pregnancy or shock. Thyroid (T3), glucose, sodium, magnesium, and protein are crucial for maintaining plasma composition and homeostatic control.

**CONTEXT:** What are the broader implications of low albumin levels and hypovolemia, and what are the key nutrients for maintaining homeostasis?
