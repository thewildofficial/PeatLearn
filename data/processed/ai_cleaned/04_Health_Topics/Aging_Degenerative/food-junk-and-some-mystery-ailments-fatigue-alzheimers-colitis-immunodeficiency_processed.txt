**RAY PEAT:** Carrageenan, a polysaccharide made from seaweed, was recognized as a dangerous allergen in the 1940s. It's now used to produce inflammatory tumors (granulomas), immunodeficiency, and arthritis in laboratory settings. Despite its known harmful effects, it's increasingly common in the food industry, often justified by the claim that its large molecules are too large to be absorbed. This ignores two critical points: these materials can interact dangerously with intestinal bacteria, and they can be absorbed through a process called "persorption."

**CONTEXT:** What is the primary concern with carrageenan in food?

**RAY PEAT:** The accepted description of fat absorption, involving the disassembly and reassembly of molecules by intestinal cells, creates a mental barrier that prevents the biomedical culture from accepting the facts of persorption. This phenomenon, where large molecules and particles can pass through the intestine, was demonstrated by Gerhard Volkheimer, who found starch grains in the blood and urine of ingested animals. This process would have revolutionized the study of allergy and immunology 150 years ago if it had been accepted.

**CONTEXT:** How does the current understanding of intestinal absorption hinder the acceptance of persorption?

**RAY PEAT:** Volkheimer found that mice fed raw starch aged faster and had starch-grain-blocked arterioles in every organ, leading to cell death. This obstruction in blood supply can significantly impair organ function, particularly in the brain and heart, independent of immunological implications.

**CONTEXT:** What were the observed effects of starch persorption in animal studies?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1979, students in Mexico found no starch grains in their blood or urine after consuming alkali-treated corn products like atole, tamales, and tortillas. This led to the substitution of these foods for other starches whenever possible.

**CONTEXT:** What practical application arose from the understanding of starch persorption?

**RAY PEAT:** Environmental factors such as radiation, estrogens, and unsaturated fats, which we've been increasingly exposed to since 1940, are known to damage the immune system and the brain.

**CONTEXT:** What other environmental factors are implicated in immune and brain damage?

**RAY PEAT:** The increase in inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and liver diseases over the past 50 years in industrialized countries is concerning. Furthermore, the death rate from septicemia in young adults has been rising rapidly since the 1940s, indicating a breakdown in defenses.

**CONTEXT:** What trends in disease incidence are observed in industrialized countries?

**RAY PEAT:** Intestinal permeability, which allows bacteria to enter the bloodstream, is particularly dangerous when phagocytic cells are weakened. Carrageenan is a known cause of macrophage disappearance, and its immunosuppressive effects can exacerbate damage from radiation, unsaturated fats, and estrogens.

**CONTEXT:** How does carrageenan contribute to increased susceptibility to infection?

**RAY PEAT:** The liver tumor characteristic of young women using oral contraceptives, hepatocellular adenoma, is considered premalignant. The rising incidence of hepatocellular tumors in men and women globally suggests an increased burden of toxins absorbed from the bowel. Carrageenan specifically depletes liver enzymes (cytochrome P-450 system) responsible for detoxifying drugs, hormones, and other chemicals.

**CONTEXT:** What is the link between carrageenan, liver function, and cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Carrageenan enters the gut even when it's intact and uninflamed, damaging both chemical and immunological defenses. When it causes inflammatory bowel damage, absorption of carrageenan and bacterial endotoxin increases. These two substances synergize, negatively impacting nitric oxide, prostaglandins, free radicals, and defensive enzyme systems.

**CONTEXT:** How does carrageenan affect the gut's defense mechanisms?

**RAY PEAT:** The continuous efficient production of energy is crucial for metabolic defense, and this is disrupted by carrageenan and endotoxin. This energy failure creates a vicious cycle, increasing intestinal permeability to the very substances it should exclude.

**CONTEXT:** What is the metabolic consequence of carrageenan and endotoxin exposure?

**RAY PEAT:** Once the protective barriers of the intestine and liver are compromised, allergens and other biologically active substances can enter tissues. Absorbed starches can act as "false signals," deranging cellular function in ways that mimic changes seen in cancer.

**CONTEXT:** How do compromised intestinal barriers lead to broader health issues?

**RAY PEAT:** R.J.V. Pulvertaft observed a similarity between Burkitt cells and human lymphocytes stimulated by bean extract, suggesting a potential link between bean consumption and Burkitt's lymphoma, though other factors are involved. Intestinal parasites can also cause bowel inflammation, leading to increased antigen absorption.

**CONTEXT:** What is the potential link between diet and certain cancers, as suggested by research?

**RAY PEAT:** Since the bowel becomes inflamed during influenza, it's plausible that some flu symptoms are caused by absorbed bowel toxins.

**CONTEXT:** What is a potential explanation for some flu symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** Post-influenza syndromes are likely influenced by the nature of bacteria or foods present, especially during uncompensated stress or inflammatory disease. K.M. Stevens suggests that while streptococcal antigens cause rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be caused by antigens from gram-positive lactobacilli in the normal flora.

**CONTEXT:** What is a proposed etiological factor for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)?

**RAY PEAT:** Migraine, SLE, chronic fatigue syndrome, thyroid problems, and some porphyrias are more common in women of reproductive age and are often worsened by premenstrual hormonal changes. Stevens posits that women in this age group harbor a peculiar flora, specifically large numbers of gram-positive lactobacilli in the vagina, which may contribute to SLE.

**CONTEXT:** Why are certain autoimmune and chronic conditions more prevalent in women of reproductive age?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1974, I noticed migraines after consuming lactobacillus milk products and stopped recommending them, initially suspecting lactic acid. However, Stevens' point about the immunological response to systemic bacterial antigens is more significant. Lactic acid is a metabolic burden, especially with estrogen excess.

**CONTEXT:** What personal observation led to a re-evaluation of lactobacillus-containing foods?

**RAY PEAT:** A typical diet leads to the accumulation of linoleic acid, altering mitochondrial cardiolipin, which regulates mitochondrial enzyme response to thyroid hormone. This is particularly evident in the female liver. In "autoimmune" diseases like lupus, antibodies to cardiolipin suggest the body is reacting against its own tissues altered by linoleic acid storage. This altered mitochondrial function, central to many symptoms, can become a vicious cycle involving endotoxin and estrogen, initiated by diet, stress, and toxins.

**CONTEXT:** How does dietary linoleic acid contribute to autoimmune diseases?

**RAY PEAT:** A questionnaire circulated in a "fibromyositis" discussion group revealed that 15 out of 16 respondents experienced worsening of symptoms premenstrually, with no reported improvement.

**CONTEXT:** What was a key finding from a questionnaire regarding fibromyositis symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** Premenstrual estrogen dominance typically leads to increased prolactin and decreased thyroid function. Estrogen is linked to endotoxinemia, histamine and nitric oxide formation, and inflammatory and "autoimmune" diseases. Anything that irritates the bowel and increases endotoxin absorption contributes to this cluster of metabolic consequences.

**CONTEXT:** What are the metabolic consequences of premenstrual estrogen dominance?

**RAY PEAT:** Antibiotics, carrot fiber, or charcoal can relieve the premenstrual syndrome. Charcoal, by binding toxins and catalyzing their oxidative destruction, can mimic the action of protective intestinal and liver enzymes. Adding charcoal to the diet has also been shown to extend lifespan.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary interventions can help with premenstrual symptoms and overall health?

**RAY PEAT:** Some women with premenstrual fatigue find the "premenstrual" phase lengthens into chronic fatigue. This is often correctable. In older individuals with longer-term illness, fatigue involves more bodily systems. The greater the "toxic fat" stored, the more caution is needed when increasing metabolic and physical activity. Using more vitamin E, short-chain saturated fats, and other anti-lipid-peroxidation agents is important.

**CONTEXT:** What factors influence the severity and persistence of fatigue, and what are the recommended countermeasures?

**RAY PEAT:** Inflammatory diseases that develop after prolonged stress can be difficult to correct. Avoiding major toxic allergens like carrageenan is as crucial as correcting thyroid function and avoiding antithyroid substances.

**CONTEXT:** What are the essential considerations for addressing inflammatory diseases that arise after prolonged stress?

**RAY PEAT:** Low cholesterol is frequently associated with stress-related diseases and, like inadequate dietary protein, reduces the system's responsiveness to supplementary thyroid hormone.

**CONTEXT:** How does cholesterol level relate to stress-induced diseases and thyroid hormone efficacy?

**RAY PEAT:** The proliferative aspects of inflammatory diseases may represent a primitive form of regeneration. Conditions like arthritis, atherosclerosis, granulomatous processes, breast diseases, and liver adenomas offer opportunities to study systems and substances that guide cell proliferation toward reconstruction rather than degeneration. Degenerative diseases likely hold clues for understanding regeneration, as seen with Alzheimer's disease and inflammation. The initial step in addressing these issues is always to minimize exposure to disruptive substances.

**CONTEXT:** What is the potential significance of the proliferative aspects of inflammatory diseases, and what is the foundational step in addressing them?
