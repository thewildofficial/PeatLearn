**RAY PEAT:** The food and drug industries, and many physicians, are promoting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with double bonds farthest from the acidic end of the molecule. These fats, found in fish, algae, and many vegetables, are the most easily oxidized. With stress, such as premature birth, and with aging, these fats produce free radical decomposition products at a high rate, contributing to "shock lung" and multiple organ failure.

**CONTEXT:** What are the primary concerns regarding certain fatty acids and their impact on health?

**RAY PEAT:** After my dissertation on aging and oxygen metabolism, and observing progesterone's effects, I met a woman with an inflammatory muscle and joint disease. Her emaciated face and arms contrasted with huge hips and thighs, a pattern indicative of prolonged estrogen influence. Her movement problems began at 21 when her physician father injected her and her mother with estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** Can you describe a case that highlighted the connection between estrogen and physiological issues?

**RAY PEAT:** Her medical tests revealed a pulmonary oxygen diffusion capacity that was "95% below normal." This suggests they were in the lowest 5% of the population. Around the same time, a study showed that a large dose of estrogen in mice caused a similarly radical decrease in oxygen diffusing capacity within 40 minutes.

**CONTEXT:** What specific medical finding in this case was particularly striking, and what research supported this observation?

**RAY PEAT:** In the late 1960s, I was interested in athletes using a gelatin-oxygen drink for better blood oxygenation. Physicians dismissed it, stating blood is always fully oxygenated leaving the lungs. However, a 1968 study found blood oxygenation declines with aging, often to about 50%. Despite the mouse study, I found no human studies on estrogen's effects on oxygen diffusion, likely due to authoritarianism and a rigid adherence to textbooks.

**CONTEXT:** What was the prevailing medical view on blood oxygenation, and what research contradicted it?

**RAY PEAT:** About 15 years later, I visited an 82-year-old friend in Toluca, Mexico. He was breathing heavily, with a purplish face, diagnosed with emphysema. His obesity suggested an estrogen-provoked diffusion problem. I gave his daughter progesterone and pregnenolone. Upon my return, his color had improved, and his humor had returned. Two weeks later, his color was normal, he was working, and insisted on showing me the city, despite the 8,500-foot altitude.

**CONTEXT:** Can you share an experience that demonstrated the therapeutic potential of progesterone and pregnenolone in a case of respiratory distress?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s, Gilbert Ling found that increased carbon dioxide prevents excitable cells from depolarizing as much as in a normal atmosphere. This principle is used to treat epilepsy with added carbon dioxide and to diagnose it by inducing seizures through hyperventilation, which depletes carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide forms carbamino groups with proteins, and increased oxygen pressure displaces carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide influence cellular electrical activity, and what are its therapeutic applications?

**RAY PEAT:** The binding of acidic carbon dioxide to proteins shifts electrons, making them more acidic. This alters protein interactions with molecules like water, sodium, potassium, and calcium. Under acidic conditions with abundant carbon dioxide, protein electrons are slightly "retracted," inhibiting free radical production and increasing resistance to radiation and excitatory damage.

**CONTEXT:** What is the biochemical mechanism by which carbon dioxide affects cellular proteins and protects against damage?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide, along with carbonic acid, regulates the body's water handling. Its association with cells affects hormone and neurotransmitter regulation. For instance, carbon dioxide causes cells to bind serotonin; a loss of carbon dioxide releases serotonin, increasing blood vessel permeability and fluid leakage.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond cellular electrical activity, what other physiological roles does carbon dioxide play?

**RAY PEAT:** In the lungs, this serum leakage creates a barrier to oxygen diffusion. Hypoxic cells release lactic acid and other inflammatory mediators, and capillary walls thicken, impeding blood circulation. While often overlooked in the brain and heart, these effects are evident in the lungs, leading to "shock lung" or "wet lung" with waterlogged lungs and increased weight after stressful death.

**CONTEXT:** How does serum leakage in the lungs contribute to respiratory distress?

**RAY PEAT:** Oxygen opposes the antiexcitatory action of carbon dioxide, acting as a cell excitatory agent. High-pressure oxygen can cause seizures, and even at normal pressure, lungs are more susceptible to damage with more oxygen. The lungs' delicate membranes are exposed to air, making them vulnerable to excessive carbon dioxide loss in the presence of too much oxygen.

**CONTEXT:** How does oxygen interact with carbon dioxide in the context of lung function and potential damage?

**RAY PEAT:** At high altitudes, adapted tissues retain more carbon dioxide, preventing excessive cellular activation and reducing lactic acid production. Carbon dioxide facilitates blood circulation, reducing the heart's workload. Even at maximum exertion, the heart relies more on oxygen than glycolysis at high altitudes, unlike sea-level metabolism which resembles cancer metabolism due to a high oxygen/carbon dioxide ratio.

**CONTEXT:** How does altitude adaptation, specifically regarding carbon dioxide retention, affect metabolic efficiency and cardiac function?

**RAY PEAT:** Some individuals with respiratory issues at sea level hyperventilate at high altitudes, losing more carbon dioxide, which can lead to lung and brain edema and seizures. Altitude sickness can be treated with supplemental carbon dioxide. Acetazolamide, a drug that promotes carbon dioxide retention, is the standard treatment for mountain sickness, yet there's a reluctance to acknowledge carbon dioxide insufficiency as the cause. This drug is also used for sleep apnea, contrary to the belief that it's caused by excess carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** What is the paradox surrounding the treatment of altitude sickness and sleep apnea with carbon dioxide-related interventions?

**RAY PEAT:** Lactic acid indicates metabolic inefficiency. Athletes, especially at sea level, exhibit inefficiency during strenuous exercise. Despite available oxygen, intense glycolysis produces lactic acid, which seems to limit oxygen utilization. High oxygen pressure, by depleting carbon dioxide, likely triggers this less efficient, lactic acid-producing glycolysis.

**CONTEXT:** How does lactic acid production relate to metabolic efficiency, particularly in the context of exercise and oxygen availability?

**RAY PEAT:** "Hypoxemia of exercise," where blood isn't fully oxygenated during strenuous activity, mirrors the chronic hypoxemia in "respiratory distress syndrome." Women athletes are more prone to exercise hypoxemia. In the luteal phase, when progesterone is dominant, women breathe more effectively than in the estrogen-dominated follicular phase. Estrogen, like exercise, increases capillary permeability, explaining this difference. Stress, including exercise and illness, elevates estrogen and inflammatory mediators in both sexes.

**CONTEXT:** What is "hypoxemia of exercise," and how do hormonal cycles and stress influence respiratory function in women?

**RAY PEAT:** Both exercise and estrogen dominance mobilize fatty acids from tissues. Unsaturated fatty acids increase capillary permeability, and their ratio to saturated fats correlates with lung malfunction and respiratory distress. Medium-chain saturated triglycerides from coconut oil can be used for intravenous feeding without the respiratory distress caused by unsaturated vegetable oils.

**CONTEXT:** How do exercise, estrogen, and fatty acid composition impact capillary permeability and lung function?

**RAY PEAT:** Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), cause mitochondrial breakdown, thyroid suppression, vascular permeability, brain edema, and increased radiation sensitivity.

**CONTEXT:** What are the specific detrimental effects of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids on cellular and systemic functions?

**RAY PEAT:** DHA is the most unstable PUFA. Despite marketing promoting DHA for infant formula and adult consumption based on evolutionary diets, animals fed DHA-deficient diets are less susceptible to eye damage. More broadly, animals deficient in all "essential fatty acids" are highly resistant to injury, shock, and poisoning.

**CONTEXT:** What is the current marketing push for DHA, and what does research suggest about its necessity and potential risks?

**RAY PEAT:** All PUFAs inhibit thyroid function, which is crucial for brain and lung development. Increased PUFA consumption leads to hypothyroidism, resulting in more premature babies with lung disease. High PUFA concentrations in the lungs, combined with oxygen exposure in newborns, create an inflammatory reaction. This likely explains the delayed onset of respiratory distress in prematurity. Increased DHA use could exacerbate infant lung disease.

**CONTEXT:** How does PUFA consumption impact thyroid function and fetal development, particularly concerning lung health?

**RAY PEAT:** Unsaturated fats and estrogen increase serotonin and nitric oxide (NO) release. NO is produced during inflammation and, like ethane, can be detected in exhaled breath during lung inflammation. NO, as a pro-inflammatory free radical, stimulates PUFA peroxidation. Both NO and serotonin inhibit mitochondrial respiration, shifting metabolism towards glycolysis.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of serotonin and nitric oxide in inflammation and metabolic shifts, and how are they linked to PUFAs and estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** The processes damaging lungs in aging, stress, and prematurity are similar. Examining factors causing premature birth can illuminate general "lung stress."

**CONTEXT:** What commonalities exist between lung damage in aging, stress, and prematurity?

**RAY PEAT:** Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome affecting about 10% of pregnancies, is a leading cause of maternal and newborn mortality.

**CONTEXT:** What is preeclampsia, and what is its significance in pregnancy?

**RAY PEAT:** Thomas Brewer demonstrated 50 years ago that protein deficiency is the primary cause of preeclampsia, leading to a general inflammatory condition with increased serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** What did Thomas Brewer identify as the main cause of preeclampsia?

**RAY PEAT:** Women with preeclampsia have elevated serotonin, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation. A study of over 3000 women (Clausen et al., 2001) found a strong association between high sugar and PUFA consumption and preeclampsia. While consistent with Brewer's work, this study specifically implicated PUFAs, not saturated or monounsaturated fats. Eclampsia and preeclampsia are caused by oxidative stress from excessive unstable fats, with increased serotonin and NO expected from high PUFA intake, especially with protein deficiency.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary factors were linked to preeclampsia in a large study, and how do these findings relate to previous research?

**RAY PEAT:** Protein deficiency, like excess PUFAs, causes thyroid deficiency. Thyroid supplementation during gestation accelerates fetal lung maturation and prevents respiratory distress syndrome.

**CONTEXT:** How does protein deficiency and PUFA excess impact thyroid function, and what is the role of thyroid hormone in fetal lung development?

**RAY PEAT:** Adequate protein and saturated fats during pregnancy prevent many pregnancy and infancy issues. However, since PUFAs are stored in tissues for years and mobilized during stress, consistent healthy eating is crucial long before pregnancy. Vitamin E requirements remain high for years after excess PUFA intake.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary recommendations are important for preventing pregnancy and infancy complications, and what are the long-term implications of PUFA consumption?

**RAY PEAT:** The diet that protects the developing fetus also protects adults from stress and mitigates many aging symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** What is the broader implication of the optimal diet for fetal development?

**RAY PEAT:** Supplemental thyroid, pregnenolone, and progesterone can partially compensate for dietary deficiencies by improving the balance between carbon dioxide and lactic acid and by inhibiting stress mediators like NO, serotonin, and estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** How can certain hormone supplements help mitigate the effects of dietary deficiencies?
