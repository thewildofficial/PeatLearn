**RAY PEAT:** The reason for the menopausal increase in pituitary hormones is that the nerve cells which regulate their secretion have been killed or desensitized by their past exposure to estrogen; it is their reduced sensitivity that requires the very large doses of estrogen to suppress secretion of the gonadotrophic hormones.

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying physiological reason for the increased pituitary gonadotrophins observed around menopause?

**RAY PEAT:** Clonidine (normally used for high blood pressure) can be used as a skin patch, to control menopausal flushing; progesterone and DHEA prevent osteoporosis. After those issues have been taken care of, the question of pituitary hyperfunction should be considered, in relation to preventing ovarian cancer. (Combinations of safe substances including progesterone and naloxone can probably be worked out empirically.) A variety of other possibilities exist, including Gonadotrophin Inhibiting Substance, and antagonists to the specific gonadotrophin release hormones. Normalizing the menopausal gonadotrophins would have far-reaching effects, possibly improving the immune response.

**CONTEXT:** What are some physiological approaches to managing menopausal symptoms and potentially preventing ovarian cancer by addressing pituitary hyperfunction?

**RAY PEAT:** Women who have children, or who take oral contraceptives that might suppress ovulation, are believed to have a lower incidence of ovarian cancer because of reduced exposure to the gonadotrophins. (Though cancers of liver, breast, and other organs are reported to be more frequent among pill users; prolactinomas seemed to become epidemic after the pill was introduced.)

**CONTEXT:** What is the observed epidemiological link between ovulation suppression and ovarian cancer incidence, and what are potential side effects of hormonal interventions like oral contraceptives?

**RAY PEAT:** Normal factors in the physiological control of the ovaries include an interaction between the thyroid and the gonadotrophins; the combination of hypothyroidism and stimulation by gonadotrophins can cause ovarian cysts to develop. Small amounts of estrogen can increase both FSH and LH, and large amounts of progesterone decrease both FSH and LH.

**CONTEXT:** How do thyroid function and gonadotrophins interact in ovarian physiology, and what are the effects of estrogen and progesterone on FSH and LH secretion?

**RAY PEAT:** If ovaries are removed from their normal location, and transplanted into the spleen, so that their secretions go directly to the liver where they are inactivated, they produce tumors because they are subject to "hypersecretion of gonadotrophic hormones." Other experiments support the idea that ovarian tumors develop from excess pituitary stimulation. For example, removal of one ovary was essential to produce a tumor in the other ovary even after it had been irradiated. Similarly, no tumors developed in irradiated ovaries transplanted into other mice, irradiated or not, as long as they had their own ovaries, which kept the pituitary functioning normally.

**CONTEXT:** What experimental evidence suggests that ovarian tumors develop from excess pituitary stimulation?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone and estrogen "receptors" can be demonstrated in some ovarian tumors, and by analogy with breast and uterine tissue, in which progesterone generally retards cell division and estrogen stimulates it, hormones have been investigated as possible therapies for ovarian cancer. Although in vitro studies show that there might be a direct action on the tumor cells, the reports of positive responses in patients treated with progesterone or synthetic progestins are more interesting, since the most logical approach involves normalization of the pituitary gonadotrophins.

**CONTEXT:** How are progesterone and estrogen being investigated as therapies for ovarian cancer, and what is considered the most logical therapeutic approach?

**RAY PEAT:** If it is true that a "deficiency" of the so-called "essential" fatty acids suppresses gonadotrophin secretion, then a diet lacking those estrogen-promoting substances should be both protective and therapeutic for ovarian cancer (assuming that the results seen with progestin therapy are produced by gonadotrophin inhibition.) If our purpose is to delay the menopausal rise of the gonadotrophins, then it is interesting that lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (which increases with age) can be intimately involved in loss of progesterone forming ability by human steroidogenic tissues. That is, aging decreases the ability of certain brain cells to inhibit the pituitary gonadotrophins, and it also tends to decrease the steroidogenic tissues' ability to produce the regulatory steroids.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed role of "essential" fatty acids in gonadotrophin secretion and ovarian cancer, and how does lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids relate to aging and steroidogenesis?

**RAY PEAT:** After menopause, estrogen is produced less by the ovary than by other tissues, including fat cells. Breast cancer cells can produce their own estrogen. This means that estrogen is one of the "cancer hormones" which, secreted by the tumor, promotes the growth of the tumor and also has a systemic pro-cancer action. Ovarian tumors, too, can cause great systemic hormonal imbalances, which should be investigated routinely in a physiological approach to the disease. After menopause, estrogen is largely produced by conversion of "androgenic" steroids from the adrenal glands. It would be desirable to be able to inhibit the conversion of the adrenal steroid precursor to estrogen. Newton, et al. showed that progesterone inhibits the conversion of the precursor to estrogen, and P.K. Siiteri showed a similar effect for thyroid hormone.

**CONTEXT:** How is estrogen production altered after menopause, and what is the significance of estrogen as a "cancer hormone"? What hormonal interventions can inhibit the conversion of adrenal precursors to estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** A diet low in polyunsaturated fats facilitates thyroid hormone secretion, transport, and tissue response to it, and would minimize the stress-related or age-related inhibition of progesterone formation by lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E and vitamin A also protect against lipid peroxidation, and vitamin A is specifically involved in progesterone synthesis. Vitamin A also has a variety of anti-estrogen functions, that are often considered to be relevant to protection against cancer.

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of a diet low in polyunsaturated fats for thyroid function and progesterone production, and what roles do vitamins E and A play in protecting against lipid peroxidation and supporting progesterone synthesis and anti-estrogenic effects?

**RAY PEAT:** All of these dietary and hormonal approaches to normalizing the pituitary gonadotrophins and controlling ovarian cell division are things which also tend to optimize the immune response. A slight deficiency of iron is probably protective against cancer, since there are several ways that iron can promote cancer, apart from its role in damage to the immune system and the steroidogenic system by lipid peroxidation.

**CONTEXT:** How do these physiological approaches to hormone normalization and cell division control impact the immune response, and what is the proposed role of iron in cancer development?
