**RAY PEAT:** The death rate from cancer is increasing, not decreasing, despite official claims to the contrary. This is due to a statistical manipulation called "age standardization," which falsely compares current populations to older, differently structured populations. The post-war baby boom, for instance, created a younger population bulge, naturally lowering the average cancer death rate. However, the incidence and mortality rates for specific cancers like breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma have been steadily increasing.

**CONTEXT:** What are the real trends in cancer mortality?

**RAY PEAT:** The cancer establishment, including organizations like the American Cancer Society and chemotherapy drug producers, has a vested interest in promoting early detection and conventional treatments rather than addressing the root causes of cancer. They actively work to deny that avoidable agents like radiation, estrogen, and chemical pollutants are major contributors to the rise in breast cancer.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of the "cancer establishment" in the perception of cancer trends?

**RAY PEAT:** Leonell Strong's research demonstrated that genetically predisposed mammary cancer in mice could be eradicated with simple liver extracts. When Strong shifted his focus to showing that "genetic" cancer was treatable, he faced official abuse and the loss of his research. This indicates that discoveries offering simple prevention or treatment are often unwelcome by the established cancer industry.

**CONTEXT:** What was the significance of Leonell Strong's research?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea that cancer is caused by a single defective cell, the "clonal" theory, is a flawed ideology. Harry Rubin's work shows that genetic changes in tumors occur *after* the cancer has already begun. The "clonal-goblin theory" of cancer, which posits a single mutated cell as the cause, logically leads to the conclusion that cancer must be surgically removed or destroyed with chemotherapy and radiation.

**CONTEXT:** What is the flaw in the prevailing "clonal" theory of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** A biological understanding of cancer views cellular development, both normal and abnormal, as a response to environmental conditions.

**CONTEXT:** What is the alternative biological theory of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen and ionizing radiation are the most clearly identified causes of breast cancer. They induce inflammation, edema, fibrosis, and disrupt intercellular communication. Radiation itself is estrogenic. Increased estrogenic stimulation leads to growth and a temporary loss of differentiated cell functions. Other factors like vitamin A deficiency, hypothyroidism, chlorinated hydrocarbons, irritation, and oxygen deprivation can also cause similar tissue changes, but estrogen and radiation have been extensively studied.

**CONTEXT:** What are the primary causes of breast cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), particularly omega-6 fatty acids like linoleic acid, are another significant cause of cancer, especially breast cancer. PUFAs synergize with estrogen and increase sensitivity to radiation. Maternal exposure to PUFAs can lead to an increased tendency for breast or prostate cancer in offspring.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of polyunsaturated fats in cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** An individual's hormone balance can be disrupted by radiation, estrogens, or unsaturated fats. These disruptions can imprint on the offspring, affecting chromosomes, the liver, brain, pituitary, and other tissues.

**CONTEXT:** How do these factors affect offspring?

**RAY PEAT:** It is easy to reduce exposure to radiation by avoiding mammograms, bone density scans, and other X-rays. Ultrasound and MRI can provide good imaging without the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.

**CONTEXT:** How can radiation exposure be reduced?

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated fats can be reduced through careful food selection, although the food industry is increasingly contaminating traditionally safe foods. Milk, cheese, beef, and lamb remain safe due to their nutritional content and the purification processes in ruminant animals. Saturated fats, like those in coconut oil, may even have a protective effect.

**CONTEXT:** How can exposure to polyunsaturated fats be minimized?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogenic influences can be reduced by avoiding soy products and unsaturated fats. Adequate protein intake is crucial for optimizing the liver's estrogen elimination. Consuming fiber-rich foods like raw carrots, potatoes, and milk can stimulate bowel action, preventing estrogen reabsorption. Preventing hypothyroidism is also essential for managing estrogen levels.

**CONTEXT:** How can estrogenic influences be reduced?

**RAY PEAT:** Some studies suggest a link between dietary starch and breast cancer, as starch stimulates insulin secretion, which in turn stimulates estrogen production.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of dietary starch?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen is produced in fat cells under the influence of cortisol, and this process is suppressed by progesterone and thyroid hormone. Postmenopausal obesity is linked to increased estrogen and breast cancer. Preventing weight gain and supplementing with thyroid and progesterone, if needed, can be protective against many cancers, particularly breast, kidney, and uterine cancers.

**CONTEXT:** How does obesity relate to estrogen and breast cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Prenatal or early-life exposure to estrogens (including phytoestrogens), irradiation, or polyunsaturated oils increases the incidence of mammary cancers in adulthood.

**CONTEXT:** What are the long-term consequences of early life exposure to certain substances?

**RAY PEAT:** Protein deficiency during pregnancy or early life leads to a lifelong excess of serotonin. Excess tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, during pregnancy can cause pituitary and mammary tumors in offspring. Serotonin is closely linked to estrogen and polyunsaturated fats and can be metabolized into carcinogens.

**CONTEXT:** What is the impact of protein deficiency and tryptophan on offspring?

**RAY PEAT:** Prenatal protein deficiency and excess unsaturated oils predispose individuals to a pattern of hypothyroidism and hyperestrogenism. This can lead to earlier puberty, weight gain, and intensified inflammatory processes, which further exacerbate the effects of estrogen and serotonin.

**CONTEXT:** What are the developmental consequences of prenatal protein deficiency and unsaturated oils?

**RAY PEAT:** Anti-inflammatory and antioxidative substances like aspirin, caffeine, progesterone, and thyroid hormone are beneficial both preventively and therapeutically for cancer. Aspirin, at moderate doses, can induce cancer cell death and has anti-estrogenic effects, similar to progesterone and thyroid. While its potential for stomach bleeding is a concern, it can be a powerful anticancer agent.

**CONTEXT:** What therapeutic agents are beneficial for cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** The "essential fatty acids" (PUFAs) are toxic and can be carcinogenic. They are stored in tissues and can be released into the bloodstream during stress or hunger. Estrogens, adrenaline, serotonin, growth hormone, and prolonged darkness increase the release of these free fatty acids. Frequent meals, including saturated fats like coconut oil, and a balanced intake of protein, sugars, and salts can minimize the release of stored fats.

**CONTEXT:** How can the negative effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids be mitigated?

**RAY PEAT:** The increasing trends of obesity and earlier puberty in the population are associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. In the 19th century, when breast cancer incidence was lower, puberty typically occurred around age 17. In countries with low breast cancer rates, puberty still occurs in the mid to late teens. The current biological changes in children suggest an increased incidence of degenerative diseases as they age.

**CONTEXT:** What do population trends in obesity and puberty indicate about future health?

**RAY PEAT:** A metabolic approach to cancer prevention and treatment would have numerous positive side effects, contributing to healthier, happier, and more intelligent individuals.

**CONTEXT:** What are the broader benefits of a metabolic approach to cancer?
