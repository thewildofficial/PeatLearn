**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen causes the prostate gland to enlarge in experimental animals. The prevailing, oversimplified view was that estrogen causes female organs to grow and testosterone causes male organs to grow, leading to the mistaken idea that hormones of one sex would inhibit the growth of the reproductive organs of the other sex.

**CONTEXT:** What was the initial understanding of estrogen's role in prostate growth?

**RAY PEAT:** The medical profession's "research" into using estrogen for prostate cancer was peculiar. It often involved mailing questionnaires to physicians asking if they thought estrogen was reasonable to administer based on its supposed opposition to testosterone, which was considered responsible for prostate growth. Many physicians answered affirmatively, and their opinions became the "evidence" for the treatment's value, leading to phrases like "treatment of choice" and "standard practice." This pseudo-scientific mystique meant that physicians basing their practice on sound science often violated professional norms.

**CONTEXT:** How did the medical establishment justify the use of estrogen for prostate cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Deliberate misrepresentation was involved in the continued designation of estrogen as "the female hormone." By the mid-1980s, studies showed estrogen treatment didn't prolong prostate cancer patient survival, but it was argued that these patients were happier. However, a survey at a physician conference revealed many would choose no treatment if diagnosed with prostate cancer. More recently, recommendations suggest older patients shouldn't be treated aggressively due to slow-growing cancers and age-related mortality.

**CONTEXT:** What were the observed outcomes and evolving perspectives on estrogen therapy for prostate cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** My friend, despite my warnings about estrogen causing strokes and heart attacks, took the treatment. Within days, he developed asthma and disturbed sleep, followed by strokes and death. This occurred because estrogen treatment is dangerous for men, increasing blood clotting and vascular spasms. The overriding belief driving its use was that "estrogen, the female hormone, opposes testosterone, the male hormone, which is responsible for the growth—and therefore for the cancerization—of the prostate gland." This entire premise is flawed. Otto Warburg observed that all carcinogenic factors he studied caused tissue atrophy before cancer appeared. Furthermore, every hormone has multiple functions, and every endocrine gland produces multiple hormones.

**CONTEXT:** What were the dangers of estrogen therapy for prostate cancer, and what was the flawed reasoning behind its use?

**RAY PEAT:** Since the time of Brown-Sequard and Eugen Steinach, declining testicular function has been recognized as a common feature of aging, with testosterone consistently decreasing with age (Vermeulen, et al., 1972, 1979). It's odd that prostate enlargement occurs mainly in older men if testosterone causes its growth and estrogen is antagonistic. The nature of prostate growth in older men differs from natural growth in youth.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between aging, testosterone, and prostate enlargement?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen rises in men during old age, as it does during stress, disease, malnutrition, and hypothyroidism, all associated with aging. Estrogen is produced in fat, which increases with age when thyroid and progesterone are deficient. Testosterone conversion to estrogen occurs in the testicle but is inhibited by the favorable hormonal environment of youth. Active thyroid hormone (T3) declines with aging, lowering pregnenolone and progesterone production. DHEA may rise during stress due to deficiencies in thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone.

**CONTEXT:** How do hormonal changes with aging contribute to increased estrogen levels?

**RAY PEAT:** John Hunter reported in 1786 that castration reduces prostate size, and by the late 19th century, castration was advocated for prostate enlargement. In aging men, the prostate atrophies, and cancer cells are found within this atrophic gland. Nodular, noncancerous enlargement can occur with or without cancer. An autopsy study in 1935 found carcinoma in 30% of prostates by age 50. Proliferation of ductal and epithelial tissue is closely associated with prostate cancer, similar to the breast. "Epitheliosis," an exaggerated proliferation of epithelial cells, is seen with cancer in women and can be caused by irritation or vitamin A deficiency. Estrogenic stimulation clearly causes proliferative epitheliosis in the breast. The antagonism between estrogen and vitamin A in controlling epithelial proliferation is evident; vitamin A restrains it. Vitamin A supplementation would likely be beneficial wherever estrogen is a factor in abnormal tissue development. In aging men and women, as breasts and prostates atrophy, their estrogen/antiestrogen ratio increases.

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical perspective on prostate gland changes and the role of hormones and nutrition?

**RAY PEAT:** In men with prostate cancer, prostatic fluid contains significantly more estradiol than in men without cancer (Rose, et al., 1984), analogous to observations in women with breast cancer.

**CONTEXT:** What hormonal differences are observed in the prostatic fluid of men with prostate cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Pituitary hormones have diverse functions beyond their "classical" roles, including effects on epithelial tissues. Growth hormone, ACTH (Lostroh and Li, 1957), and ACTH with prolactin (Tullner, 1963) stimulate prostate growth. Prolactin, increased by estrogen, stimulates rat lateral prostate growth (Holland and Lee, 1980) and human prostate epithelial cell growth in vitro (Syms, et al., 1985). LH increases with progesterone or testosterone deficiency. Growth hormone and prolactin increase under stress and with estrogenic stimulation. Prostate cancer patients with higher LH and lower testosterone died most quickly (Harper, et al., 1984). A high ratio of testosterone to estradiol or testosterone to prolactin correlated with better survival (Rannikko, et al., 1981). Higher testosterone levels and lower growth hormone levels were associated with better prognoses (Wilson, et al., 1985). Has anyone tried testosterone therapy for prostate cancer, or a generalized antiestrogenic therapy using thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone? Drugs like naloxone, bromocriptine, GnRH agonists, and anti-growth hormone drugs can regulate pituitary hormones and may be useful therapeutically or preventively (Blaakaer, et al., 1995). Biskind and Biskind's work (1944) on ovarian tumors might be relevant to both testicular and prostate cancer.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of pituitary hormones and other endocrine factors in prostate cancer progression and survival?

**RAY PEAT:** Abnormal pituitary hormone patterns reflect stress and hormonal imbalance and are directly involved in widespread changes in tissue glycoprotein content. The prostate's specialization in secreting mucin suggests interactions between growth-regulatory and secretion-regulatory systems.

**CONTEXT:** How do hormonal imbalances affect prostate function and tissue composition?

**RAY PEAT:** Prostate cancer incidence has increased rapidly, with no apparent reduction in death rates despite increased treatment. The postwar baby boom created an abnormal age structure, used to argue for progress against cancer. Increasing environmental estrogens cause reproductive abnormalities, and their contribution to prostate cancer would receive more attention if estrogen's role in prostate disease were better understood. Environmental estrogens cause genital deformities and sterility in wildlife, but industry creates controversy when causal links are made to human abnormalities. Even the effects of estrogens in sewage, known for decades, are classified. Testicular cancer incidence has clearly increased (100% in white men, 200% in black men) since 1950, with increased undescended testicles and urethral abnormalities, similar to DES sons and wildlife. This provides context for the significant increase in prostate cancer death rates during the same period.

**CONTEXT:** What are the environmental factors and trends contributing to the rise in prostate cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Although animal studies showed estrogen promotes prostate enlargement, it was possible to assume human prostate growth was solely testosterone-stimulated until in vitro tests on cell division. In human prostate slices, several hormones (including insulin and likely prolactin) stimulated cell division, while testosterone did not under these conditions (McKeehan, et al., 1984). Contrary to stereotypes, supplementary androgens might control prostate cancer (Umekita, et al., 1996), and prolactin and estrogen antagonists could be useful in hormonal therapy (Wennbo, et al., 1997; Lane, et al., 1997). By age 50, men often have excess prolactin and estrogen, and deficient thyroid and testosterone, coinciding with noticeable prostate enlargement.

**CONTEXT:** What do in vitro studies reveal about the hormonal regulation of prostate cell division and potential therapeutic targets?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen's role in prostate growth and cancerization is clear: "...simultaneous treatment of intact...rats with testosterone and estradiol-17beta for 16 weeks consistently induced a putative precancerous lesion, termed dysplasia, in the dorsolateral prostate of all animals. Since treatment of rats with androgen alone did not elicit the same response, we concluded that estrogen played a critical role in the genesis of this proliferative lesion." (Ho and Yu.)

**CONTEXT:** What experimental evidence directly implicates estrogen in prostate cancer development?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone and pregnenolone also decline in aging men. Synthetic progestins have effectively shrunk the hypertrophic prostate, and saw palmetto is reported to contain pregnenolone or similar compounds. These substances may reduce the conversion of testosterone or other androgens to estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of progesterone and pregnenolone in prostate health, and what natural remedies might be beneficial?

**RAY PEAT:** Prostaglandins, discovered in prostatic fluid, are deeply involved in the development of various cancers. Aspirin and other prostaglandin inhibitors should be considered basic cancer therapy, as prostaglandins promote cancer growth through local and systemic effects. ("The prostaglandins and related eicosanoids synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors have been implicated as modulators of tumor metastasis, host immunoregulation, tumor promotion, and cell proliferation." Hubbard, et al., 1988.)

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of prostaglandins in cancer development and therapy?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogens elevate free fatty acids, and there are many interactions between unsaturated fatty acids and estrogen, including their metabolism to prostaglandins and peroxidation. Estrogen's roles as a free-radical promoter, DNA toxin, carcinogen, tumor promoter, modifier of tissue growth factors, and anti-thymic hormone, along with its local prostate effects, must be considered. While estrogen receptors in the prostate are studied, many of estrogen's most important actions do not involve receptors. Direct excitatory actions on prostate cells and indirect actions via the pituitary, pancreas, thyroid, adrenal, fatty acids, prostaglandins, histamine, and circulation are likely essential to the cancerization process. Unsaturated fatty acids, unlike saturated ones, free estrogen from serum proteins, increasing its availability and activity in tissue cells.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen and unsaturated fatty acids interact to promote prostate cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid supplementation, adequate animal protein, trace minerals, and vitamin A are primary considerations for preventing prostate hypertrophy and cancer. Nutritional and endocrine support can be combined with rational anticancer treatments, as there's no sharp distinction between approaches aimed at endocrine and immunological balance without harm.

**CONTEXT:** What are the foundational nutritional and endocrine strategies for prostate health?

**RAY PEAT:** Avoiding tissue atrophy is closely linked to promoting healthy regeneration, both requiring efficient energy production and a balance between stimulation and resources. While growth hormone is sometimes recommended for tissue atrophy, evidence suggests it promotes prostate tumefaction. The only study suggesting it might benefit prostatic cancer was a 14-day experiment in female rats. Numerous studies indicate blocking growth hormone is beneficial in prostate cancer treatment. Growth hormone, like estrogen, cortisol, and unsaturated fats, tends to promote degenerative aging changes.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of growth hormone in prostate health and aging, and what are the implications for cancer treatment?
