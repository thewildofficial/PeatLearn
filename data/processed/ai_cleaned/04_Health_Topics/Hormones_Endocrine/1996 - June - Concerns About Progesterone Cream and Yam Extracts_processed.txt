**RAY PEAT:** The idea that progesterone is a yam extract is a misrepresentation. If progesterone is a yam extract, then so is estrogen, anabolic steroids, glucocorticoids, and contraceptive steroids. The phrase "Mexican yam root extract" or "wild yam" does not honestly describe the contents of the product. *Dioscorea*, wild yam root, has been in the National Formulary for many years as a drug in itself, used to treat "bilious colic" and as a diuretic and expectorant.

If the yam-substance is applied to the skin, the saponins in it might be good for cleaning the skin (it was commonly used for washing clothes, shampooing, etc.), but they will have no hormone action. If the "menopause creams" contain estrogen, they might have a systemic effect, but the studies of topical progesterone, by Papa and Kligman, showed that progesterone had a local effect, but no detectable systemic effect. This is because of its low solubility in ordinary oils. The progesterone-vitamin E combination, which I patented, is stably dissolved so that it can be absorbed by any route — transdermal, oral, rectal, or vaginal, but I have not licensed my patent to any of the companies such as Yamcon/Phillips Nutritionals or Pro-Gest/Transitions/Professional & Technical Services, which advertise creams for the treatment of menopause. Some creams contain progesterone, some creams contain vitamin E, some contain neither. The patented progesterone-in-vitamin E products are sold only in Eugene, Oregon.

The order in which ingredients are listed on the label must be in the order of their quantity in the product. Pro-Gest’s advertisement claims that “For over 17 years, physicians have recommended Pro-Gest to their menopausal patients,” but I participated in the design of some of the original progesterone lotions which were sold by Professional and Technical Services (while I was “President” of that corporation), and those early formulations (I still have copies of the various brand-name labels) essentially had no effective shelf life, because of their poor formulation; the progesterone was crystallized by the time it arrived from the factory. The composition of the various Professional & Technical Services products, at least according to their labels, has changed over the years. It is incorrect to say that Pro-Gest has existed for 17 years. One formulation, for example, showed a higher content of vitamin E than of progesterone, meaning that there was sufficient vitamin E to dissolve the progesterone, and thus to infringe my patent. When I pointed this out to MacFarland, he didn’t want to pay me royalties, so he obligingly changed the formulation. “Cielo 2000” another of MacFarland’s previous products, moved vitamin E far down on its label, meaning that its solvent action was very limited. My samples of Pro-Gest contain massive amounts of crystals, indicating that they didn’t copy my patented composition.

A friend quoted one manufacturer of a progesterone cream, as saying, when she told him of my patent, “that’s easy to get around.” But a truthful label will say in a simple way whether or not it is violating my patent, by indicating the relative amounts of vitamin E and progesterone.

Lab analysis shows that the products licensed under my patent contain by far the largest amount of progesterone of any product tested, but the important point is that the progesterone is dissolved in vitamin E, and is completely available biologically. Crystalline progesterone isn’t available transdermally, and when it is ingested, it is quickly metabolized by the bowel and the liver, into a derivative of progesterone, which has a certain biological activity, but which is chemically and biologically distinct from progesterone.

A small amount of any herbal saponin, such as those found in the *Dioscorea* yams, may be harmless, but larger amounts can be lethal, by causing hemolysis, and there is also some evidence that it can cause liver damage. The people in Mexico traditionally used the yam for washing clothes and for killing fish. Russell Marker, who created the steroid industry based on the Mexican yam, took a dose of saponin while working on a project in Mexico, and was seriously poisoned. His colleague, Norman Applezweig, said the next day that he looked as if he had “been hit by a truck,” because he was covered by bruises resulting from the hemolytic action of the saponins.
**CONTEXT:** The editor of the Townsend Letter for Doctors & Patients made an editorial change to a chapter from your book on menopause, which reversed your intended meaning regarding the role of progesterone and thyroid in tissue preservation. You are writing to clarify your original statement and address concerns about progesterone cream and yam extracts.
