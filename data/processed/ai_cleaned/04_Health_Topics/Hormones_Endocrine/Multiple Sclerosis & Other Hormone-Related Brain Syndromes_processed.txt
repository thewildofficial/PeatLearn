**RAY PEAT:** The hormones pregnenolone, thyroid, and estrogen are involved in several ways with the changes that occur in multiple sclerosis but no one talks about them.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key hormones involved in the changes seen in multiple sclerosis?

**RAY PEAT:** The process of myelination is known to depend on the thyroid hormone. The myelinating cells are the oligodendroglia (oligodendrocytes) which appear to stop functioning in MS (and sometimes to a milder degree in Alzheimer's disease, and other conditions). The cell's absorption of thyroid hormone is influenced by dietary factors.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of thyroid hormone in myelination and the function of oligodendrocytes?

**RAY PEAT:** The oligodendrocytes are steroid-producing cells, and steroidogenesis is dependent on thyroid hormone, and on thyroid-dependent respiratory enzymes and on the heme-enzyme P-450 scc, which are all sensitive to poisoning by carbon monoxide and cyanide. The steroid produced by the oligodendrocytes is pregnenolone, which is known to have a profound anti-stress action, and which appears to be the main brain-protective steroid.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between oligodendrocytes, steroidogenesis, thyroid hormone, and specific enzymes? What is the primary steroid produced by oligodendrocytes and its function?

**RAY PEAT:** Lesions resembling those of MS can be produced experimentally by carbon monoxide or cyanide-poisoning. The lesions tend to be associated with individual small blood vessels and are likely to contain clots. "Detoxified" cyanide is still toxic to the thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** What environmental toxins can induce lesions similar to those seen in MS, and what is their mechanism of action?

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone and progesterone protect against nerve damage by the excitotoxic amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, monosodium glutamate, aspartame, etc.), while estrogen and cortisol are nerve-destroying, acting through the excitotoxic amino acids. Excitotoxins destroy certain types of nerve, especially the dopaminergic and cholinergic types, leaving the noradrenergic types, paralleling the changes that occur in aging. The clustering of oligodendrocytes around deteriorating nerve cells could represent an adaptive attempt to provide pregnenolone to injured nerve cells.

**CONTEXT:** How do pregnenolone, progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol affect nerve cells in relation to excitotoxic amino acids? What is the potential role of oligodendrocytes in protecting injured nerve cells?

**RAY PEAT:** The involvement of hormones and environmental factors probably accounts for the intermittent progress of multiple sclerosis. To the extent that the environmental factors can be corrected, the disease can probably be controlled.

**CONTEXT:** What factors likely contribute to the intermittent nature of multiple sclerosis, and what is the potential for controlling the disease?

**RAY PEAT:** Winter's darkness is stressful in a very fundamental way, and like any stress it tends to suppress thyroid function. In the hypothyroid state, any estrogen which is produced tends to accumulate in the body, because of liver sluggishness.

**CONTEXT:** How does winter darkness act as a stressor, and what is its impact on thyroid function and estrogen metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** I began to see that PMS could be controlled by certain things -- extra light, supplements of sodium and magnesium, high quality protein, and correction of deficiencies of thyroid and progesterone. In working on my dissertation, I saw that tissue hypoxia (lower than optimal concentrations of oxygen in the blood) may result from estrogen excess, vitamin E deficiency, or aging. There is a close biological parallel between estrogen-dominance and the other hypoxic states, such as stress/shock, and aging.

**CONTEXT:** What factors can help control PMS, and what is the relationship between estrogen dominance, hypoxia, stress, and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** More recently, it has been found that men with heart disease have abnormally high estrogen, that women using oral contraceptives have higher mortality from heart attack, and that estrogen tends to promote spasm of blood vessels. These reactions are probably related to the physiology of menstruation, in which progesterone withdrawal causes spasms in the spiral arteries of the uterus, producing endometrial anoxia and cell death.

**CONTEXT:** What is the link between elevated estrogen levels, cardiovascular issues, and vascular spasms?

**RAY PEAT:** In toxemia of late pregnancy, or eclampsia, the exaggerated clotting tendency caused by excess estrogen (or by inadequately opposed estrogen, i.e., progesterone deficiency), can cause convulsions and strokes. Vascular spasms could be involved here, too. The stasis caused by the vasospasm would facilitate clotting. The brains of women who have died following eclampsia show massive clotting in the blood vessels, and their livers are characteristically injured, with clots.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen excess or progesterone deficiency contribute to conditions like eclampsia, leading to clotting, convulsions, and strokes?

**RAY PEAT:** Various researchers have demonstrated that the plaques of MS usually occur in the area served by a single blood vessel, and some have suggested that clotting is the cause. MS patients have been found to have an abnormal clotting time, and it has been suggested that an altered diet might be able to correct the clotting tendency.

**CONTEXT:** What is the observed pattern of MS plaques in relation to blood vessels, and what is the proposed role of clotting and dietary intervention?

**RAY PEAT:** Protein deficiency causes an adaptive decrease in thyroid function, which leads to a compensatory increase in adrenaline and cortisone. The combination of high estrogen with high adrenaline increases the tendency for both clots and spasms of the blood vessels.

**CONTEXT:** How does protein deficiency impact thyroid function, adrenaline, cortisone, and the risk of blood clots and vascular spasms in conjunction with estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** In experimental poisoning of animals with carbon monoxide or cyanide, the brain lesions resembling MS include blood clots. The patchy distribution of these spots in the brain suggests that the clotting is secondary to metabolic damage in the brain. Presumably, the same would be true in ordinary MS, with clots and spasms being induced in certain areas by metabolic abnormalities in brain cells. The injured cells that are responsible for myelination of nerve fibers are steroid-forming cells. A failure to secrete their protective pregnenolone could cause a local spasm of a blood vessel. The circulatory problem would exacerbate the respiratory problem. Steroid production is dependent on NADH and NADPH, and so requires adequate energy supplies and energy metabolism. The phenomenon of blood-sludging, studied by M. Knisely at the University of Chicago in the 1930s and 1940s, is apparently a general result of decreased energy metabolism, and is likely to be a factor in energy-and-circulatory vicious circles.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed mechanism linking metabolic damage in brain cells, blood clots, vascular spasms, and the failure of steroid secretion by myelinating cells in MS?

**RAY PEAT:** When they tried taking a thyroid supplement, all of their symptoms disappeared, including those that had led to their MS diagnosis. One of the women went to her doctor to tell him that she felt perfectly healthy since taking thyroid, and he told her to stop taking it, because people who have MS need a lot of rest, and she wouldn't get enough rest if she was living in a normally active way. The assumption seemed to be that the diagnosis was more important than the person. When I refer to a "thyroid supplement" I mean one that contains some T3. Many people experience "neurological symptoms" when they take thyroxine by itself. Experimentally, it has been found to suppress brain respiration, probably by diluting the T3 that was already present in the brain tissue.

**CONTEXT:** What was the outcome when individuals diagnosed with MS took thyroid supplements containing T3, and what is the potential issue with using thyroxine alone?

**RAY PEAT:** The rate-regulating step in steroid synthesis involves the entry of cholesterol into the mitochondria, where the heme-enzyme P-450 scc then removes the side-chain of cholesterol (by introducing oxygen atoms), to produce pregnenolone. This enzyme can be poisoned by carbon monoxide or cyanide, and light can eliminate the poison; this could be one aspect of the winter-sickness problem.

**CONTEXT:** What is the critical step in steroid synthesis, and how can it be inhibited by toxins and potentially mitigated by light?

**RAY PEAT:** I think of the issue of "saltatory conduction at the nodes of Ranvier" as another of the fetish ideas that have served to obstruct progress in biology in the United States. A more realistic approach to nerve function can be found in Gilbert Ling's work. Ling has demonstrated in many ways that the ruling dogma of "cell membrane" function isn't coherently based on fact. He found that hormones such as progesterone regulate the energetic and structural stability of cells. Many people, unaware of his work, have felt that it was necessary to argue against the idea that there are anesthetic steroids with generalized protective functions, because of their commitment to a textbook dogma of "cell membrane" physiology.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's critique of the prevailing understanding of nerve conduction and cell membrane function, and what alternative perspective is offered by Gilbert Ling's work regarding hormones and cell stability?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the myelinating cells do have relevance to nerve conduction, but I don't think they serve primarily as electrical insulators. If the adrenal cortex were inside the heart, it would be obvious to ask whether its hormones aren't important for the heart's function. Since the oligodendrocytes are steroid-synthesizers, it seems obvious to ask whether their production of pregnenolone in response to stress or fatigue isn't relevant to the conduction processes of the nerves they surround.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's view on the primary function of myelinating cells in nerve conduction, and what is the proposed role of oligodendrocyte-produced pregnenolone?

**RAY PEAT:** In old age the brain steroids fall to about 5% of their level in youth. Pregnenolone and DHEA improve memory in old rats, and improve mood stability and mental clarity of old people. Pregnenolone's action in improving the sense of being able to cope with challenges probably reflects a quieting and coordinating of the "sequencing" apparatus of the forebrain, which is the area most sensitive to energy deprivation. This is the area that malfunctions in hyperactive and "dyslexic" children. Weakening of the sequencing and sorting processes probably explains the common old-age inability to extract important sounds from environmental noise, creating a kind of "confusion deafness." Insomnia, worry and "restless legs" at bedtime are problems for many old people, and I think they are variations of the basic energy-depletion problem.

**CONTEXT:** How do brain steroid levels change with age, and what are the effects of pregnenolone and DHEA on cognitive function and age-related issues?

**RAY PEAT:** The oligodendrocytes were reported (Hiroisi and Lee, 1936) to be the source of the senile plaques or amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease. Hiroisi and Lee showed the cells in different stages of degeneration, ending with translucent "mucoid" spots that stained the same as amyloid, the material in the senile plaques. This type of cell also appears to form a halo or crown around degenerating nerve cells -- possibly in a protective reaction to provide the nerve cell with any pregnenolone the oligodendrocytes are able to make. The oligodendrocytes, the source of the brain steroids (that people previously believed came from the adrenals and gonads, and were just stored in the brain), myelinate nerve fibers under the influence of thyroid hormone. Thyroid is responsible for both myelination and hormone formation.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed role of oligodendrocytes in the formation of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, and what is their relationship with thyroid hormone in myelination and steroid production?

**RAY PEAT:** These differences suggest the possibility that Alzheimer's disease involves a specific premature loss of brain pregnenolone production, but not of thyroid. Recent work suggests a central role for pregnenolone and progesterone in the regulation of consciousness, and possibly in the brain's detoxifying system. Elsewhere, I have suggested that vitamin A deficiency might cause the excessive production of the "amyloid" protein. A vitamin A deficiency severely inhibits steroid synthesis. It is used so massively in steroid synthesis that a progesterone supplement can prevent the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency. I suspect that vitamin A is necessary for the side-chain cleavage that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. Iron-stimulated lipid peroxidation is known to block steroid formation, and vitamin A is very susceptible to destruction by iron and oxidation. Iron tends to accumulate in tissues with aging.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential differences in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease compared to MS, and what is the proposed role of vitamin A, iron, and lipid peroxidation in steroid synthesis and amyloid production?

**RAY PEAT:** If MS involves a deficiency of thyroid (or of T3 within the oligodendrocytes, where T3 normally can be made from thyroxine; many things, including protein deficiency, can block the conversion of T4 to T3), those cells would necessarily be deficient in their ability to produce pregnenolone, but in young people the brain would still be receiving a little pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA from the adrenals and gonads. This relatively abundant youthful supply of hormones would keep most of the body's organs in good condition, and could keep the bodies of the major brain cells from deteriorating. But if proper functioning of the nerve fibers requires that they be fed a relatively high concentration of pregnenolone from their immediately adjacent neighbors (with the amount increasing during stress and fatigue), then their function would be impaired when they had to depend on the hormones that arrived from the bloodstream.

**CONTEXT:** How might a deficiency in thyroid hormone or T3 within oligodendrocytes lead to impaired pregnenolone production in MS, and how does this compare to the hormonal support available in younger individuals?

**RAY PEAT:** In menopause, certain nerve cells have lost their ability to regulate the ovaries, because of prolonged exposure to estrogen. The cells that fail as a result of prolonged estrogen exposure aren't the same cells that fail from prolonged exposure to the glucocorticoids, but they have in common the factor of excitatory injury.

**CONTEXT:** How does prolonged estrogen exposure affect nerve cells and their ability to regulate ovarian function, and what is the common mechanism of injury with glucocorticoids?

**RAY PEAT:** Since people who experience premature menopause are known to be more likely than average to die prematurely, it is reasonable to view menopause as a model of the aging process. It is now well established that progesterone fails to be produced at the onset of menopause (the first missed period, increased loss of calcium, symptoms such as hot flashes, etc.), and that estrogen continues to be produced at monthly intervals for about four years. The essential question for aging, in the present context, is why the anesthetic steroids are no longer produced at a rate that allows them to protect tissues, including brain cells, from the excitotoxins. Using menopause as a model for aging, we can make the question more answerable by asking why progesterone stops being produced.

**CONTEXT:** How can menopause serve as a model for aging, and what is the critical question regarding the decline of "anesthetic steroids" and the cessation of progesterone production?

**RAY PEAT:** During stress, we are designed not to get pregnant, and the simplest aspect of this is that ACTH, besides stimulating the adrenals to produce stress-related hormones, inhibits the production of progesterone by the ovary. Other stress-induced factors, such as increased prolactin and decreased thyroid, also inhibit progesterone production. Stress eventually makes us more susceptible to stress. Menopause and other landmarks of aging simply represent upward inflections in the rate-of-aging curve. Individual variations in type of stress, hormonal response and diet, etc., probably govern the nature of the aging process in an individual.

**CONTEXT:** How does stress, mediated by ACTH, prolactin, and thyroid function, inhibit progesterone production and contribute to aging?

**RAY PEAT:** The amphetamine-like action of estrogen, which undoubtedly contributes to the general level of stress and excitotoxic abuse of nerve cells, is probably the only "useful" facet of estrogen treatment, but a little cocaine might achieve the same effect with no more harm, possibly less. The toxicity of catecholamines has been known for over 30 years, and conversion to catechol-estrogens which increase the activity of brain catecholamines. Estrogen's powerful ability to nullify learning seems never to be mentioned by the people who promote its use. The importance of a good balance of brain steroids for mood, attention, memory, and reasoning is starting to be recognized, but powerful economic forces militate against its general acceptance.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's view on the "useful" aspects of estrogen, its relationship to catecholamines and excitotoxicity, and the barriers to recognizing the importance of balanced brain steroids?

**RAY PEAT:** Since the brain is the organ that can allow us to adapt without undergoing stress in the hormonal sense, it is very important to protect its flexibility and to keep its energy level high, so it can work in a relaxed way. It is the low energy cellular state that leads to the retention of calcium and iron, and to the production of age pigment, and other changes that constitute the vicious circle of aging. And mental activity that challenges obsession and rigidity might be the most important brain energizer. Pseudo-optimism, humor-as-therapy, has a certain value, but a deeper optimism involves a willingness to assimilate new information and to change plans accordingly.

**CONTEXT:** How can the brain's adaptability be supported, and what are the consequences of a low energy cellular state in the context of aging?

**RAY PEAT:** Nutritional supplements that might help to prevent or correct these brain syndromes include: Vitamin E and coconut oil; vitamin A; magnesium, sodium; thyroid which includes T3; large amounts of animal protein, especially eggs; sulfur, such as magnesium sulfate or flowers of sulfur, but not to take continuously, because of sulfur's interference with copper absorption; pregnenolone; progesterone if needed. Bright light, weak in the blue end of the spectrum and with protection against ultraviolet, activates respiratory metabolism and quenches free radicals. Raw carrot fiber and/or laxatives if needed; charcoal occasionally for gas or bowel irritation. Coconut oil serves several purposes. Its butyric acid is known to increase T3 uptake by glial cells. It has a general pro-thyroid action, for example by diluting and displacing antithyroid unsaturated oils, its short-and medium-chain fatty acids sustain blood sugar and have anti-allergic actions, and it protects mitochondria against stress injury.

**CONTEXT:** What specific nutritional supplements and lifestyle interventions are recommended for preventing or correcting brain syndromes, and what are the benefits of coconut oil?

**RAY PEAT:** I described my suspicion that ALS involved defective metabolism or regulation of testosterone. In some tissues, testosterone is selectively concentrated to prevent atrophy, and ALS is a disease of middle-age, when hormone regulation often becomes a special problem. In the late 1970s, there was discussion of a higher incidence of ALS in males, and especially in athletes I told her about progesterone's general protective effects, its antagonism to testosterone, and its prevention of atrophy in various tissues. She decided to ask her doctor to try progesterone for her husband Later, I learned that her husband had gone into a very rapid decline immediately after the injection, and died within a week; the physician had given him testosterone, since, he said, "testosterone and progesterone are both male hormones." Besides making me more aware of the problems patients have in communicating with physicians, this tended to reinforce my feeling that a hormone imbalance is involved in ALS. Although I haven't written much about testosterone's toxicity, Marian Diamond's work showed that prenatal testosterone is similar to prenatal estrogen, in causing decreased thickness of the cortex of the brain; both of those hormones oppose progesterone's brain-protecting and brain-promoting actions.

**CONTEXT:** What is the author's suspicion regarding the role of testosterone and progesterone in ALS, and what is the significance of the misadministration of testosterone in a patient case?
