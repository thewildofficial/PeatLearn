**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen steals oxygen from mitochondria, shifting patterns of growth and adaptation.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental mechanism by which estrogen impacts cellular function and adaptation?

**RAY PEAT:** In good health, an animal's systems are designed so that certain tissues will be intensely but briefly stimulated by estrogen. This stimulation by estrogen doesn't produce the normal amount of carbon dioxide, so the tissue experiences oxygen deprivation, leading to swelling and cell division. Along with the reduced carbon dioxide production, there is increased lipid peroxidation. Any similar stimulation, whether it's produced by soot, or suffocation, or irradiation, will produce the broad range of estrogen's effects, beginning with inflammation but ending with atrophy or cancer if it is too prolonged.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's stimulation of tissues lead to negative outcomes like inflammation, atrophy, or cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the maladies caused by estrogen excess appear to develop in the same way that it interferes with pregnancy, by driving the tissue to require more energy and oxygen than can be delivered to it. Necrosis, the death of sections of tissue, was produced acutely by extreme overdoses of estrogen, or gradually by less extreme overdoses, and if the estrogenic stimulation was milder but very prolonged, the result would usually be tumors, sometimes developing in the midst of atrophy or necrosis.

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which estrogen excess leads to tissue death and tumor formation?

**RAY PEAT:** In the case of the embryo that can't implant in the aged or estrogenized uterus, it is because oxygen is being consumed so fast by the uterus that very little is available for the embryo. The uterus is, effectively, in an inflamed state, and the embryo is in a state that requires abundant oxygen. The general loss of tissue that Toth associated with increased estrogen follows many of the same steps that occur in the failure of the embryo to implant in the uterus: Glycogen is depleted in futile oxidative cycles, protein synthesis is inhibited, lipid peroxides and free radicals accumulate, cellular defensive and repair processes replace normal functioning.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's impact on oxygen utilization in the uterus relate to the broader process of aging and tissue dysfunction?

**RAY PEAT:** With aging, the loss of glycogen in the brain has serious consequences, including insomnia. Estrogen's depletion of glycogen in other tissues is probably important for their functioning, and thyroid and progesterone are known to help maintain the glycogen stores.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of glycogen depletion by estrogen, and how do thyroid and progesterone counteract this?

**RAY PEAT:** In the last few years, according to the medical literature estrogen would seem to have outgrown nearly all of its bad traits. It protects the brain, the heart, the blood vessels, even the fetus, and it prevents many kinds of cancer, and improves memory, mood, and immunity. And it would still seem to be of great promise in treating breast cancer and prostate cancer, if we took some medical journals seriously. It achieves many of these nice things by functioning as an antioxidant and by increasing circulation, often acting through nitric oxide and serotonin or melatonin. Even though I have read thousands of the articles that said otherwise, the near unanimity of the current research literature can almost give me the feeling that things might not be exactly as they had seemed.

**CONTEXT:** What is the prevailing, yet potentially misleading, view of estrogen's benefits in current medical literature?

**RAY PEAT:** In fact they aren't, but the change is in what passes for science, rather than in the way organisms respond to estrogen. Many little pictures are being presented, that seem to add up to a very different big picture. It is clear that this new picture is being painted by those who fund the research, and by some of those whose careers depend on that funding. The people who do the odd little studies of estrogen and cytokines, nitric oxide, regulatory genes, and so on, are usually getting the data they claim to get, and if they draw speculative conclusions about what their study means medically, that's their privilege. But hundreds of these little publications that would be harmless individually, add up to national policy endorsed by the FDA and other powerful agencies--they add up to the same sort of criminal conspiracy that the tobacco industry and its researchers perpretrated throughout the twentieth century.

**CONTEXT:** What is the critique of modern estrogen research and its influence on national policy?

**RAY PEAT:** Journals that are considered to be the best in their field publish many papers that simply misrepresent some of the basic facts, while interpreting experimental results that would otherwise have unpleasant commercial implications. For example, the follicular phase is a time of low steroid production by the ovary, until near the end of the phase, just before ovulation, when estrogen rises. The luteal phase is a time of high estrogen and high progesterone synthesis. Many publications describe the follicular phase as a time of high estrogen, and the luteal phase as a time of low estrogen, roughly the opposite of the actual situation. And an even larger number of studies get the results they want by using a short exposure to estrogen to study something which takes a long time to develop.

**CONTEXT:** How do scientific publications often misrepresent the hormonal profiles of the menstrual cycle and the effects of estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** In the last few years, one of the most common tricks of estrogen promotion is to argue that estrogen protects against heart disease and Alzheimer's disease because it relaxes blood vessels, by increasing the formation of nitric oxide. It does generally increase the formation of nitric oxide, but nitric oxide is a toxic free radical that plays a major role in degenerative diseases. And the inappropriate relaxation of blood vessels, coupled with increased clottability of the blood, is a major cause of pulmonary embolisms and venous disorders.

**CONTEXT:** What is the problematic interpretation of estrogen's effect on blood vessels and nitric oxide?

**RAY PEAT:** In studies of tendons, excess estrogen, aging, and cooking (the phenomenon of the curling pork chop) all caused hardening and contraction of the collagen. When people get to be 90 or 100 years old, the opening between their eyelids is sometimes contracted, presumably because of this process of collagen shrinkage. If this shrinkage of connective tissue affects the large blood vessels, they become narrower and stiffer, so that the blood has to travel faster if the same amount is to be delivered in the same time.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen contribute to the stiffening and contraction of connective tissues, impacting vascular function?

**RAY PEAT:** Ultrasound can be used to measure the velocity of the blood flow, and increased velocity will correspond to constriction of the channel, if the same amount of blood is being delivered. But many people praise estrogen's vascular benefits on the basis of tests showing increased blood velocity in large arteries such as the aorta, without evidence that more blood is being circulated. With aging, as arteries become constricted, increased blood velocity is taken as evidence of the pathology. Velocity measurements have to be interpreted in the contexts of tissue perfusion, cardiac output, etc. When the diameter of the artery is considered along with the velocity of the blood, the volume of flow can be determined, and then it appears that progesterone increases blood flow, while estrogen can decrease it. [Dickey and Hower, 1996.] This would be consistent with the known ability of an estrogen excess to cause retarded growth of the fetus, as well as specific birth defects.

**CONTEXT:** How is blood velocity measurement misinterpreted as a benefit of estrogen, and what is the actual effect of estrogen and progesterone on blood flow?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen does increase the blood flow to particular organs, but apparently less than it increases their oxygen demand, as can be seen from the color change of estrogenized tissues, toward purple, rather than pink. Measurements of oxygen tension in the tissue show that estrogen decreases the relative availability of oxygen. And when the level of estrogen is very high, metabolically demanding tissues, such as the kidney and adrenal cortex, simply die, especially under conditions that restrict blood flow. [E.g., Kocsis, et al., 1988, McCaig, et al., 1998, Yang, et al., 1999.] When estrogen's effects overlap with the stimulating effects of other hormones, such as pituitary hormones, particular organs undergo something similar to “excitotoxicity.” When estrogen overlaps with endotoxin (as it tends to do), multiple organ failure is the result.

**CONTEXT:** What is the observable and measurable impact of estrogen on tissue oxygenation and the viability of organs?

**RAY PEAT:** The simple need for more oxygen is a stimulus to increase the growth of blood vessels, and estrogen's stimulation of non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption with the production of lactic acid stimulates blood vessel formation. Progesterone, by increasing oxidative efficiency, opposes this “angiogenic” (neovascularization) effect of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen and progesterone differentially influence blood vessel formation (angiogenesis)?

**RAY PEAT:** He showed that estrogen excess prevents the increase of stroke volume as the speed increases, but that progesterone increases the stroke volume as the heart accelerates, making pumping more effective without unnecessary acceleration of the heart rate. These effects are parallel to Selye's observation that estrogen imitates the shock reaction.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen and progesterone affect the heart's pumping efficiency and its response to increased demand, drawing a parallel to the shock reaction?

**RAY PEAT:** In shock, the blood pressure decreases, mainly because the blood volume decreases. Water is taken up by the tissues, out of the blood. Much of the remaining blood volume is accumulated in the relaxed veins, and little is returned to the heart, yet the increased need for circulation accelerates the heart, causing each stroke to pump only a small amount. The reduced blood pressure caused many people to think that adrenaline would help to improve the circulation, but actually the “resistance arteries,” small arteries that provide blood to the arterioles and capillaries, are constricted in shock, (Lin, et al., 1998,) and adrenaline usually makes the situation worse. When tissue is poorly oxygenated (or is exposed to estrogen) it takes up water, swelling and becoming more rigid, turgid. (It also takes up calcium, especially under the influence of estrogen, causing muscles to contract.) This swelling effect will be much more noticeable in small arteries than in major arteries with very large channels, but when the effect is prolonged, it will affect even the heart, causing it to “stiffen,” weakening its ability to pump. There is some evidence that estrogen can make large arteries stiffen, over a span of a few months. (Giltay, et al., 1999)

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's effect on tissue oxygenation and water/calcium uptake mimic the physiological changes seen in shock?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen, by creating an oxygen deficiency, stimulates first swelling, and then collagen synthesis. Collagen tends to accumulate with aging.

**CONTEXT:** What is the link between estrogen-induced oxygen deficiency, tissue swelling, and collagen accumulation in aging?

**RAY PEAT:** In shock, the cells are in a very low energy state, and infusions of ATP have been found to be therapeutic, but simple hypertonic solutions of glucose and salt are probably safer, and are very effective. The low energy of cells causes them to take up water, but it also causes the veins (which always receive blood after most of its oxygen and nutrients have been extracted) to lose their tone, allowing blood to pool in them, instead of returning to the heart. (Abel and Longnecker, 1978) This contributes to varicose veins (Ciardullo, et al., 2000), and to orthostatic hypotension, which is seen in women who are exposed to too much estrogen, and very frequently in old people.

**CONTEXT:** How do the energy deficits caused by estrogen excess lead to conditions like varicose veins and orthostatic hypotension, and what are the therapeutic implications?

**RAY PEAT:** The energy failure resulting from estrogen excess has been remarkably well characterized (but the meaning of this for the cell hasn't been explored). The electron transfer process of the mitochondria is interrupted by the futile redox cycling catalyzed by estrogens.

**CONTEXT:** What is the specific mitochondrial mechanism by which estrogen causes energy failure?

**RAY PEAT:** Good sleep requires fairly vigorous metabolism and a normal body temperature. In old age, the metabolic rate is decreased, and sleep becomes defective. Protein synthesis declines with aging, as the metabolic rate slows. At least in the brain, protein synthesis occurs most rapidly in deep sleep. [Nakanishi, et al., 1997; Ramm and Smith, 1990]

**CONTEXT:** How does aging affect metabolism, sleep, and protein synthesis, and what is the role of sleep in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** In old age, the catabolic hormones such as cortisol are relatively dominant [Deuschle, et al., 1998], and even in youth, cortisol rises during darkness, reaching its peak around dawn. Even in young women, bone loss occurs almost entirely during the night, when cortisol is high. The hormones that are commonly said to prevent bone loss, estrogen and growth hormone, are high at night, rising along with cortisol. Estrogen causes growth hormone to increase, and in the morning, young women's growth hormone has been found to be 28 times higher than men's.[Engstrom, et al., 1999] The growth hormone response to estrogen is probably the result of the changed use of glucose under estrogen's influence, making it necessary to mobilize free fatty acids from tissues. While estrogen is usually highest at night, progesterone is lowest during the night. These observations should suggest that progesterone, not estrogen, is the bone protective substance.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cortisol, estrogen, growth hormone, and progesterone in bone metabolism, particularly concerning nocturnal bone loss and gender differences?

**RAY PEAT:** The disappearance of water from the blood, as it moves into the tissues during the night, makes sleep resemble a state of shock or inflammation. Since rats, that are active at night, experience the same blood thickening, it's actually the darkness, rather than sleep, that creates this “inflammatory” state. Estrogen increases, and acts through, the inflammatory mediators, serotonin and histamine, to increase vascular leakiness, at the same time that it causes cells to take up water and calcium. The formation of lactic acid, in place of carbon dioxide, tends to coordinate these effects.

**CONTEXT:** How does the physiological state during sleep and darkness contribute to an "inflammatory" state, and what role does estrogen play in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** In sleep, as in shock, hyperventilation is common, and it sometimes produces extreme vasoconstriction, because of the loss of carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between sleep, shock, hyperventilation, and vasoconstriction due to carbon dioxide loss?

**RAY PEAT:** Since glucose and salt are used to treat shock (intravenous 7.5% salt solutions are effective), it seems appropriate to use carbohydrate (preferably sugar, rather than starch) and salty foods during the night, to minimize the stress reaction. They lower adrenalin and cortisol, and help to maintain the volume and fluidity of blood. Thyroid, to maintain adequate carbon dioxide, is often all it takes to improve the blood levels of salt, glucose, and adrenalin.

**CONTEXT:** What dietary and hormonal strategies can mitigate the stress reaction during the night, drawing parallels to shock treatment?

**RAY PEAT:** Temperature falls during sleep. Recent experiments show that hypothermia during surgery exacerbates the edema produced by stress, and that hypertonic (hyperosmotic or hyperoncotic) solutions alleviate the swelling. It is possible that light's action directly on the cells helps them to prevent swelling, and that the body's infrared emissions have a similar function. Whatever the mechanism is, adequate temperature improves sleep, and an excessive nocturnal temperature drop probably increases edema, with all of its harmful consequences.

**CONTEXT:** How does body temperature regulation during sleep, and the potential effects of light and infrared radiation, relate to edema and overall health?

**RAY PEAT:** At least some of the redox cycles involving NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH keep electrons from moving beyond ubiquinone (coQ10) and energizing the mitochondria. The cycle that makes nitric oxide is one of these, but some forms of estrogen participate directly as catalysts in this energy-stealing process. One of the effects of blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria is to lower the energy charge of the cells, mimicking the function of the age-damaged mitochondria. Glutathione and protein sulfhydryls are oxidized, because the normal energy pathways that maintain them have been disrupted.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen and nitric oxide production interfere with mitochondrial energy production and lead to cellular energy depletion?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen directly lowers the temperature, while progesterone raises the temperature. Estrogen sets the brain's temperature regulator lower, but, acting through serotonin and other mediators, it can actually lower the metabolic rate, too.

**CONTEXT:** What are the direct and indirect effects of estrogen and progesterone on body temperature and metabolic rate?

**RAY PEAT:** Far from being just the “hormone of estrus,” estrogen, in the form of estradiol and the related steroids, plays a role in organisms as diverse as yeasts, worms and mollusks, and in modifying the function of practically every type of animal cell--skin, nerve, muscle, bone, hair, gland, etc. But, as more and more of its functions come to be understood, it turns out that many toxic chemicals and stressful physical processes can activate the same functions, and that estrogen's association with the functions of stress makes it a kind of window into some universal biological functions.

**CONTEXT:** How has the understanding of estrogen's role evolved beyond its association with estrus, and what does its connection to stress reveal about universal biological functions?

**RAY PEAT:** When Hans Selye brought it to our attention that “stress” was a general life process, he began a process of generalization that led people to be able to see that the changes of aging were also the result of complex interactions between organisms and their environment, rather than some genetic program that operates like a clock running down.

**CONTEXT:** How did Hans Selye's concept of stress as a general life process influence the understanding of aging?

**RAY PEAT:** When W. Donner Denckla demonstrated that the removal of an animal's pituitary (or, in the case of an octopus, its equivalent optic gland) radically extended the animal's life span, he proposed the existence of a death hormone in the pituitary gland. But the case of the octopus makes it clear that the catabolic, death-inducing hormone is produced by the ovary, under the influence of the optic gland's gonadotropins. This sacrifice of “the old” (the individual) for “the new” (the progeny) is analogous to the tissue wasting we see under the influence of estrogen, as it stimulates cell division.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the octopus model in understanding the relationship between the ovary, gonadotropins, and catabolic hormones that contribute to aging and tissue wasting?

**RAY PEAT:** In Selye's classical stress, the destruction of tissues by the catabolic hormones makes sense in terms of the “functional system” described by Anokhin, in which the hormones of adaptation dissolve one tissue for use by the system which is adaptively functioning, with the production of carbon dioxide by the functional tissue, stabilizing it and regulating the adequate delivery of blood.

**CONTEXT:** How does Selye's stress response and Anokhin's functional system explain the role of catabolic hormones in tissue adaptation and blood regulation?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is both an anticatabolic hormone and an antiestrogenic hormone, and in both cases, it protects the functional systems from atrophy.

**CONTEXT:** What are the dual protective roles of progesterone in counteracting catabolism and estrogenic effects?

**RAY PEAT:** The extreme generality of the phenomenon of “estrogenicity” that was built up during the twentieth century has taken the concept beyond the specific functions of estrus, and reproduction, and the activation of genetic programs of the female animal, to make it necessary to see it as a way that living substance responds to certain kinds of stimulus. And these ways of responding turn out to be involved in the complex but coherent ways that organisms respond to aging.

**CONTEXT:** How has the concept of "estrogenicity" broadened to encompass a fundamental response of living substance to stimuli, and how does this relate to aging?

**RAY PEAT:** Selye gave various names to the biology of stress, but the “general adaptation syndrome” expressed the idea accurately. But the biology of estrogenicity, like the biology of aging, is so central that any name is likely to be misleading. The historical accident of naming a hormone for estrus shouldn't keep us from thinking about the way estrogen affects our energetics and structure, and how those processes relate to aging, atrophy, cancerization, etc.

**CONTEXT:** Why is it important to look beyond the name "estrogen" and consider its broader impact on energetics, structure, and aging processes?

**RAY PEAT:** While progesterone is probably the most perfect antiestrogenic hormone, and therefore an anti-stress and anti-aging hormone, the recognition of a wide variety of estrogen's effects has made it possible to adjust many things in our diet and environment to more perfectly oppose the estrogenic and age-accelerating influences.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of progesterone as an antiestrogenic, anti-stress, and anti-aging hormone, and how can we counteract estrogenic and age-accelerating influences?
