**RAY PEAT:** It seems clear that the course of degenerative aging processes is set in young adulthood (or even earlier), and that it is never too early to be concerned with correcting processes that are going in the wrong direction.

**CONTEXT:** The article discusses the long-term effects of estrogen on aging and degenerative processes.

**RAY PEAT:** Aging is an energy problem, and in the brain, which has extremely high energy requirements, interference with the energy supply quickly causes cells to die.

**CONTEXT:** The article is explaining the fundamental mechanism by which estrogen impacts aging.

**RAY PEAT:** I believe that estrogen's "principle," in all of its actions, is to interfere with the respiratory mode of energy production. This is an integrating principle that explains estrogen's immediate, direct effects on cells and organisms, which aren't explained by the idea that it acts on the genes through a specific "estrogen receptor." It explains why estrogen causes cells to take up water, allowing calcium to enter, activating various enzymes and cell division. On the organismic level, it explains why estrogen mimics "shock," releasing histamine and activating the nervous and glandular stress response system. The inefficiency of metabolism which doesn't use oxygen in the normal way causes glucose to be used rapidly, and this in itself is enough to trigger the release of pituitary ACTH and adrenal cortisol. The ACTH, and related hormones, liberate free fatty acids, which cells take up instead of glucose, and this (in the so-called Randall cycle) further limits the body's ability to oxidize glucose.

**CONTEXT:** The article is detailing the proposed mechanism of estrogen's action on cellular energy production and the stress response.

**RAY PEAT:** People have spoken of "cascades" in relation to the adrenal glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) and estrogen, leading to cell damage, but really both of these hormonal cascades have to be seen as part of a more general collapse of adaptive systems, as a result of both chronic and immediate inadequacies of energy production.

**CONTEXT:** The article is connecting estrogen's effects to broader systemic issues of energy production and stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen activates the adrenal stress reaction by way of the hypothalamus and pituitary, by direct actions on the adrenal glands, and by a variety of indirect effects, such as the increase of free fatty acids. It activates the excitotoxic glutamic acid pathway, and interferes with protective adenosine inhibition of nerves. It has both direct and indirect ways of promoting the formation of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. These, and other estrogen-promoted factors, quickly and seriously interfere with mitochondrial respiration. Many of these effects contribute to increased intracellular calcium and free radical production, contributing to both the excitatory excess and the energy deficit.

**CONTEXT:** This section elaborates on the specific pathways through which estrogen triggers stress responses and impairs cellular respiration.

**RAY PEAT:** The biochemical details of these cascades are mainly interesting because they show how many different kinds of stress converge on a few physiological processes--mitochondrial energy production, cellular excitation, and intercellular communication--which, when damaged thousands of times, lead to the familiar states of old age. These few functions, damaged by an infinite variety of stresses, have their own complexly adaptive ways of deteriorating, producing the various degenerative diseases.

**CONTEXT:** This statement provides a unifying perspective on how various stresses, including estrogen, contribute to aging and disease.

**RAY PEAT:** This perspective brings dementia, heart failure, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency and other diseases of aging together, in ways that allow generalized therapeutic and preventive approaches.

**CONTEXT:** The article is highlighting the broad applicability of the discussed bioenergetic principles.

**RAY PEAT:** The antistress, antiestrogen approaches become fundamental to prevention of aging.

**CONTEXT:** This is a key takeaway regarding preventive strategies.

**RAY PEAT:** The pro-estrogenic nature of the unsaturated fatty acids is probably the biggest barrier to the radical elimination of degenerative diseases. Various saturated fatty acids, including butyric, octanoic, and palmitic, have protective effects on mitochondrial respiration.

**CONTEXT:** This highlights a significant dietary factor influencing degenerative diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is the basic brain-protective antiestrogen. It works to protect the brain at many levels (preventing lipid peroxidation, exitotoxicity, nitric oxide damage, energy deficit, edema, etc.) and it promotes repair and recovery.

**CONTEXT:** This introduces progesterone as a key counteracting agent to estrogen's effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone in most cases has effects opposite to estrogen's, improving mitochondrial energy production while preventing excessive excitation. Along with pregnenolone, progesterone is recognized as a neurosteroid with anti-excitotoxic actions, with the ability to promote repair and regeneration of the nervous system. (Roof, Stein, Faden; Schumacher, et al.; Baulieu.)

**CONTEXT:** This further details the beneficial actions of progesterone, referencing scientific support.

**RAY PEAT:** The use of aspirin, which reduces inflammation and inhibits the formation of neurotoxic prostaglandins, is known to be associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease, and in other contexts, it offers protection against estrogen. Naloxone, the antiendorphin, has been found to reverse some of the cumulative effects of stress, restoring some pituitary and ovarian function, and it promotes recovery after brain injury; in a variety of ways, it corrects some of estrogen's toxic effects.

**CONTEXT:** This mentions other substances with protective effects against estrogen's damage.

**RAY PEAT:** Adenosine helps to maintain brain glycogen stores, which are lost in stress and aging. Vitamin B12 protects against nitric oxide, and improves alertness.

**CONTEXT:** This provides additional nutritional and supplemental recommendations.

**RAY PEAT:** Pyruvic acid has brain-protective effects, apparently through its decarboxylation (producing carbon dioxide) rather than through its use as an energy source, since other ketoacids are similarly protective. (The ketoacids occur in some natural foods.) The directly brain-protective effect of carbon dioxide offers many clues that should be interpreted in relation to estrogen's toxicity, since many of their effects on nerves are opposite. Estrogen blocks the production of energy while it stimulates nerve cells to use energy more rapidly, and carbon dioxide promotes the production of energy, while restraining the excitation which expends energy. The presence of carbon dioxide is an indicator of proper mitochondrial respiratory functioning.

**CONTEXT:** This explains the neuroprotective role of pyruvic acid and carbon dioxide, contrasting their effects with estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** Pharmaceutical blockers of glutamic acid transmission, and of calcium and sodium uptake, prevent some deterioration following brain injury, but the most physiological way to protect against those toxic processes is to maintain metabolic energy at a high level. Magnesium, which is protective against excitatory damage and is a calcium antagonist, tends to be retained in proportion to the activity of thyroid hormone.

**CONTEXT:** This discusses broader strategies for protecting against neurotoxicity, emphasizing metabolic energy and magnesium.

**RAY PEAT:** As I have discussed previously, progesterone alone has brought people out of post-epileptic dementia and senile dementia, but it is reasonable to use a combined physiological approach, including thyroid.

**CONTEXT:** This reiterates the importance of progesterone and introduces thyroid hormone as a complementary therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** Besides providing new insights into biological energy and aging, the recognition that estrogen activates the stress hormone system--the pituitary-adrenal system--also provides clear insights into other problems, such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, hirsutism, adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's disease, etc.

**CONTEXT:** This broadens the scope of estrogen's impact to include other endocrine and hormonal disorders.
