**RAY PEAT:** "The pharmaceutical industry has a long history of lying about natural progesterone (and many other natural substances), to promote sales of their competing products. The price ratio of retail estrogen tablets to bulk estrogen can be 1000 to 1, while the ratio for progesterone products is often less than 10 to 1. With the increased use of progesterone (its sales in the US have increased more than 100-fold), the estrogen industry has had to develop new kinds of attack. A small shift of the market away from estrogen costs the drug industry hundreds of millions of dollars. The loss of estrogen sales following the 2002 WHI study, that convincingly demonstrated its toxicity, was huge, with the decreased sales of Wyeth alone amounting to billions of dollars. Wyeth has petitioned the FDA to prevent compounding pharmacies from selling the natural hormones."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion centers on the pharmaceutical industry's efforts to discredit progesterone and promote estrogen, particularly in light of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study.

**RAY PEAT:** "People who have made a career of research that, according to them, reveals the 'benefits' of estrogen have, in recent years, expanded their work to argue that it is progesterone, rather than estrogen, that causes diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and cancer."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the industry's strategy of shifting blame for estrogen's negative effects onto progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "The EPA currently has a document draft on the internet which, in relation to the evaluation of a carcinogenic herbicide, reviews the issue of the balance between estrogen and progesterone in the development of cancer in rats, and includes the observation that progesterone is not carcinogenic to rats, and that it instead is protective against cancer, because of its antiestrogenic effects."

**CONTEXT:** This points to scientific evidence contradicting the claims against progesterone, even within regulatory bodies.

**RAY PEAT:** "California's regulatory board that lists progesterone as a carcinogen cites two bodies that have evaluated carcinogens, the US National Toxicology Program (NTP), and the UN's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), as authoritative sources. One of those, the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) cites the other's, the IARC's, evaluation of progesterone as the basis for its own listing of progesterone, so the opinion of IARC has been very influential."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the origin of the classification of progesterone as a carcinogen, tracing it back to influential international and national agencies.

**RAY PEAT:** "The IARC publications discussed the toxicity of several of the synthetic progestins, and concluded that some of them are possible human carcinogens. The (1987) entry for medroxyprogesterone acetate, for example, has three sections: 'A. Evidence for carcinogenicity to humans (inadequate),' 'B. Evidence for carcinogenicity to animals (sufficient),' and C., that it can damage chromosomes. Eight citations, besides two IARC monographs (1974 and 1979), are given as supporting evidence."

**CONTEXT:** This details the IARC's findings regarding synthetic progestins, differentiating them from natural progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "The entry for progesterone, oddly, has only two sections, 'A. Evidence for carcinogenicity to animals (sufficient),' and B, that it doesn't damage chromosomes. There is no mention of human carcinogenicity at all. Besides the IARC monographs, only one study is mentioned, a test in beagles (I'll comment on the competency of that study below). At the end of the whole section, which included eleven synthetics and progesterone, it concludes: 'Overall evaluation' 'Progestins are possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B),' oddly neglecting to distinguish progesterone from the synthetics."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the flawed methodology and conclusions regarding progesterone by the IARC, particularly its conflation with synthetic progestins.

**RAY PEAT:** "The corruption of the term 'progestin' or 'progestogen' by the industry and the drug regulators has been terribly consequential. The synthetic chemicals classified as progestins often have anti-progesterone actions, and shouldn't be called progestins at all, because they don't support gestation, contrary to what the term falsely implies. It is exactly their anti-progesterone/antigestational action that led to their use as contraceptives."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the critical semantic and scientific error of lumping synthetic progestins with natural progesterone, leading to misinterpretations of their effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "But California's board of 'qualified experts' in the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) identify progesterone as known to cause cancer, and cites the group of studies listed by IARC in the medroxyprogesterone acetate report as their evidence. Rather than trying to clarify the confusions that exist in the IARC documents, this board has compounded the confusion."

**CONTEXT:** This points out how California's regulatory body perpetuated the errors of the IARC by misinterpreting their findings.

**RAY PEAT:** "Edgren, who had argued that progesterone wasn't a carcinogen, said that administering them by injection 'leads to the development of mammary nodules, some of which have the characteristics of malignant tumors, although these tumors rarely metastasize.' A little later, Kilgore said 'I mean, I heard you say that it was rare that it metastasized. I would say any kind of metastasizing is important.' Edgren isn't quoted in the transcript as having attempted to explain that the malignant and metastatic cancers appeared only in beagles treated with synthetic progestins."

**CONTEXT:** This illustrates the confusion and misinterpretation of data regarding synthetic progestins versus natural progesterone in the regulatory committee's discussions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The State's rules explicitly state that all the relevant evidence is to be presented to the committee for consideration, and that the evidence must show clearly, by accepted scientific methods, that a material causes cancer (i.e., malignant tumors) before it can be listed. What is clearly shown by the few papers provided to the committee is that their procedures were not followed at all. Providing publications that didn't even claim to have involved the development of cancer, and ignoring an immense amount of more relevant evidence, the committee, in a parody of legal process, didn't even get a randomly selected sampling of the relevant evidence."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the flawed process by which progesterone was listed as a carcinogen, highlighting the disregard for proper scientific evidence and procedure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Edgren, who had argued that progesterone wasn't a carcinogen, said 'Careful evaluation of data from a properly conducted oral study is a prerequisite before the carcinogenicity of any chemical can be adequately evaluated.' The reason for that statement is that it had become clear in the 1970s and 1980s that the invasive introduction of anything into the body's tissues creates inflammation and a complex series of systemic stress reactions that affect the immune system, and that can lead to the development or promotion of cancer, no matter how inert and innocuous seeming the injected material might be. The people on the committee didn't even discuss that issue. Worse, the studies mentioned by IARC included some that hadn't met basic scientific standards of experimental design, failing to use proper experimental controls, including vehicle controls, and failing to describe the actual composition of the vehicle or solvent used for administering progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the importance of proper experimental design, particularly oral administration and the avoidance of inflammatory injection vehicles, which were neglected in the studies used to classify progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Every good high school science teacher or science student knows that the experimental variables have to be clearly defined. The United Nations' IARC, the US's NTP, and California's Panel of Qualified Experts chose to draw conclusions on some studies that don't meet any standards for testing carcinogens, such as those published by the US government. And while disregarding basic standards of experimental design, their review of the literature had an even more serious flaw--it 'cherry-picked' the published evidence that they apparently preferred, ignoring the studies which, over a period of more than 20 years, showed that progesterone prevents and/or cures tumors. And in an extremely unrepresentative selection of studies on the subject of progesterone's carcinogenicity, the selected studies presented some clear evidence of some of progesterone's anticarcinogenic effects, along with some results that can't be interpreted clearly."

**CONTEXT:** This reiterates the severe methodological flaws, including "cherry-picking" data and ignoring contradictory evidence, used to label progesterone as carcinogenic.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the early papers listed as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity in animals actually concluded that their experiments completely failed 'to produce any beneficial effect by the administration of progesterone on the mammary cancer in mice,' and cautioned that their results showed 'the need for care in attempting to generalize results even in different strains of the same species and emphasizes the difficulty of attempting to carry over results obtained in experimental animals to human pathology.' (Burrows and Hoch-Ligeti, 1946)."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights a specific study cited as evidence of carcinogenicity that actually found no beneficial effect and cautioned against generalizing animal results to humans.

**RAY PEAT:** "The work (demonstrations of the anti-tumor effect of progesterone) that they were not able to confirm had included explicit observations that intermittent injections of progesterone were not effective in preventing tumors or causing them to regress, and emphasized the importance of continuous exposure. Knowing that, the Burrows and Hoch-Ligeti publication appears to have been designed propagandistically to oppose the work that was demonstrating the anti-tumor actions of progesterone, since they--without explanation--used the already discredited method of giving periodic injections of progesterone dissolved in peanut oil."

**CONTEXT:** This explains how a study's methodology (intermittent injections) was known to be ineffective for progesterone's anti-tumor effects, suggesting a deliberate attempt to discredit its benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since the 1920s, many studies had demonstrated that 'spontaneous' cancers increase in proportion to the quantity of polyunsaturated fat (especially linoleic acid) in the diet. By the end of the 1960s, the carcinogenicity of vegetable oils, or at least their 'co-carcinogenicity' or 'tumor promoting' effects had become widely known, and one of the World Health Organization publications observed that progesterone carcinogenicity studies using vegetable oil as the vehicle couldn't be recognized as valid."

**CONTEXT:** This points to the role of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) in promoting cancer and how their use as vehicles in progesterone studies invalidated those findings.

**RAY PEAT:** "More recently, ethanol has been found to antagonize progesterone's anticancer and anti-proliferative actions."

**CONTEXT:** This introduces another factor that can interfere with progesterone's beneficial effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Studies using implanted pellets or plastic tubes containing a solution of progesterone sometimes neglected to even mention the nature of the solvent used. Since implanted pieces of inert materials, such as disks of plastic, could be carcinogenic, it was recognized that a proper control for a hormone-containing pellet or tube would require the implantation of a pellet or tube without the hormone. Sometimes, instead of actually implanting the object, sham surgery, similar to that involved in implantation of the pellet, would be used, in recognition that the surgical trauma itself could have far reaching effects on the organism."

**CONTEXT:** This details critical experimental control issues with implanted devices, emphasizing the need for proper controls to avoid confounding results.

**RAY PEAT:** "Any tissue damage or irritation causes the release of cytokines and mediators of inflammation, which are known to be involved in tissue growth and cancer. When injected, even plain water and other normally harmless things are carcinogenic."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the general principle that tissue damage and inflammation from injections can contribute to cancer, regardless of the injected substance.

**RAY PEAT:** "The need for proper experimental controls when using implanted devices is shown by a study that analyzed the fibrotic tumors that had grown around implanted plastic tubes. Crystals of talc were found in the tumor, that were assumed to have originated from the surgical gloves used during the operation. Talc is now widely recognized as a carcinogen, and is suspected of causing ovarian cancer."

**CONTEXT:** This provides a concrete example of how contaminants from surgical procedures can lead to erroneous conclusions about carcinogenicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1970s, a new method for suspending or dissolving oily chemicals in water was being explored. A cyclic carbohydrate, cyclodextrin, makes it possible to wet substances that are insoluble in water, such as progesterone, even if the substance remains in a solid crystalline form. Several companies were promoting the use of these for the administration of hydrophobic drugs."

**CONTEXT:** This introduces cyclodextrins, a substance used to solubilize drugs, which later proved to have toxic properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1976, D.W. Frank reported that the cyclodextrins produced nephrosis in rats. In 1978, a study by Perrin, et al., reported its toxicity to the kidneys. Twenty years later, Horsky and Pitha at NIH reported that the cyclodextrins can synergize with carcinogens, and in 1982 a group in Japan reported that cyclodextrins can increase the production of kidney cancers by another carcinogen (Hiasa, et al.). The intrinsic carcinogenicity of a more water soluble cyclodextrin, that was considered 'more toxicologically benign,' was found to cause pathological changes in lungs, liver, and kidney, and to increase the formation of tumors in the pancreas and intestines of rats (Gould and Scott, 2005)."

**CONTEXT:** This details the documented toxicity of cyclodextrins, including kidney damage and synergy with carcinogens, which were used in progesterone studies.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1974, D. W. Frank and others at Upjohn had begun testing the effects of progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate in beagle dogs, using an 'aqueous suspension.' Their 1979 publication describing that four year study didn't mention the way in which the 'aqueous solution' had been made, and didn't mention cyclodextrins at all. Frank's published observation during the beagle study that cyclodextrins are toxic to the kidneys suggests that someone at Upjohn had noticed a problem with the 'wetting agent' that was already in use in the beagle study."

**CONTEXT:** This connects the use of cyclodextrins in the Upjohn beagle study with known toxic effects, suggesting a deliberate omission of information.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another remarkable feature of the four year beagle study was that, of 140 dogs that began the intended 7 year study, 28 had died by the time they published the report, and none died of cancer, but the causes of death were not reported. The only experimental group in which there were no deaths by the end of four years was the low dose progesterone group. The dogs in the high dose progesterone group received weekly intramuscular injections of 1140 mg of progesterone suspended in 11.4 ml of 'aqueous vehicle.' 2345 ml of the vehicle was received by each dog during the four years. Only four dogs in that group were still alive at the time of publication, but the cause of death of the other 16 wasn't mentioned. Quarts of a toxic material that had never before been used in this way, injected into their muscles, and the unexplained deaths of so many animals, make this a unique experiment that is unlikely ever to be repeated."

**CONTEXT:** This describes the severe adverse effects and high mortality in the Upjohn beagle study, particularly in the high-dose progesterone group, with unexplained deaths and the use of a toxic vehicle.

**RAY PEAT:** "Their failure to mention injection-site muscle damage is just another indication of the study's low quality."

**CONTEXT:** This further criticizes the Upjohn beagle study for its lack of reporting on injection site damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "At the time of the study, it had been known for many years that interference with the organism's detoxifying systems, especially the liver and kidneys, can contribute to the development of cancer. Although the study was planned to continue for 7 years to meet the FDA requirement, none of the eight authors ever published again on a related topic, and most of them didn't publish again at all."

**CONTEXT:** This points out the lack of follow-up research by the authors of the Upjohn beagle study, suggesting a lack of confidence in their findings or a desire to distance themselves from the shoddy work.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I tried to contact one of the authors, he didn't respond. I assume they were embarrassed by the shoddiness of their methods. Richard Edgren has commented, 'I can't believe how fast and how completely they shut down. They fired people and retrained the rest for other areas.'"

**CONTEXT:** This provides anecdotal evidence of the negative repercussions and likely embarrassment associated with the Upjohn beagle study.

**RAY PEAT:** "But the regulatory agencies have tied their reputations to studies of that sort."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the problematic reliance of regulatory agencies on flawed studies.

**RAY PEAT:** "No malignant cancers were reported in this four-year beagle study. Beagles normally have a high incidence of cancer, especially mammary cancer. In a different study in which 172 beagles were treated with contraceptive hormones, nine of them developed malignant cancers, and of those, five metastasized. (This might be why the chairman of the committee was thinking about metastatic cancer, but if so, he was simply confused, because the issue they were considering was the listing of natural progesterone, which wasn't reported to have produced any malignant or metastatic tumors.)"

**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the findings of the Upjohn beagle study with other studies on beagles, emphasizing that natural progesterone did not cause malignant or metastatic tumors, unlike some contraceptive hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "Two other studies cited by the IARC and other agencies, by Jones and Bern, 1977, and Rebout and Pageaut, hardly seem appropriate studies to support the idea that progesterone is carcinogenic."

**CONTEXT:** This introduces two more studies that are deemed inappropriate for supporting the claim of progesterone's carcinogenicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Jones' and Bern's paper described the production, 12 months after neonatal treatment with progesterone, of vaginal and cervical lesions, and mammary nodules, which are also referred to as tumors. 'Progesterone alone induced cervical lesions in only 1 of 32 mice...and induced vaginal lesions in only 2 or 32 mice. Furthermore, progesterone given with either dose of estrogen to intact mice reduced the incidence of hyperplastic lesions, compared with intact groups treated with estrogen alone.' They commented (page 74) that their results were 'mammary tumor virus dependent,' and that this might account for the production of 'hyperplastic alveolar nodules as opposed to' tumors of possible ductal origin, that had been seen in other studies when the carcinogen DMBA was used. In another 1977 publication, Jones, Bern, and Wong described changes seen when the mice were 1.5 to 2 years old. This later publication appears to clarify the meaning of nodules or tumors in the younger animals: 'Although mammary tumors were observed neither in control nor in progesterone-treated intact mice, many of the latter group possessed hyperplastic alveolar-like mammary nodules and other dysplasias.' Neither of these studies refers to the carcinogenicity of progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** This analyzes the Jones and Bern studies, highlighting that they reported lesions and nodules, not actual cancers, and that the effects were virus-dependent and reduced by progesterone in combination with estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "The 1977 study (at the University of California, Berkeley) was explicitly motivated by Jones' and Bern's concern with the risks of the medical practice of treating pregnant women with DES and a synthetic progestin, and they used mammary tumor virus-bearing mice, and they didn't continue the study to observe the incidence of actual cancers. (Their choice of infant rodents to study progesterone might be questioned, because of earlier work showing that immature rat ovaries are able to convert progesterone to estrogens, unlike the tissues of other animals or humans: Quattropani and Weisz, 1973; Weniger, et al., 1984, later reported similar results.)"

**CONTEXT:** This further critiques the Jones and Bern study, noting its motivation, the use of virus-bearing mice, and the potential for immature rat ovaries to convert progesterone to estrogen, confounding the results.

**RAY PEAT:** "Anyone working with mammary tumor virus-bearing mice in the 1970s should have been aware of the effects of sex hormones on the expression of virus and development of cancer in the infected mice, as studied by Strong, Figge, and others for about 40 years. Excess estrogen causes the virus to be expressed, progesterone opposes its expression."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the critical interaction between sex hormones and the mammary tumor virus, where estrogen promotes viral expression and progesterone inhibits it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Jones and Bern injected the newborn mice with 0.02 ml of sesame oil daily for five days, with or without estrogen and progesterone. A newborn mouse weighs a little over a gram. On a weight and volume basis, this would be like injecting an adult human with more than a quart of sesame oil daily for five days. The proportionate weight of progesterone in an adult human would be several grams per day. This amount of progesterone is far more than the anesthetic dose. Since the authors didn't mention anesthesia, very little of the progesterone could have been absorbed, meaning that deposits of crystals would have remained in their tissues."

**CONTEXT:** This details the extreme dosage and administration method used in the Jones and Bern study, suggesting potential absorption issues and tissue irritation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Tissue irritation from foreign bodies and from vegetable oil, even in relatively small amounts, can produce severe systemic reactions, because of the reactive production of nitric oxide, prostanoids, and a great variety of pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting cytokines."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the mechanism by which tissue irritation, including from vegetable oils, can lead to inflammation and tumor promotion.

**RAY PEAT:** "This study might have had the formal appearance of a scientific experiment, but the unfamiliarity of the men with the material they were using, their use of mice carrying the mammary tumor virus, and, more importantly, the extremely complex reactions produced when extraneous materials are injected into the tissues, make this a useless experiment. The value of Richard Edgren's statement about the need to test carcinogens orally, rather than by injection, is becoming clearer all the time, as the role of irritation in cancer development is being better understood."

**CONTEXT:** This summarizes the critical flaws of the Jones and Bern study, emphasizing the importance of oral testing and the role of irritation in cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "In their second 1977 study, Jones, Bern and Wong reported that at the age of 1.5 to 2 years, nearly two thirds of the progesterone treated mice had genital tract lesions. In another study published in 1977 (Iguchi and Takasugi) neonatal mice were given the same daily amount of progesterone, but for ten days rather than five, giving them twice the dose. These authors reported that there were no permanent changes in the vaginal and uterine epithelium. This study wasn't mentioned by any of the agencies, but it calls the results of the California study into question."

**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the Jones, Bern, and Wong study with the Iguchi and Takasugi study, showing that a higher dose of progesterone for a longer period did not induce permanent changes, thus questioning the California agency's reliance on the former.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a 1973 study by Rebout and Pageaut, progesterone was administered in a pellet, the composition of which was not mentioned, and there was no vehicle control at all. Each mouse received 45 mg of progesterone. The average mouse weighs about 30 grams. Invasive squamous carcinomas were produced by the carcinogen 20-methylcholanthrene, and these were more numerous in the progesterone treated mice. Methylcholanthrene is an extremely hydrophobic, highly irritating hydrocarbon which has often been used to create experimental cancers. The method of administering the carcinogen isn't clearly described: 'Local exposure of carcinogen ... in the cervical canal for 9 weeks ... induced one invasive carcinoma in the vagina-exocervix and five in the endocervix.' It was introduced into the cervical canal, but in what form and how often isn't described. Methylcholanthrene has some estrogenic properties."

**CONTEXT:** This analyzes the Rebout and Pageaut study, highlighting the lack of pellet composition and vehicle control, the use of a known carcinogen with estrogenic properties, and the unclear administration of the carcinogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen increases the production of mucus in the cervix and vagina, and increases its water content and mobility. Abundant and fluid mucus has a cleaning action, eliminating bacteria and other material. Progesterone makes the mucus more viscous and less hydrophilic, and when it dominates the reproductive physiology, it effectively creates a plug in the cervix that prevents the entry of sperms."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the physiological role of estrogen and progesterone in cervical mucus, which is relevant to the Rebout and Pageaut study's focus on the cervix.

**RAY PEAT:** "The choice of the cervix and vagina suggests that the authors were 'engineering' the experimental outcome, because the effect of progesterone on cervical mucus is very well known. To apply the irritant to an area where it would normally be washed away by the mucus, but where it is kept in place by hormonally altering the mucus, is really a way of manipulating how much exposure to the irritating chemical the tissue will receive. It's analogous to studying the 'toxicity' of an antihistamine, by applying a toxin to the nasal membrane of a person with a cold, and then administering the antihistamine to stop the flow of mucus, allowing the membrane to fully absorb the applied dose of toxin."

**CONTEXT:** This argues that the Rebout and Pageaut study's methodology was designed to manipulate the experimental outcome by altering the cervical mucus environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "A different chemical carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was used in another 1973 study (Jabara, et al.), in combination with progesterone. In this experiment, the carcinogen was administered to rats in one dose by stomach tube, dissolved in corn oil. The progesterone was injected subcutaneously in 3 mg doses in corn oil three times per week. Unfortunately, there was no control group in which the corn oil was injected alone. The progesterone was supposedly dissolved in the corn oil, one tenth ml per dose. That amount of progesterone (3% weight/volume) will dissolve in hot corn oil, but as the oil cools, the progesterone crystallizes and precipitates. That creates doubt regarding what the animals were actually receiving."

**CONTEXT:** This details the Jabara et al. study, noting the use of corn oil as a vehicle, the lack of a corn oil control, and the potential for progesterone to precipitate out of the corn oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Corn oil is one of the most effective vegetable oil tumor promoters/carcinogens, and it's now considered improper to use it as a solvent for testing even oral carcinogens, since some chemicals that are carcinogenic in the oil are relatively harmless when administered without the corn oil. The animals got 2 ml of corn oil in the stomach feeding with the carcinogen. One of the groups (group 5) received, in addition, more than 6 ml of corn oil in the injections. The experiment lasted only 135 days, and in the group that received only the carcinogen, the mortality was only 5%, and that death occurred shortly after the carcinogen was administered. All of the groups receiving the corn oil and progesterone injections had higher mortality, two with 25%, one with 37.5% mortality. Despite the unexplained general problem with prematurely dying rats, the authors found that 'The relative incidence rates indicated that pretreatment with progesterone inhibited tumorigenesis, except in the group (5) in which progesterone treatment was continued for the duration of the experiment.' Without progesterone, it is almost certain that the additional corn oil injected would have increased tumorigenesis in all experimental groups."

**CONTEXT:** This analyzes the Jabara et al. study's findings, highlighting the confounding effects of corn oil, the higher mortality in progesterone-treated groups due to the vehicle, and the observation that progesterone inhibited tumorigenesis except in one group.

**RAY PEAT:** "Without that vehicle control group, the experiment can just as well be described as a test of corn oil, rather than of progesterone. If you claim to be testing the capacity of a substance to promote tumors, it shouldn't be administered in a standard tumor promoter."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the Jabara et al. study for its lack of a vehicle control, making it a test of corn oil rather than progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "A 1968 publication by Glucksmann and Cherry was included in the documents offered as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity. Unfortunately, they neglected to identify the vehicle used for giving twice weekly intramuscular injections of 1 mg of progesterone, and they didn't have a vehicle control for the progesterone injections. At that time, the most common vehicle was a mixture of 9% benzyl alcohol and oil, usually sesame or peanut oil. Benzyl alcohol by itself is quite toxic, and was responsible for the death or brain damage of thousands of babies in hospitals, even in the small amounts that remained as residue in tubing after they had been rinsed with 'bacteriostatic water,' which contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol, and which is still used as the vehicle for many injections, such as penicillin and vitamin B12. The antitoxic (or 'catatoxic') action of progesterone greatly reduces the toxicity of benzyl alcohol."

**CONTEXT:** This examines the Glucksmann and Cherry study, noting the unspecified vehicle and lack of control, and the potential toxicity of benzyl alcohol, which progesterone can mitigate.

**RAY PEAT:** "In discussing the effects of hormones on the induction of sarcomas, Glucksmann and Cherry comment that 'The rate of induction of sarcomas in intact rats was slowed down slightly by treatment with progesterone and not significantly increased in spayed animals....' In their Discussion section, they mention several previous studies in relation to their own results, and comment, regarding other studies, that 'The effect of progesterone on the type of induced cervical cancer in mice consists in increasing the columnar component of mixed carcinomas in castrates . . . without materially affecting the induction period and tumour yield. Thus the experimental evidence in rats and mice is not as clearly antitumorigenic as that of Lipschutz (1950) for guinea pigs and the clinical observations (Ulfelder, 1962; Jolles, 1962).'"

**CONTEXT:** This quotes the Glucksmann and Cherry study's findings, which indicated a slight slowing of sarcoma induction by progesterone and acknowledged other studies showing clearer anti-tumorigenic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Comparing this study to that of Burrows and Hoch-Ligetti, the dose of 2 mg per week per rat is lower, on a body-weight basis, than the earlier study's dose of 1 mg per week in mice, but the greater frequency came a little closer to the continuous treatment that Lipschutz said was necessary. This could account for the fact that some of their results were intermediate between those of the Lipschutz group and those of Burrows and Hoch-Ligetti."

**CONTEXT:** This compares the Glucksmann and Cherry study with the Burrows and Hoch-Ligetti study, suggesting that dosage and frequency of administration might explain the differing results.

**RAY PEAT:** "In Glucksmann's and Cherry's results, progesterone retarded one type of tumor and appeared to promote another (an epithelial tumor, which wasn't described as malignant or cancerous), but if the progesterone was dissolved in a tumor promoting solvent, it's impossible to ascribe the effect to progesterone. Vegetable oil applied to epithelium that has been exposed to a carcinogen such as the DMBA they used will typically increase the growth of the tumors. Without information about the vehicle, it's impossible to interpret that part of their results clearly, but anyway, they didn't describe any carcinogenic effect of progesterone; they did, however, describe a clearly anticarcinogenic action."

**CONTEXT:** This analyzes the Glucksmann and Cherry study's findings, noting that while progesterone retarded one tumor type, the use of a potentially tumor-promoting solvent makes the results ambiguous, and importantly, no carcinogenic effect of progesterone was described, only an anticarcinogenic one.

**RAY PEAT:** "A 1962 study, by Capel-Edwards, et al., was intended to compare the effects of prolonged administration of high doses of progesterone with the known toxic effects of synthetic progestagens. They didn't find any malignant tumors, so the study can't be taken as evidence of the carcinogenicity of progesterone. The vehicle used for dissolving the progesterone consisted of benzyl alcohol, ethanol, and ethyl oleate. Some of the solutions contained more than 10% progesterone. When this sort of solution interacts with water in the tissues, it causes the progesterone to crystallize out of solution. The authors reported that 'subcutaneous tissue reactions developed at injection sites,' and that these 'occurred in all animals, including controls, and were apparent for several days after the injection.' These injection-site lesions sometimes developed into 'sterile abscesses which eventually ulcerated and healed.' The only dog that died during the study was in the control group, and although there were 'a number of pathologic findings,' the exact nature of that dog's sickness couldn't be determined. The injections were given daily, for a total of 518 injections in each animal, and each injection contained as much as 4 ml of the vehicle. Almost an ounce per week of this material, combined with the massive irritation produced by crystallization at hundreds of injection sites, would be the most likely explanation for the various inflammatory changes they saw, including osmotic fragility of red blood cells, and as much as a 50% enlargement of liver and kidneys."

**CONTEXT:** This examines the Capel-Edwards study, noting its intention to compare progesterone with synthetic progestagens, the absence of malignant tumors, the use of a vehicle causing tissue reactions, and the potential for the vehicle itself to cause the observed inflammatory changes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although some of the basic ideas about canine physiology that were held when the Capel-Edwards study was designed have been found to be mistaken, and the toxicity of their vehicle can now be seen, and they didn't conclude that progesterone was carcinogenic, their study wasn't the worst of those that have been presented as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity."

**CONTEXT:** This provides a concluding assessment of the Capel-Edwards study, acknowledging its flaws but noting it was not the most egregious example of flawed research used to label progesterone as carcinogenic.

**RAY PEAT:** "When an experimenter doesn't yet have a clear hypothesis, it's reasonable to do some exploratory tests, just to get an orientation to the possibilities so that it's possible to form a well defined hypothesis, before designing an experiment that will test the hypothesis. Sometimes an experimenter and journal editors will allow a merely exploratory experiment to be published. If they don't draw inappropriate conclusions from the ambiguous results, the publication can be justified, simply because it might stimulate others to investigate the subject more thoroughly."

**CONTEXT:** This discusses the role of exploratory research and the importance of not drawing definitive conclusions from ambiguous results.

**RAY PEAT:** "But often editors allow the author to draw conclusions from the experiment that are not directly implied by the data, especially when those conclusions support the editor's prejudices. A conclusion may be consistent with, though not implied by, the results of the experiment. These publications may be effective propaganda, but they aren't good science."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the publication of studies that draw conclusions not supported by the data, especially when those conclusions align with pre-existing biases.

**RAY PEAT:** "But California's OEHHA identifies those eight publications as 'the relevant evidence that clearly shows through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles that progesterone causes cancer.'"

**CONTEXT:** This directly quotes the California agency's justification for listing progesterone as a carcinogen, highlighting the claim of "scientifically valid testing."

**RAY PEAT:** "In their 2004 document, OEHHA mentioned 17 articles that had been submitted regarding progesterone's protective effects. Some of these were identified; two were egregiously misrepresented in a single sentence: Plu-Bureau, et al., were said to have reported 'no association between breast cancer risk and progesterone topically applied for the treatment of mastalgia and benign breast disease...' What Plu-Bureau, et al., said immediately following that was 'Although the combined treatment of oral progestogens with percutaneous progesterone significantly decreased the risk of breast cancer (RR = 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.9) as compared with nonusers, there was no significant difference in the risk of breast cancer in percutaneous progesterone users versus nonusers among oral progestogen users.' (RR means 'relative risk,' or 'risk ratio,' and 0.5 means a 50% reduction in risk.)"

**CONTEXT:** This exposes how the OEHHA misrepresented findings from the Plu-Bureau et al. study, omitting the crucial detail that combined treatment with progesterone significantly decreased breast cancer risk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Cowan, et al. (1981), according to the OEHHA document, reported 'reduced premenopausal breast cancer in women who had a history of progesterone deficiency.' What they actually said was 'These women were categorized as to the cause of infertility into 2 groups, those with endogenous progesterone deficiency (PD) and those with nonhormonal causes (NH). Women in the PD group had 5.4 times the risk of premenopausal breast cancer as compared to women in the NH group. This excess risk could not be explained by differences between the 2 groups in age at menarche or age at menopause, history of oral contraceptive use, history of benign breast diseases, or age at 1st birth. Women in the PD group also experienced a 10-fold increase in deaths from all malignant neoplasm compared to the NH group.'"

**CONTEXT:** This reveals another instance of OEHHA misrepresentation, this time of the Cowan et al. study, which actually showed a significantly *increased* risk of breast cancer in women with progesterone deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ending the paragraph that mentioned those studies, the California document continues: 'However, there is also evidence that progesterone may have a mitogenic effect. For example, Soderqvist et al. (1997) found that in breast cells of healthy women, cell proliferation was correlated with serum progesterone levels, thereby suggesting a proliferative action of progesterone.' Such a suggestion is not made by that 'correlation.' The authors said, 'Our objective was to assess proliferation in normal breast epithelial cells from healthy women during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.' At the beginning of the luteal phase, both estrogen and progesterone normally rise several-fold, so the small increase in proliferative rate also correlates with estrogen levels. A 'defective luteal phase' is common, in which the ratio of estrogen to progesterone is high, and in that case progesterone's well established antiproliferative, differentiative effect will be overridden by estrogen's proliferative stimulation."

**CONTEXT:** This critiques the OEHHA's interpretation of the Soderqvist et al. study, explaining that the observed correlation between progesterone and proliferation is normal during the luteal phase and can be overridden by estrogen's effects, especially in cases of progesterone deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "The state's reviewers didn't comment on the studies which showed that progesterone, besides inhibiting proliferation, also inhibits an 'oncogene' which is associated with cancer, rather than just with proliferation. Instead, they cited a meaningless 'correlation' as if it were some kind of argument against progesterone's anticancer effects. The authors of this document don't seem to know very much about the biology of cancer, but maybe they know too much about the issue of the proliferation of breast epithelium."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the OEHHA for ignoring studies showing progesterone's inhibition of oncogenes and focusing on a misleading correlation, suggesting a bias against progesterone's anticancer properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a paragraph 'rebutting' the petitioner's point that 'This new research supports that exogenous progesterone actually reduces the risk of breast cancer in humans,' the authors don't mention that point at all, but instead refer to cancer treatment and to the various claims relating to progesterone's carcinogenicity, ending with the mention of 'studies that suggest progesterone stimulates cell proliferation (e.g., Soderqvist et al., 1997).' Apparently the authors had no answer to the petitioners' point, and preferred to talk about proliferation of breast cells."

**CONTEXT:** This points out the OEHHA's evasion of the petitioner's argument about progesterone reducing breast cancer risk, instead resorting to discussions of proliferation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Nearing the end of the document, the authors say 'The NCI also reports on other studies of estrogens with progestins, which would suggest that progesterone increases the risk of human breast cancer,' and then quotes comments on studies of estrogens with (synthetic) progestins. The authors cite two more studies with synthetic progestins, and then say 'As discussed above, the mammary gland was a main target site in animal cancer bioassays providing the basis for the IARC and NTP identification of progesterone as carcinogenic.' (The preceding discussion had mentioned the 4 year beagle study--which ended the careers of the researchers--and a 1993 publication by Kordon, et al., which had no control group for reference, and instead compared progesterone with different doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate, finding that the fewest tumors occurred in the progesterone group.)"

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the OEHHA's continued reliance on studies involving synthetic progestins and flawed animal studies to support their claim against progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "The techniques of distortion, diversion and evasion in this document are so obvious that any college composition teacher would have returned it to the student for revision. The document says much more about its authors than about its subject."

**CONTEXT:** This offers a strong critique of the OEHHA document's rhetorical and logical deficiencies.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think this bureaucratic behavior is understandable only if you know the composition of the group that is responsible for the progesterone listing, because the proliferation of breast cells has become an important issue for the group around USC professor Malcolm Pike."

**CONTEXT:** This suggests a conflict of interest and a specific agenda behind the OEHHA's actions, linking it to the work of Malcolm Pike.

**RAY PEAT:** "Around 1980, Malcolm Pike, a statistician from South Africa, working in epidemiology, began arguing that the use of oral contraceptives prevented cancer. This epidemiologist, unfamiliar with steroid physiology except as it filtered through the oral contraceptive industry, decided that progesterone was the primary cause of breast cancer, by stimulating cell division and increasing the tissue density of the breast."

**CONTEXT:** This introduces Malcolm Pike and his controversial theory linking progesterone to breast cancer, based on his limited understanding of steroid physiology and industry influence.

**RAY PEAT:** "This line of reasoning gained adherents in the USC Keck School of Medicine, despite an overwhelming amount of contrary evidence, accumulated over more than 50 years, that progesterone protects against breast cancer, partly by inhibiting cell division, and that increased breast density is significantly associated with breast mitogens, such as serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF), prolactin, and estrogens, rather than with progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** This points out the acceptance of Pike's theory at USC despite substantial evidence to the contrary, emphasizing progesterone's protective role and the association of breast density with estrogen and other mitogens.

**RAY PEAT:** "Breast mitogens correspond to both breast density and the risk of breast cancer (Boyd), but progesterone (antimitogen) corresponds to factors associated with low risk of breast cancer. Progesterone may reduce breast density by inhibiting some growth factors, including IGF, NO (nitric oxide), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), bcl-2 (a protein that inhibits apoptosis), polyamines, and prostaglandins."

**CONTEXT:** This elaborates on the biological mechanisms by which progesterone acts as an antimitogen and reduces breast density, thereby lowering cancer risk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Much of the research at USC's Keck School has been generously funded by pharmaceutical companies with huge interest in estrogen-related products. The medical school website has articles by their faculty that give the impression that they are often more concerned with the fate of the estrogen market than with the science they claim to be doing. For example, commenting on the WHI evidence showing that estrogen helps to cause Alzheimer's disease, professor B.E. Henderson said 'I continue to believe that estrogen therapy may help reduce a woman's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease . . . .' I noticed that there were hundreds of other estrogen-related items on the USC website."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the financial ties between USC's Keck School of Medicine and the pharmaceutical industry, suggesting a bias in their research and public statements regarding estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "The medical school, some of its professors, government agencies, and private companies are involved in some very complex, overlapping activities that give the impression of what used to be called 'conflicts of interest.'"

**CONTEXT:** This summarizes the pervasive conflicts of interest involving various entities in the promotion of estrogen and the suppression of progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Keck School (a private institution), and the company, Balance Pharmaceuticals, Inc., controlled by three of their professors, participate in the business promotion organization operated by the State of California, Larta Institute, which manages Project T2, which is part of a 'commercialization' system, involving awards of federal government money: 'The organization will provide the awardees with assistance in all aspects of commercialization, including business development, funding and capital acquisition, government regulatory processes, intellectual property protection, licensing strategies, and merger and acquisition opportunities. SBIR Phase II is the research and development stage of the well-known program, with award sizes typically starting at $750,000 each.' 'Working with one of the Federal government's largest and most important agencies to assist SBIR awardees on the cusp of commercialization is a natural extension of everything we've done for the past ten years,' said Larta Institute CEO Rohit Shukla."

**CONTEXT:** This details the intricate web of commercialization and government funding involving USC, Balance Pharmaceuticals, and the Larta Institute, which includes assistance with regulatory processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "On California's committee that chooses chemicals to put on their list of 'known carcinogens' is Juliet Singh, who is the chief executive of Trans Pharma Corporation, a company that is developing transdermal drug delivery systems, for example for giving hormones by applying them to the skin. Under California's law, chemicals on the carcinogen list may to sold as drugs without a warning."

**CONTEXT:** This reveals a direct conflict of interest on California's carcinogen committee, with a pharmaceutical executive involved in hormone delivery systems.

**RAY PEAT:** "On the committee with Singh are Anna Wu and Thomas Mack, who co-authored several papers with Malcolm Pike, who was the most visible promoter of the campaign against progesterone, and who with two other USC professors controls Balance Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is being promoted by Larta Institute, and that's planning to market a contraceptive based on the idea of suppressing progesterone. Three USC professors are on California's carcinogen committee, more than from any of the other universities in the state."

**CONTEXT:** This further exposes the concentration of individuals with ties to Malcolm Pike and the pharmaceutical industry on California's carcinogen committee, suggesting a biased decision-making process.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a jury trial, I think this would look like a tainted jury."

**CONTEXT:** This offers a strong analogy to describe the compromised nature of California's carcinogen committee.

**RAY PEAT:** "Comparing the California agency's parody of legitimate process in this instance with its reconsideration in 2002 of its listing of saccharin as a carcinogen is illuminating. In that case, there was at least a pretense that the staff had made an attempt to provide 'all relevant scientific evidence' for the committee to review, as specified by the agency's regulations. And in its decision, the State's Qualified Experts made a point of declaring, according to the language of the law, that in the opinion of the state's qualified experts it had not been 'clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer.' The Committee found that, in this case, it had to use a 'weight of evidence' approach to evaluate the body of information available...."

**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the handling of saccharin with that of progesterone, noting that at least a pretense of due process was made for saccharin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Unfortunately, the committee allowed some bizarre speculations about calcium phosphate to outweigh the fact that saccharin is a mild carcinogen, and in evaluating the rat experiments they were in such a hurry to remove saccharin from the list that they neglected to notice that calcium phosphate precipitation isn't unique to rat urine, but very commonly occurs in human urine. Their decision to remove it from the list rested on that non-fact."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the flawed reasoning used to delist saccharin, highlighting the committee's haste and misinterpretation of scientific data.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although the agency cited 150 studies, and went through the formality of describing some of them in their document, anyone reading the document justifying the delisting of saccharin, and the document rejecting the delisting of progesterone, will find it hard to see a principle of law that could justify removing a carcinogen from the list, because of uncertainty regarding the mechanism by which it causes cancer, and keeping progesterone on the list, despite overwhelming evidence that it protects against cancer, and a great amount of evidence regarding the mechanisms through which the protection occurs."

**CONTEXT:** This draws a stark comparison between the delisting of saccharin and the continued listing of progesterone, highlighting the inconsistent and biased application of scientific principles.

**RAY PEAT:** "The committee of experts who 'weighed' speculations about calcium phosphate in the 2002 saccharin document, chose not to consider, either in 1987 or 2004, any of the hundreds of empirical studies showing progesterone's protective anticancer effects. The committee 'considered' approximately half of all research publications on saccharin and cancer, and fewer than 1% of those relating to progesterone and cancer. Something other than scientific objectivity must explain those differences."

**CONTEXT:** This quantifies the disparity in the review of evidence for saccharin versus progesterone, strongly suggesting a deliberate exclusion of data unfavorable to the anti-progesterone agenda.

**RAY PEAT:** "The agency in charge of those processes of evaluating evidence of carcinogenicity declines to identify the people who made those possibly biased, certainly bizarre, selections of articles, or to list their qualifications for being in the crucial position of deciding what evidence would be provided to the Scientific Advisory Panel. And in the list of studies that the committee did receive, are two (Kwapien, et al., and Yager and Yager) that are about completely different chemicals, that the agency still identifies as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity."

**CONTEXT:** This further criticizes the lack of transparency and the inclusion of irrelevant studies in the OEHHA's evaluation of progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many progesterone products have been taken off the market because of California's warning signs and labels, and as a result many women are having to rely on their physicians for progesterone. Too many physicians know only what the pharmaceutical companies want them to know about progesterone and other hormones that had been available for decades in places such as health food stores."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the practical consequences of California's actions, limiting access to progesterone and increasing reliance on physicians with potentially biased knowledge.

**RAY PEAT:** "An article in JAMA (Marcia Stefanick, April 11, 2006) was summed up by Stefanick in a way that seems designed to encourage physicians to return to prescribing estrogen: 'In the estrogen and progestin trial those women who got on the active pills, we saw an increase in breast cancer within five years. In the case of estrogen only, we not only do not see an increase by 7 years, but there's actually a suggestion of a decrease.' That is a serious misrepresentation of the study."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes a JAMA article for misrepresenting study findings to promote estrogen and discourage progesterone use.

**RAY PEAT:** "The recently reported (December 15, 2006) decline of breast cancer incidence, coinciding with the great decrease in the use of menopausal estrogen treatments, also coincided with an increased use of natural progesterone, but if the lawyers, bureaucrats, and agents of the estrogen industry succeed in convincing the public that progesterone is carcinogenic, its use will decline, and breast cancer incidence could be expected to increase again."

**CONTEXT:** This links the decline in breast cancer incidence to increased progesterone use and warns that the demonization of progesterone could reverse this trend.

**RAY PEAT:** "The studies that show cancer prevention by progesterone have, over the years, failed to resonate in the medical culture. The confusion created by classifying the antiprogestational, carcinogenic synthetics as 'progestins' is largely responsible for the failure to understand the protective nature of progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** This reiterates the central problem of conflating synthetic progestins with natural progesterone, hindering the recognition of progesterone's protective effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "If the evidence showing that progesterone prevents or cures cancer could be weighed against the evidence purporting to show that it is carcinogenic, I think it would be clear that something like a cultural-commercial misogyny has been at work. The novelty of the newer misogyny is that it is so often led, or at least figureheaded by women."

**CONTEXT:** This offers a concluding, critical perspective on the forces driving the anti-progesterone agenda, suggesting a blend of commercial interests and a form of misogyny.

**RAY PEAT:** "The intrinsic carcinogenicity of a more water soluble cyclodextrin, that was considered 'more toxicologically benign,' was found to cause pathological changes in lungs, liver, and kidney, and to increase the formation of tumors in the pancreas and intestines of rats (Gould and Scott, 2005)."

**CONTEXT:** This provides further evidence of the toxicity of cyclodextrins, a substance used in some progesterone studies.

**RAY PEAT:** "The hypothesis of progesterone decreasing the proliferative effect of estradiol in the postmenopausal breast remains highly plausible."

**CONTEXT:** This supports the idea that progesterone counteracts the proliferative effects of estrogen in breast tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone receptor activation. an alternative to SERMs in breast cancer. 'In postmenopausal women, adding progesterone to percutaneously administrated oestradiol significantly reduces the proliferation induced by oestradiol.'"

**CONTEXT:** This highlights progesterone's role in reducing estrogen-induced proliferation in breast cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "'Estrogen can stimulate growth of SPI in adipose tissue sites, whereas progesterone inhibits growth.' 'Our results are consistent with the model that adipose tissue exerts an estrogen-dependent positive regulatory effect on primary SPI tumor growth, and promotes the formation of metastases.'"

**CONTEXT:** This demonstrates progesterone's inhibitory effect on tumor growth in adipose tissue, contrasting with estrogen's stimulatory effect.

Formby B, Wiley TS. This study sought to elucidate the mechanism by which progesterone inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Utilizing breast cancer cell lines with and without progesterone receptors (T47-D and MDA-231, respectively) in vitro, the authors looked at apoptosis (programmed cell death) in response to progesterone exposure as a possible mechanism. The results demonstrated that progesterone does produce a strong antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cell lines containing progesterone receptors, and induced apoptosis. The relatively high levels of progesterone utilized were similar to those seen during the third trimester of human pregnancy."

**CONTEXT:** This details the cellular mechanisms by which progesterone inhibits breast cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis, noting that the effective doses are comparable to those during late pregnancy.

**CONTEXT:** This study suggests an inverse association between luteal progesterone levels and breast cancer risk.

**RAY PEAT:** "Breast cancer and oral contraceptives: critique of the proposition that high potency progestogen products confer excess risk. Sturtevant FM A recent report by Pike et al. from the U. S. A. concluded on the basis of epidemiologic evidence that an increased risk of breast cancer was manifested by young women who had used combination oral contraceptives (OC) with a high 'potency' of progestogen over a prolonged period. This conclusion is criticized in the present article, centering on three cardinal defects in the Pike study: (1) The assigned potencies of OC's are fiction and were derived from out-dated delay-of-menses data; (2) Well-known risk factors for breast cancer were ignored; (3) The method assumed no error of recall of OC brand, dose and duration of use occurring many years before telephone interviews. Noting that others have not been able to confirm these findings, it is concluded that there is no scientific basis for accepting the suggestion of Pike et al."

**CONTEXT:** This is a critique of Malcolm Pike's study on oral contraceptives and breast cancer risk, highlighting significant methodological flaws and lack of reproducibility.
