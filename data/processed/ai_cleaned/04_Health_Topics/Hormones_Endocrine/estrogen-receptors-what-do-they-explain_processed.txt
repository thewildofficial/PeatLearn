**RAY PEAT:** The presence of the "estrogen-receptor" is a normal tissue property. Even the normal eye's retina is "estrogen-receptor positive." Breast tissues, including tumors, also normally contain "receptors" for vitamin A, thyroid hormone, progesterone, oxytocin, and for a great number of other hormones and growth-regulating factors. The absence of the "estrogen-receptor" is just one indication that the tissue is abnormal. Better clues to the cancerous nature of a breast tumor might be found in the presence of the "heat-shock proteins" or even the "prostate specific antigen," rather than in the "estrogen receptor."

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of estrogen receptors in tumor diagnosis?

**RAY PEAT:** The protein (or, rather, group of proteins) called "the estrogen receptor" has been of interest to oncologists partly because of the fact that estrogen is involved in the development of cancer, and because estrogens and antiestrogens have been used to treat breast cancers. As long as it is recognized that its presence or absence in a tumor is just one indication of the tissue's normality or abnormality, using it to characterize a tumor needn't cause any problems.

**CONTEXT:** What are the potential dangers associated with the concept of estrogen receptors?

**RAY PEAT:** Tamoxifen, an "antiestrogen," competes with ordinary estrogens for binding sites on the "estrogen receptor" (though it has other actions), and its value in protecting breast tissue against estrogen's effects is recognized. However, it causes uterine cancer, and is also toxic to the liver and other tissues. The drug companies would like to have drugs that oppose estrogen's cancer-causing effects, without the toxicity of tamoxifen. The drug companies are creating a culture in which the special properties of the “estrogen receptors” are to be the defining features for the special properties of the new “designer” estrogens and antiestrogens, the “Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators” (SERMs), which will allow the new drugs to be approved solely on the basis of their effects on the estrogen receptors, which apparently are clear and simple molecular interactions, without reference to their actual effects on the health of patients. This is closely analogous to the present situation in which estrogen is claimed to prevent heart disease, on the basis of its effects on certain “markers” of heart disease. The substitution of “markers” for the realities of sickness and therapeutic outcome has been one of the drug industry’s cleverest achievements.

**CONTEXT:** How has the pharmaceutical industry influenced the understanding and application of estrogen receptor research?

**RAY PEAT:** The claim will be made that the newer SERMs (e.g., raloxifen) are better than tamoxifen, because they don’t activate the estrogen receptors in the uterus, and so shouldn’t cause uterine cancer, as tamoxifen does. This will allow them to be sold to patients who are told that they “need estrogen,” as well as to the patients who will be told that they need “an antiestrogen.” If the drugs aren’t tested properly, it might be generations before all the side effects are discovered, and their damage to public health could be greater than all of the pharmaceutical debacles that have already occurred.

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical and philosophical context that has shaped the "estrogen receptor" theory?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1950s and 1960s, the ability of bacteria to adapt to changes in their food supply was explained in terms of a simplified feedback system. In bacteria, specific proteins were found to regulate genes in response to the type of food available, but even in that simple organism, that theoretical model is inadequate and misleading; the favorite gene of the people who insisted on the orthodox regulator model, actually undergoes adaptive mutation, which was exactly what their model was supposed to explain away (J. Cairns and P. Foster, Genetics 128(4), 695-7-1, 1991). This oversimplified idea was taken as a model for explaining how complex organisms respond to hormones, such as estrogen. It was the prestige of molecular biology, and the “classical simplicity” of the genetic model, that made the idea persist, even when there were many reasons for believing that it was entirely inappropriate as a model for mammalian or human physiology.

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of the estrogen receptor has been around for 40 years, but it’s only in the last few years that the candidate-protein has been studied with real clarity. For its first 15 or 20 years, the status of the “estrogen receptor” was just hypothetical-philosophical, and that mystique is even more powerful now, adding a quasi-religious significance to the few facts that have been produced. For that reason, we can’t understand the full meaning of the “estrogen receptor” until we know why so many people were so sure that “it existed.”

**RAY PEAT:** This philosophical context has given special power to an idea of “one-to-one correspondence” (and to a related idea of an “all-or-nothing” response). Its overtones are everything--it implies exactness, completeness, perfection. One stimulus produces one nervous discharge, for example, and nothing else--if you set your apparatus up in such a way that it can’t measure anything else, and if you define a “stimulus” as something which produces a nervous discharge. The “one-to-one” idea helps to sustain the mechanical models which make the mathematical hypotheses easier to manage. In genetics, one “gene” corresponded to one “trait,” because the system was defined in that way, not because organisms were usually constituted in that way. Traits, like nerve reactions, had to be all-or-nothing--the offspring of a red-flowered plant and a white-flowered plant weren’t allowed to be pink, because a discrete mechanical theory didn’t want to recognize such confusing things.

**RAY PEAT:** In sensory physiology, a unit of stimulus, for example a photon of light, was “transduced” into a unit of response, by some object in the cell which changed one form of energy into another. The “one-to-one correspondence” idea, working in terms of a discrete transducer in the cell, led our scientific establishment during almost the entire 20th century to say that it was impossible in principle for radio waves, ordinary sound waves, red light, or “subthreshold” x-rays to have any “biological effects” at all. The gigantic amount of stupidity involved in this can probably be taken as a hint that there is a fundamental flaw in our scientific-philosophical culture.

**RAY PEAT:** It was these contexts, in genetics and nerve physiology particularly, that led to the confidence that there would be a “discrete” (i.e., simple mechanical) thing in certain cells which would allow the “female hormone” to produce its effect, the “female response.”

**CONTEXT:** How does the "estrogen receptor" model explain the mechanism of estrogen action, and what are the limitations of this model?

**RAY PEAT:** If there are many copies of the “female gene” to be activated, and if there are many copies of the receptor molecule, then the response to estrogen can be graded from small to maximum, according to whether there are only a few molecules of estrogen reaching the cell, or enough molecules to “saturate” all the “female genes” with the appropriate number of estrogen-activated receptor molecules. When the dose of estrogen is high enough to saturate all of the estrogen-responsive genes or all of the estrogen receptor molecules, higher doses of the hormone will have no more effect.

**RAY PEAT:** For years, some researchers were finding exactly what they had predicted. Before estrogen was applied to the cell, all of the “receptors” were found in the cytoplasm, none in the nucleus. When estrogen was applied, the receptor bound the estrogen and changed its shape, and was then transported into the nucleus, leaving none in the cytoplasm. After a time, the receptor and the estrogen that was bound to it, activated certain genes, which began transcribing specific RNA, which then moved to the cytoplasm, where it was used to produce the proteins which embodied the “estrogen response.”

**RAY PEAT:** But as more people studied the system, none of those events stayed as simple as the early studies had indicated. Especially studied at the normal body temperature, the "receptors" appeared to be in a fully activated state without estrogen. Some of them disappeared at body temperature; different techniques produced different results, and the receptors were probably already distributed throughout the cell before estrogen was added to the system. When the system was held at nearly the freezing temperature, the added estrogen had the anticipated action. Although some of the experimental results are hard to relate to the supposed biological actions of the receptors, the alteration of these proteins by estrogen in a cold system is interesting in itself, since it indicates that estrogen changes the stability of the proteins when the watery solution is close to its freezing point, something which might be applicable to many other proteins, and which could have important implications for the way estrogen acts. The “cold-sensitive” receptors, like certain enzymes and structural proteins, apparently respond sensitively to the entropy of their watery environment, which suggests that they could participate in a cooperative holistic regulatory system.

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1960s, endocrine physiologists were already pointing out that many different things bound estrogen, that some of those things responded instantly to the presence of estrogen, and that estrogen began producing its biological effects instantly when it entered the cell, and many cellular and organismic effects of estrogen were continuously graded from the smallest dose to the largest doses, with no evidence of “saturability.” If Popper’s philosophy of science really represented how science works, the massive evidence that conflicted with the “estrogen receptor” theory would have disproved that theory. But the practical way to deal with evidence that doesn’t measure up to the model is to ignore it.

**RAY PEAT:** A few researchers, mainly people who studied nerves and believed that nerves were governed by their “membrane functions,” noticed the evidence for estrogen’s instantaneous effects, and began describing these as estrogen’s “membrane effects.” But these people, too, generally thought in terms of discrete and saturable “membrane estrogen receptors.”

**RAY PEAT:** The same model of cellular action by discrete “response elements” that led so many people to deny the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation has served the medical-pharmaceutical establishment’s desire to maintain that they understand and can control estrogen’s potential for harm.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen was said to be able to promote, but not to initiate, cancer, and to do that only in the “female organs” (uterus and breasts) which contained the estrogen receptors. The abstract “classical estrogen receptor” model is a rationale behind the tens of millions of unnecessary hysterectomies that have been performed in the United States, and it is part of the argument for removing breasts to prevent cancer, and for ignoring the multitude of other harmful effects that estrogen can have. Large doses of estrogen were said to be harmless, because the response system was saturable, and beyond a certain dose, additional estrogen could have no effect.

**RAY PEAT:** According to the idea that estrogen acts only through “its receptor,” it shouldn’t change the activity of existing enzymes, or immediately increase the cell’s affinity for water, or modify ionic balances, or act on mitochondria, or cause mutations, or produce massive amounts of free radicals, or accelerate cellular aging, or cause an unsaturable, dose-related increase in active electrons (as measured by their reaction with an indicator-dye), or cause inflammation, or epileptic seizures, or produce birth defects, or activate the stress/shock proteins such as the “heat shock proteins,” or disrupt microtubules, or disorganize the mitotic apparatus in a dose-related manner, up to the point that it produces genomic instability, three-cornered cell division, loss or gain of chromosomes, multipolar cell divisions, and finally cellular disintegration. None of those effects is predicted by the idea of the receptor-transducer of femininity, and so “the female hormone” shouldn’t produce them.

**RAY PEAT:** If a physiological level of estrogen produces, in a dose-related manner, functional and anatomical changes in many parts of many kinds of cell in many organs, in both men and women, independently of “the estrogen receptor,” then a thoroughly different approach to understanding the sensitivity and response to estrogen is needed.

**RAY PEAT:** Many different tissues contain the protein that is called the “estrogen receptor”--liver, kidney, thymus, pancreas, stomach, bowel, brain, retina, lung, skin, gums, etc., so--ignoring the responses which don’t require that protein--the original intent of the “estrogen receptor” theory has become pretty muddled, unless it can, for example, explain that there is something sexually relevant in a woman’s gums. And men’s tissues have the “estrogen receptors” just as widely distributed, so the “specific response” idea has become so difficult to sustain that it is slowly coming to be held that the estrogen receptor does something different in different tissues, and under different circumstances. But at that point, the silliness of calling it “the estrogen receptor” should start to become apparent. It would seem to be just one more of the many things which respond to estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen produces many effects without the “receptor,” and when the receptor is “activated,” what it does, wherever it is, still hasn’t been satisfactorily defined.

**RAY PEAT:** Rather than pretending that estrogen’s many effects just don’t exist, a few people have looked for ways to find order and generality in the complex diversity. Szent-Gyorgyi’s career was devoted to finding some integrating simplicities that would make it possible to understand the “living state,” which he saw as a special state of matter which corresponded to certain ways of using energy. For most of his career, a central question was how the special state of water in the cell helped to sustain certain active electronic states. At one point, he studied the ways in which estrogen and progesterone oppositely affected the physiology of the heart; he obviously wasn’t treating them as “female hormones.”

**RAY PEAT:** Influenced by Szent-Gyorgyi, in 1971 and 1972 I proposed that estrogen, by influencing the cell’s water-structure in a particular way, could in an organized way alter the function of a large number of enzymes and physiological processes. The change of water structure induced by estrogen is analogous to “melting,” and this type of change, a loosening of the structure of the water, can be seen to occur in a variety of other cellular states, for example, in cancer, aging, and lack of oxygen. Articles by Troshin, Cope, Damadian, Wiggins, Clegg, Drost-Hansen, and Ling discuss the issue of the difference of cell-water from ordinary bulk-water.

**RAY PEAT:** Going back to the old ideas of radical empiricism, it was the whole animal (or the whole cell) which experienced; experience wasn’t reduced to “sensory atoms” which activated inner structures one unit at a time. (Sensory atomism was given a strong foothold in science when Einstein proposed the quantum interpretation of the photoelectric effect; that theory was conditioned by the same philosophical environment.) Theories of “the living state” represent attempts to bring empirical reality back into science, examining what happens in reality rather than what can be found that corresponds to the convenient units of our favorite way of calculating.

**RAY PEAT:** In its long history, the theory of the estrogen receptor hasn’t produced any demonstrable benefits, except to the drug industry. (Tamoxifen, useful for its antiestrogen effect, is active even without the estrogen receptor.) Even the idea of using the estrogen receptor idea in cancer prognosis has proven to be little more than a fantasy. But the idea has produced a great amount of harm, allowing the drug experts to assure the public that they understand where estrogen’s risks and benefits lie, just as the x-ray experts used to assure the public that “low doses” of radiation couldn’t cause cancer, or brain damage, or birth defects.

**CONTEXT:** What should one consider when someone speaks about "estrogen receptors"?

**RAY PEAT:** When someone speaks “knowledgeably” about “estrogen receptors,” it is important to ask just what they mean, and what evidence supports their claims.

**CONTEXT:** How is the language surrounding estrogen and its receptors being used to promote drugs, and what are the implications for public health?

**RAY PEAT:** Language matters. The doctrine of “the female hormone” acting through “its receptor” is being used to sell drugs. They say estrogen delays aging, and if one estrogen causes cancer, they will provide a “designer estrogen” or a “specific antiestrogen” to prevent or cure cancer. Ordinary estrogens are being promoted to prevent osteoporosis, heart disease, and (though they don’t yet make direct product claims in this case) Alzheimer’s disease and other degenerative brain diseases. If estrogen is protective against these diseases, why is the incidence of osteoporosis and Alzheimer’s disease so much higher in women than in men? And why is the incidence of bone fractures caused by osteoporosis increasing, even among men, who are now being exposed to more estrogen than in the past?

**RAY PEAT:** For a long time, estrogen was sold to “prevent miscarriages,” despite the clear evidence that it caused them. The language of deceitful salesmanship made that possible, since “the female hormone” had to support “the female function” of child-bearing. When the industry realized that it would eventually be able to sell the product to prevent child-bearing, it invented a ridiculous rationale, claiming that taking estrogen acted to lower estrogen and prevent conception. But the side effects of having too much estrogen forced them to lower the dose of estrogen, and this was occurring at the same time that the estrogen pill was supposed to be lowering the body’s estrogen level. Essentially, the industry will say anything that the public will swallow, and the public will swallow a lot.

**RAY PEAT:** When patents on one generation of drugs expire, the industry prepares the public for a new generation of better drugs, by “educating” them in the new uses of the language. The language and ideology of the “estrogen receptor” is like the patter of a prestidigitator, distracting the audience from the real issue: Is the drug going to be helpful or harmful?

**CONTEXT:** What are alternative approaches to controlling estrogen's effects if we move beyond the "Receptor Dogma"?

**RAY PEAT:** If we are free of the Receptor Dogma, we can think of controlling estrogen’s effects by means other than by making molecules to block estrogen’s binding to its receptor, or making molecules to bind to “antiestrogen receptors.”

**RAY PEAT:** It is now clear that estrogen is intimately related to the universal stress-reaction system, the heat shock proteins. Progesterone, the most direct and general antagonist to estrogen, is now seen to be involved in this fundamental system--it opposes the actions of the stress proteins, and the stress proteins mediate the factors which cause a progesterone deficiency. The problem of allowing estrogen to have its useful effects, without causing cumulative harm, such as aging the brain and bringing on menopause, is essentially a problem of achieving optimal functioning without stress. The problem has to do with the organism in its environment, not with specific “designer drugs.”
