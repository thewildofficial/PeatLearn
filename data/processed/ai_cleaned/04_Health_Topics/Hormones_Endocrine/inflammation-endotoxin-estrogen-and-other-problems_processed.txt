**RAY PEAT:** Inflammation has changed from being thought of simply as an essential part of the immune reaction, to being recognized as something that can interfere with the immune system, and that contributes to chronic disease and degeneration.

**CONTEXT:** What is the evolving understanding of inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Many components of the inflammatory reaction have been identified lately, but the way those fit into the context of the whole organism still isn't clear. Many of the "evolutionary interpretations” of particular biological features are just words, empty speculations that can't be tested. Selective breeding experiments and comparative physiology can provide some basis for arguments about the evolution of the immune system, but the people who created the "big picture" weren't burdened by a need for detailed evidence.

**CONTEXT:** What are the limitations of current evolutionary explanations for biological features, particularly concerning the immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** Developmental processes, however, have been studied in great detail, and as information accumulates, it is becoming clear that the traditional view of inflammation has little to do with reality. When inflammation is "explained" as something that evolved to protect the organism against infection, people will be taught that theory, and will feel no need to think about the subject again.

**CONTEXT:** How does the developmental context challenge traditional views of inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** With the newer realization that inflammation can lead to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, dementia, and other degenerative processes, the logical seeming course of action for people taught the traditional "evolutionary" view of inflammation has been to look for the infectious organism causing the problem.

**CONTEXT:** What is the consequence of viewing inflammation solely through an evolutionary lens when considering chronic diseases?

**RAY PEAT:** But if we put inflammation into the developmental context, it is immediately clear that infectious agents are just one of the many factors that we interact with and that can be involved in the inflammatory and degenerative processes. Nutrition, toxins, environmental stresses, and biological cycles influence the way we react to infectious organisms, and even in the absence of virulent organisms, can cause inflammation and degeneration. In the uterus and ovary, for example, inflammatory and degenerative changes are part of normal functioning.

**CONTEXT:** How does a developmental perspective broaden the understanding of factors contributing to inflammation and degeneration?

**RAY PEAT:** In those organs, the cyclic changes in structure are orchestrated to a monthly rhythm that makes them very obvious. But in other organs, such as the adrenal cortex, the intestinal epithelium, the liver, and the skin, there is a continuous process of renewal (and degeneration) of cells that is fairly well known, despite the dogmatists who want to cling to the "Hayflick limit," that denies the existence of a flowing renewal of cells in every organ, or that insists that no renewal is possible after 50 divisions of a cell line. Cell renewal occurs even in the brain and the heart. The Hayflick doctrine was plausible to people who were committed to a Weismannist view of genetics and development, a view that radically denied the role of organismic and environmental interactions in development.

**CONTEXT:** How do normal physiological processes in various organs illustrate continuous cell renewal, and how does this contrast with the "Hayflick limit" doctrine?

**RAY PEAT:** Cells that are well insulated from the environment can live for a very long time, but cells that directly contact the environment, i.e., the skin and the intestinal epithelium, divide rapidly, and are shed.

**CONTEXT:** What determines the rate of cell division and shedding?

**RAY PEAT:** When stimulation is great, and energy supply is weak, a cell will either adapt to the conditions, sometimes increasing its rate of division, or die. Nerve cells can protect themselves by becoming insensitive to stimulation; in some cases, the stress-induced loss of its axon can probably turn a nerve cell into a resting, or stem, cell.

**CONTEXT:** How do cells respond to high stimulation and low energy supply?

**RAY PEAT:** The dissolution of a cell releases its materials in different ways, according to the conditions that caused it to die. Sometimes it releases histamine and other substances that can increase blood flow in nearby capillaries, but under other conditions it can liquefy without causing much change in its environment. When a significant amount of cellular debris accumulates in an area, wandering cells sense it, and depending on the nature of the injury, they may simply remove the debris, or stay and adapt, forming part of a repair structure.

**CONTEXT:** What happens when a cell dies, and how does the environment influence this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Proteolytic enzymes and nucleases can decompose most of the structural proteins and nucleic acids, but the lipases that act on the dead cell's structural lipids release a variety of modified phospholipids, fatty acids, and cholesterol, with considerable biological activity or significance. These substances appear with regularity when cells are being damaged, and they are the most important class of signals acting on the immune system. Oxidized phospholipids can cause other cells to form a variety of substances that amplify the alarm signal (e.g., Kadl, et al., 2002). Their importance justifies the view of J. Cunliffe and P. Matzinger, that the immune system is actually a system of structural development and maintenance, and that its role in killing alien organisms is triggered when tissue damage releases our intrinsic signal substances.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key signaling molecules released from dying cells, and what is their significance for the immune system?

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated fatty acids, derived from foods, have a special role in the immune system, intensifying the effects of stress (cholesterol newsletter, September, 2005) in killing lymphocytes, and blocking the proliferative response of thymic cells (Rotondo, et al., 1994). They tend to shift immune functions from cellular immunity to humoral (antibody) immunity, and this pattern predisposes to autoimmunity. They are probably directly toxic to the liver (Ritskes-Hoitinga, 1998). DHA increases the leakiness of the bowel, allowing more endotoxin to enter the circulation (Roig-Perez, et al., 2004).

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the immune system and their potential negative effects?

**RAY PEAT:** When cells have enough glucose, oxygen, and thyroid hormone, and aren't being over-stimulated, energy consumption can be uncoupled from the formation of ATP. This allows the mitochondria to devote more energy to the production of the material needed for synthesizing cholesterol and its derivatives, pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA, and to form carbon dioxide at a high rate. Uncoupling helps to lower the formation of inflammatory cytokines (Horvath, et al., 2003). A chronically "uncoupled" metabolic state has been associated with longevity (Speakman, et al., 2004). The rate of cholesterol production, and the amount in circulation, tend to be inversely related to systemic inflammation. All of the types of lipoprotein absorb, bind, and help to eliminate endotoxin, for example. Carbon dioxide and the major steroids stabilize cells against excessive stimulation, and protect the cell structure.

**CONTEXT:** How does adequate cellular energy production, coupled with uncoupling, influence metabolic processes and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Bacteria and plants produce a variety of lipids that serve some purposes analogous to our cholesterol and phospholipids. Some of the common intestinal bacteria produce a molecule containing amino sugars and fatty acids (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), that's called endotoxin. The "endo" root distinguishes it from the "exotoxins" secreted by some bacteria, because the endotoxin is a structural part of the bacterium, that protects the bacterium against some of the exotoxins produced by other microorganisms. Normally, our intestine and liver destroy most of the LPS endotoxin before it reaches the general circulation. The bile acids, a major end product of cholesterol, have a detergent action in the intestine that usually keeps endotoxin in solution, away from the absorptive surfaces of the intestine. If the flow of bile is obstructed, endotoxin is allowed to enter the system (Bertok, 2004). Estrogen can inhibit the flow of bile (Stieger, et al., 2000). A mucus lining is part of the protective barrier, but the microscopic integrity of the intestinal cells themselves finally regulates the passage of materials into the blood and lymphatic vessels.

**CONTEXT:** What is endotoxin, how is it normally handled by the body, and what factors can disrupt this process?

**RAY PEAT:** The barrier function of the intestine is weakened by poisons, malnutrition, and the reduced circulation that can result from stress. Estrogens, such as oral contraceptives or Premarin, can cause colitis by shutting off the blood supply (Gurbuz, et al., 1994; Deana and Dean, 1995).

**CONTEXT:** What factors compromise the intestinal barrier function, and how can estrogens contribute to colitis?

**RAY PEAT:** When our cells are exposed to LPS, they produce many of the same reactions that they would produce in response to our endogenous phospholipids. The major proteins that interact with cholesterol contain lipophilic regions called beta sheets, in which a relatively flat surface is formed by parallel strands of the protein. LPS contains a group of fatty acids bound together by the polysaccharide, that strongly binds to these proteins.

**CONTEXT:** How do cells respond to LPS exposure, and what is the molecular interaction involved?

**RAY PEAT:** The alarm reaction produced either by damage of some of our own tissue or by the entrance of LPS into the circulation can, under ideal circumstances, lead to a series of protective and defensive reactions, that resolve the problem. The production of steroids is increased, and, early in life, the liberation of fatty acids itself can contribute to the antiinflammatory processes that restore the barrier function and energy production. But when the endogenous omega-9 fatty acids have been thoroughly displaced by dietary omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, the systemic release of fatty acids becomes an amplifier of the stress state initiated by injury or other stress. The liver, for example, decreases its detoxification of estrogen in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**CONTEXT:** How does the body's alarm reaction to tissue damage or LPS normally resolve, and how can dietary fatty acids alter this process?

**RAY PEAT:** In the ovary and uterus, the healthy alternation of excitation and quiescence usually continues for many years, and in rodents it often ends in a state of "persistent estrus," in which the excitatory state can't be terminated in the usual way, by the production of progesterone. In humans, menopause is analogous, because the excitatory FSH hormone from the pituitary becomes excessive, with the ovary continuing to produce estrogen but failing to produce progesterone, sometimes with the pituitary failing to shift from FSH to LH. In rodents, it's recognized that persistent estrus is caused by chronically elevated estrogen, but in humans there has been tremendous resistance to the recognition of estrogen's central role in menopause and senescence. An excess of the basic promoter of inflammation, serotonin, which is closely associated with estrogen's influence, can have similar effects on the reproductive cycle (Cooper, et al., 1986). The industry has devoted the necessary funding to making the easily manipulated medical culture, and the public, believe the opposite, i.e., that reproductive aging is mainly caused by estrogen deficiency.

**CONTEXT:** How do hormonal changes in the ovary and uterus relate to aging, and what is the role of estrogen in menopause and senescence?

**RAY PEAT:** The liver, besides its important role in keeping endotoxin from reaching the circulation, normally "destroys" all of the estrogen that reaches it, that is, it makes it water soluble so that it will be excreted in the urine or bile, rather than being retained by cells. But in malnutrition, hypothyroidism, or stress, the liver allows estrogen to pass through without being completely inactivated. M.S. Biskind and G.R. Biskind (1941, 1946) showed that the B vitamins were crucial for estrogen elimination, and others around the same time demonstrated that toxins, protein deficiency, hypothyroidism, and even hyperestrogenism itself tended to reduce the liver's ability to detoxify estrogen. Endotoxin's inhibition of this detoxifying system (Banhegyi, et al., 1995) is just one of the ways that it increases estrogen systemically.

**CONTEXT:** What is the liver's role in estrogen metabolism, and what factors impair its ability to detoxify estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen, which was named for a gadfly, is excitatory in all of its biological actions (including nervous excitation and cellular proliferation), and in most tissues this excitatory action has been shown to cause oxidation damage. Many different toxic changes have been produced in the liver by estrogen, but lipid peroxidation can be clearly demonstrated in the liver as an early reaction to subcutaneous estrogen injection (Genc, et al., 1999).

**CONTEXT:** What are the primary effects of estrogen on cells and tissues, and how does it contribute to liver damage?

**RAY PEAT:** Endotoxin and estrogen interact in many interesting and potentially deadly ways. Both of them activate many of the same alarm systems, including phospholipases, nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins (including IL-6, according to Bengtsson, et al., 2004), and the enzymes that form prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Estrogen makes the toxic-mediator-producing cells in the liver (Kupffer cells) hypersensitive to LPS--15 times more sensitive than normal (Ikejima, et al., 1998). One way estrogen increases the toxicity of endotoxin is probably by making the intestine more permeable (Enomoto, et al., 1999). The acute phase reaction, a process in which the liver decreases its production of albumin and increases the production of serum amyloids, lipoproteins, and fibrinogen, is promoted by both estrogen and endotoxin. Estrogen (like endotoxin) activates nuclear factor kappa-B (Shyamala and Guiot, 1992; Hamilton, et al., 2003), which activates cells to produce TNF, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and interleukins. A long series of observations have indicated that estrogen’s main effects begin with redox changes in the mitochondria, and recent evidence (Felty and Roy, 2005) shows that oxidative free radicals produced in the mitochondria by estrogen induce NF kappa-B. Old age is associated with increased activity of NF kappa-B.

**CONTEXT:** How do endotoxin and estrogen interact, and what are the common inflammatory pathways they activate?

**RAY PEAT:** Aspirin, increased levels of carbon dioxide (Ni Chonghaile, et al., 2005), and progesterone (Deroo and Archer, 2002; Kelly, et al., 2001; Allport, et al., 2001; van der Burg and van der Saag, 1996; Caldenhoven, et al., 1995) inhibit NF kappa-B, and NF kappa-B inhibits the synthesis of both testosterone (Hong, et al., 2004) and progesterone (Allport, et al., 2001).

**CONTEXT:** What substances and hormones inhibit NF kappa-B, and what is the effect of NF kappa-B on steroid synthesis?

**RAY PEAT:** The amount of injury needed to increase the endotoxin in the blood can be fairly minor. Two thirds of people having a colonoscopy had a significant increase in endotoxin in their blood, and intense exercise or anxiety will increase it. Endotoxin activates the enzyme that synthesizes estrogen while it decreases the formation of androgen (Christeff, et al., 1992), and this undoubtedly is partly responsible for the large increases in estrogen in both men and women caused by trauma, sickness or excessive fatigue.

**CONTEXT:** What minor injuries or stresses can increase endotoxin levels, and how does endotoxin affect estrogen and androgen production?

**RAY PEAT:** The positive interactions among estrogen and endotoxin and NF kappa-B, and their negative interactions with progesterone and testosterone, tend to "stabilize" the inflammatory condition. In a young person, good food, sunlight, and a high altitude can often overcome severe and progressive inflammatory conditions. In an older person, whose tissues contain larger amounts of polyunsaturated fats and their breakdown products, it takes more environmental support to get out of the inflammatory pattern.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen, endotoxin, NF kappa-B, progesterone, and testosterone interact to influence inflammation, and what factors can help overcome inflammatory conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** Glycine (the main amino acid in gelatin) is an important nutrient with powerful antiinflammatory actions (Zhong, et al., 1999; Wang, et al., 2004). Saturated fatty acids can help to reduce chronic inflammatory states, but it's essential to eliminate as far as possible the unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids, which suppress normal immune functions, besides contributing to the free radical-lipid peroxidation burden. Cholesterol and ATP have been used therapeutically, but ordinarily their synthesis can be increased safely by using a diet that contains a significant amount of ordinary sugar (sucrose, from fruits) when the thyroid function is adequate.

**CONTEXT:** What are the anti-inflammatory properties of glycine and saturated fatty acids, and what is the role of sugar and thyroid function in supporting cholesterol and ATP synthesis?

**RAY PEAT:** Since vascular leakiness is involved in the inflammatory syndromes, as well as in shock, I think it's reasonable to treat them similarly, keeping in mind the importance of normal blood volume and viscosity. Sodium and sugar help to lower adrenaline, and so they can make a contribution to preventing high blood pressure, while maintaining normal hydration of the blood. Estradiol and cholera toxin, which both increase vascular leakiness, probably exert some of their influence by lowering the osmotic tension of the extracellular fluid (Webster, et al., 1984; Witten and Bradbury, 1951). The enzyme activated by cholera toxin, estrogen, and hypotonic medium in the study by Webster, et al., was ornithine decarboxylase, which produces the polyamines. The polyamines promote cellular proliferation, and promote the actions of the excitotoxic amino acids. Histamine also activates excitotoxicity, and magnesium opposes it.

**CONTEXT:** How can vascular leakiness in inflammatory syndromes and shock be addressed, and what is the role of sodium, sugar, estradiol, and histamine in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** The inflammatory states that produce the age-related degenerative diseases have many things in common with "pre-eclampsia" or pregnancy toxemia, and the same simple things can usually alleviate both kinds of problem. With aging, intracellular water tends to decrease, as the extracellular water increases (Lesser and Markovsky, 1979), probably because of reduced cellular energy, and increased vascular permeability. When albumin production is adequate, it "binds" sodium, and the combination osmotically increases the ability of the blood to retain water.

**CONTEXT:** What are the similarities between age-related degenerative diseases and pre-eclampsia, and how do changes in water distribution and albumin production relate to aging?

**RAY PEAT:** Sodium bicarbonate can provide a little extra carbon dioxide, along with the sodium, and its diuretic action is well established, but it works by improving perfusion of the tissues, reducing any abnormal water retention, rather than by causing the kidneys to lose water in unphysiological ways. One of progesterone's important functions is the maintenance of blood volume, and adequate thyroid is essential for preventing hyponatremia (insufficient sodium in the blood, which often occurs in combination with decreased formation of albumin).

**CONTEXT:** How does sodium bicarbonate benefit the body, and what is the role of progesterone and thyroid in maintaining blood volume and sodium balance?

**RAY PEAT:** Stress, trauma, and shock start an inflammatory process, that can cause progressive damage to the organs, including the liver. Giving progesterone following the injury protects against the increase of TNF, IL-6, and leakage of liver enzymes (Kuebler, et al., 2003). It has similar protective effects in the brain, lungs, and other organs. During the normal menstrual cycle, IL-6 is inversely related to the level of progesterone (Angstwurm, et al., 1997).

**CONTEXT:** How do stress, trauma, and shock initiate inflammation, and what protective effects does progesterone have in these situations?

**RAY PEAT:** The liver's important role in regulating endotoxin and estrogen, and the cascade of inflammatory mediators that can be released as a result of a depression of the liver's function, makes it important to keep the liver in mind, even when the immediate problem seems to be in the brain, the lungs, kidneys, pancreas, blood vessels, heart, eyes, prostate, ovaries, muscles, or any other organ.

**CONTEXT:** Why is the liver's function crucial in managing endotoxin and estrogen, and how does liver dysfunction impact other organs?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen is obviously part of a primitive repair system, more fundamental or general than its role in reproduction. When a tissue is injured, it forms large amounts of an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, that removes the water soluble sugar acid, glucuronic acid, from the estrogen glucuronide which circulates harmlessly in the blood after its formation in the liver, and before its elimination in the urine. The injured tissue reverses the inactivation of the estrogen that has occurred in the liver, causing the fat soluble estrogen to remain in the damaged tissue, where it changes the metabolism, activating enzymes that stimulate proliferation and accelerate collagen formation and other processes involved in repair. (Other enzymes, sulfatases and aromatase, contribute to the increase in estrogen in stressed tissues, but beta-glucuronidase has been studied most, because it is very easy to identify.)

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen function as a primitive repair system, and what is the role of beta-glucuronidase in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** These local processes don't depend on liver failure to become active, but in the systemic effects of liver failure they probably play a very important role in amplifying the effects of endotoxin and unprocessed estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** How do local estrogen-mediated repair processes interact with systemic liver failure?

**RAY PEAT:** The effects of endotoxin and estrogen on cells are additive, for example in causing vascular leakiness (e.g., Tollan, et al., 1992), even in the brain (Oztas and Kaya, 1998). Dementia, respiratory distress/shock lung, and all of the classical inflammatory conditions, are promoted by the simple process of making capillaries excessively permeable. But the cellular changes that make capillaries leaky, also affect other cells, changing their antigenicity, leading to "autoimmune" processes (Sekigawa, et al., 2004).

**CONTEXT:** How do endotoxin and estrogen contribute to vascular leakiness and inflammatory conditions, and what is the link to autoimmune processes?

**RAY PEAT:** Protein deficiency creates an inflammatory state, and since stress causes tissue proteins to be destroyed and converted into sugars and fats, it's common to underestimate the amount of protein needed. One of the functions of sucrose in the diet is to reduce the production of cortisol, and so to spare protein.

**CONTEXT:** How does protein deficiency contribute to inflammation, and what role does sucrose play in protein sparing?

**RAY PEAT:** Milk has a variety of antiinflammatory functions. Its saturated fats help to prevent oxidation of lipids, including cholesterol. Several of its vitamins, especially vitamins D and K, have antiinflammatory and even antiestrogenic actions. Since the parathyroid hormone (like some of the other pituitary hormones) is pro-inflammatory, a generous supply of calcium is important because it inhibits the secretion of the parathyroid hormone.

**CONTEXT:** What are the anti-inflammatory properties of milk, and why is calcium important in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** Stress activates the endorphin system (partly by increased histamine, according to Kjaer, et al., 1993), and these intrinsic hormones, like morphine and the other opiates, are pro-inflammatory. Both estrogen and endotoxin activate the endorphin system. Excessive exposure to estrogen destroys many of the beta-endorphin nerves in the hypothalamus, resulting in an adaptive hypersensitivity, that maintains a chronic activation of the endorphin sensitive tissues, suppressing progesterone production (Desjardins, 1995).

**CONTEXT:** How does stress activate the endorphin system, and what is the relationship between estrogen, endotoxin, and endorphins?

**RAY PEAT:** There are drugs (e.g., naloxone) that can help to block the actions of the endorphins, and since the endorphins inhibit the luteinizing hormone (LH) which promotes the production of progesterone and testosterone, a little naloxone can often restore normal menstrual cycles that have stopped because of stress and excessive exposure to estrogen. Endorphins are probably involved in menopausal flushing, and drugs of the naloxone type have been used to relieve it. But a combination of other antistress factors can do the same.

**CONTEXT:** How can naloxone be used to counteract the effects of endorphins, and what conditions can it help manage?

**RAY PEAT:** Salicylic acid, which occurs naturally in many fruits, as well as in aspirin, is unlike the other antiinflammatory drugs so vaguely classified with it as “nonsteroidal,” in having a broad spectrum of antiinflammatory effects, inhibiting the prostaglandins and NF kappa-B, TNF, and IL-6, besides contributing to the inhibition of estrogen synthesis and actions.

**CONTEXT:** What are the broad anti-inflammatory effects of salicylic acid?

**RAY PEAT:** Magnesium is lost during stress, and that can lead to destabilization of the mast cells, with increased release of histamine and other promoters of inflammation and excitation. Thyroid hormone helps cells to assimilate and retain magnesium. Estrogen's effect on magnesium seems to be antagonistic (e.g., Muneyyirci-Delale, et al., 1999). Fruits and meats are good sources of magnesium, but coffee and chocolate are among the best sources of it, and the caffeine they contain adds to their antiinflammatory and liver-protective effect (see Sakamoto, et al., 1999).

**CONTEXT:** How does stress affect magnesium levels, and what is the role of thyroid hormone and estrogen in magnesium balance? What are good sources of magnesium?

**RAY PEAT:** The saturated fatty acids found in coconut oil inhibit the formation of histamine (Mimura, et al., 1980), as does glucose (Kaneko, et al., 1997), and prevent leakiness of the intestine, protecting the liver from endotoxin (Kono, et al., 2003). Progesterone and testosterone protect against histamine, while estrogen increases its formation and actions. Benadryl (diphenhydramine) protects the liver and other organs from various toxins, and from the toxic effects of histamine.

**CONTEXT:** What are the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of saturated fatty acids, glucose, progesterone, testosterone, and Benadryl regarding histamine and endotoxin?

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid's antiinflammatory function in arthritis and rheumatic conditions has been known for about a century, but there aren't many contemporary publications on its roles in inflammation and degeneration (see Bartalena, et al., 1994; Rittenhouse and Redei, 1997).

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical and current understanding of thyroid's role in inflammation and degeneration?

**RAY PEAT:** TSH, the thyroid stimulating hormone secreted by the pituitary, stimulates some of the inflammatory mediators, and although the definition of the "normal range" has been decreasing, the people I see whose TSH is "normal" aren't as healthy as those whose TSH is well "below normal." Other indicators of adequate thyroid function are needed.

**CONTEXT:** How does TSH relate to inflammatory mediators, and what are the limitations of relying solely on TSH levels for assessing thyroid function?

**RAY PEAT:** Expired carbon dioxide ("end tidal") is a good indicator, but it's rarely measured. Lactic acid tends to rise in hypothyroidism, so measuring its level in the blood can be helpful. Oxygen consumption, serum cholesterol, daily cycle of temperature and pulse rate, and calorie consumption are good indicators of thyroid function. The inflammatory cytokines can activate the glycolytic enzymes that produce lactic acid (Bauer, et al., 2004), and the thyroid hormone accelerates the oxidation of lactic acid, so I think it's reasonable to think of a higher metabolic rate as a corrective compensation for inflammation, as well as the most important factor in preventing it.

**CONTEXT:** What are reliable indicators of adequate thyroid function, and how does thyroid hormone influence lactic acid metabolism and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Anyone can measure their calorie consumption with enough accuracy to be useful. Considering that the Criles' measurements of oxygen consumption in the 1930s showed that Americans as a group were extremely hypothyroid, and that other studies done around the same time suggested that nearly half of the population benefitted from supplemental thyroid, we should probably ignore the present "official" recommendations regarding caloric requirements.

**CONTEXT:** How can calorie consumption be used to assess metabolic rate, and what historical data suggests widespread hypothyroidism?

**RAY PEAT:** Besides keeping track of the caloric value of the food we eat, it's possible to estimate our metabolic rate fairly closely by measuring our daily fluid intake, and subtracting the amount of urine produced during 24 hours. The missing water was evaporated, and with moderate atmospheric humidity, we evaporate about a liter of water for every 1000 calories we burn.

**CONTEXT:** What is another method for estimating metabolic rate besides tracking calorie intake?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the roles of fat in the food is to stimulate the secretion of bile by the gall bladder. Besides that important function, saturated fats have a variety of protective, antiinflammatory effects, including the reduction of endotoxemia and lipid peroxidation (Nanji, et al., 1997). "Coconut oil completely abolished the responses to endotoxin" (Wan and Grimble, 1987).

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of fat in the diet, particularly saturated fats, in relation to bile secretion and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** Appetizing foods stimulate the digestive secretions, but it's important to avoid foods that directly trigger an inflammatory reaction, or that are indigestible and as a result support harmful bacterial growth. Cellulose can accelerate transit through the intestine and lower estrogen systemically (partly by simply preventing the reabsorption of estrogen that has been secreted by the bile), but the lignans found in many seeds and grains tend to promote inflammation. Raw carrots, for example, lower estrogen, while flax meal can increase it.

**CONTEXT:** What types of foods should be avoided to prevent inflammation and support digestive health, and how do cellulose and lignans affect estrogen levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Constipation or diarrhea, or their alternation, usually develops when there is inflammation in the bowel. A laxative can sometimes reduce the inflammation, but it’s important to identify the foods that contribute to the problem. A salad of shredded carrot, with oil and vinegar dressing, has a germicidal action, and is stimulating to the digestive processes. Most salad vegetables, though, are likely to produce intestinal irritation, directly or as a result of bacterial decomposition.

**CONTEXT:** What are the causes of constipation and diarrhea, and what are the benefits of a carrot salad?

**RAY PEAT:** One or a few of the antiinflammatory measures can often make a tremendous difference, but for serious chronic problems, it's best to use as many safe techniques as possible, including periodic breathing in a paper bag to increase carbon dioxide retention, and taking niacinamide to inhibit lipolysis, until the signs of inflammation begin to subside. Eventually, the goal should be to become "deficient" in the "essential fatty acids," since experiments have shown that such animals are extremely resistant to endotoxin poisoning (Li, et al., 1990).

**CONTEXT:** What are effective strategies for managing chronic inflammation, including breathing techniques and supplements, and what is the significance of essential fatty acid deficiency in relation to endotoxin?
