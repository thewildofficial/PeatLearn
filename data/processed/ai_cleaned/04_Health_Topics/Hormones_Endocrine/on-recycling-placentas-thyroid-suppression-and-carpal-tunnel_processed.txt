He found that corneas transplanted from cadavers that had been kept in cold storage for some time exerted a healing influence on adjacent tissues. He saw similar effects in reconstructive surgery using “tube-flaps” of skin, and concluded that tissues subjected to stressful conditions formed substances which promoted healing and regeneration. (Succinic acid and other dicarboxylic acids were identified among the “biogenic tissue stimulators.” Succinate stimulates respiration and steroid formation, and protects against peroxidative damage. Filatov’s work is an important complement to that of Engelhardt and Szent-Györgyi and Polezhaev and Meerson.) Because abscesses often formed when vital tissue was implanted, Filatov tried sterilized tissue, and found that it was as effective in stimulating healing and regeneration. At this point he realized that tissue extracts would have the same effects, and he made and used extracts from a great variety of “stressed tissues,” including leaves. He published results showing that sterile extracts could stimulate regeneration of the optic nerve, and of various other tissues. Many years after he died, people at the Filatov Institute found that extracts of placentas were extremely beneficial to old people.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion revolves around the work of the Russian scientist Filatov and the use of placental extracts.

**RAY PEAT:** It is easy for an excess of exogenous thyroid hormone to suppress the gland until there is no detectable endogenous thyroid hormone formed (using radioactive tracers), but the important point is that in normal people a totally suppressed thyroid function takes only two or three days to return to normal when the suppressive treatment is stopped. In a small percentage of hypothyroid people, treatment for a short time with thyroid supplementation can stimulate recovery of normal thyroid function, by activating the brain-pituitary system, raising blood sugar which activates the liver enzyme system that produces T3, and by lowering the anti-thyroid stress hormones. Without using radioactive material, it is easy to visualize the process of suppression: very obvious depressions in the neck thyroid region appear on a thoroughly suppressive dose, and reducing the dose for a few days restores the neck contour. This very rapid adaptation of the gland’s anatomy and function to exogenous thyroid is necessary, because of the irregularity of our consumption of thyroid substance in a natural diet. Until this century, everyone ate the thyroid in various small animals, and we still get some in milk and shellfish and a few exotic foods.

The issue is different with thyroxin, T4. The bulk of our active T3 hormone is produced in the liver, as part of a quickly adaptive system for adjusting the metabolic rate in relation to nutritional status, but the pituitary is also able to convert T4 to T3, and a high level of T4 will cause suppression of TSH secretion, even if the liver is failing to produce the active T3, as in aging, stress, cirrhosis, and various other diseases. Thyroxin can literally make hypothyroidism worse. In this case you have suppression without a compensating absorption of active hormone.

Although a little thyroid substance is a normal dietary factor, and digestion of the glandular colloid converts the protein into the hormones in the same kind of process that occurs in normal secretion from the living gland, I agree with Morstein that it is important to restore the gland’s normal function as far as that is possible. I think many of her suggestions derive from the endocrinology course I taught at NCNM in the 1970's, but I think some of the details are wrong. Normalizing the thyroid is now a pretty well defined physiological process, and the biggest problem is ideological, rather than technical. Many cultural forces, especially the drug companies, have made it hard for people to discuss thyroid endocrinology.

**CONTEXT:** The discussion addresses the effects of exogenous thyroid hormone and thyroxin (T4) on thyroid function and the potential for hypothyroidism to be exacerbated by T4.

**RAY PEAT:** When a physician chooses the most profitable diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to a health problem, it is likely to be considered fraudulent if the doctor is a chiropractor, but not if the doctor is a surgeon. If a naturopath tells you that bed rest is the best treatment for a ruptured spinal disc, surgeons will warn you about the dangers of quackery, but the research clearly shows that, for safety and efficacy, surgery is distinctly inferior to bed rest. There are many other cases in which doing nothing, or using a more conservative treatment, is clearly superior to the standard medical or surgical treatment, but the medical industry has learned how to control public opinion by manipulating the mass media.

By consulting with thousands of women who believed they had a hormone imbalance of some sort that their physicians couldn't identify, I began to see several clusters of symptoms that responded immediately to a rational nutritional and hormonal anti-stress program. One of these clusters might be called Subtle Constellation of Absorbed-Mucoprotein-related signs and symptoms, or possibly sub-clinical myxedema, though neither term is likely to be widely adopted in the medical community.

Women are several times more likely than men to have “thyroid disease,” implying because estrogen tends to block thyroid function. Estrogen-induced thyroid hypo-function can be compensated to some degree by various hormonal adjustments; elevated secretion of adrenalin and cortisol are common. When the compensation is inadequate, there will often be hypoglycemia and a tendency to form too much histamine. Too much adrenalin will cause cold hands and feet, too little will cause orthostatic hypotension (blanching out when you stand up too quickly) and bowel spasms, for example.

Various water-binding glycoproteins are formed under the influence of hormones or stress, but whatever proteins are in the blood, including albumin, will show up outside the blood vessels, around the tissue cells, when the blood vessels become leaky. Low thyroid, high estrogen, and high histamine are known to increase the permeability of blood vessels.

Patients who have myxedema typically have mitral valve prolapse, and at autopsy it can be seen that the valve is thickened into a jelly-like mass. Many women with the premenstrual syndrome have a mitral valve heart murmur premenstrually, but not at other times of the month. The jelly can be formed and removed fairly quickly.

Old textbooks on the thyroid gland often listed emphysema as a symptom of myxedema. When rats are given a large injection of estrogen, the oxygenation of blood in their lungs is sharply decreased in less than an hour. Although it is not common to test oxygen diffusion in humans, I know of two women in the same family who showed very poor pulmonary oxygen diffusion after they were put on high doses of estrogen. (Since estrogen inhibits thyroid secretion, and hypothyroidism is associated with elevated estrogen, they should be considered together.) Leakage of proteins from capillaries in the lungs is probably responsible for the decreased diffusion, by thickening the layer through which the oxygen must diffuse.

When myxedema exists in childhood, the cartilage in joints swells, and is deformed, causing a characteristic knock-kneed appearance. In milder form, the swelling can cause joint pain that doesn’t involve the characteristic inflammation of arthritis. In a mild form, the calf muscles tend to swell after prolonged activity; the “growing pains” that are so common around the beginning of puberty are probably the result of a temporary hypothyroid edema of the leg muscles.

When a tendon swells, it is sometimes the result of a local injury or of a particular over-use of a muscle, and in these cases local treatment can sometimes produce a permanent cure. But when the problem keeps recurring, or keeps showing up in different areas, there is probably a general hormonal problem.

When a tendon in the wrist swells, it can cause numbness in the hand, by pressing on a nerve which passes through the carpal tunnel with some tendons. The tunnel is formed by a ligament that holds the tendons in place, and swelling of the ligament itself can contribute to compression of the nerve. Even the connective tissue that forms the nerve sheath itself can swell. Many people with undiagnosed hypothyroidism complain that they “have poor circulation,” and that their hands and feet go to sleep easily. I think these are two separate (but related) problems. Low thyroid people often have cold hands and feet, and they often have nerves that are over-sensitive to compression. Poor oxygenation is involved in edema, both as cause and consequence, but swelling can cause compression and nerve injury in a way that is exacerbated by certain postures or repetitive actions, and this compression can be relieved by surgery. But if the tissue was susceptible to swelling because of the general hormonal environment, other problems will follow. Pinched nerves and arthritis commonly follow treatment of the carpal tunnel syndrome by surgery or local cortisone injections.

**CONTEXT:** This section discusses the medical industry's profit-driven approaches, the link between estrogen, hypothyroidism, and various symptoms including carpal tunnel syndrome, and the physiological mechanisms behind these issues.
