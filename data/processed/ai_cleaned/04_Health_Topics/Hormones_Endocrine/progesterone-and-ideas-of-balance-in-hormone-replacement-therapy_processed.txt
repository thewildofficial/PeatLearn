**RAY PEAT:** Because I came to progesterone research after involvement in other biological issues such as the study of the effects of nuclear fallout and ionizing radiation on the brain, rather than as a physician, I had no commitment to any of the ideas which had grown up with the pharmaceutical industry, and that have become so basic to the professions’ understanding of the actions of drugs and hormones. For example, receptors are supposed to be part of our genetic constitution, making us able to respond to drugs, poisons, hormones, infections, allergens, nervous stimuli, odors, etc. A substance, by binding to its receptor, sets in motion a biological response. With stimuli such as odors and adrenalin, there is a certain logic to the situation—with prolonged stimulation, fatigue sets in, we adapt to a certain level of stimulation, and it then takes a larger amount of the stimulus to produce a response. The receptors are desensitized. But if a stimulus evoked, or increased the quantity of, its own receptor, increasing the tissue’s sensitivity, there would be a tendency for things to get out of control. What could be the biological meaning of such a situation? Imagine applying this principle to various kinds of receptors—any odor would tend to increase until it became overpowering, the heart would be accelerated by smaller and smaller stimuli, or would require stronger and stronger impulses from the vagal nerve to restrain it. Allergy represents what happens when a stimulus creates increased sensitivity to itself; autoimmunity and lymphoma could represent similar processes of positive-feedback, increasing responses to a given level of stimulation. Excitotoxicity, epilepsy, movement disorders, and mania are other examples of what happens when negative (inhibitory) feedback fails.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen's interaction with its receptor differ from other hormonal interactions, and what are the implications of this difference?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen’s action on many tissues increases the tissue’s ability to bind estrogen; estrogen induces its own “receptor,” in a self-stimulating, self-destabilizing process. This is unlike the behavior of other “receptors,” such as the adrenalin receptor, which is inactivated by increased exposure to adrenalin. This unusual interaction between tissue and hormone requires careful examination. For example, estrogen’s immediate effect on a responsive tissue is to cause it to take up water, and to increase its ratio of sodium to potassium; these changes lead to depolarization-activation of nerve, muscle, and some glandular cells, and of initiation of growth and cell division in other cell types. If the stimulation to growth process continued unchecked, or even accelerated, it’s obvious that form and proportion and organization would quickly be lost. Similarly with the other forms of stimulation—activated responses must not continue beyond the organism’s need for them. Estrogenic stimulation, like an allergic reaction, would tend to increase progressively, if it weren’t for the antiestrogens. The antiinflammatory effect of the glucocorticoids on an allergic reaction, preventing anaphylactic shock, are analogous to the effects of the antiestrogens, blocking estrogenic stimulation. The analogy is especially interesting, when we consider that Selye characterized estrogen’s effect as similar to the shock phase of the stress reaction, and that antihistamines are generally antiestrogenic, and antiestrogens are generally antihistaminic.

**CONTEXT:** Given the tendency for estrogen to be excitatory and potentially destabilizing, what is the role of progesterone in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** Since the actual levels of estrogen increase (Musey, et al., 1987; also see Rodriguez, et al., 1993 and O’Rourke, et al., 1996) during a woman’s reproductive years, and then often act almost unopposed during a time around menopause (Nencioni and Polvani, 1985), and tend to increase progressively in aging men, and in both sexes during stress, we need to know what our protective systems are, for interrupting estrogen’s excitatory actions on a great variety of tissues. One of progesterone’s effects is to degrade and eliminate estrogen receptors (Brown and MacLusky, 1994; Medlock, et al., 1994; Okulicz, et al., 1993; Selcer and Leavitt, 1988). This is clearly an antiestrogenic action, and many people like to say the opposite, that progesterone induces estrogen receptors, simply because the idea suits their doctrines of synergy, balance, and more basic ideas of genetic constitution, the nature of gender, etc. But the facts are so clear that they will have to look elsewhere for something to support their orientation. Recently it has been found that estrogen receptors are degraded by proteasomes (Nawaz, et al., 1999; Alarid, et al., 1999). This could relate to the fact that unsaturated fatty acids promote the retention of estrogen in the cell, since unsaturated fatty acids often inhibit proteolytic enzymes. By reducing the cell’s ability to bind estrogen, progesterone acts as an estrogen repellant. But it also activates enzymes which physically/chemically detoxify estrogen, converting it to a water-soluble sulfated form, in which it tends to be expelled from cells and to be excreted in the urine. On the systemic level, progesterone helps to activate the liver’s detoxifying systems, in which other types of enzymes modify estrogen, reducing its activity and preparing it for excretion, in both the bile and the urine.

**CONTEXT:** How does the pharmaceutical industry's classification of progesterone as a "progestin" misrepresent its function, and how should progesterone's role be understood?

**RAY PEAT:** One way of looking at progesterone is that it is an antiestrogen. The estrogen industry doesn’t like that concept, and prefers to think of progesterone as an estrogen synergist. But if its effect is to interrupt estrogen’s excitatory actions, and to eliminate estrogen from the tissues, it is no more “synergic” with estrogen than the inhibitory impulses of the vagus nerve are synergic with the excitatory adrenergic influences. The FDA, in its service to industry, has classified progesterone as a “progestin,” defining the category only in terms of an effect on the uterus. No other pseudo-scientific concept exceeds this in its harmful consequences. But to describe progesterone as an antiestrogen is meaningful only to the extent that we understand the nature of estrogenic stimulation.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between estrogen, testosterone, and masculine/feminine traits, and how does estrogen's role as a "goad" influence this?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen, as an easy derivative of testosterone, is deeply involved in the establishment of masculine features; even in mature women, estrogen excess (progesterone deficiency) can produce hirsutism and other masculine traits when it overstimulates the adrenal glands. As a goad (the term estrogen is based on estrus, gadfly, intense stimulus, goad), estrogen initiates activity in cells and systems; depending on the organism’s resources, that stimulus will be restrained before it gets out of control. Does the specific outcome of stimulation take its direction from estrogen, or rather from the ways in which estrogen is neutralized and detoxified? There are many antiestrogenic systems (thyroid, progesterone, testosterone, sulfation, methylation, glucuronidation, antiinflammatory factors, etc.) and the varied, specific nature of the organism’s response to stimulation is probably sufficient to account for the different outcomes, such as masculinity or femininity, tumefaction or growth, alertness or mania.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogenic activation compare to other forms of cellular stress or injury?

**RAY PEAT:** How specific is estrogenic stimulation itself? Asphyxia, radiation injury, vitamin deficiencies, and other harmful stimuli, closely mimic the estrogenic excitation/shock response. (Boling, et al., 1939; Mandl and Zuckerman, 1956; Biskind, 1946.) Estrogenic activation, with the uptake of water and the loss of potassium (relative to intracellular sodium), is probably the simplest reaction a cell is capable of, and any specificity that can be found in the process is the result of pre-existing cellular conditions, or of defensive reactions of the organism. Depending on its place in the life of an individual, estrogen can either masculinize or feminize, produce breasts or whiskers.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the similarity between radiation injury and estrogenic stimulation, and what protective roles does progesterone play?

**RAY PEAT:** The similarity of radiation injury to estrogenic stimulation has led to studies showing some radiation protection from progesterone; similar protective actions of progesterone can be seen for other types of injury. Thyroid, and other antiestrogens, also have a wide spectrum of protective actions, against radiation, asphyxia, carcinogens, etc.

**CONTEXT:** What fundamental cellular properties explain the coherent activation of cells across different levels, and how does cell water play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** I think the only way to approach the general nature of cellular excitation is to see it in terms of the basic properties of the living material. Only something as general and basic as the cell’s state of hydration, its “wetness,” can account for the coherent way in which cells are activated, with related processes happening at all levels, from chromosomes, to mitochondria and enzymes, the structural protein meshwork of the cytoskeleton, and sensory functions. Cells use something like metaphor or analogy (as previously discussed in relation to J. Cairns’ work, and e.g., in observations such as those of Smith, et al., 1990) to achieve coordination over long distances, and a medium of coordination and cooperation is needed; cell water, with its much structural potential, provides that medium.

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of these bioenergetic principles for medical practice, particularly regarding the concept of "estrogen deficiency" and the use of estrogen supplementation?

**RAY PEAT:** First, that the issue of “estrogen deficiency” must be weighed very carefully. 35 years ago, men were given estrogen “to protect them from heart attacks,” and the treatment increased the incidence of heart problems; several new campaigns are underway to use estrogens to protect both men and women from heart attacks. Similar campaigns, contrary to facts, are being developed in “brain protection,” and other imaginary benefits of estrogen. Consistently, it has been found that the “positive results” found among women who take estrogen aren’t scientifically valid, since the groups were selected in such a way that the women who took estrogen were healthier to begin with than the women who didn’t take estrogen. In the light of such imagined protective effects of estrogen, supplements are being recommended, either without any measurement of estrogen, or on the basis of finding a “low level” of estrogen, without taking any of the opposing or balancing factors into account. The idea of “estrogen deficiency,” like that of “estrogen’s protective action,” is completely without scientific foundation. Any idea of balance suggests that there could be an imbalance in either direction. The harm done by unopposed estrogenic stimulation is clear.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone's effect on cellular hydration and ion balance relate to its broader physiological functions, and how should "side effects" be understood in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone’s effects on cellular hydration and ion balance are related to its fundamental role in stabilizing cellular excitation. Its ability to increase cellular water and promote potassium retention, while reducing sodium influx, contributes to a more polarized and less excitable state. This is crucial for preventing overstimulation and maintaining cellular integrity. The sedative and anesthetic effects of progesterone, which can increase with concentration, are not necessarily "side effects" in the conventional sense. Instead, they represent a continuum of its intrinsic function to dampen excessive cellular activity. In situations where this dampening is not the primary therapeutic goal, such as during normal daily function, these effects might be considered "collateral" to the intended pharmacological action. However, it's important to recognize that the drug industry's concept of "side effect" often promotes a simplistic "one substance-one effect" model, which doesn't capture the nuanced, dose-dependent, and context-specific actions of hormones like progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** How can we conceptualize biological energy, differentiation, and respiratory function in an integrated manner, and what factors influence these processes?

**RAY PEAT:** Therapeutically, we can think in terms of what the organism is doing in response to its challenges, and support those processes of restoration, adaptation, inhibition, and reconstruction. Because excitation or stress is a simple thing—it is any disturbance of the living state’s quiescence—radiation damage, asphyxia, nutritional deficiencies, various poisons, carcinogens, and irritants can imitate the actions of estrogen. Or, looking at estrogen’s meaning in evolution, we could say that estrogen imitates the natural menaces that life confronts, so that the processes of regeneration can be managed and integrated into the life plans of the organisms. This means that antiestrogenic strategies are appropriate under a great variety of conditions. Whatever the challenge, a successful response will restore the organism to a new, high energy state of readiness.

**CONTEXT:** Given that noxious events and natural hormones can produce similar reactions, what role does stimulation play in other aspects of the organism, and how does energy deficit relate to excitation?

**RAY PEAT:** The interaction of energy and structure in the cell means that an energy deficit becomes excitatory. In the case of nutrition, this has been worked out in relatively great detail. Hypoglycemia and arousal mobilize various functional systems to satisfy the need. Pavlov, working on these issues, knew that it was essential to answer the question, “what stimulates the activities that we consider uniquely human?” The exploratory reflex is activated by novelty, by anything which isn’t understood. The need/desire for freedom and understanding has the same basic pattern as the other needs, and it has apparently evolved by differentiation from the basic sensitivity of the living material. The relatively mild stimulation of novelty, when combined with meeting basic needs and preventing irrelevant, stressful stimulation, can be therapeutic. For example, in a digestive disturbance, therapeutic stimulation might be achieved by something as mild as beef broth, acting by intrinsic (unconditional) chemical processes, or by some simple alteration in the way the food is prepared, or a change in the mealtime atmosphere. The therapeutic effect of laughter, which is produced by surprise, can be seen in terms of a basic organismic process of organizing resources, creatively adapting to produce a new state of readiness. In outline, a benign stimulation is one which can be met with adequate energy, with good humor, and with an adequate amount of progesterone and related chemical resources.

**CONTEXT:** What is the ultimate understanding of estrogen's role in the organism, and how does its interaction with progesterone contribute to overall stability?

**RAY PEAT:** All of the information that has accumulated about estrogen in the last century leads to the view that it is the organism’s means of producing a momentary and localized imbalance, goading cells into activity. An important factor in the integration of this momentary imbalance into the life of the organism is the manner in which destabilizing excitation and the restoration of stability, e.g., estrogen and progesterone production, relate to each other. Estrogen stimulates the formation of progesterone, and progesterone lowers the concentration of estrogen. (Liu, et al., 1997) Whether we consider pregnancy, or bone metabolism, or the health of the brain or the circulatory system, no situation has been identified in which the “balance of estrogen and progesterone” can be improved by the use of estrogen supplementation. But there is a tremendous amount of information showing that reproduction and the health of bones, brain, and circulatory system, and many other functions, can be improved by antiestrogenic approaches. The pharmaceutical industry is trying to exploit this information, by reclassifying their antiestrogenic drugs as “designer estrogens.” But the body already has its proper array of antiestrogenic strategies, which can be supported in many safe and economical ways.
