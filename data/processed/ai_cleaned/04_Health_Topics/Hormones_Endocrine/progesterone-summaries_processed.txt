**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is the most protective hormone the body produces. The large amounts produced during pregnancy are for the developing baby's protection from a stressful environment. The brain has a very high concentration of progesterone, reflecting its protective function. The thymus gland, key to the immune system, is also profoundly dependent on progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental role of progesterone in the body?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is the basic hormone of adaptation and resistance to stress. Adrenal glands use it to produce antistress hormones, preventing the need to produce potentially harmful cortisol. Progesterone deficiency leads to excessive cortisol, which causes osteoporosis, skin aging, brain cell damage, and fat accumulation, particularly on the back and abdomen.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone relate to stress and cortisol production?

**RAY PEAT:** Experiments show progesterone relieves anxiety, improves memory, protects brain cells, and prevents epileptic seizures. It promotes respiration and has been used to correct emphysema. In the circulatory system, it prevents bulging veins by increasing blood vessel tone and improves heart efficiency. It reverses signs of skin aging and promotes healthy bone growth. It can relieve arthritis and helps with immunological problems.

**CONTEXT:** What are the specific benefits of progesterone for brain and cardiovascular health?

**RAY PEAT:** When dissolved in vitamin E, progesterone is efficiently absorbed and distributed to all tissues. In women with ovaries, it helps regulate their function and hormone production, and restores normal thyroid and other gland function. If ovaries are removed, progesterone should be taken consistently to replace the lost supply. Progesterone deficiency is often associated with increased susceptibility to cancer, and progesterone has been used to treat some types of cancer.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone absorption work, and what is its role in women's health, particularly after ovary removal?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is not just for pregnancy; it's of far greater and more basic physiological significance than testosterone. While men produce progesterone and can benefit from it, it's not a male hormone. Progesterone is the body's natural complement to estrogen. Used alone, it often makes estrogen unnecessary for symptoms like hot flashes or insomnia.

**CONTEXT:** What is the broader significance of progesterone beyond its role in pregnancy, and how does it interact with estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** When dissolved in vitamin E, progesterone enters the bloodstream through membranes like the lips, tongue, gums, or palate. When swallowed with food, it's absorbed with digestion, circulating to organs before liver processing.

**CONTEXT:** How is progesterone absorbed when taken orally or topically?

**RAY PEAT:** For symptomatic relief of tendonitis, bursitis, arthritis, or sunburn, progesterone in vitamin E can be applied locally after a little olive oil. For migraines, it can be taken orally at the onset of symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** What are the practical applications of progesterone for localized pain and headaches?

**RAY PEAT:** The normal progesterone secretion pattern involves a large amount produced in the second half of the menstrual cycle (days 14-28), starting at ovulation and ending around menstruation. An average person produces about 30 mg daily during this period. A solution with 3-4 mg of progesterone per drop means 3-4 drops (10-15 mg) can often normalize progesterone levels. This dose can be repeated once or twice daily to alleviate PMS symptoms. Progesterone is more effective when estrogen production is balanced; if estrogen is extremely high, progesterone may have no clear effect, necessitating regulation of estrogen metabolism through diet and thyroid support. Unsaturated fats are antithyroid and synergize with estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended dosage and timing for progesterone supplementation for Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)?

**RAY PEAT:** Perimenopausal symptoms are linked to decreasing progesterone production while estrogen may be at a lifetime high. Cyclic progesterone use (two weeks on, two weeks off) can help maintain the normal menstrual cycle. A typical daily dose is 3-4 drops (10-12 mg), though some prefer to repeat it. Progesterone is more effective with adequate dietary protein and minimal unsaturated fat.

**CONTEXT:** How should progesterone be used during perimenopause?

**RAY PEAT:** Some women continue cyclic progesterone use postmenopause as the pituitary and brain may continue to cycle, and progesterone regulates their function. This cycling affects adrenal glands and other organs, and progesterone protects against unopposed prolactin, cortisol, and adrenal androgenic hormones. Progesterone's pituitary effects contribute to protection against osteoporosis, hypertension, and hirsutism. Others prefer continuous progesterone use postmenopause for its antistress effects. Slender individuals typically need 2-3 drops daily, repeated as needed. Adequate protein and good thyroid function support the body's own progesterone production, even after ovary removal, as adrenal glands and the brain continue to produce it.

**CONTEXT:** What are the recommendations for progesterone use in postmenopausal women?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone has no harmful side effects like other hormones, except for potential menstrual cycle alteration if taken at the wrong time. The goal is to use enough to eliminate symptoms and time its use to avoid disrupting menstrual cycles, typically between ovulation and menstruation unless symptoms are severe.

**CONTEXT:** What is the general principle for determining the correct dosage and timing of progesterone supplementation?

**RAY PEAT:** If a person has an enlarged thyroid, progesterone can promote thyroid secretion and unloading of colloid, potentially causing a temporary hyperthyroid state. This is a corrective process. A thyroid supplement should be used to shrink the goiter before progesterone administration. Normal progesterone levels facilitate thyroid secretion, while deficiency, with unopposed estrogen, causes thyroid enlargement. Euphoria can be a sign of a good physiological state. Very large doses in vitamin E solution can achieve levels similar to late pregnancy, causing euphoria and anesthesia. To avoid unexpected anesthesia, determine the correct dose by taking about 10 mg, allowing it to spread into the mouth membranes, and repeating every 10 minutes until symptoms are controlled.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone interact with thyroid function, and what are the considerations for dosage to avoid side effects like anesthesia?

**RAY PEAT:** An excessive estrogen/progesterone ratio is a more common cause or aggravator of symptoms than isolated estrogen excess or progesterone deficiency. This ratio is influenced by age, diet, other steroids, thyroid, and other hormones. Estrogen excess appears to cause tissue hypoxia through changes in alveolar diffusion, peripheral vascular effects, and intracellular oxygen wastage.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the estrogen/progesterone ratio and its link to hypoxia?

**RAY PEAT:** Hypoxia leads to edema and hypoglycemia because glycolysis increases significantly with even small oxygen deficiencies. Elevated blood lactic acid is a sign of tissue hypoxia. Edema, hypoglycemia, and lactic academia can also result from other "respiratory" defects, including hypothyroidism, where tissues don't use enough oxygen. In hypoxia, the skin appears bluer in thin areas, while low oxygen consumption causes the skin to look relatively bloodless. Low thyroid is a cause of estrogen excess, and when high estrogen combines with low thyroid, the skin appears bloodless.

**CONTEXT:** How does hypoxia manifest physiologically, and what is its relationship to thyroid function and skin appearance?

**RAY PEAT:** Symptoms in cycling women are most common around ovulation and in the premenstrual week, when the estrogen/progesterone ratio is highest. Puberty, the early twenties, late thirties, and menopause are ages when this ratio is often disturbed, coinciding with common thyroid disorders in women.

**CONTEXT:** At what life stages are hormonal imbalances, particularly the estrogen/progesterone ratio, most likely to cause symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** Individuals with one aspect of progesterone and/or thyroid deficiency tend to develop other problems. Cyclic depression or migraines at age 22 may lead to breast disease later and pregnancy complications. Those with a history of severe symptoms are more prone to severe menopausal issues. Prenatal exposure to imbalanced hormones can predispose a child to later hormonal problems.

**CONTEXT:** What is the long-term progression of hormonal deficiencies and their impact on health?

**RAY PEAT:** Excessive stress can block progesterone synthesis and elevate estrogen, triggering symptoms in individuals who previously had none. Long daylight hours, like in Alaska, can relieve chronic symptoms. Dark, cloudy winters in places like the Pacific Northwest are stressors that lower progesterone production in women and testosterone in men. Toxins and nutritional deficiencies can also cause similar symptoms. A common cause of estrogen excess is dietary protein deficiency, impairing the liver's ability to detoxify estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** What external factors and lifestyle choices can influence progesterone levels and trigger hormonal symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** With a diet high in protein (70-100 grams daily, including eggs) and vitamin A (not beta-carotene), the dose of progesterone can be reduced monthly. Thyroid supplementation usually decreases the need for progesterone. Occasionally, a woman may not respond even to 100 mg of progesterone, suggesting a need for thyroid and dietary adjustments to normalize estrogen, prolactin, and cortisol.

**CONTEXT:** How can diet and thyroid support reduce the need for progesterone supplementation?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone stimulates the ovaries and adrenals to produce progesterone and activates the thyroid, leading to prolonged effects from a single dose. Indefinite progesterone use may not be necessary unless the ovaries have been removed. For slender post-menopausal women, 10 mg daily is usually sufficient to prevent progesterone deficiency symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** What is the long-term outlook for progesterone supplementation, and what is a typical maintenance dose for postmenopausal women?

**RAY PEAT:** In a 10% progesterone solution in vitamin E, one drop contains about three milligrams of progesterone. The body normally produces 10-20 mg per day. A dose of 3-4 drops typically raises blood levels to the normal range, but this can be repeated several times daily if needed to control symptoms.

**CONTEXT:** What is the concentration of progesterone in a typical vitamin E solution, and what is a standard dose?

**RAY PEAT:** For general purposes, taking progesterone dissolved in vitamin E orally is economical and effective. This can be done by placing drops on the lips and tongue or rubbing them into the gums, which is also beneficial for gum health. These membranes are thin, allowing rapid entry into the bloodstream. When swallowed, vitamin E aids absorption through the stomach and intestinal walls, allowing assimilation with food in chylomicrons, which circulate to organs before liver processing.

**CONTEXT:** What is the most effective and economical way to take progesterone, and how does vitamin E facilitate its absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** For topical treatment of sun-damaged skin, acne, or wrinkles, the progesterone oil can be applied directly to the affected area.

**CONTEXT:** How can progesterone be used topically for skin conditions?
