**RAY PEAT:** Proliferation is the natural tendency of all cells. In multicellular organisms, many cells remain quiescent for years. Oxidative metabolism is crucial for maintaining this quiescence and the organism's organization. The extracellular matrix and the materials passing through it are essential for cellular function. Aging leads to changes in the connective tissue matrix, making it tougher. Estrogen increases collagen formation, separating cells from their blood supply by a thickened barrier of water and collagen. This alters the developmental field, making it difficult for cells to maintain their proper place, and in an energy-deprived state, some revert to a proliferative state. Thyroid hormone, the regulator of oxidative metabolism, is fundamental for respiration and sustaining the multicellular state.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental role of oxidative metabolism in maintaining the multicellular state, and how do hormones like estrogen and thyroid hormone influence this?

**RAY PEAT:** The simple idea of hormone antagonism, like between catabolic and anabolic steroids or progesterone and estrogen, is experimentally based. However, medical endocrinology often assumes synergy based on hormone names, rather than recognizing their contrasting actions. Hundreds of estrogen's biological actions are reversed by progesterone, and vice versa.

**CONTEXT:** How do hormones like estrogen and progesterone interact, and what are the implications of their opposing actions?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen excess causes problems like shock, capillary leakage, excessive clotting, epilepsy, goiter, and hyperactivity, which are normalized by progesterone. Alejandro Lipschutz established over fifty years ago that estrogen promotes cancerization, while progesterone opposes it. Despite this, the drug industry and regulatory agencies have hindered a rational approach to hormone use in cancer prevention and treatment. For decades, estrogen has been promoted for cancer prevention and treatment, with industry claims that it is not carcinogenic and preventing its classification as such. Conversely, natural progesterone has been falsely accused of causing cancer or being ineffective. Billions spent on cancer research have ignored this basic knowledge, and research favorable to progesterone has been suppressed by medical journals and conferences.

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical context of estrogen and progesterone research in relation to cancer, and what has been the role of the pharmaceutical industry?

**RAY PEAT:** The "genetic determination" idea has benefited the drug industry. If moderate estrogen didn't cause mutations in genes distinguishing normal from cancer cells, how could it be carcinogenic? If cancer cells are "genetically committed," only lethal cytotoxic methods would be considered therapies.

**CONTEXT:** How has the concept of "genetic determination" influenced the understanding and treatment of cancer, particularly in relation to hormonal influences?

**RAY PEAT:** The history of estrogen and progesterone research offers an alternative view of cancer and physiology. Hans Selye demonstrated in the 1940s that progesterone produced rapid, deep anesthesia, indicating effects not mediated by gene activation. Estrogen's rapid actions, like tissue water uptake and nervous excitation, were also ignored because they contradicted the doctrine of genetic determination. Estrogen acts on multiple levels, affecting water, proteins, fats, immune, circulatory, and nervous systems. It's not just a "carcinogen" or "female hormone"; substances like cholera toxin, x-rays, and oxygen deprivation mimic many of its effects.

**CONTEXT:** What are the rapid, non-genomic effects of hormones like progesterone and estrogen, and why were they historically overlooked?

**RAY PEAT:** Energy generates and maintains order. The destruction of order degrades cellular energy production.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental relationship between energy and cellular order?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone and related substances act on multiple levels of organization simultaneously. Protein-water interactions are immediately altered, leading to circulatory, nervous, and bioelectrical responses that coincide with changes in cellular functions, including receptor systems. The functional changes observed within minutes of progesterone's action lead to metabolic and then more fundamental structural changes.

**CONTEXT:** How does progesterone exert its effects on cellular organization and function?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone stabilizes and activates mitochondria, shifting metabolism away from glycolysis (Joe and Ramirez, 2001: GAPDH inhibition). This is the opposite of estrogen's toxic effects on mitochondria, such as increasing nitric oxide and activating glycolysis.

**CONTEXT:** What are the specific effects of progesterone and estrogen on mitochondrial function and energy metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** On a molecular level, progesterone and estrogen have different structural effects that account for their globally opposite regulatory effects. Their distinct impacts on energy production lead to global differences in the regulation of cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones, and cellular organelles. This contributes to macroscopic shifts in the distribution of substances throughout the organism, including water, fats, and extracellular matrix components like collagen and glycoproteins.

**CONTEXT:** How do the molecular structures of progesterone and estrogen lead to their opposing regulatory effects on cellular and organismic functions?

**RAY PEAT:** If progesterone is the "hormone of gestation," then estrogen could be called the "hormone of miscarriage."

**CONTEXT:** What is the functional distinction between progesterone and estrogen in terms of their roles in reproduction and development?

**RAY PEAT:** The characteristic metabolic end-product of progesterone-dominated metabolism is carbon dioxide. During gestation, the fetus is exposed to high levels of progesterone and carbon dioxide. High progesterone concentrations prevent tissues from retaining excess estrogen. High carbon dioxide levels offer numerous protective effects, including preventing lactic acid formation.

**CONTEXT:** What are the key metabolic end-products associated with progesterone-dominated metabolism, and what are their protective roles, particularly during gestation?

**RAY PEAT:** Every tumor is biologically unique but compatible with its host, similar to tissue compatibility in twins sharing a placenta despite genetic differences.

**CONTEXT:** What is the biological compatibility of tumors with their host, and what analogy can be drawn to explain this?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide spontaneously combines with amine groups in proteins, influencing protein interactions and inhibiting protein glycation. Protein glycation, associated with stress and aging, degrades protein and cellular function and contributes to the hardening of connective tissues with aging. Fibrosis of aging is linked to generalized inflammation, catabolism, and atrophy, with some areas regenerating cells and tissues in disorganized ways, leading to abnormalities that can be diagnosed as "precancerous" and potentially develop into tumors.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide influence protein function and aging, and what is the connection between fibrosis, inflammation, and cancer development?

**RAY PEAT:** A.V. Everitt's work on the pituitary and aging mentions studies linking progesterone and aging. Uterine collagen aging, increased by estrogen, is lowest in older rodents that have bred more often, likely due to progesterone's action on collagenase and fibroblasts and its ability to displace estrogen. Leo Loeb showed that excess estrogen and aging both increase collagen. Alejandro Lipschutz found chronic estrogen treatment caused fibrosis in virtually all tissues, leading to cancer development. Progesterone was the most effective steroid in inhibiting this fibromatogenic action, followed by pregnenolone. Brief, intermittent estrogen exposure did not cause harm, and progesterone reduces estrogen retention. Lipschutz's 1950 book summarizes this work.

**CONTEXT:** What research has demonstrated the antifibrotic and anti-aging effects of progesterone, and how does it compare to estrogen's effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Contemporaries of Loeb and Lipschutz, such as Joseph Needham, C.H. Waddington, and J.W. Orr, argued that cancer evolves through tissue-level developments rather than solely at the cellular level.

**CONTEXT:** What was the prevailing view on cancer development among contemporaries of Loeb and Lipschutz, and how did it differ from a purely cellular perspective?

**RAY PEAT:** Hans Selye later showed that partial tissue isolation, like growth within a small implanted glass tube in a rat, dramatically accelerated aging in the isolated cells and matrix. An impermeable plastic sheet folded into a concavity implanted in an animal could induce cancer. The thickened connective tissue matrix formed with aging, irritation, and stress creates numerous areas where cells are cut off from their normal environment.

**CONTEXT:** How did Hans Selye's experiments on tissue isolation and implanted materials shed light on the environmental factors contributing to aging and cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen treatment at menopause causes alkalosis and hyperventilation, stimulating peroxidation and other harmful stress products. Prenatally, estrogen excess can retard fetal brain growth due to its antigestational metabolic actions, which are utilized in contraceptive and abortion pills.

**CONTEXT:** What are the metabolic consequences of estrogen excess, both at menopause and during prenatal development?

**RAY PEAT:** All cancer cells produce lactate even in the presence of oxygen, increasing intracellular alkalinity, promoting swelling, calcium uptake, and proliferation. Prolonged exposure to lactic acid increases collagen formation and fibrosis.

**CONTEXT:** What is the metabolic characteristic of cancer cells that contributes to their proliferation and the development of fibrosis?

**RAY PEAT:** I view high altitude as analogous to the protected gestational state, where both progesterone and carbon dioxide are increased in adapted individuals. Respiratory acidosis, or carbon dioxide retention, is highly protective and a hallmark of uterine life. Adequate carbon dioxide is crucial even during embryo implantation. Many embryological and developmental mysteries are explained by the high carbon dioxide levels during gestation, such as scar-free healing of fetal injuries through complete regeneration. Enclosing a wound in an airtight compartment can allow remarkable regeneration, even in adults, as exposure to air causes tissues to lose carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** How does the physiological state during gestation, particularly the role of carbon dioxide, relate to tissue regeneration and healing, and what parallels can be drawn to other physiological conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** High altitude sickness is treated with acetazolamide (which promotes carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis) or direct carbon dioxide inhalation. Sleep apnea, historically treated with progesterone, is now treated with acetazolamide, recognizing its link to alkalosis. Both progesterone and acetazolamide increase tissue carbon dioxide by reducing sensitivity to it, while simultaneously stimulating respiration by increasing sensitivity to oxygen deprivation (Wagenaar, et al., 2000). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, similar to acetazolamide, have recently been found to halt the growth of various tumors.

**CONTEXT:** What are the therapeutic implications of carbon dioxide retention and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in treating conditions like high altitude sickness, sleep apnea, and cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide, progesterone, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors generally stabilize and protect cells. They all inhibit epileptic seizures and are involved in regulating calcium, preventing bone loss and hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia is common in cancer and dangerous if uncontrolled.

**CONTEXT:** What are the common protective mechanisms of carbon dioxide, progesterone, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, particularly in relation to calcium regulation and neurological conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** Increased intracellular calcium is excitatory and interferes with mitochondrial energy production. Prolonged oxygen deprivation increases intracellular calcium (Smith, et al., 2001). Cancer cells can disrupt the calcium regulation of other cells, causing them to break contact (Tsuji, et al., 2002). Increased intracellular calcium can also lead to cellular reorganization and spontaneous proliferation (Furst, et al., 2002). The intracellular architecture, depolymerized by calcium excitation, links the extracellular matrix to nuclear gene regulation. Generally, factors that increase intracellular calcium (estrogen, prolactin, alkalinity, swelling, cadmium, iron) also increase cellular proliferation. Drugs that decrease intracellular calcium are increasingly recognized for their ability to halt cancer cell proliferation.

**CONTEXT:** How does intracellular calcium regulation impact cellular energy production, proliferation, and the interaction between cells and their environment, particularly in the context of cancer?

**RAY PEAT:** Increased intracellular calcium also promotes collagen formation, and drugs that decrease intracellular calcium reduce collagen secretion.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between intracellular calcium levels and collagen synthesis?

**RAY PEAT:** If cancer is a spontaneous process of healing and regeneration gone awry due to environmental changes and loss of contact with its "formative field," then the approach to cancer prevention and treatment should be to restore that field. The conditions of gestation represent the highest known formative field for mammals.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed underlying mechanism of cancer development, and what is the ideal approach to its prevention and treatment based on this understanding?

**RAY PEAT:** During gestation, after organ differentiation, nerve cells extend fibers to innervate muscles and tissues. The uterine environment supports this, but similar processes can occur in adults during nerve regeneration. A key difference between fetal and adult injury is that fetal wounds regenerate without scars, while adult regeneration is often impaired, with connective tissue scars replacing functional tissue.

**CONTEXT:** What are the differences in tissue regeneration between fetal and adult injuries, and what role does the uterine environment play?

**RAY PEAT:** The intestinal nerves of stressed animals fragment, forming beads before axons break. Axons require very low surface tension to remain stable due to their high surface-to-volume ratio. Ordinary water's high surface tension causes it to form drops rather than filaments. Progesterone, being highly lipophilic, lowers cytoplasmic surface tension and powerfully improves nerve cell regeneration. During stress, cells become oxygen-deprived, produce lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide, and the lipophilic, acidic gas is replaced by hydrophilic lactate.

**CONTEXT:** How does stress affect nerve integrity, and what role does progesterone play in nerve regeneration and maintaining the stability of nerve axons?

**RAY PEAT:** Carbon dioxide protects nerves and muscles from excessive excitation, inhibits lactic acid formation, and can completely suppress lipid peroxidation at a pCO2 of about 90 mm, without causing acidosis.

**CONTEXT:** What are the protective effects of carbon dioxide on nerve and muscle tissue, and how does it influence metabolic processes like lactic acid formation and lipid peroxidation?

**RAY PEAT:** Hospital respirators often hyperventilate patients, and supplemental oxygen can worsen this, hindering breathing and circulation. Carbogen (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) is available but rarely used. Hyperbaric oxygen is safer and more effective with added carbon dioxide, though the required amount varies with pressure. Improved understanding of nerve and respiratory physiology could help more people recover from brain and spinal cord injuries.

**CONTEXT:** What are the issues with current respiratory support practices, and how could the use of carbon dioxide improve outcomes for neurological injuries?

**RAY PEAT:** A common sign of estrogen excess is capillary leakage. Simple hyperventilation can cause this, leading to decreased carbon dioxide and increased serotonin release. Edema, fibrosis, and inflammation resulting from capillary leakage alter cellular energy production. Serotonin and other substances released during stress-induced alkalosis stimulate cell multiplication.

**CONTEXT:** How does estrogen excess manifest in capillary function, and what are the downstream effects on cellular energy and proliferation?

**RAY PEAT:** Cellular excitation due to carbon dioxide deficiency increases energy demand. If energy production is suppressed (by estrogen, serotonin, edema), cells will adapt or die.

**CONTEXT:** What happens to cells when they experience carbon dioxide deficiency and suppressed energy production?

**RAY PEAT:** In a degenerating extracellular matrix with impaired energy supply, some cells attempt to repair or regenerate tissue by proliferating and degrading the matrix. However, encountering more damaged tissue and other proliferating cells, they adapt in a disorganized manner without a stable organismic field, potentially leading to malignant tumors.

**CONTEXT:** How can a degenerating extracellular matrix and impaired energy supply contribute to the development of malignant tumors?

**RAY PEAT:** A 1951 symposium chapter by Roy Hertz et al. on progesterone's effect on cervical carcinoma followed up on Lipschutz's findings of progesterone's antitumorigenic effects. They reported significant regression in 11 of 17 treated patients, with reduced tumor size, vascularity, friability, and improved epithelization and pliability of surrounding tissues. Despite these favorable results, they concluded progesterone was not sufficient as a therapeutic agent for cervical carcinoma, a conclusion made even more striking by the subsequent discussion of estrogens' ambiguous effects on breast cancer being considered valuable. Institutional sponsorship of the symposium likely influenced these conclusions.

**CONTEXT:** What were the findings of Hertz et al. regarding progesterone's effect on cervical carcinoma, and why is their conclusion noteworthy in the context of estrogen's effects and institutional influence?

**RAY PEAT:** Hertz et al. administered 250 mg of progesterone in vegetable oil intramuscularly, usually daily, for 10 to 170 days, without reporting sedation or anesthesia. Hans Selye found large doses of progesterone caused profound anesthesia in rats, but this is not reported in humans due to inadequate pharmaceutical formulations. Progesterone dissolved in vitamin E (10% or 20%) can cause semi-anesthesia with 100 mg and profound anesthesia with higher doses. While high doses can be lethal to rats, lower anesthetic doses stimulate the respiratory center.

**CONTEXT:** What are the observed effects of different progesterone formulations and dosages on anesthesia and respiratory function, and how do these compare between species?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone has poor solubility in ordinary vegetable oils. Formulations with 250 mg/ml often contain benzyl alcohol as a solvent, which, being water-soluble, causes progesterone to crystallize immediately after intramuscular injection. Previous writings have detailed the history of medical progesterone and the fraudulent claims and doctrines shaping its use.

**CONTEXT:** What are the formulation challenges with progesterone, and what historical factors have influenced its medical application?

**RAY PEAT:** My observations indicate progesterone is more effective in treating various cancers than published literature suggests, yet journal editors disagree. A patent examiner advised removing any mention of cancer for my progesterone-in-vitamin E formulation to be approved. The "evil mutant cell" theory of cancer and the classification of progesterone as a "gestational hormone" or progestin discourage consideration of its broader regulatory functions.

**CONTEXT:** What are the obstacles to recognizing progesterone's broader therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer treatment, and what is the role of prevailing scientific paradigms?

**RAY PEAT:** Synthetic "progestins" share some progesterone properties and have shown curative effects in various cancers. However, the dominant cancer culture leads to their use with cytotoxic chemicals or radiation, rather than with factors that would synergize with their "progestational" actions and correct the organismic field.

**CONTEXT:** How are synthetic progestins utilized in cancer treatment, and what is the missed opportunity in their therapeutic application?

**RAY PEAT:** Since progesterone raises tissue carbon dioxide levels, other methods that increase carbon dioxide should be used concurrently. Thyroid hormone is crucial for carbon dioxide production, preventing lactic acidosis, adrenaline excess, and other processes that lower carbon dioxide. Thyroid is also essential for progesterone synthesis, restraining estrogen synthesis, and accelerating estrogen elimination.

**CONTEXT:** What are the synergistic therapies that should be used alongside progesterone to enhance its cancer-fighting effects, and what is the role of thyroid hormone in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone, thyroid, and carbon dioxide protect against cancer-promoting actions of calcium by increasing respiratory energy, which favors intracellular magnesium over calcium. Adequate dietary magnesium is crucial. A calcium-deficient diet is counterproductive, as it increases intracellular calcium at the expense of bone calcium.

**CONTEXT:** How do progesterone, thyroid, and carbon dioxide protect against cancer, and what is the importance of magnesium and calcium balance in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** The immense power of the pharmaceutical industry and its controlled government agencies marginalizes the work of researchers like Lipschutz and Needham. Without a meaningful context, individuals with authoritarian tendencies may believe science is solely about comparing the latest products. Newer "alternative medicine" products, if they adhere to the same flawed views of cancer and life that drive the old products, cannot bring about real change.

**CONTEXT:** How does the influence of the pharmaceutical industry and government agencies impact scientific progress and the perception of health and disease, particularly concerning cancer?
