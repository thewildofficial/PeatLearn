**RAY PEAT:** "The effectiveness of the transdermal (absorption) route of administration varies with the individual, but compares favorably with injections in the amount assimilated. Thickness of skin or degree of circulation in the skin (these can be very abnormal in hypothyroidism, for example) and the amount of adipose tissue apparently make some difference in the rate of absorption and response. When a small daily dose (e.g., 5 or 10 mg.) is sufficient, this can be taken as about 250 mg. of a three percent cream rubbed into the throat, where it will leave no noticeable oiliness after a few minutes. For large doses, the appropriate amount can be applied to a larger area of skin after a hot bath, once or twice a day if necessary."

**CONTEXT:** How does transdermal progesterone absorption vary, and what are practical application guidelines?

**RAY PEAT:** "We have used transdermal progesterone therapy in two hundred women suffering from the full range of premenstrual symptoms, including migraine, acne, depression, mastalgia, edema, and lethargy, and we found that nearly all of the women, applying the lotion themselves, are able to find the appropriate dosage for controlling their symptoms. Occasionally, thyroid therapy, weight reduction, or change in some aspect of life-style is necessary for complete relief from symptoms. We have learned that it is necessary to be very explicit in describing the amounts that can be used, while leaving it up to the patient to find the dose which controls her symptoms, because some women have an exaggerated idea of the power of a 'hormone.' We have learned, when some women said the progesterone had no effect, that they were applying it as sparingly as they would a rare perfume, just touching it to their wrists."

**CONTEXT:** What has been the observed effectiveness and patient experience with transdermal progesterone for PMS symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** "Another problem we have encountered is that a few women have trouble understanding how, if their edema is caused by 'hormones,' a 'hormone' could relieve the edema. We have usually solved such problems by applying one dose (sometimes using a twenty-five percent solution) in the office, and waiting thirty or forty minutes to make sure that it was large enough to take effect. Once having felt sudden relief from this 'cold cream,' it is easier for the patient to understand how it should be used."

**CONTEXT:** How can the mechanism of transdermal progesterone in relieving edema be explained to patients?

**RAY PEAT:** "Unfortunately, many of the solvents which hold progesterone stably in a concentrated solution are highly allergenic. Injectable progesterone in oil could be used transdermally except for this problem. Progesterone can be removed from an injectable water suspension, and dissolved in warm olive or almond oil for transdermal use in patients who react to other solvents."
