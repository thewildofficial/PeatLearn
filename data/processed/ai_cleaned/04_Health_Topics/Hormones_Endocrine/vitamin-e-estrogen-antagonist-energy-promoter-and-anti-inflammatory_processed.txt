**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin E, like progesterone and aspirin, acts within the cellular regulatory systems, to prevent inflammation and inappropriate excitation. Since uncontrolled excitation causes destructive oxidations, these substances prevent those forms of oxidation. Molecules that can easily be oxidized and reduced can function as antioxidants, and vitamin E does function as that kind of antioxidant in many chemical environments. But it is highly misleading to consider that as the explanation for its many beneficial biological effects. That kind of reasoning contributed to the use of the antioxidant carcinogens BHT and BHA as food additives and "antiaging" supplements, and many other chemicals are being promoted on the basis of their abstract antioxidant function.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental mechanism of action for Vitamin E, beyond its antioxidant properties?

**RAY PEAT:** Becoming aware of the real value of vitamin E will have far reaching implications in nutrition and medicine.

**CONTEXT:** What is the broader significance of understanding Vitamin E's true function?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin E was advocated as an effective treatment for heart disease by Dr. Evan Shute of London, Ontario more than 50 years ago. His pioneering claims, which were unacceptable to the medical community at large, have been confirmed by recent findings from epidemiologic studies and clinical trials.

**CONTEXT:** Who were some of the early proponents of Vitamin E for heart disease, and what was the initial reception?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1940s, it had already become clear to the estrogen industry that vitamin E research was impinging on its vital interests.

**CONTEXT:** What industry had a vested interest in suppressing Vitamin E research?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1933 the physician R.J. Shute was aware of the problems associated with toxemia of pregnancy or preeclampsia. Especially among poorly nourished women, many pregnancies were complicated by circulatory problems, including cyclic bleeding, thrombosis, stroke, and hypertension, and these difficult pregnancies often ended in miscarriage or premature delivery, resulting in many serious health problems among the babies that survived. At that time, both estrogen and vitamin E were being widely studied, though the exact structure of the tocopherol molecule wasn't defined until 1936-37. Vitamin E had been found to improve fertility of both male and female animals, and to prevent intrauterine death of the embryo or fetus, so it was called the "antisterility vitamin." Using it to prevent women from having miscarriages must have occurred to many people. Animal research in the 1930s was also showing that estrogen had many toxic effects, including causing infertility or intrauterine death, connective tissue abnormalities, and excessive blood clotting. Dr. Shute and his sons, Wilfred and Evan, were among those who considered vitamin E to be an antiestrogen. They found that it was very effective in preventing the clotting diseases of pregnancy. Other researchers, who knew that progesterone protected against the toxic effects of estrogen, described vitamin E as the "progesterone-sparing agent," since so many of its antiestrogenic effects resembled those of progesterone. The Shute brothers began using vitamin E to treat circulatory diseases in general, rather than just in pregnant women--blood clots, phlebitis, hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes all responded well to treatment with large doses.

**CONTEXT:** What were the early observations regarding Vitamin E's effects on pregnancy and circulatory issues, and how did it relate to estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin E, as its name indicates, was the fifth type of "vitamin" factor to be identified, and it received its name in 1922, even though its chemical structure hadn't been identified. The public quickly understood and accepted that certain substances in food were essential for life and health, so by 1940 practically all physicians were recommending the use of nutritional supplements. If vitamin E was essential for human health, and achieved at least some of its amazing effects by opposing estrogen, then the synthetic estrogen industry had a problem.

**CONTEXT:** How did the early understanding of Vitamin E's essentiality pose a challenge to the burgeoning estrogen industry?

**RAY PEAT:** The drug industry began using his techniques in sometimes crude but always effective ways. Estrogen was named "the female hormone;" natural hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, were claimed, without any research, to be inactive when taken orally. Physician-shills were created to claim wonderful effects for estrogen. The vitamin status of the tocopherols was denied; as recently as the 1970s (and maybe later), university professors of dietetics were flatly saying "no one needs vitamin E." Very little research showing the curative effects of vitamin E in human diseases was allowed to be published, so it was only occasionally necessary to openly denounce vitamin E as worthless or dangerous. In 1981, the journal of the AMA published an article reviewing the "toxic" effects of vitamin E. Since I had read all of the articles cited, I realized that the author was claiming that whenever vitamin E changed something, the change was harmful, even though the original publication had described the effect as beneficial. Although JAMA was eventually forced to give up its revenue from cigarette advertising, it didn't suffer at all, because of the vast advertising campaigns of the estrogen industry. JAMA obviously wouldn't want to publish anything suggesting that vitamin E, or progesterone, or thyroid, might be beneficial because of its antagonism of the harmful effects of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** How did the pharmaceutical industry and medical establishment actively suppress information about Vitamin E's benefits, particularly in relation to estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen causes changes in the uterus that prevent implantation of the embryo, and that impair support for its development if it has already implanted. It decreases the availability of oxygen to the embryo, while vitamin E increases it. My dissertation adviser, A.L. Soderwall, did a series of experiments in which he showed that providing hamsters with extra vitamin E postponed the onset of infertility in middle age. In my experiments, vitamin E increased the amount of oxygen in the uterus, correcting an oxygen deficiency produced either by supplemental estrogen or by old age. Progesterone has similar effects on the delivery of oxygen to the uterus.

**CONTEXT:** What is the specific mechanism by which estrogen negatively impacts pregnancy, and how does Vitamin E counteract this?

**RAY PEAT:** In the 1940s, the official definition of vitamin E's activity was changed. Instead of its effectiveness in preventing the death and resorption of embryos, or the degeneration of the testicles or brain or muscles, it was redefined as an antioxidant, preventing the oxidation of unsaturated oils. Although some people continued to think of it as a protective factor against thrombosis, heart attacks, diabetes, and infertility, the medical establishment claimed that the prevention or cure of diseases in animals wasn't relevant to humans, and that a mere antioxidant couldn't prevent or cure any human disease.

**CONTEXT:** How was the scientific definition of Vitamin E's function deliberately altered, and what was the justification given by the medical establishment?

**RAY PEAT:** The experiments that led to the identification of vitamin E involved feeding rats a diet containing rancid lard and, as a vitamin A supplement, cod liver oil. Both of these contained large amounts of polyunsaturated oils. From 1929 to the early 1930s, other researchers were claiming to have demonstrated that the polyunsaturated fatty acids were nutritionally essential. These experiments, like the vitamin E experiments, were done on rats, but the medical establishment was satisfied that rat experiments proved that humans need linoleic or linolenic acid, while they refused to accept that vitamin E was essential for humans. When, in the 1940s, a group of vitamin B6 researchers showed that the supposed "essential fatty acid deficiency" could be cured by a supplement of vitamin B6, it became apparent that the polyunsaturated fatty acids slowed metabolism, and reduced all nutritional needs. The thyroid hormone was powerfully suppressed by the "essential" fatty acids. When we consider the two sets of experiments together, their outstanding feature is the toxicity of the polyunsaturated oils, which in one kind of experiment suppressed metabolism, and in the other kind of experiment created a variety of degenerative conditions.

**CONTEXT:** What was the historical context of early Vitamin E research, and how did it intersect with the understanding of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)?

**RAY PEAT:** By the late 1940s and early 1950s, estrogens of various sorts had been synthesized from hydrocarbons, and were being recommended to prevent miscarriages, because "estrogen is the female hormone." The meat industry had found that the polyunsaturated oils were valuable in animal feed, since they suppressed metabolism and made it cheaper to fatten the animals, and these antithyroid oils were next marketed as "heart protective" human foods, though by suppressing the thyroid and destroying vitamin E, they actually contributed to both heart disease and cancer. (Giving estrogen to livestock to improve their feed efficiency, and to people "to prevent heart attacks," was an interesting parallel to the oil promotional campaigns.) The influence of the food oil industry kept researchers away from the idea that these oils were not safe for food use, and instead tended to support the idea that vitamin E is just an antioxidant, and that the seed oils were the best way to get vitamin E in the diet.

**CONTEXT:** How did the meat and food oil industries contribute to the mischaracterization of PUFAs and Vitamin E?

**RAY PEAT:** The antifertility effects of the polyunsaturated oils, demonstrated in the vitamin E experiments, weren't at the time understood to have anything to do with estrogen's antifertility effects. But to understand vitamin E, I think we have to consider the close interactions between estrogen and the polyunsatured fatty acids (PUFA). Their actions are closely intertwined, and are antagonized by a variety of energizing and stabiliizing substances, including saturated fats, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin E, and aspirin.

**CONTEXT:** What is the critical relationship between estrogen and PUFAs, and what substances antagonize their combined negative effects?

**RAY PEAT:** Generally, chemicals that inhibit enzymes are toxic, producing some sort of symptom or deterioration. But a group of enzymes related to estrogen and PUFA are inhibited by these protective substances. Although under our present diet, these enzymes metabolize the PUFA, in the fetus and newborn they act on our endogenous fats, the series related to the Mead acids. The Mead acid is antiinflammatory, and broadly protective. The dietary PUFA interfere with these natural protective substances. The enzymes that, if we didn’t eat PUFA, would be regulating the Mead series, being activated in response to stress, would be producing antistress substances, which would limit the stress reaction. But as we become increasingly saturated with the anti-vitamin E fats, these enzymes, instead of stopping inflammation, promote it and cause tissue injury. The remaining stress limiting factors, such as progesterone, by correcting the distortions caused by stress, tend to eliminate the conditions which activated the enzymes--in a very indirect form of inhibition.

**CONTEXT:** How do PUFAs interfere with protective endogenous fatty acid pathways, and what is the role of enzymes in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Many of the events involved in inflammation are increased by estrogen, and decreased by vitamin E. Estrogen causes capillaries to become leaky; vitamin E does the opposite. Estrogen increases platelet aggregation, and decreases a factor that inhibits platelet aggregation; vitamin E does the opposite. Excess clotting is known to be caused by too much estrogen, and also by a vitamin E deficiency. Clotting leads to fibrosis, and there is clear evidence that vitamin E prevents and cures fibrotic diseases, but this still isn't generally accepted by the powerful medical institutions. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats increase fibrosis. Estrogen increases progstaglandin synthesis, vitamin E decreases their synthesis; estrogen increases the activity of the enzymes COX and LOX, vitamin E decreases their activitiy. (Jiang, et al., 2000; Ali, et al., 1980; Parkhomets, et al., 2001.) Estrogen releases enzymes from lysosomes, vitamin E inhibits their release. Beta-glucuronidase, one of these enzymes, can release estrogen at the site of an inflammation. Estrogen often increases intracellular calcium and protein kinase C, vitamin E has generally opposite effects. The polyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives, the prostaglandins, act as effectors, or amplifiers, of estrogen's actions. If vitamin E is acting as a protectant against the polyunsaturated fatty acids, that in itself would account for at least some of its antiestrogenic effects.

**CONTEXT:** Detail the specific ways estrogen and Vitamin E influence inflammatory processes, including capillary permeability, platelet aggregation, and prostaglandin synthesis.

**RAY PEAT:** Besides antagonizing some of the end effects of the toxic fatty acids, vitamin E inhibits lipolysis, lowering the concentration of free fatty acids (the opposite of estrogen’s effect), and it also binds to, and inactivates, free fatty acids. The long saturated carbon chain is very important for its full functioning, and this saturated chain might allow it to serve as a substitute for the omega -9 fats, from which the Mead acid is formed. The unsaturated tocotrienols have hardly been tested for the spectrum of true vitamin E activity, and animal studies have suggested that it may be toxic, since it caused liver enlargement.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond its antiestrogenic effects, what other metabolic actions does Vitamin E have, particularly concerning fatty acids?

**RAY PEAT:** One possibly crucial protective effect of vitamin E against the polyunsaturated fatty acids that hasn't been explored is the direct destruction of linolenic and linoleic acid. It is known that bacterial vitamin E is involved in the saturation of unsaturated fatty acids, and it is also known that intestinal bacteria turn linoleic and linolenic acids into the fully saturated stearic acid. "No metabolic function is known for alpha-tocopherolquinol or its quinone other than as a cofactor in the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids that can be carried out by only a few organisms." P.E. Hughes and S.B. Tove, 1982. "Linoleic acid was significantly decreased (P < 0.001) and there was a significant rise (P < 0.05) in its hydrogenation product, stearic acid. Linolenic acid was also significantly decreased. . . ." "The study provides evidence that bacteria from the human colon can hydrogenate C18 essential polyunsaturated fatty acids." F.A. Howard & C. Henderson, 1999.

**CONTEXT:** What is the potential role of Vitamin E in the bacterial saturation of unsaturated fatty acids, and what evidence supports this?

**RAY PEAT:** Because of the way in which the decision to call vitamin E a simple antioxidant was conditioned by the historical setting, there has been a reluctance, until recently, to give much weight to the pathogenicity of lipid peroxidation and free radicals, partly because lipid peroxidation is only a minor part of the toxicity of the polyunsaturated oils, and there was little support for the investigation of the real nature of their toxicity. This environment has even distorted the actual antioxidant value of the various forms of vitamin E. (For example, see Chen, et al., 2002.) The people who say that vitamin E is nothing but an antioxidant sometimes take other antioxidants, with, or instead of, vitamin E. BHT, BHA, and many natural compounds (derived from industrial and agricultural wastes) are often said to be "better than vitamin E" as antioxidants. Anything that can be oxidized and reduced (melatonin, estrogen, tryptophan, carotene, etc.) will function as an antioxidant in some system, but in other circumstances, it can be a pro-oxidant. The people who think there is benefit in the abstract "antioxidant" function seem to be thinking in terms of something that will, like a ubiquitous fire department, put out every little fire as soon as it starts. I think it's more appropriate to think of the biological antioxidant systems as programs for controlling the arsonists before they can set the fires.

**CONTEXT:** How has the prevailing view of Vitamin E as solely an antioxidant hindered research into its other functions, and what is a more accurate analogy for biological antioxidant systems?

**RAY PEAT:** Since the requirement for vitamin E decreases as the consumption of unsaturated fats decreases, the requirement, if any, would be very small if we didn't eat significant quantities of those fats.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between PUFA consumption and Vitamin E requirements?

**RAY PEAT:** We compared the effect of a mixed tocopherol preparation with that of alpha-tocopherol alone on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and iNOS expression in cultured myocytes exposed to H-R. Both tocopherol preparations attenuated cell injury. . . . However, mixed-tocopherol preparation was much superior to alpha-tocopherol in terms of myocyte protection. . . . Lack of efficacy of commercial tocopherol preparations in clinical trials may reflect absence of gamma- and delta-tocopherols. Chen H, Li D, Saldeen T, Romeo F, Mehta JL, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2002 "Mixed tocopherol preparation is superior to alpha-tocopherol alone against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury."

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of mixed tocopherol preparations compared to alpha-tocopherol alone, and why might commercial preparations fail in clinical trials?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping our diet as free as possible of the polyunsaturated fats, to create something like the "deficiency" state that is so protective (against cancer, trauma, poison, shock, inflammation, infection, etc.) in the animal experiments, seems preferable to trying to saturate ourselves with antioxidants, considering the imperfectly defined nature of the vitamin E products, and the known toxicity of many of the other antioxidants on the market.

**CONTEXT:** What is the preferred strategy for health optimization, and why is it superior to relying on antioxidant supplements?

**RAY PEAT:** The carcinogenic properties of the polyunsaturated fats have been known for more than 50 years, as has the principle of extending the life span by restricted feeding. More recently several studies have demonstrated that the long lived species contain fewer highly unsaturated fats than the short lived species. Restriction of calories prevents the lipids in the brain, heart, and liver from becoming more unsaturated with aging. (Lee, et al., 1999; Laganiere, et al., 1993; Tacconi, et al., 1991; R. Patzelt-Wenczler, 1981.)

**CONTEXT:** What is the link between PUFAs, aging, and lifespan, and how does caloric restriction influence lipid unsaturation?

**RAY PEAT:** When cells are grown in tissue culture without the “essential fatty acids,” they become “deficient,” and in that state are very resistant to chemical injury, and can be grown indefinitely. Besides being a simple demonstration of the way in which the polyunsaturated fats sensitize cells to injury (Wey, et al., 1993), these experiments must be an embarrassment to the people who base their argument for the oils’ essentiality on a supposed requirement for “making cell membranes.” Since the cells can multiply nicely in their deficient state, we have to conclude that the oils aren’t needed for “membranes,” or maybe that cells resist injury better “without membranes.”

**CONTEXT:** What do cell culture experiments with "essential fatty acid" deficient cells reveal about the role of PUFAs in cell membranes and injury resistance?

**RAY PEAT:** In the opposite direction, an excess of insulin or prolactin, or a deficiency of vitamin E, increases the activity of the enzymes that convert linoleic acid into the more highly unsaturated fatty acids. Excess insulin and prolactin are crucially involved in many degenerative diseases.

**CONTEXT:** What hormonal imbalances exacerbate the negative effects of linoleic acid, and what diseases are associated with them?

**RAY PEAT:** The highly unsaturated fats suppress respiration in many ways, and these trends toward increased unsaturation with aging, endocrine stress, and vitamin E deficiency parallel the life-long trend toward lower energy production from respiration. Many studies show that vitamin E can protect and improve mitochondrial energy production. (Kikuchi, et al., 1991; Donchenko, et al., 1990, 1983; Guarnieri, et al., 1981, 1982.) But the state of so-called essential fatty acid deficiency not only makes mitochondria very resistant to injury, it greatly intensifies their energy production. Vitamin E supplementation is seldom as effective as the absence of the toxic oils.

**CONTEXT:** How do PUFAs negatively impact cellular respiration and energy production, and how does Vitamin E compare to the absence of PUFAs in improving mitochondrial function?

**RAY PEAT:** Many nutrition charts no longer list liver as a good source of vitamin E, but a large portion of an animal’s vitamin E is in its liver. This bias in the dietetic literature can be traced to various sources, but a major influence was the campaign in the 1970s by the drug companies that had patented new forms of synthetic “vitamin A.” They had physicians and professors fabricate stories about the great toxicity of natural vitamin A, and placed the stories in national magazines, to clear the field for their supposedly non-toxic products, which have turned out to be disastrously toxic. The result is that many people have fearfully stopped eating liver, because of its vitamin A. The other vitamins in liver, including vitamin K, function very closely with vitamin E, and the stably stored forms of vitamin E are likely to be a good approximation for our needs.

**CONTEXT:** Why has liver been de-emphasized as a source of Vitamin E in nutrition literature, and what is the role of other nutrients in liver that are synergistic with Vitamin E?

**RAY PEAT:** There is still a strong division between what people can say in their professional publications, and what they believe. A man who was influential in designating vitamin E as an antioxidant, M.K. Horwitt, complained when the government raised its recommended vitamin E intake by 50%, because it wasn’t supported by new data, and because millions of people get only ten milligrams per day and “are healthy.” But he has been taking 200 mg daily (plus aspirin) for many years. He apparently doesn't have very much confidence in the ideas he advocates publicly.

**CONTEXT:** What is the discrepancy between public pronouncements and private practices regarding Vitamin E recommendations, as exemplified by M.K. Horwitt?

**RAY PEAT:** Alpha-tocopherol, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, was evaluated for its effects on the synthesis of thromboxane and prostaglandins. A dose-dependent reduction in thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin D2 synthesis was observed with approximately 60% inhibition at 5.0 IU or alpha-tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol produced a time-dependent, irreversible inhibition. Ali M, Gudbranson CG, McDonald JW.

**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of alpha-tocopherol on thromboxane and prostaglandin synthesis, and what is the nature of this inhibition?

**RAY PEAT:** Recent new findings have shed new light on the physiological role of vitamin E and suggest that it has a much broader array of biological activities than originally expected. In addition to its well described role as an antioxidant, it is becoming evident that vitamin E also can modulate the immune system, suppress local and chronic inflammation, reduce blood coagulation and thrombus formation, and enhance cell function and survival. Bron D, Asmis R.

**CONTEXT:** Beyond its antioxidant role, what other physiological activities of Vitamin E are being recognized?

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin E appears to be a safe, simple, and inexpensive means of reducing the number of postoperative capsular contractures following breast augmentation. The synthetic form of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is recommended to avoid nausea or skin eruptions in patients with oily skin, which are frequently encountered when the natural form is taken. No harmful side effects have been noted in any of the patients to date. Vitamin E has no effect on coagulation systems and does not cause excessive bleeding either during or after surgery. The recommended dosage of synthetic vitamin E is 1000 IU, b.i.d., for 2 years beginning 1 week before surgery. If no contracture exists at that time, the dosage may be reduced to 1000 IU daily thereafter. Baker JL Jr.

**CONTEXT:** What is the recommended dosage and protocol for using synthetic alpha-tocopherol to reduce capsular contractures after breast augmentation, and what are its safety considerations?

**RAY PEAT:** Results showed that the skin concentrations of Eol, as well as levels in the adipose tissue, were increased after topical application. Mice treated with each form of vitamin E showed no signs of toxicity and had significantly less acute and chronic skin damage induced by UV irradiation, as indicated by reduced inflammation and pigmentation and by later onset and lesser incidence of skin cancer. Burke KE, Clive J, Combs GF Jr, Commisso J, Keen CL, Nakamura RM.

**CONTEXT:** What were the findings regarding the topical and oral administration of Vitamin E in mice exposed to UV irradiation, specifically concerning skin damage and cancer incidence?

**RAY PEAT:** Complex treatment using tocopherol acetate produced a positive effect on the coagulation properties of the blood and did essentially influence the fibrinolytic activity and microcirculation. Tocopherol plus nicotinic acid resulted in normalization of the blood coagulation process, favoured activation of fibrinolysis and improvement of the microcirculatory bed. Chernomorets NN, Kotlubei GV, Vatutin NT, Zhivotovskaia IA, Gnilitskaia VB, Alifanova RE, Lobach EIa, Mal'tseva NV, Mitrofanov AN.

**CONTEXT:** What were the observed effects of tocopherol acetate, alone and in combination with nicotinic acid, on blood coagulation and microcirculation in patients with ischemic heart disease?

**RAY PEAT:** Oral contraceptive (OC) use is a risk for thrombogenic events. From these data we conclude that: 1. OC use modifies slightly but significantly the oxidative status in women and in animals by decreasing in plasma and blood cells the antioxidant defenses (vitamins and enzymes). 2. The changes in the oxidative status are related to an increase in plasma lipid peroxides apparently responsible for the hyperaggregability and possibly the imbalance in clotting factors associated with the OC-induced prethrombotic state. 3. These effects of OC appear to be increased by a high intake of polyunsaturated fat and counteracted by supplements of vitamin E. 4. The risk factors acting synergistically with OC, have all been shown to increase platelet reactivity. Ciavatti M, Renaud S.

**CONTEXT:** How does oral contraceptive use affect oxidative status, and how are these effects influenced by PUFA intake and Vitamin E supplementation?

**RAY PEAT:** These infants with over 3% fragmented cells were found to have a significant association with: sepsis, jaundice, crenated RBC's, low levels of hemoglobin, increased reticulocyte count, and low vitamin E levels. Covarrubias Espinoza G, Lepe Zuniga JL.

**CONTEXT:** What clinical associations were found in newborns with fragmented red blood cells, and what was the correlation with Vitamin E levels?

**RAY PEAT:** Estradiol valerate (EV) treatment has been shown to result in the destruction of 60% of beta-endorphin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Evidence suggests that the mechanism of EV-induced neurotoxicity involves the conversion of estradiol to catechol estrogen and subsequent oxidation to free radicals in local peroxidase-positive astrocytes. In this study, we examined whether treatment with the antioxidant, vitamin E, protects beta-endorphin neurons from the neurotoxic action of estradiol. Our results demonstrate that chronic vitamin E treatment prevents the decrement in hypothalamic beta-endorphin concentrations resulting from arcuate beta-endorphin cell loss, suggesting that the latter is mediated by free radicals. Vitamin E treatment also prevented the onset of persistent vaginal cornification and polycystic ovarian condition which have been shown to result from the EV-induced hypothalamic pathology. Desjardins GC, Beaudet A, Schipper HM, Brawer JR.

**CONTEXT:** How does estradiol treatment lead to neurotoxicity, and how does Vitamin E protect against this neurotoxicity and its associated reproductive pathologies?

**RAY PEAT:** Other proaging effects of insulin involve the inhibition of proteasome and the stimulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis and of nitric oxide (NO). The hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia accelerates aging also offers a metabolic explanation for the life-prolonging effect of calorie restriction and of mutations decreasing the overall activity of insulin-like receptors in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Facchini FS, Hua NW, Reaven GM, Stoohs RA.

**CONTEXT:** What are the proposed pro-aging effects of insulin, and how does this relate to PUFA synthesis and calorie restriction?

**RAY PEAT:** Both alpha-tocopherol and a 1:1.7 mixture of alpha-tocopherol and tocotrienols at a 0.2% dietary level significantly depressed the age-related increase in the systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) after 3 weeks of feeding. The aortic production of prostacyclin was increased 1.5 times both by alpha-tocopherol and a tocotrienol mixture, suggesting a possible relevance to their hypotensive effect. These vitamins did not influence the delta 6- and delta 5-desaturase activities of liver microsomes, but fatty acid profiles of the liver phospholipids predicted a reduction of linoleic acid desaturation. These effects were in general more clear with tocotrienols than with alpha-tocopherol. Platelet aggregation by 5 microM ADP remained uninfluenced. Thus, tocotrienols may have effects on various lipid parameters somewhat different from those of alpha-tocopherol. Koba K, Abe K, Ikeda I, Sugano M.

**CONTEXT:** What were the comparative effects of alpha-tocopherol and tocotrienols on blood pressure and linoleic acid metabolism in spontaneously hypertensive rats?

**RAY PEAT:** Phospholipids from liver mitochondrial and microsomal membrane preparations were analyzed to further assess the effects of age and lifelong calorie restriction on membrane lipid composition. The data revealed characteristic patterns of age-related changes in ad libitum (AL) fed rats: membrane levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, 22:4 and 22:5, increased progressively, while membrane linoleic acid (18:2) decreased steadily with age. Levels of 18:2 fell by approximately 40%, and 22:5 content almost doubled making the peroxidizability index increase with age. We concluded that the membrane-stabilizing action of long-term calorie restriction relates to the selective modification of membrane long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids during aging. Laganiere S, Yu BP.

**CONTEXT:** How does aging affect the fatty acid composition of mitochondrial and microsomal membranes, and how does lifelong calorie restriction counteract these changes?

**RAY PEAT:** The fatty acid composition of the mitochondrial membranes of the two ad lib fed groups differed: the long-chain polyunsaturated 22:4 fatty acid was higher in the older group, although linoleic acid (18:2) was lower. DR eliminated the differences. Considered together, these results suggest that DR maintains the integrity of the cardiac mitochondrial membrane fluidity by minimizing membrane damage through modulation of membrane fatty acid profile. Lee J, Yu BP, Herlihy JT.

**CONTEXT:** How does dietary restriction (DR) influence the fatty acid composition of cardiac mitochondrial membranes in relation to aging?

**RAY PEAT:** Rat liver microsomes incubated with linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAHPO) lost cytochrome P-450 specifically among the enzymes of microsomal electron transport systems. The loss of cytochrome P-450 content and glucose-6-phosphatase activity by LAHPO was accompanied by an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) production. These results suggest the possibility that the loss of microsomal enzyme activities during lipid peroxidation may be attributed largely to a direct attack on enzyme proteins by lipid peroxides rather than indirectly to a structural damage of microsomal membranes resulting from peroxidative breakdown of membrane lipids. Masuda Y, Murano T.

**CONTEXT:** What is the effect of linoleic acid hydroperoxide on liver microsomal enzymes, and what is the proposed mechanism for this damage?

**RAY PEAT:** Alpha-Tocopherol, tocopherylquinon jointly with the proteins tocopherol acceptors from cytosole were identified to inhibit the activity of 5-lipoxigenase and so the synthesis of leukotriene A4 at the early stages providing for A4 hydrolase activation and C4 synthesase, as well as accelerate leukotrienes B4 and C4 synthesis at the further stages respectively changing the final spectrum of leukotriens in the organism tissues. Firstly, the leading role of proteins complexes capable to strengthen the effect of alpha-tocopherol and tocopherylquinon on arachidonic acid oxidative metabolism was determined. Parkhomets' VP, Silonov SB, Donchenko HV.

**CONTEXT:** How do alpha-tocopherol and tocopherylquinon, in conjunction with tocopherol-binding proteins, influence the metabolism of arachidonic acid and the synthesis of leukotrienes?

**RAY PEAT:** The formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids is influenced by vitamin E. The enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum isolated from rat liver responsible for chain elongation and desaturation showed higher activity under vitamin E-deficiency. The activity was raised both per mg protein and per mg DNA. The application of alpha-Tocopherol to the vitamin E-deficient animals caused the normalization of the enzyme activity within 48 hours. This indicates a regulatory function of alpha-Tocopherol in the process of oxidation. Patzelt-Wenczler R.

**CONTEXT:** How does Vitamin E influence the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and what is its regulatory role in this process?

**RAY PEAT:** Our in vitro experiments with skin fibroblasts suggest that alpha-tocopherol may protect against skin aging by decreasing the level of collagenase expression, which is induced by environmental insults and by aging. Ricciarelli R, Maroni P, Ozer N, Zingg JM, Azzi A.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed mechanism by which alpha-tocopherol may protect against skin aging?

**RAY PEAT:** The erythrocyte filterability was unaltered in the vitamin E group in comparison with baseline but was significantly impaired in the control group. Simon-Schnass I, Korniszewski L.

**CONTEXT:** What was the effect of Vitamin E supplementation on erythrocyte filterability in high altitude mountaineers compared to a control group?

**RAY PEAT:** In experimental animals dietary restriction reduces the body weight increase due to aging, increases longevity and delays the onset of age-related physiological deterioration, including age-related changes in serum lipids. Little is known about the influence of food restriction on brain lipids, whose concentration and composition have been shown to change with age. We studied whether some biochemical and biophysical parameters of rat brain membranes, known to be modified with age, were affected by a diet low in calories, in which 50% of lipids and 35% of carbohydrates have been replaced by fibers. The diet was started at weaning and maintained throughout the animal's entire life span. Animals fed the low calorie diet survived longer and gained less body weight than standard diet fed rats. Age-related increases in microviscosity, cholesterol/phospholipid and sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine ratios were reduced or restored to the levels of young animals in cortex membranes of 32 old rats fed the low calorie diet, while the age-related increase in mono- to polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios in phospholipids was further raised. In conclusion we have shown that a diet low in calories and high in fibers affects lipid composition in the rat brain, in a direction opposite to that normally believed to reduce age-related deterioration of brain functions. Tacconi MT, Lligona L, Salmona M, Pitsikas N, Algeri S.

**CONTEXT:** How does a low-calorie, high-fiber diet affect brain membrane lipid composition in aging rats, and how do these changes relate to age-related deterioration?

**RAY PEAT:** Human keratinocytes are commonly grown in culture with a serum-free medium. Under these conditions, keratinocytes become essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD), as determined by gas chromatographic analysis of cell phospholipid fatty acid composition. Exposure of EFAD keratinocytes for 2 hr to concentrations of t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) up to 2 mM did not result in toxicity assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and only a small indication of lipid peroxidation assessed by the release of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Addition of 10 microM linoleic acid (LA) to serum-free medium alleviated the EFAD condition by increasing the phospholipid content of LA and its elongation and desaturation products, arachidonic acid and docosatetraenoic acid. Exposure of LA-supplemented keratinocytes to tBHP resulted in significant LDH (at 1 and 2 mM tBHP) and TBARS (tBHP concentration dependent) release. TBARS release was also significantly elevated in unexposed LA-supplemented keratinocytes (basal release). Co-supplementation with the antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol succinate (TS) prevented tBHP (1 mM)-induced LDH release in LA-supplemented cultures. TS supplementation also attenuated the effect of tBHP on TBARS release, but when compared to TS-supplemented EFAD cultures, LA supplementation still led to increased tBHP-induced TBARS release. Keratinocyte cultures are potentially useful as an alternative to animals in toxicology research and testing. It is important, however, that the cell model provide a response to toxic insult similar to that experienced in vivo. Our results suggest that fatty acid and antioxidant nutrition of cultured keratinocytes are important parameters in mediating the toxic effects of lipid peroxidation. Wey HE, Pyron L.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of essential fatty acid deficiency and alpha-tocopherol succinate in mediating the toxicity of lipid peroxidation in cultured human keratinocytes?

**RAY PEAT:** The response-to-injury hypothesis explains atherosclerosis as a chronic inflammatory response to injury of the endothelium, which leads to complex cellular and molecular interactions among cells derived from the endothelium, smooth muscle and several blood cell components. Inflammatory and other stimuli trigger an overproduction of free radicals, which promote peroxidation of lipids in LDL trapped in the subendothelial space. Products of LDL oxidation are bioactive, and they induce endothelial expression and secretion of cytokines, growth factors and several cell surface adhesion molecules. The last-mentioned are capable of recruiting circulating monocytes and T lymphocytes into the intima where monocytes are differentiated into macrophages, the precursor of foam cells. In response to the growth factors and cytokines, smooth muscle cells proliferate in the intima, resulting in the narrowing of the lumen. Oxidized LDL can also inhibit endothelial production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide, two potent autacoids that are vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. Evidence is presented that vitamin E is protective against the development of atherosclerosis. Vitamin E enrichment has been shown to retard LDL oxidation, inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation, inhibit the expression and function of adhesion molecules, attenuate the synthesis of leukotrienes and potentiate the release of prostacyclin through up-regulating the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase. Collectively, these biological functions of vitamin E may account for its protection against the development of atherosclerosis. AC Chan, J. of Nutrition, 1998.

**CONTEXT:** According to the response-to-injury hypothesis, how does atherosclerosis develop, and what specific mechanisms does Vitamin E employ to protect against it?

**RAY PEAT:** Following the advice given by the Department of Health to women who are, or may become pregnant, not to eat liver and liver products because of the risk of vitamin A toxicity, the concentrations of vitamins A and E, and copper, magnesium and zinc in cord blood were investigated. The study was conducted in Hackney, an inner city area of London. Esters of vitamin A were not detected in any of the samples, indicating that there was no biochemical evidence of a risk of toxicity. Indeed, vitamin A correlated significantly with birthweight, head circumference, length, and gestation period. There was also a significant positive relationship between zinc and birthweight. In contrast, copper showed a negative correlation with birthweight and head circumference. Vitamin E and magnesium were not associated with any of the anthropometric measurements, although magnesium showed an increasing trend with birthweight. The data suggest that most of the mothers of the subjects studied may have been marginal with respect to vitamins A and E and zinc. In those with low birthweight babies. a higher intake would have improved their nutritional status and possibly the outcome of their pregnancy. For these low-income mothers, liver and liver products are the cheapest and the best source of vitamins A and E, haem iron, B vitamins and several other essential nutrients; hence the advice of the Department of Health may have been misplaced.

**CONTEXT:** What were the findings regarding vitamin A and E levels in cord blood, and how did these relate to birth outcomes, particularly in light of public health advice against consuming liver?
