This parallels the "toxic" effect of night and winter on animals; the darkness damages mitochondria, and red light seems to be the most effective frequency in restoring their function. The observation that cortisone begins to rise in humans when lights are turned out, rather than when people begin to sleep, fits with rabbit mitochondria studies and autumn leaves. Either cortisone causes the damage, or, more probably, mitochondrial inefficiency wastes glucose, and increased adrenalin, cortisone, and dreaming are responses to hypoglycemia.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the relationship between light, mitochondria, and stress hormones?

**RAY PEAT:** I am working on the idea that potato plants, which do not normally produce seeds, can be induced to do so by blue (and other high-frequency) light, at least when grown in acidic soil which provides iron or other heavy metals that tend to generate free radicals. This is a generalization of the idea that injuring a coneless pine tree with an ax can cause it to produce a heavy crop of seed. Grass produces seed early when the weather is dry. The many toxic effects of estrogen have led me to interpret its effects, such as rapid cell division in the uterus, as another example of this process. In the 1940s, famine was often discussed as causing extremely early fertility in girls; starvation and other stress do cause an elevation of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** You've mentioned the role of stress in inducing fertility. How does this relate to cellular energy and reproduction?

**RAY PEAT:** Since Albert Szent-Györgyi died, I've been thinking about his idea that the "Hopkins electron pool," stored in cellular proteins, provides the energy for cell division. Around 1972, it was reported that sunlight shining on dark hair induces free radicals, and these free radicals persist for hours in darkness. Exposure to red light, however, "quenches" the free radicals within seconds. My idea of the "toxicity" of darkness is that free radicals, produced by metabolism or perhaps cosmic rays, accumulate with time, but the red component of light normally quenches them. In darkness, the excess of excited electrons would begin to spread beyond their safe storage system, causing toxic effects like oxygen wastage. Many toxins and stressors act through a common pathway of free-radical damage, accounting for the generalized protective effects of substances like vitamin E.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the concept of the "Hopkins electron pool" and its connection to free radicals and light?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the most sensitive tests for estrogen's effect is the reduction of a dye (TTC) by tissue and whole cells, theoretically by various "dehydrogenases." The Hopkins electron pool was called by E. Racker "nothing dehydrogenase." Progesterone blocks estrogen's effects on this dye. Since a similar dye has been used to measure the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), it seems that the superoxide radical can reduce the dye. Whatever the source of the electrons, estrogen and progesterone act in different directions on their availability.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen and progesterone interact with cellular electron transfer systems?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is known to inhibit cell division in various situations: in the uterine endometrium, in cancer, and in frogs' eggs. Several years ago, it was found that progesterone in frogs' eggs was bound to melanin, whose function in the eggs was never understood. Szent-Györgyi emphasized that pigments often exist invisibly inside organisms and probably have electronic-metabolic functions, rather than decorative ones. Melanin generally exists as a complex with proteins. If the energy for cell division is stored in proteins, and if progesterone inhibits cell division and is bound to melanin, which stores electronic excitation, then perhaps progesterone acts to prevent the escape of energy from the protein-melanin system. If it does this generally, that could explain its very general "catatoxic" effects.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed mechanism by which progesterone might inhibit cell division, and how does melanin fit into this?

**RAY PEAT:** It was around 1954 that I first found some potato fruits and hoped to get viable seeds to grow new strains. Around that time, John Ort found that squash plants he was photographing with pink artificial light produced only male flowers. The next season, he used bluish artificial lights, and his plants produced only female flowers. Later, he found that night-blooming plants, like the Morning Glory, could keep blooming if exposed to blue light, but their blooms collapsed when exposed to pinkish light.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the experiments with artificial light and plant reproduction?

**RAY PEAT:** All of this seems to be converging on the idea that female reproductive tissues are activated by a free-radical or excited electron promitotic system. Beyond that, it has clear implications for aging, stress, toxicity, energy, tissue repair, and regeneration. The key idea is that biological structure and biological energy are delicately linked and balanced, even at the finest molecular and submolecular levels.

**CONTEXT:** What are the broader implications of this research for understanding biological processes?
