**RAY PEAT:** "In this book I offer some practical methods for solving health problems by increasing biological energy. The methods can be applied by people to themselves, or by physicians to their patients. But energy and individuality and thought are so closely associated that full access to the value of these techniques might require the integrated and balanced approach that can be provided by a new theoretical orientation. I offer some suggestions on the way our inner world can mesh with the outer world, in an energy-based orientation. And the theory might not be of general interest unless its meaning can be concretized in some specific situations. Other people are working on the same kinds of theories, and other people have worked out parts of the various techniques, but my effort here is to offer something like a 'technology of life,' which unites theory and practice."
**CONTEXT:** Introduction to the book's purpose.

**RAY PEAT:** "I intend to show that the human substance isn't simply a metastable, transient event, but that it is rather a pioneering probe into a new system. Self-organizing systems decay only if they have assimilated inertia, and--with a little support of the right kind--the centers of degeneration can become centers of regeneration."
**CONTEXT:** Introduction to the book's core philosophy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Biogenic stimulators, adaptogens, spontaneous healing, cancer, aging, and reproduction are considered here in the light of the best available knowledge of developmental systems in biology and non-equilibrium processes. Besides having the practical value of bringing coherence into our understanding of some things that have been merely 'therapeutic approaches,' I hope it will also help to shift the theoretical focus in the study of self-ordering processes away from the informational-statistical, and toward the energetic; to interpret structure, phase and state in terms of energy and history, before considering their abstract, informational properties."
**CONTEXT:** Introduction to the book's theoretical framework.

**RAY PEAT:** "Holism is the observation that, although natural objects can be resolved into their parts, the parts are to some extent shaped by their participation in the whole object. For example, in organic chemistry it is recognized that the reactivity of an atom or radical is modified by adjoining parts of the molecule, by the solvent, etc. Holism would never have been named, except that it is so common in our scientific tradition for someone to say 'We know all there is to know about the parts (atoms, surfaces, fields, genes, etc.), so we can foresee the result of their combination.' Good engineering involves knowing the properties of the materials so thoroughly that accurate predictions can be made about their behavior in new structures, but good science requires a willingness to accept the unpredicted when it occurs. Holism, or a non-dogmatic attitude toward the world, recognizes individual uniqueness, rather than averages, and is likely to look for complex causes (especially environmental influences), rather than too easily ascribing traits 'to the genes.'"
**CONTEXT:** Defining holism in a scientific context.

**RAY PEAT:** "Consciousness, perception, sensation, pleasure, and intention have often been omitted from the world described by reductionists. If we are going to understand life and its possibilities, then it seems that we should begin with an appreciation of its 'liveliest' aspects, as an essential dimension of our thinking, even if we are going to work with some of its relatively inert aspects, such as viral genetics."
**CONTEXT:** The importance of subjective experience in scientific understanding.

**RAY PEAT:** "The relation of energy to structure is, I think, the central question of biology. (The importance of the same question for the physical sciences might indicate in a rough way how Haldane's predicted 'swallowing up' might occur.) The ideas of resonance and hysteresis, which are only vaguely defined in physics, have to do with the interaction of energy and structure on various levels of complexity and organization, and are examples of physical concepts that can gain meaning and clarity from biology.(1) When energy flows through matter, order accumulates (as a result of resonance and hysteresis, for example), but we hear so much about 'entropy,' 'randomness,' and 'symmetry' that we forget most of the formative processes in the material world."
**CONTEXT:** The fundamental role of energy in biological structure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Human (and ecological) health obviously should have the benefits of holistic science, but the actual situation is that biology and medicine have become very product-oriented, and holistic considerations are increasingly left to a variety of 'fringe' occupations. Many of these alternative approaches are concerned with the idea of 'energy' as the key to health, but in general they lack simple and effective methods for optimizing biological energy, and often use counter-productive methods, such as prescribing linseed oil nutritional supplements. In the following pages I will show how some of the most important achievements of ordinary science can be retrieved from the distortions of the medical promoters, and made available for holistic use, that is, for appropriate use."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of modern medicine's product-orientation and the need for holistic energy optimization.

**RAY PEAT:** "The word, 'gene,' itself contains an ideology, since it implies origin, or genesis, though its main meaning is something like 'a unit of continuity.' Building on the word's connotation, dogmatic geneticists explicitly stated their 'central dogma': that information flows only from DNA to RNA, and only from RNA to protein. When Temin and Baltimore described the 'reverse transcription' of DNA from RNA, all of the professional biologists I talked to said flatly that they didn't believe it was possible. Even when no one was threatening the addition of 'information' to the chromosomes, the dominant belief among biologists was that development was closely controlled 'by the genes,' because the body owes its genesis to the genes. Intelligence, body proportions, and senescence were said to be 'specified' or 'governed' or 'programmed' by the genes. The 'congenital' condition was often taken as the 'genetic' condition. Textbooks said that the maternal influence was only 'genetic,' because the fetus was 'insulated' from events in the mother's body (just as the 'germ line' was isolated from events in the rest of the body). Although many kinds of experiment showed both prenatal and transgenerational (see Figure 1) influences of the environment on intelligence, body proportions, and rate of aging, the genetics-reductionist school ignored them, and defined themselves as the only scientific school of biology."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of genetic determinism and the "central dogma" of molecular biology.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I was a student of literature, I was interested in the apparent energy differences between different writers and different social groups. The literature of dissent (I wrote my master's thesis on William Blake) always reveals an abundance, or excess, of energy. I came to see literary 'periods' or styles (classical, realist, Romantic, surrealist, etc.) as reflections of a society's energy and structure. As I followed this line of thinking about the function of language in society, and in the life of the individual, I saw that Blake's descriptions of his own use of images and symbols made sense in relation to brain physiology. Even attitudes toward mathematical concepts, theories of ideal languages, and 'language philosophy' related strongly to the person's attitude toward authority, energy, the body, and the nature of consciousness.(2)"
**CONTEXT:** The connection between literature, energy, and brain physiology.

**RAY PEAT:** "After I had spent a few years studying and teaching linguistics, I decided to study brain physiology. At that time, a group at the University of California had already found that freedom and stimulation caused a cumulative, transgenerational increase in the size of rats' brains. Continuing that work, Marion Diamond has found that pregnancy, or progesterone treatment increases brain size and inhibits the development of age pigment (suggesting that longevity might also be increased). In 1968, another group found that prenatal hormone treatment (causing increased production of progesterone) greatly increased the intelligence of rats. Several researchers have shown that brain size relates strongly to both energy production and longevity. A graph (Figure 2) suggests how adaptive (mental) energy and longevity might relate."
**CONTEXT:** The influence of hormones and stimulation on brain development and longevity.

**RAY PEAT:** "At a certain stage of gestation, there are more than twice as many brain cells as there are at the time of birth, and it is likely that good conditions for the mother and fetus--adequate blood volume, oxygenation, glucose, progesterone (3), thyroid hormone, and absence of toxins and nutritional imbalances--can preserve some of the cells that would normally die. Since the brain and the liver regulate the amount of glucose and hormones in the body, the conditions under which those organs develop will very likely influence their later functioning, and account for some of the transgenerational effects that have been observed."
**CONTEXT:** Factors influencing fetal brain development and transgenerational effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "As I became aware of the influences of hormones and the availability of energy on the development of the brain, and the effects of the brain on aging (and became aware of the amount of dogma in the neuro-sciences), I began to work on the ways in which energy metabolism affects reproductive failure, especially in senescent decline of fertility. I hoped that working in a less dogmatic area of physiology would still allow me to get a better understanding of the organism in general, including the brain."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between energy metabolism, hormones, and reproductive aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "Professor Soderwall and his students at the University of Oregon had shown that the corpora lutea (areas in the ovary which mainly produce progesterone) appeared to fail in aging hamsters, and that vitamin E supplements could extend fertility by a significant amount. His group showed that 'aged ova' were not responsible for infertility, but rather that the uterine environment was not suitable for implantation. Soderwall had also demonstrated that excess estrogen could cause failure of the pregnancy at any point, from failure of the embryo to implant, to resorption of the fetus at a late stage of pregnancy."
**CONTEXT:** Research on aging hamsters, fertility, vitamin E, and estrogen's role.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although I had investigated the association of estrogen with cancer, and knew from my own experience with migraines that stress, diet and hormones interacted in powerful ways, when I began to investigate the oxidative metabolism of the uterus I didn't realize that it would involve a convergence of several of my main interests. I was familiar with Otto Warburg's famous idea that cancer is caused by a 'respiratory defect,' and I knew that aged tissue has a diminished respiratory capacity."
**CONTEXT:** The convergence of interests in estrogen, cancer, and oxidative metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The text-books indicated that estrogen deficiency and 'aged ova' were responsible for senescent infertility. (The origin of these ideas in a dogmatic matrix is another story which I have told elsewhere.) I found that the uterine endometrium of old animals often consumed oxygen at a high rate, and showed other signs of being under the influence of excessive estrogen. As I tried to understand this, I saw that several things could contribute to a high rate of oxygen consumption. Either too much estrogen, or too little progesterone could have the same effect, since it is the ratio between these hormones which controls their effects. A vitamin E deficiency increases oxygen consumption, and too much unsaturated fat has the same effect. In a vitamin E deficiency, unsaturated oils are oxidized in a way that produces 'age pigment,' also called ceroid pigment or lipofuscin. This pigment consumes both oxygen and fuel, but produces no usable energy. Estrogen excess synergizes with a deficiency of vitamin E to intensify the formation of this pigment. Partly, this might be because estrogen is a powerful stimulant of iron absorption, and iron is involved in the peroxidation that produces the pigment. But low oxygen concentration is what causes the iron to become active in peroxidation, and estrogen acts in several ways to decrease the availability of oxygen. It appeared, therefore, that many of the features of aging resembled an estrogen excess, rather than estrogen deficiency."
**CONTEXT:** The role of estrogen, progesterone, vitamin E, unsaturated fats, and iron in aging and oxygen metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The way in which estrogen prevents or terminates pregnancy seems to be by causing the uterus to consume oxygen at such a high rate that there is no oxygen available for the embryo, which has a high requirement for oxygen beginning on the day that it normally implants. The chronic or cumulative effects of estrogen, leading to formation of lipofuscin, happen to act in the same direction as estrogen itself, causing oxygen to be reduced, especially in the uterus, but in all other tissues, too (aging the whole organism). Estrogen excess can also destroy the corpora lutea, interfering with the production of progesterone. Progesterone's effect in pregnancy is to assure the availability of oxygen and nutrients for the embryo, but it also has the general effect of inhibiting the formation of lipofuscin, and of other aging signs, by improving efficiency. (Progesterone is unusual among the anti-stress steroids in having no harmful side-effects.)"
**CONTEXT:** Estrogen's mechanism in pregnancy termination and aging, and progesterone's protective role.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although my work confirmed the other research that had been done in Soderwall's lab in the preceding 25 years, the idea that estrogen's influence appears to increase with aging, and even to contribute to the process of aging, was contrary to the doctrine that has been promoted by the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, as I read more, I saw that there was really no evidence contrary to what I had seen in my own work. What existed was a web of interpretation which existed to sell estrogen treatments. Even the fact that estrogen causes abortion was 'ignored,' very consciously, until the industry had fabricated a more acceptable rationale with which to sell its 'contraceptive' pills."
**CONTEXT:** The pharmaceutical industry's influence on the interpretation of estrogen's role in aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of many factors acting in the same direction, and tending to have a cumulative effect, seemed to me to have a general biological significance. It seemed to be part of the answer to the question of what it is which is lost, or accumulated, during aging, which accounts for the decreased ability to adapt to the changing environment. It seemed to say something about the nature of Warburg's 'respiratory defect' in cancer. The thyroid hormone, which governs respiration, is suppressed by estrogen, and by unsaturated fats. The wasteful metabolism of estrogen dominance tends to use up glucose, and is likely to activate the stress hormones, including cortisol. The main features of aging can be produced directly by administering excessive amounts of cortisol. These features include atrophy of skin, arteries, muscle, bone, immune system, and parts of the brain, loss of pigment (melanin), deposition of fat in certain areas, and slowed conduction velocity of nerves. The physiology of aging (especially reproductive aging) overlaps the physiology of stress."
**CONTEXT:** The cumulative effects of factors like estrogen, unsaturated fats, and cortisol on aging and stress physiology.

**RAY PEAT:** "When there are sewers and clean water, the death rate of infants and children from infectious diseases isn't high, so the average age of the population increases as a larger percentage of those born live into old age. Increased use of birth control will also increase the average age of the population if fewer children are born each year. These changes in the birth rate and infant survival can happen at the same time that industrial pollution is causing chronic poisoning which shortens the lives of mature people."
**CONTEXT:** Factors influencing average lifespan and the impact of industrial pollution.

**RAY PEAT:** "To understand the effects of aging on the risk of human disease and death, we need information specifically about people who have reached a certain age. There are several organizations and individuals in the U.S. that have cleverly used 're-standardized' statistics to convince the public that cancer is being defeated, industrial pollution is harmless, sickness is caused by the victim's own irresponsible choices, and that our longevity has increased by several years in the last few decades. Old people are the most likely to die of cancer, and the cancer death rate for old people in the U.S. has been increasing in recent decades, as has the cancer death rate for the population in general. The life expectancy for older people in the U.S. has barely increased a year in recent decades. 2,000 years ago, the life-expectancy for older people seems to have been several years longer than it is now (Figure 3)."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of longevity statistics and the reality of aging in the US.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many studies have demonstrated that puberty seems to trigger the mechanism of aging, and the idea of a 'death hormone,' located in the pituitary gland, has been suggested. (Figures 4 and 5.) Many degenerative diseases develop under the influence of excessive estrogen and cortisone (and as a result of the many metabolic changes which follow exposure to those hormones). Many of these diseases, especially those which appear after puberty and are more frequent in women, can be treated very effectively with the anti-estrogen and anti-stress hormones, such as progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** The link between puberty, aging, estrogen, cortisone, and the therapeutic potential of progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hans Selye pointed out that estrogen treatment mimics the first, 'shock' phase of the stress reaction. An excess of estrogen (or any stressor) causes the pituitary to secrete prolactin and ACTH, and both of these hormones act on the ovaries to stop progesterone production, and contribute in many other ways to the process of atrophy. ACTH, of course, stimulates the secretion of cortisol. The removal of the pituitary obviously isn't a practical way to delay senescence, but protection against the 'death hormones' can be achieved to some extent by altering the diet to minimize the effects of estrogen and cortisol."
**CONTEXT:** Estrogen's role in the stress response and its impact on progesterone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "If we can generalize from animal studies, delaying puberty could increase brain size and longevity, improve intelligence, decrease violence, and even make people physically more attractive (the 'cute puppy' appearance is largely a matter of brain size in relation to the size of the face and body). I think this will be the next step in human evolution. Just as nurturing, stimulation, and freedom promote improvement in the function and structure of the brain, cruelty and oppression act in the opposite direction. If puberty is delayed, then the importance of a culture which supports curiosity, exploration, play and sensuous pleasure seems obvious, so that biology and culture will be mutually supportive."
**CONTEXT:** The potential benefits of delaying puberty for human development and evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** "The physiological age of the parts of an organism depends in some way on the developmental stage of the whole organism. This contradicts the reductionists' idea that cells or tissues have an 'intrinsic' lifespan which will cause them to deteriorate after a certain limited number of divisions. When pieces of breast tissue or skin were repeatedly transplanted from old animals to young animals of the same (syngeneic) strain, they were still in good condition after ten 'life-times,' and their survival was apparently limited only by the necessity of trimming them each time they were transferred, to make sure that no host tissue was transplanted with them. When old rats were grafted onto young rats, the old member of the pair lived to twice the expected age. Recently, young female mice were grafted onto old females, to investigate any hormonal factors in aging. The ovaries of the young animal appeared to age, and its production of progesterone decreased. That is, old tissue seems to become younger on young animals, and young tissue can be 'aged' by association with an old animal."
**CONTEXT:** Evidence suggesting that aging is systemic rather than cellularly intrinsic.

**RAY PEAT:** "This kind of evidence (and the simple observation that the cells in skin and intestine undergo thousands of divisions in an individual's life-time) strongly favors the idea that a systemic energy problem its involved in aging."
**CONTEXT:** The systemic energy deficit as a cause of aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "V.I. Vernadsky believed that the earth's energy-exchange and substance-exchange processes were intensifying, and that the biosphere would undergo another major increase in its 'metabolic rate,' similar to that which appeared early in life's development with photosynthesis. M.I. Budyko (in Evolution of the Biosphere, 1986) discusses the principle of 'aromorphosis,' in which the origin of higher types of animal is closely associated with the availability of larger amounts of energy in the environment, and with the appearance of new structures which made possible a higher energy level of activity and more complex interactions with the environment.(4) When vertebrates developed an effective method of heat regulation, they were able to considerably increase their use of energy. The move from water to land requires greater ability to use energy, as well as requiring new structures suitable to the new way of living."
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's and Budyko's theories on energy, evolution, and "aromorphosis."

**RAY PEAT:** "When mammals and birds achieved the ability to sustain a high metabolic rate by keeping their bodies at a steady, fairly high, temperature, their 'food chain,' based on photosynthesis, consisted of organisms that generally lived at a lower temperature."
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic implications of endothermy in evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sugars, proteins, and the saturated fats produced by warm organisms can be eaten by warm-blooded animals with no particular side-effects.(5) Organisms that live at low temperatures, however, contain unsaturated fats. The consumption of large amounts of unsaturated fats lowers the metabolic rate, and accumulated unsaturated fats are susceptible to a spontaneous and toxic form of oxidation. (The toxic effects include damage to the respiratory apparatus and to the circulatory and immune systems, increased rate of aging, and cancer.)"
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic and toxic effects of unsaturated fats.

**RAY PEAT:** "These 'low energy' foods in effect counteract the evolutionary achievement of a high metabolic rate. Several studies show that decreased consumption of unsaturated fats can delay puberty. Other studies show that an excess of unsaturated oil in the mother's diet can damage the development of the fetus's brain. The choice of foods which have less unsaturated fat tends to reinforce the achievements of evolution."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of unsaturated fats on puberty, fetal development, and evolutionary progress.

**RAY PEAT:** "The seed oil industry has created a national phobia about the consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol, but there is no basis for the idea that those foods should be avoided. People with hypothyroidism are susceptible to heart disease, but their elevated blood cholesterol becomes normal when their thyroid function is restored. (Figure 6) The body's highest concentration of cholesterol exists in the brain. The level of cholesterol in the blood strongly influences the production of the protective hormones, such as progesterone. The brain contains by far the body's highest concentration of these hormones."
**CONTEXT:** The role of saturated fats, cholesterol, and thyroid function in heart disease and hormone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another energy-promoting factor is visible light. In the winter and at night the respiratory energy producing system is damaged, and the protective hormones decline, and the harmful stress hormones increase. The immune system becomes less active, and mortality increases."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of light and darkness on energy production, hormones, and immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although ultraviolet light interacts with unsaturated fats in the skin to accelerate aging (E.R. Pinckney, Medical Counterpoint, Feb, 1973) and to produce cancer, ordinary visible light has several beneficial effects in animals. One effect is the 'regeneration' of the enzyme SOD (superoxide dismutase), by causing its copper atom to be re-attached to the protein. Light also increases the activity of normal respiratory enzymes, and tends to normalize (or maximize) the production of hormones, including progesterone and thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** The beneficial effects of visible light on enzymes, respiration, and hormone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Animal migration to reproduce in regions with longer days is a way to benefit from this energy-promoting action of light. In adult birds, the increase of hormones in the spring causes the growth of new brain cells in the area that controls their singing. (In humans, the space inside the cranium keeps increasing into old age, and the amount of DNA in the brain also keeps increasing with age, but it has been assumed that such changes in adult brains result from an increase in the size of nerve cells, and an increase in the number of connective tissue cells, rather than from a continuing increase in the number of nerve cells.) I would expect an increase in the temperature of the earth, and increased use of artificial light (or migration) to lead to a prolongation of youth and the development of better brains."
**CONTEXT:** The role of light in brain cell growth and the potential for increased longevity and improved brains.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many years ago, people talked about the tendency toward 'cephalization' in evolution. That is the tendency to create a hierarchical organization, with the size and importance of the brain increasing with evolution. More recently, it was found that both the intensity and the efficiency of respiratory energy production in the brain increase with evolutionary level and with the degree of alertness."
**CONTEXT:** Cephalization and the link between brain energy production, evolution, and alertness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another seemingly directional tendency relating to energy production has to do with a non-random composition of the DNA. Aerobic micro-organisms' DNA has a higher G+C (the bases guanine and cytosine) content than does that of anaerobes, and warm-blooded vertebrates have more G+C than do lower organisms, with the G+C content again corresponding to the amount of oxygen used. Although the full meaning of the G+C content isn't known, it is thought to affect the stability of the organism at various levels, and I suppose this would allow the organism to thrive at higher temperatures."
**CONTEXT:** The correlation between G+C content in DNA, aerobic metabolism, and evolutionary level.

**RAY PEAT:** "The association of G+C content with evolutionary level is interesting because the changes occur in 'non-coding' DNA, where the ordinary kind of selection, involving 'coded' proteins, isn't involved. The 'isolation' of the genome, and the randomness of its changes, used to be at the core of genetics; I suspect this is why even most biologists aren't aware of this odd feature of DNA composition. The passage of time will allow people to disengage themselves from an embarrassing dogma. (Figure 7 shows the ascending G+C content for fruit fly, toad, mouse, cow, and human, in the DNA of the mitochondrion, where energy is produced.)"
**CONTEXT:** The significance of G+C content in non-coding DNA and its relation to evolutionary progression.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides the distortion of our food supply by the propaganda of the seed oil industry, there is increasing contamination of our food supply by heavy metals. Lead, for instance, has been spread everywhere, largely as a result of its use in leaded gasoline. Food additives are often contaminated with heavy metals from the sulfuric acid used in their manufacture. Many people are aware of the famous experiments in which food restriction increased the longevity of animals, as if eating were toxic. But removing toxic heavy metals from the food, without restricting the amount of food eaten, has had the same life-extending effect in experimental animals."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of heavy metal contamination and its similarity to caloric restriction in extending lifespan.

**RAY PEAT:** "When estrogen is elevated (as at puberty, or in pregnancy, or with medical estrogen treatment) the absorption of iron is stimulated. During aging, the body's load of iron increases, especially if there is a deficiency of copper, and the body's content of copper decreases with age. Copper is an essential component of cytochrome oxidase, which has the crucial last position in the mitochondrial respiratory system. Copper is a component of the cytoplasmic SOD enzyme, which decreases with age. Ceruloplasmin, a major copper-containing protein, helps to keep iron in its safe oxidized form. Copper is involved in the production of melanin (itself an antioxidant) and elastin. The loss of melanin, elastin, and respiratory capacity, which is so characteristic of senescence, is also produced by excessive exposure to cortisol."
**CONTEXT:** The interplay of estrogen, iron, copper, cortisol, and their effects on aging, respiration, and tissue integrity.

**RAY PEAT:** "The protein, metallothionein, is rich in sulfhydryl groups, which bind heavy metals. It is assumed that this protein helps to detoxify and eliminate the toxic metals. This protein is induced by exposure to either a heavy metal or cortisol. A larger amount is produced in response to the combination of heavy metals and cortisol, than by either alone. Since copper, like the toxic metals cadmium, lead, mercury, and silver, reacts strongly with sulfhydryl groups, the body is likely to lose some copper when it is subjected to heavy metals or cortisol. I think this chronic loss of copper accounts for the obvious features of aging, such as loss of elasticity of the skin, lungs, and blood vessels, the depigmentation (demelanization) of skin, hair, and (in Parkinson's disease) substantia nigra, and for the decrease in respiratory capacity. The replacement of the copper by iron (and the loss of the copper-enzymes which protect against iron-catalyzed free radicals) probably accounts for the increased formation of lipofuscin during aging. When copper-dependent mitochondrial respiration fails, lipofuscin has the ability to sustain energy production through glycolysis (by keeping the coenzyme NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, relatively oxidized), so it is possible that lipofuscin is a primitive sort of defense against stress."
**CONTEXT:** Metallothionein, copper loss, aging, and the role of lipofuscin in energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** "In animals, copper supplementation can restore natural color to white hair, and in one experiment, it increased longevity. At present, there isn't enough knowledge about the safety of different ways of administering supplemental copper. It can be toxic, and it oxidizes other nutrients. Besides choosing foods high in copper and low in iron and other heavy metals, other dietary choices which support thyroid function will tend to promote the retention of copper. Other dietary practices can minimize our production of cortisol (e.g., combining fruits and proteins, since protein foods lower blood sugar and stimulate the secretion of cortisol)."
**CONTEXT:** Copper supplementation, hair color, longevity, and dietary strategies for retaining copper and minimizing cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** "An old idea in our culture, which still inclines many people to a 'billiard ball' conception of mechanistic causality, is that matter must be ordered 'from outside.' For Descartes, this involved a material world which lacks 'secondary' qualities, i.e., every quality other than being present in space. That abstract world was supplemented by an utterly separate world of mind and spirit. Descartes’ spirit has continued to live in many geneticists, who see 'selection' as an ordering principle imposed upon a stupid sort of material substance, which can vary only randomly, by chance."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of mechanistic causality and genetic determinism, contrasting with Descartes' dualism.

**RAY PEAT:** "This genetic doctrine has a strong influence on medical thinking. Hundreds of diseases have been classified as 'genetic diseases,' and the idea is extended by showing an increased susceptibility among certain genetic tissue types even to germ-caused diseases and toxic sicknesses. Diabetes, allergies, arthritis, goiter, and myopia are often said to be 'caused by genes,' despite clear evidence for the involvement of the environment in producing them."
**CONTEXT:** The pervasive influence of genetic doctrine on medical classification and understanding of disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Physical science provides a much richer picture of the qualities and potential of the material world than geneticists recognize. Even many physicists don't recognize the richness implied by the body of experimental results in their field. Many well known physical scientists have had relatively holistic attitudes (e.g., J.C. Bose, Michael Polanyi, B.V. Deryagin, Frederick Soddy, V.I. Vernadsky). A rich view of physics has much to offer to biology. However, when I say that a holistic view of biology is open to using physics and chemistry, as well as ecology, history, and cosmology, to achieve an adequate understanding, I should mention that there is a school of weird (immaterial and 'quantum' centered) physics which is presenting itself as a holistic world-view. To them, I think Einstein's remark still applies: 'You believe in a dice-playing God and I in perfect laws in the world of things existing as real objects... .' Elsewhere, Einstein observed that an object's fields amounted to an extension of its material substance, i.e., he preferred to materialize fields, rather than to dematerialize things, as some of the popular philosophers of physics do.(6)"
**CONTEXT:** The limitations of geneticists' understanding of the material world and the value of a holistic approach informed by physics.

**RAY PEAT:** "The orderly, epitaxial growth of crystals has been shown to occur across the thickness of a plastic film. A detailed study of this sort of long-range ordering process was made by Alexander Rothen. He was able to demonstrate biologically specific adsorption at relatively great distances. Many other types of research in adsorption fields and long-range order make it clear that the interactions of atoms and molecules in cells needn't be governed by either direct contact or by random motion. When cell components are rearranged, they return to their normal position in relation to other components, revealing a great capacity for self-assembly or self-ordering."
**CONTEXT:** Evidence for long-range order and self-assembly in biological systems, challenging random motion as the sole organizing principle.

**RAY PEAT:** "The medical tradition of naturopathy recognizes a great capacity of the body for self-regulation and self-healing. I think these attitudes can be usefully expanded now, in the light of new knowledge about energy and structure. On the short time scale in which we think about the health of an individual, and on the transgenerational scale relating to having healthier, more intelligent children, and on the evolutionary time scale, I think we can see a tendency, not just to preserve homeostasis, but to move upward in energy and greater generality of structure and function. To provide more energy and scope for using it stimulates our ability to use energy meaningfully."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for expanding naturopathic principles with new knowledge about energy and structure, leading to upward adaptation.

**RAY PEAT:** "There is considerable flexibility in living organisms, and in higher and lower levels of organization, and we can see some of the ways in which structures of different complexity accommodate themselves to the surrounding condition of energy and structure."
**CONTEXT:** The adaptability of living organisms to their energy and structural environments.

**RAY PEAT:** "The conditions under which the brain develops, including gestational support and the later nutritional, hormonal, and behavioral conditions, the degree of stress and stimulation, contribute to the brain's structural complexity and metabolic energy use, and to the organism's ability to cope successfully with the environment."
**CONTEXT:** Factors influencing brain development and an organism's environmental coping mechanisms.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vicious circles of physiology often stabilize an organism on a low energy level, which may involve disease or rapid aging."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of vicious physiological cycles leading to low energy states.

**RAY PEAT:** "The existence of a few systems of positive feedback (self stimulation), however, indicates that in our fundamental structure we are biased in an expansive, upward direction. Progesterone (and its precursors, pregnenolone and cholesterol) and thyroid hormones participate in some of the important positive feedback systems, involving energy production, stress resistance, and brain growth."
**CONTEXT:** The role of positive feedback systems and specific hormones in promoting expansion and upward development.

**RAY PEAT:** "In therapy and in everyday living we can try to protect and promote our energy-producing and energy-using systems by seeking the stimulation, the conditions of light and temperature, and the foods that are appropriate for our evolutionary level."
**CONTEXT:** Practical strategies for optimizing energy production and utilization.

**RAY PEAT:** "Order can't be expected to emerge from disorder, even 'if you wait long enough,' unless an ordering principle, a 'formative tendency,' is present in the starting situation. 'Chaos,' then, would be described as 'potential,' and the development of organization would be more like a snowball rolling downhill, than like the step-by-step preservation of 'random variations' over an almost infinitely long time scale. Our knowledge of ourselves, and our sense of the meaning of life, are influenced by the answer to this basic question about the nature of order, and of the origin of life."
**CONTEXT:** The necessity of an ordering principle for the emergence of organization.

**RAY PEAT:** "When complex organic compounds were found in petroleum, some people argued that this was evidence that the petroleum was the residue of dead organisms, that had seeped into porous geological formations. Another view is that petroleum was directly created by the earth, and that life is a parallel creation."
**CONTEXT:** Theories on the origin of petroleum and its relation to life.

**RAY PEAT:** "Mendeleev and others proposed that molten metals deep in the earth might interact with the carbon present in minerals to create petroleum."
**CONTEXT:** Mendeleev's hypothesis on the inorganic origin of petroleum.

**RAY PEAT:** "Recently, Gustaf Arrhenius at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography has been studying the ability of iron carbonates to produce organic compounds. I think the gap of 100 years between this work and the ideas of Mendeleev and his contemporaries is the result of a dominant habit of thought which sees the world as an inhospitable place, in which life is a great improbability that came into existence only with great difficulty. The famous Crick, for example, suggested that life had to originate elsewhere, and arrived on earth as a truly alien space-traveler. The thought that life forms might just sort of gush up out of the earth in volcanic regions makes it all seem too easy; where might it lead if people started believing that life could originate without a struggle for existence?"
**CONTEXT:** The resistance to theories of life's easy origin and the potential for volcanic origins.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several years ago, Sidney Fox demonstrated that amino acids placed on a hot volcanic rock spontaneously formed into proteins, and that these proteins had some enzyme-like catalytic action. Adding a little water, the proteins spontaneously formed small self-reproducing spheres, just the size of bacteria. One of their enzyme-like actions was the ability to synthesize gene-like chains from suitable precursor molecules."
**CONTEXT:** Sidney Fox's experiments on the spontaneous formation of proteins and self-reproducing spheres.

**RAY PEAT:** "Explorations of the deep ocean floor, far below the level at which life should exist, because of the absence of light, revealed worm-like organisms. Further study showed that the worms live on bacteria, which in turn live on volcanic emissions rising through the ocean floor. If volcanic processes created life forms, and can even provide their food, then we don't have to imagine that green plants necessarily evolved before animals."
**CONTEXT:** Deep-sea life and the potential for volcanic origins of life independent of photosynthesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oxidants(2) are emitted by volcanism, and there are heme-like porphyrin molecules in petroleum which can catalyze respiration-like reactions. While molecular oxygen is now our most important electron acceptor (oxidant), other substances could have had a similar function. And, since volcanos emit both oxidants and reductants (depending on temperature and other conditions) we shouldn't blindly accept the doctrine that life originated in a 'reducing atmosphere.'(3) Since the reactions which produce petroleum-like hydrocarbons do not produce carbohydrates, we might want to investigate the possibility that carbohydrates are the product of a primitive type of metabolism."
**CONTEXT:** Volcanic emissions, porphyrins, oxidants, and the potential for alternative origins of metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several things look different when we consider the possibility of a volcanic origin for life. For example, there is a suggestion that life originated in abundance, in an environment rich, at least locally, in complex organic molecules, rather than in occasional puffs of molecules generated by lightning or dissolving slowly out of a meteorite. And the thought that life is truly geological, and is an expression of our planet's nature, might make us feel more at home, and nurtured."
**CONTEXT:** The implications of a volcanic origin for life, suggesting abundance and a geological connection.

**RAY PEAT:** "If we think of life, already complex and respiring, moving into the light and adapting to a new system in which carbon dioxide is captured from the environment for new syntheses, we are likely to ask a different set of biochemical and bioenergetic questions. Detoxifying systems, that would have evolved to protect respiration from compounds such as ammonia, cyanide, and carbon monoxide, might have been the first systems to make use of light. Evolution of these systems might have led into photosynthesis. If this is true, then the theoretical and chemical study of the origin of life might give us some clues to the nature of the biological rhythms based on the cycle of day and night."
**CONTEXT:** The transition of life to light-based systems and the evolution of detoxifying systems.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several people have written about the idea of a 'noosphere.' Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, in The Human Phenomenon, used the term coined by Edouard Le Roy. V. I. Vernadsky, in Biogeochemical Essays, developed the concept in relation to the principles of biogeochemistry. Vernadsky saw the noosphere as a stage in the natural geological development of the earth. He suggested that the various stages and aspects of the earth, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, the biosphere, will be followed by a stage in which a highly developed human society will recognize its place in the world and with understanding will guide the preservation and development of the natural system."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of the noosphere as a stage of Earth's geological development.

**RAY PEAT:** "This is not exactly the same as the 'Gaia hypothesis,' which sees the earth as an organism-like self-regulating system, since the people who talk about the noosphere idea recognize the damage that human life has already done to the biosphere, and emphasize that the course of human civilization will be crucial in the fate of the earth."
**CONTEXT:** Distinguishing the noosphere concept from the Gaia hypothesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "If we proceed blindly with aimless industrialization, deforestation, destructive agricultural practices and militarism, the entire biosphere could be destroyed, possibly ending the earth's progress forever. But if civilization proceeds toward an understanding that the world is in development, we might find our place in this developmental process. If this happens, the earth will be entering a new energy level, analogous to the earlier appearance of photosynthesis. As we build our understanding we can increasingly think of our consciousness as a geological force."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for human consciousness to become a geological force in guiding Earth's development.

**RAY PEAT:** "During the Second World War, Vernadsky wrote: 'I look at everything from the point of view of the noosphere and I think that in the wind and storm, in the horror and ordeal, a wonderful new future is being spontaneously born.'"
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's perspective on the future amidst global turmoil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Increasingly in the last decade, people in the Soviet Union who are interested in perestroika and an alternative world view have been thinking about V. I. Vernadsky and his work. Ecologists and conservationists in that country have found that his picture of the world offers an approach to the unity of life and its environment which is both practical and inspiring. While it initially sounds like a strange thing to say, Vernadsky's work made a real place for human consciousness and history in science by using simple physical concepts such as mass, energy, and rates of change, for approaching the biosphere. By examining the limits set by space and the flow of energy from the sun and the earth, Vernadsky was led to propose some simple laws of biogeochemistry, for example that the migration of chemical elements tends towards a maximum. Within this framework, he saw that the intensity of biological reproduction and metabolism and the degree of biological organization have orderly and lawful interrelations, and that human culture and consciousness participate in these natural relationships and processes. Vernadsky described his view as 'cosmic realism,' a phrase that had also been used by Mendeleev."
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's "cosmic realism" and its integration of consciousness, history, and biogeochemistry.

**RAY PEAT:** "As a student, Vernadsky (1863-1945) was drawn toward both history and mathematics, and he read widely in philosophy and religion, including Plato, Aristotle, and Hinduism. After studying with Dokuchaev (who has been described as the pioneer of ecology because of his study of the interaction of biological and geological factors in the formation of soil), Vernadsky studied in Germany and France. It seems that he sought out the best minds and strongest personalities of the time, in many branches of knowledge. He knew the Curies, Hans Driesch (a student of Haeckel, the Darwinist; Driesch is known as a vitalist), Sechenov, Le Chatelier, Mendeleev, and Tolstoy, and was able to integrate their perceptions into his view."
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's interdisciplinary education and intellectual influences.

**RAY PEAT:** "For example, he wrote 'I think that the teaching of Tolstoy is much deeper than I first thought. This depth consists in his view that the basis of life is the search for truth, and that the real task is to tell this truth without any retreats,' and he described Tolstoy as an accumulator of the energy of human consciousness."
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's appreciation for Tolstoy's emphasis on truth and the energy of consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Tolstoy's moral thought was paralleled by Vernadsky's perception of unity, in which humans, as part of a cycle of transformations, have an obligation to think and act for the good of the planet. The creation and preservation of culture and human consciousness are given a central place in Vernadsky's view, but not at the expense of anything else in the world: Consciousness is needed by all of humanity, for the good of the world."
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's view of human obligation to the planet and the central role of consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although many of Vernadsky's concrete discoveries have been independently rediscovered in the United States, his name seldom appears in American books on geology or ecology. I think this is because of his basic belief that nature is not ruled by accident. 'Earth's structure is a harmonious integration of parts that must be studied as an indivisible mechanism. . . . Creatures on earth are the fruit of a long and complicated mechanism in which it is known that fixed laws apply and chance does not exist.'"
**CONTEXT:** The marginalization of Vernadsky's work in the US due to his belief in nature's lawful, non-accidental processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idealization of randomness in German and Anglo-American science makes it hard even now to discuss physical and biological approaches which emphasize order, lawfulness, and directional transformations. Like Le Chatelier's ideas in physical chemistry, which were very influential in Vernadsky's thinking, the idea of a principle of 'stability' which leads spontaneously to increased complexity and order in a system, is a little too alien to be received easily in our culture. Ilya Prigogine's work in this area is probably changing the atmosphere a little."
**CONTEXT:** The resistance to concepts of order and stability in science, contrasting with Vernadsky's and Prigogine's work.

**RAY PEAT:** "Unfortunately, even when there are systematic observations of the appearance of structure out of relative disorder, there is in the United States a preference to attribute the appearance of order to 'chaotic' processes, and to argue from the 'logic of chaos' that the future is absolutely unforeseeable, and that the world is chaotic rather than lawful. (If there is any significant chaos in this new doctrine, I think it is primarily in the terminology and in the illogical conclusions of some of its proponents.)"
**CONTEXT:** The tendency in the US to attribute order to chaos and deny lawfulness in natural processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "To Vernadsky, the world is lawful. His view of life as an active mass, a form of matter which must be understood quantitatively, 'a whirlwind of molecules,' acting on its surroundings, led him to think in terms of the rate of migration of atoms through this active mass. With this view, inert atoms become active, while active atoms become inert, depending on their situation."
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's view of life as an active mass and the concept of an atom's "history."

**RAY PEAT:** "His first biogeochemical law, that the migration of atoms tends toward a maximum, is obvious to anyone who thinks about it, and it is an obvious parallel to Le Chatelier's principle of equilibrium. Once that principle is accepted, and if life is seen as part of nature, then Vernadsky's second law, that evolution will produce species which maximize the migration of chemical elements, follows naturally."
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's biogeochemical laws and their connection to Le Chatelier's principle.

**RAY PEAT:** "But this requires thinking about the biosphere as a system which is driven by energy from the sun, and this context isn't habitual for evolutionists. Vernadsky said that his second biogeochemical principle 'shows, in a manner as precise as the corresponding principles in mechanics and physical chemistry, the direction in which the processes of evolution must proceed, namely, in the direction of increasing consciousness and thought, and of forms having greater and greater influence on their surroundings.'"
**CONTEXT:** Vernadsky's second biogeochemical principle and its implications for evolution and consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Teilhard de Chardin got his idea of the Noosphere from Vernadsky's work. Many people prefer to see the idea of consciousness' having a meaningful and central place in evolution as exclusively a religious idea. However, from Vernadsky's perspective it can be derived from seeing life in physical and chemical terms. To make the implications of the idea clearer, it might be useful to apply it to some contemporary scientific questions, which could range from the origin of life, to the optimization of farming and dietary practices."
**CONTEXT:** The derivation of the noosphere concept from Vernadsky's work and its scientific applicability.

**RAY PEAT:** "'One gathers that the period of youth among mammals is not essentially recapitulatory but rather adaptive and anticipatory.' P.E. Davidson, in The Recapitulatory Theory and Human Infancy, Columbia University Press, 1914."
**CONTEXT:** Davidson's view on youth as adaptive and anticipatory.

**RAY PEAT:** "Energy flows through all systems, and the flow of energy leaves a residue of structure. In the 1960's and early 1970's, I made many 'model' systems of the chemistry of respiration, trying to get perspectives on the meaning of biological respiration."
**CONTEXT:** The relationship between energy flow, structure, and respiration.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of my experiments, in 1971, involved ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and copper. Every few seconds, the mixture alternately changed color and emitted puffs of gas; this is called an oscillating reaction, or a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. This made me realize that 'structure building' can involve the dimension of time, in a way more interesting than the simple dissipation of energy over time. When starting at a point, an oscillating reaction of this sort can generate interesting ring and spiral structures in space."
**CONTEXT:** The significance of oscillating reactions in understanding structure building in time and space.

**RAY PEAT:** "I see the interaction between the flow of energy (e.g., between a sugar and oxygen) and the structure as one in which the flow is retarded by the structure, and used by the structure, in maintaining and complexifying itself. (Another way of looking at this is that if energy can do something, it does something; and what it does is to build structure. The life structure is a kind of energy charge, but the important thing is the spontaneous nature of the interactions, in the presence of an energy supply.) The chemical nature of the energy source (and of the energy 'sink,' which is usually oxygen) influences the nature of the structure-building."
**CONTEXT:** The dynamic interaction between energy flow and structure, emphasizing spontaneous interactions and the influence of energy sources.

**RAY PEAT:** "A point made by O. Warburg and A. Szent-Gyorgyi and others is that there is an important difference between the energy provided by glycolysis and that provided by mitochondrial respiration. They felt that glycolysis was a more primitive form of energy production, and supported only primitive function and cell division, while the more efficient respiration supported cell differentiation and complex functioning."
**CONTEXT:** The distinction between energy production via glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Warburg thought that localization of mitochondria within cells could explain the special effects of respiratory energy, while Szent-Gyorgyi suspected that respiration more directly held the structural proteins of the cell in a special electronic state. It is now recognized that the localization of mitochondria within a cell creates an energy (ATP) gradient within the cell. (There has been a dogmatic disbelief in such gradients.) And, for example, the polyamines, which are associated with an increased rate of cell division, appear to shift cell metabolism away from respiration, toward glycolysis. The nature of the energy source seems to be more important than many biologists have thought."
**CONTEXT:** The role of mitochondrial localization, ATP gradients, and the influence of energy sources on cellular metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Various hormones involved in adaptation and reproduction modulate the balance between glycolysis and respiration. Elsewhere (e.g., J. Orthomol. Psych., 1975) I have discussed the hormone-like properties of various nutrients. In the 1930's, it was pointed out that all of the changes produced in rats by a diet lacking the 'essential fatty acids' were the same as the changes occurring in hyperthyroidism. Parallel to the balance (or antagonism) between opposing hormones, there seems to be some sort of balance and opposition between different sorts of food energy."
**CONTEXT:** Hormonal modulation of glycolysis/respiration and the parallel between essential fatty acids and hyperthyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The structural and functional repercussions of different dietary energy sources are complex, and I plan to discuss some of them soon in more detail, but there is some evidence for a relatively simple sort of absorptive or solubility compatibility between the cell substance in a given energy state, and the fuel molecules preferred by that state. Conceivably, this could account for the apparent 'directed mutations' in the ability of microorganisms to use new substances for foods, observed by C. C. Lindegren, J. Cairns, and others. In adaptation to foods which are actually present, no anticipation is required, but only a sort of structural accommodation."
**CONTEXT:** The compatibility between cell energy states and preferred fuel molecules, and the concept of "directed mutations."

**RAY PEAT:** "When the availability of food changes according to a daily cycle of light and dark, there is an adjustment of the metabolism involving many hormones, and an adjustment of nervous function, to protect against stress (Figure 1). Learning is involved, in the sense that a cyclic repetition is anticipated even by 'simple' organisms. In humans and other mammals, there is the 'dawn phenomenon,' in which blood sugar rises to daytime levels before sunrise."
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic and nervous system adjustments to daily cycles and the anticipation of food availability.

**RAY PEAT:** "When food is abundant during pregnancy, and when the environment is not stressful, the brain of the fetus grows at a faster rate than in cases in which the pregnancy is affected by malnutrition or stress. Since the brain is a metabolically expensive organ, and since a larger brain tends to correspond to a higher metabolic rate of the entire organism, it appears that the developing fetus is anticipating a lifetime of relative abundance of food when it is well nourished in the uterus, and when it is exposed to less cortisol and more progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** Fetal brain growth and its anticipation of future environmental conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "In evolution, the tendency toward dominance of the head (cephalization) in animals overlaps with another tendency (known in plants too) called juvenilization, pedomorphism, or neoteny, in which an early stage of the organism's development, the juvenile stage, is preserved for longer and longer periods in the descendants, eventually becoming the normal adult type. Baby apes resemble humans, in body proportions and behavior, much more than the adult apes do. The infant represents our evolutionary future."
**CONTEXT:** Cephalization and neoteny as evolutionary trends.

**RAY PEAT:** "Embryologists have observed that 'ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,' that is, that early in development, mammals go through stages that resemble fish and reptiles. But I have always been intrigued by the fact that the same trend which can be seen going back from the adult to the infant--i.e., increasing of the brain-to-body ratio--can be seen to continue from the infant back to the embryo, at about the second month or seventh week of development. That is, the first few weeks of ontogeny recapitulate phylogeny, but then ontogeny also anticipates a phylogeny that hasn't been yet (Figure 2)."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of ontogeny anticipating phylogeny.

**RAY PEAT:** "If the physical/chemical structures which retard the flow of energy, and complexify with it, accommodating themselves to it, reflect past and present conditions and types of energy source and energy sink, then presumably different geological phases would be suitably associated with different anatomies and physiologies. The extremely favorable energy relationships which exist in the early embryo (which is very small in relation to its supply of energy) appear to support a certain structural relationship, which sketches out the structural-functional possibilities for the future, when our environmental energy resources might be richer."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between geological phases, energy relationships, and the development of anatomical and physiological possibilities.

**RAY PEAT:** "Each stage of evolutionary history has its characteristic metabolic chemistry. By protecting and promoting mitochondrial respiration we are contributing to our own evolution. (More on this subject appears in 'Youth, Energy and Regeneration' and 'The Life of Nature'.)"
**CONTEXT:** The role of mitochondrial respiration in evolutionary progress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Le Chatelier's principle, that a system adjusts in ways which restore a disturbed equilibrium, is behind this idea. Every part of the flow can be seen as a disequilibrium, and the complexification of the structure tends to absorb the disturbing energy."
**CONTEXT:** Le Chatelier's principle applied to energy flow and structural complexification.

**RAY PEAT:** "Referring specifically to the heart muscle, Szent-Gyorgyi said 'function builds structure.' Generalized principles of stability will illuminate the life processes in which stimulation produces growth and adaptation. Much of the needed knowledge already exists in a fragmented way."
**CONTEXT:** Szent-Gyorgyi's concept of "function builds structure" and generalized principles of stability.

**RAY PEAT:** "A proposed law of aromorphosis: that the retardation of the flow of energy in living systems tends toward a maximum; In animals, this would imply a trend toward larger-brained, longer-lived, and probably warmer animals, having a higher energy charge."
**CONTEXT:** A proposed law of aromorphosis related to energy flow and evolutionary trends.

**RAY PEAT:** "'Then tell me, what is the material world, and is it dead?' He, laughing, answer'd: 'I will write a book on leaves of flowers, if you will feed me on love-thoughts & give me now and then A cup of sparkling poetic fancies; so, when I am tipsie, I'll sing to you to this soft lute, and shew you all alive The world, where every particle of dust breathes forth its joy.' W. Blake (1794)"
**CONTEXT:** Blake's poetic view of a living, joyful world.

**RAY PEAT:** "'If this were an entirely scientific matter, there is little doubt from the evidence that the case for a fundamentally biological universe would be regarded as substantially proven. The reason why the scientific community passionately resists this conclusion is that biological systems are teleological, which is to say purposive. And if we admit the universe to be inhabited by a vast number of purposive components then the thought cannot be far away that perhaps the Universe itself might be purposive....' F. Hoyle (1989)"
**CONTEXT:** Hoyle's observation on the scientific resistance to a purposive universe due to the teleological nature of biological systems.

**RAY PEAT:** "To read either poetry or 'scientific' writing, it is useful to know what was going on in the writer's life. For example, if you know that Albert Einstein's family's business was ruined by the German electric-machine monopoly, his attitude to-ward the German-dominated physics establishment and its ideas will be seen in that context. The nature of communication and of meaning itself makes a certain consideration ('ad hominem') of the communicator's general attitudes necessary for a clear and full understanding. Einstein explicitly recognized this situation when he said that a person's life can't be separated from the person's hypothesis."
**CONTEXT:** The importance of understanding a writer's life context for interpreting their work.

**RAY PEAT:** "The dean of the Yale school of medicine said it wasn't proper for me to think that his school's research conclusions on the safety of Premarin could be influenced by a gift of a large amount of money from Ayerst (the makers of that ultra-lucrative product), but he refused to tell me how much money was involved. Big money from every major industry has corrupted our scientific culture, and it is important that we consider the scientific alternatives."
**CONTEXT:** The influence of industry funding on scientific research and the need for alternatives.

**RAY PEAT:** "The 'genetic defect' theory of disease holds the promise of a gene-implant for every problem. Interestingly, the people who point out that 'thousands of genetic diseases are now known' neglect to mention that the 'scientific literature' supporting their claim is infinitely more 'anecdotal' than the despised 'anecdotal' support for the various unofficial remedies that are so offensive to the medical establishment. A doctor sees three people in a family with muscle twitches, and a Latin-named Twitchy Muscle Syndrome with dominant Mendelian inheritance enters the scientific literature. In thousands of such publications, the possibility of nutritional deficiencies and exposure to toxins isn't investigated, because there is such eagerness to recognize a new genetic defect."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of the "genetic defect" theory of disease and the overemphasis on genetics over environmental and nutritional factors.

**RAY PEAT:** "There is a mystique in our scientific culture called Reductionism. It reduces the explanation for something to a description of its parts, and the ways the parts interact. A relatively small number of 'elements' and 'laws' are used to explain a great range of specific phenomena. My favorite formulation of the reductionist attitude is that of the famous Mr. Crick: What else is there but atoms?"
**CONTEXT:** Defining reductionism and its core tenet.

**RAY PEAT:** "The reason I call Reductionism a mystique is that its proponents feel it is so clear and obvious that they don't have to bother with philosophical complexity. They, in that sense, are the Fundamentalists of the 20th century. Although they emphasize the importance of analysis, formal reasoning, mathematics, and quantification, they are not interested in examining the philosophical basis of their methods, except occasionally to say something like 'the scientific method has been proven scientifically.'"
**CONTEXT:** Reductionism as a form of fundamentalism, avoiding philosophical complexity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sanity itself requires that we not confuse our wishes, assumptions, methods, and ideas with the world that we are trying to understand. If our method determines our conclusions we are closer to theology than to science, and that is how many 'scientists' prefer it."
**CONTEXT:** The importance of distinguishing methods from reality and the danger of method-driven conclusions.

**RAY PEAT:** "An inference that something is generally true, based on some specific examples, is a matter of judgment, rather than of formal logic. Different people may draw different inferences. An intelligent hypothesis is based on a lifetime of intelligent inferences. The element of judgment in choosing a hypothesis leads some people to suggest that there is an arbitrariness or even randomness to the choice of hypotheses. If we acknowledge clearly that our choice of hypothesis is a matter of our best judgment, there is no problem, because the virtue of science is in putting hypotheses to various tests, which will eventually eliminate the most mistaken ones. When we make specific formal deductions from a hypothesis we reveal its implications and look for ways to test these implications."
**CONTEXT:** The role of judgment and inference in hypothesis formation and the scientific process.

**RAY PEAT:** "It is in the nature of formal reasoning that we can deduce specific details from something more general, but that we can't formally deduce something more general from specific things. This is where reductionism uses its method to impose a conclusion about the nature of the world. The reductionism which says that physics can explain everything, because everything is composed of 'these basic particles, according to fundamental laws of interaction,' forces itself into asserting that the many forms of life can be deduced from the general laws of physics, and that the varied and specific forms of organisms represent the interaction through time of chance events (in the genes) with the determining forces of the environment. The mode of explanation leads to the content of the science. The nature of formal logic, proceeding from the parts, requires that the whole be explainable in terms of its parts. If the trick that explains the whole can be found in the nature of the parts, there is no problem, but problems arise when the reductionist claims that we already have the kind of knowledge of the parts that can adequately explain the whole. In this sense, biology is seen as less general than physics, and physics contains an adequate explanation for biology."
**CONTEXT:** The logical limitations of reductionism in explaining complex systems like biology.

**RAY PEAT:** "A story from a 1915 physics conference in Berlin will illustrate how the desire to explain things in terms of the parts can create problems even within physics itself (and its traditional subject matter). Michael Polanyi, a Hungarian, found that there was a simple formula that accurately described the adsorption of gas molecules on charcoal, at different pressures, in terms of an 'adsorption potential' extending through space, which allows various layers of gas molecules to condense on top of previously adsorbed layers, as the pressure is increased. The famous German physicists at the meeting pointed out that their modern knowledge of the electrical nature of matter made it evident that the first layer of molecules would neutralize the adsorbing force of the charcoal, and that it was only because Polanyi was working in a backward country that he thought an adsorption 'potential' could somehow reach out into space through a layer of molecules to pull in more molecules."
**CONTEXT:** An anecdote illustrating how reductionist thinking in physics hindered the acceptance of Polanyi's adsorption theory.

**RAY PEAT:** "Around 1930, Langmuir proposed his relatively complex multilayer adsorption theory, but by then Polanyi's more elegant adsorption isotherm was remembered only as the embarrassing 'mistake' of a young man from a backward country. (We should also remember that the 'modern' notion of the electrical nature of matter formed the very basis for such work as the theory of the photoelectric effect, which had such importance in the development of the quantum theory. If atoms aren't the discrete little packets they were thought to be around the turn of the century, then the need for discrete little packets of energy isn't as evident as it seemed then. Polanyi's other projects turned up other aspects of matter that weren't acceptable to the physics of that time.)"
**CONTEXT:** The continued suppression of Polanyi's work and its implications for quantum theory.

**RAY PEAT:** "If the world's best physicists and chemists used a reductionist approach to block the development of an important branch of physics, it is clear how the approach can obstruct the development of ideas in more complex fields, such as biology and cosmology. If the Germans had taken Polanyi's adsorption work more seriously, they would have had to revise their rigid and mistaken ideas about 'the electrical nature of matter.' A higher level of organization of substance (as in Polanyi's experiment) can, if insightfully described, provide new knowledge about the nature of the 'parts' making up the lower level. This might be called 'reducing up.'"
**CONTEXT:** The broader implications of reductionism for scientific progress in complex fields.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since there is nothing known about atoms that could cause them to arrange themselves into the shapes of the various known organisms, absolute chance is said to be responsible for variations of form, and the surrounding conditions are said to allow certain ones to persist and multiply."
**CONTEXT:** The reductionist explanation for biological form based on chance and environmental selection.

**RAY PEAT:** "Once we accept that knowledge is tentative, and that we are probably going to improve our knowledge in important ways when we learn more about the world, we are less likely to reject new information that conflicts with our present ideas. The attitude of expectancy will allow us to apply insights gained at one level of generality to other levels. No particular kind of knowledge will have such authority that it will automatically exclude certain possibilities in another field of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** The importance of intellectual humility and openness to new information.

**RAY PEAT:** "For example, either Polanyi's adsorption measurements or the known structures of organisms or biological systems could be seen as an opportunity to ask 'what processes could create structures of this sort, or are there rules of stability which can clearly define the conditions under which such a structure can exist?'"
**CONTEXT:** Using scientific observations to explore underlying principles of structure formation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Rules of structure-making are likely to be very complex, but rules of stability are relatively simple. Polanyi's adsorption isotherm is a very simple rule of stability, which describes how gas molecules arrange themselves on a surface, and it makes a general contribution to our understanding of the 'condensed state of matter.' The factors which govern mammalian fertility can be seen as part of a potential rule of stability, describing the conditions under which new mammals can come into existence; as it turns out, the factors which govern fertility also have an important influence on the subsequent development of the organism, its health, intelligence, and longevity--the way in which its very structure comes into being."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of "rules of stability" and their application to biological phenomena like fertility.

**RAY PEAT:** "Rules of stability, with greater generality than the basic laws of physics and chemistry, might be discovered which specify the nature of the substance which is likely to exist in various situations. At present, chemical engineers have some fragmentary knowledge of this sort. The attitude of reductionism has certainly kept many things from being discovered, even in chemistry and simple biochemistry. For example, people used to say that, although you can cook a soy bean or a piece of meat into its component amino acids, you could never cook amino acids into a protein. Sidney Fox did just that, simply by omitting the water in the recipe. The reductionists then said that the polymers Fox made would be random, and without any catalytic (enzyme-like) properties, but in fact their structure was non-random, and they did have catalytic activity."
**CONTEXT:** The discovery of new rules of stability and the limitations imposed by reductionism, exemplified by Sidney Fox's work.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another example: Some biochemists thought it was foolish to suggest that dilution might obscure important principles of enzyme behavior, when cells are dissolved in water in a test-tube; but a brighter man down the hall thought about it for a while, and demonstrated that some of the most famous soluble test-tube enzymes don't react randomly with molecules in solution in the cell, but pass the molecule from enzyme to enzyme in an organized way."
**CONTEXT:** The importance of organized enzyme activity within cells, challenging the notion of random reactions in dilute solutions.

**RAY PEAT:** "In these examples, the ignorant opinions were held by most chemists through most of the history of protein chemistry, because it was required by the reductionist belief that the 'parts' explain the whole. The belief that Fox's polymers of amino acids would be 'random' and inert derived from the belief that forms are generated randomly, through a long history, and that the properties of life are simply the arbitrary result of what happened to be preserved by the natural selection of the environment."
**CONTEXT:** The persistence of reductionist beliefs in protein chemistry and their impact on understanding biological forms.

**RAY PEAT:** "The existence of various chemical substances in interstellar space, or the presence of 'biological' molecules in petroleum, or of subatomic particles in cosmic rays or radioactive minerals, can be understood in terms of various rules of stability. Plant material and human substance might best be understood in terms of such rules of stability. That would put all substances on the same 'ontological level,' though the more complex substances would have more specialized requirements for existence."
**CONTEXT:** Understanding diverse substances through rules of stability, bridging chemistry and biology.

**RAY PEAT:** "The 'requirements for existence,' seen in this way, form a direct link between practical matters, such as health and human potentiality, and seemingly remote matters, such as cosmology. To discover such 'rules of stability' for complex structures requires that we imaginatively extend the rules or laws that we now recognize. Such an imaginative extension, in searching for adequate hypotheses, can be seen as an expansion of physics, or as a 'reducing up' of physics to biology."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between "requirements for existence," health, and cosmology, and the concept of "reducing up" physics to biology.

**RAY PEAT:** "The insistence that formal deductive reasoning should form the link between our present physical ideas, and our description of biology, is what forces the reductionists to assert that our existence is the result of random mutations plus natural selection. My preference for the use of imagination to extend physical ideas, rather than logical deduction to 'apply' those ideas, comes simply from my feeling that we don't yet know everything, and that in searching for new knowledge we should avoid routes that lead us to believe nothing is there even before we have looked."
**CONTEXT:** The preference for imaginative extension of physical ideas over rigid deduction in scientific inquiry.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a recent television piece, Stub Stewart, one of our local timber barons, said that when he looks at an ancient forest he sees money; an average fir tree represents more than $2000, he said. (In Ernst Schachtel's analysis of perception types, this is the lowest, undeveloped or degraded type of perception, based on self-centered utility, rather than on grasping the actual nature of the thing.) Considering that this un-intelligent sort of perception is typical of people who have power, I want to point out some of the neglected money related effects of mature forests of giant trees."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of a utilitarian perception of ancient forests.

**RAY PEAT:** "These forests, which the elderly timber baron described as rest homes which should be removed and replaced with kindergartenly tree farms, are often described as being biologically static systems which, for example, make no contribution toward absorbing the carbon dioxide produced by industry. (The people who use this argument would have a point, as far as the carbon dioxide question goes, if they proposed to plant new forests in shopping centers and other places that don't have trees now. But replacing a big forest by a little forest adds carbon dioxide to the environment. I don't consider the 'greenhouse effect' to be a problem, but I mention it as an example of how even their own arguments weigh against their intentions.)"
**CONTEXT:** The ecological and atmospheric role of ancient forests versus tree farms.

**RAY PEAT:** "The fact that I think is crucial for the world's future is that rainforests energetically are comparable to volcanos,(1) except that their energy is primarily biological, and that their effects contribute massively to the stability of the biosphere. Although net growth per year (in the sense of added biomass) is greater in a tree farm, the internal flow of energy is greater in an ancient forest than anywhere else on earth, and it is this high rate of 'metabolism' which gives the great forests their powerful influence on the rest of the world. Bioenergetically, they can be compared to the brain of an animal: intense, stable, and essential to the existence of the whole.(2,3)"
**CONTEXT:** The energetic significance of rainforests, comparing them to volcanos and the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** "Metabolic processes occurring at night influence daytime processes; winter events influence summer events; soil events influence air events. Time is bound into the system. The flow of energy is dominated by nearly horizontal switchbacks, rather than by uncontrolled vertical surges. Space is bound into the system, for example by the mysteriously powerful pumping systems involved in transpiration. (The secretion of droplets at the ends of leaf-veins under certain conditions shows that osmosis and evaporation are not adequate to explain the movement of water; the attitude of our science establishment to this fundamental problem offers great opportunities for sociological investigation.)"
**CONTEXT:** The temporal and spatial integration of metabolic processes in ancient forests.

**RAY PEAT:** "A century ago, Darwin showed that the folding movements of many plants at sunset have the function of preventing radiant heat loss; that is, the leaves arrange themselves so that they radiate their metabolically derived energy toward other leaves, rather than toward the dark, energy-absorbing sky. He showed that the angle of the leaf at night could make the difference between life and death."
**CONTEXT:** Darwin's observations on plant movements for radiant heat loss prevention.

**RAY PEAT:** "Water is a very good absorber of heat (infrared radiation). For example, a spectrum of the energy radiated from a person's hand reveals a deviation from the expected curve, as a result of infrared absorption by water. The mass of water in-side a tree is therefore metabolically relevant, even though most of the metabolism of a tree is near its surface. The height and density of the forest will also affect its thermal and metabolic stability. In humans, about 75% of our metabolic energy is lost as radiant heat. In a cold environment, the energy lost as radiant heat is important to any organism. The radiant interaction of organisms in a rainforest is immense. It is another factor which distinguishes forests from tree farms."
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic relevance of water in trees and the significance of radiant heat exchange in forests.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. defines forests as 'lands bearing vegetative associations dominated by trees of any size, exploited or not, capable of producing wood or of exerting an influence on the local climate or on the water regime.' Everyone who listens to weather reports on television and radio should be aware that the forests, and their destruction, are affecting their weather. Farmers and the owners of ski resorts are aware that droughts affect their income, so they shouldn't have too much trouble grasping the implications of deforestation. The loggers talk about the importance of their jobs, relative to the importance of the environment; droughts and floods, caused by deforestation, have obvious economic consequences, which must be taken into account."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of forests on climate and the economic consequences of deforestation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ivory dealers say 'but I have to make a living' even if elephants become extinct. Drift-net fishermen say 'I have to make a living,' even if entire populations of porpoises are destroyed. Every region and industry seems to have people who feel that their present jobs are more important than the very ecosystem which is the foundation for their present 'harvesting' job. This pathological sort of perception resembles the type of autism in which the victim devours part of his own body, unless restrained. Just as Gorbachev said that the survival of humanity transcends the class struggle, protection of the environment must transcend the witless arguments of those who insist that they must be allowed to consume these resources now, before it's too late for them to enjoy this one last harvest."
**CONTEXT:** The self-destructive perception of prioritizing immediate economic gain over ecological stability.

**RAY PEAT:** "In Alaska, gigantic Sitka spruce are being turned into wood pulp to make into rayon shirts. In Oregon and Washington, many ancient trees are made into pulp for newsprint and wrapping paper. Redwood is so resistant to decay that houses built from it should last forever, but most of the houses built from the extinct redwood forests have been bulldozed into splinters and hauled to landfills, as the cities grow and change. One California company which had been slowly cutting its large timber holdings was recently forced to begin cutting trees as fast as possible, because of debt created when it was acquired by junk-bond billionaire Hurwitz. The fortunes created by this destruction of wealth are stimulating the concentration of wealth and power, but do not seem to be leading to the production of new wealth. The condition of towns and regions which have depended on the timber industry speaks eloquently of what the timber baron's 'wealth' amounts to in human terms."
**CONTEXT:** The economic and social consequences of unsustainable logging practices.

**RAY PEAT:** "The alternative sources of cellulose for rayon and paper are numerous. Besides cotton, linen, and hemp, various types of paper have been made from straw, esparto grass, jute, sisal, cane, and bamboo. The use of wood for building houses is largely a cultural matter, since there are many better and cheaper materials. For example, I lived in a two-storey adobe house built around 1450, which had survived several major earthquakes without damage. It had 12 ft. ceilings, and didn't need air conditioning even in hot weather. When the drainage is good, these mud buildings are not damaged even by torrential rains. My father built an adobe house in the 1930's which is still in good condition. Even the shingles were made of clay, mixed with an emulsion of tar for water-proofing. These houses can never be destroyed by fire, and they don't have the toxic fumes often produced by chemically treated wood products."
**CONTEXT:** Sustainable building materials and their advantages over wood.

**RAY PEAT:** "Even northern forests can provide rich harvests of products other than wood, without causing ecological damage. Resins, drugs, hormones, and food materials are produced in abundance, though the moronic practices of clear-cutting and slash-burning have eliminated some of the potential forest crops. According to the calculations of biologist Curt Mitchell, the forests of Oregon can produce at least $4,000 worth of materials per acre per year other than trees."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for sustainable harvesting of non-wood products from forests.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 96% of the redwoods which used to extend from San Francisco to southern Oregon are gone. Only about 2 square miles of redwoods remain in Oregon, and many of these are scheduled to be sold and logged this year. The redwoods illustrate some of the interactions between trees and climate. The coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) can reach a height of more than 350 feet. It requires areas which provide summer fog as well as winter rain. In some areas, it is estimated that 50% of the annual precipitation is in the form of fog caught on their leaves, so it is obvious that their great height makes a major contribution to the water-economy of the region."
**CONTEXT:** The ecological importance of redwoods and their contribution to regional water cycles.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Sierra redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) grows at a higher elevation, on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Their massive trunks apparently represent an adaptation to the absence of the summer fog--their wood is about 50% water, so the thick trunks function as storage tanks to sustain activity through the dry seasons (Figure 1)."
**CONTEXT:** The adaptation of Sierra redwoods to drier conditions through water storage in their trunks.

**RAY PEAT:** "Disregarding the soil's water-retaining capacity in an ancient forest, just the storage of water in the trees themselves can amount to thousands of tons per acre; such quantities of water have significance even geologically. According to A.V. Lapo, in Traces of Bygone Biospheres, 'the content of water in the tissues of living organisms is approximately five times greater than in all the rivers of the globe.' 'Half the water. . .in the roots of plants is renewed in several minutes. As a result, the water cycle on land is determined almost exclusively by the transpiration of the plants.'"
**CONTEXT:** The significant role of water stored in trees for the global water cycle.

**RAY PEAT:** "The humidity of the air passing through a tree farm is much lower than that passing through a real forest. Locally, this determines what can live and thrive. On a larger scale, differences in temperature and humidity affect wind flow. I think this is why the humid ocean winds are increasingly being diverted toward British Columbia, and away from Oregon and California, where they used to provide dependable winter precipitation. (Since ocean currents are guided by winds, the disruption of weather patterns is likely to become self-stimulating.)"
**CONTEXT:** The impact of deforestation on local humidity, wind patterns, and regional precipitation.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1920's, an economist, S.G. Strumilin, showed that money spent on education gave a 27-fold return; more recently, J.K. Galbraith said that the return is about 100 times the investment, and is greater than the return on investments in railroads, dams, or factories. Buckminster Fuller talked about doing more with less; this is the meaning of applying science to economic production maximizing effects while minimizing the means."
**CONTEXT:** The economic returns of investing in education and the principle of "doing more with less."

**RAY PEAT:** "To have an economy that develops qualitatively, rather than quantitatively, means that the extractive industries will decrease, while the complexity, intensity and appropriateness of use of the materials will increase steadily. Investment in humanity means increasing productivity and enjoyment, by improving human health, intelligence, skill and knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** The shift towards a qualitative economy focused on human development and well-being.

**RAY PEAT:** "While the economists showed the value of investing in traditional schools, the returns would be greater, and the costs smaller, if we began to apply thought and knowledge to understanding the learning process better. The useful part of education is that which stimulates the imagination. The useful part of knowledge is that which expands human possibilities. If the biosphere continues to be degraded, human possibilities will be stunted, at best."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for improving education by understanding the learning process and the impact of environmental degradation on human possibilities.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think we have to start seeing jobs in resource-extraction as an index of poverty, to the extent that they degrade the biosphere. A definition of wealth must consider both quantity and quality of production. Environmentalists and ecologists have to do some intelligent thinking about economics, so they can help the people in power to think more realistically."
**CONTEXT:** Redefining wealth to include ecological health and the role of environmentalists in economic discourse.

**RAY PEAT:** "The greatest fraud now current in the mass media is the idea that we must choose between the health of our environment and the vitality of the economy or our standard of living. Just as competition from Japan and Germany is causing big corporations to move quickly to get out of the weapons business and to reinvest in the consumer economy, the present anti-environmental direction of our economy depends on relatively few decisions made by big corporations (and supported by their agents in government). Since they can get away with making stupid decisions, they make them."
**CONTEXT:** The false dichotomy between environmental health and economic vitality, and the role of corporate decisions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The stylish science-talk about global warming doesn't really take very much into account, beyond a few cultural stereotypes. The most important context to take into account is the importance of moving toward an economy which develops qualitatively rather than quantitatively. There is no foreseeable limit to the qualitative development of the economy. If we can shift from an extractive-degradative economy to one which develops by investing in education, science, culture, and human well-being, we will have a future in which to discover whether the biosphere-noosphere has any limits to its developmental potential."
**CONTEXT:** The need for a qualitative economic development focused on human well-being and the potential of the biosphere-noosphere.

**RAY PEAT:** "An emphasis on energy is rapidly gaining acceptance in biology, if not in medicine. Just twenty years ago, many biologists denied that Atkinson's idea of the cellular 'energy charge' had meaning or relevance for living systems, but the idea is now widely recognized, and most biologists would probably admit that it has at least some relevance for some situations. In this section, I discuss some of the practical consequences and applications of the idea that we should focus on the role of energy in biological adaptation. Energy, in an important sense, is prior to information, especially in the context of biology."
**CONTEXT:** The growing recognition of the cellular "energy charge" and its importance in biological adaptation.

**RAY PEAT:** "For many cells, the threshold for excitation (and response) is governed by the energy charge of the cell. This is clearest in the case of brain cells: seizures can be produced by either hypoxia or hypoglycemia, and in the low energy state of hypothyroidism, deep normal sleep is seldom possible. Muscle cells, secretory cells, and immune cells behave similarly. I believe we are at the beginning of a therapeutic revolution based on this, and other closely related principles. It is easiest to understand these relationships if we use a graph, with 'energy charge' on one axis, and with 'intensity of stimulation' on the other. This graph represents the relationship of an organism to its environment, or of a cell or tissue to its (internal) environment (Figure 1)."
**CONTEXT:** The relationship between cellular energy charge, excitation thresholds, and the organism's interaction with its environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The regions labeled with A, B, C, and D can be thought of, for the sake of illustration, as the following functional states of the organism: A -- Adventure, B -- A baby sleeping, C -- Cautious conserving of energy, D -- Stressed to death."
**CONTEXT:** Illustrative functional states of the organism based on energy charge and stimulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ideal therapy is one which restores the cellular energy thoroughly, so the organism regains its full capacity to adapt, and seeks appropriate stimulation. Good nutrition and sleep are sufficient therapy for a healthy young organism. For old or sick organisms, artificial sleep and special nutrition can be useful. The use of sedatives to produce an 'artificial coma' is an old technique which is now being used more often to treat drowning victims and other brain-injured patients."
**CONTEXT:** The principles of ideal therapy focusing on restoring cellular energy and the use of sedatives for recovery.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sedation or anesthesia decreases the use of energy, making it possible to recover a store of energy, and the efficient, relaxed state of readiness that goes with an adequate reserve of energy. Thyroid and other hormones can increase the rate at which energy is produced, but some of the steroid hormones also have the sedative and anesthetic actions which provide the other aspect of recovery: while production of energy increases, wasteful use decreases."
**CONTEXT:** The dual role of sedation/anesthesia and hormones in energy recovery.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of the 'therapeutic vector' means that any treatment should combine preservation of energy with restoration of energy production. Shock, which is a state of suppressed energy production, can be used to illustrate this approach."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of the "therapeutic vector" for preserving and restoring energy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several times in the last 50 years great advances were made in understanding the nature of shock, but they tend to be ignored or forgotten. I think this is because our medical culture has lacked a unifying principle which would integrate physiology and biochemistry into a functional whole."
**CONTEXT:** The historical neglect of shock research due to a lack of unifying principles in medicine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Under extreme conditions, the state of shock can develop. Blood circulation becomes so inefficient that the organism often dies from the shock state itself. It has been traditional to administer adrenalin to shock patients to raise their blood pressure, but adrenalin is often already present at a high level, and more can simply exacerbate the problem. This is because the arterioles contract in shock, and under the influence of adrenalin (and cortisone)."
**CONTEXT:** The pathophysiology of shock and the counterproductive use of adrenalin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Early in Hans Selye's study of the steroids, he noticed that estrogen treatment causes the same changes which occur in the shock phase of the stress reaction. Many years later I noticed that oxygen deprivation causes the same biochemical changes that occur with an estrogen excess, and with old age, and I proposed that estrogen acts by interfering with the use of oxygen. In the mid-1940s a group of researchers, believing that energy depletion was the basic cause of shock, demonstrated that intravenous injection of the 'energy molecule' ATP caused animals to recover which otherwise would have died from shock."
**CONTEXT:** The link between estrogen, oxygen deprivation, aging, and the therapeutic potential of ATP in shock.

**RAY PEAT:** "ATP isn't the sort of chemical that is likely to interest the pharmaceutical industry, and although other people have demonstrated that it has therapeutic value in a variety of diseases, the dominant attitude has been to scoff that it is 'only a vasodilator.' But the tone of smooth muscle in blood vessels is largely a function of the energy charge of the muscle cell. Thus, intravenous glucose can restore the balance between the muscle tone of arteries and veins, and it has been used many times to bring patients out of shock. If a physician is focusing on his patient's extremely low blood pressure, a vasodilator is the last thing he would consider, and salt water is often preferred in place of glucose, but restoring energy should be the basic aim."
**CONTEXT:** The therapeutic value of ATP and glucose in shock, and the pharmaceutical industry's dismissal of their energy-restoring properties.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the blood vessels at the left side of Figure 2, the arterioles are in the high energy resting state, while the veins are in the middle, active zone. On the right, the arterioles are receiving 'depleted' blood, lacking oxygen or sugar for example, and so are now in the middle energy, active state. Passing through the capillaries, most of the blood's remaining oxygen and nutrients are extracted by the tissue cells, leaving only minimal energy supplies for the veins, which are therefore in the lowest energy state, 'protective inhibition,' in which there is no muscle tone."
**CONTEXT:** The relationship between vascular tone and cellular energy charge, explaining the shock state.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides helping to explain the shock state itself, this relationship of vascular tone to cellular energy helps to explain the circulatory distress which is associated with fatigue, old age, hypothyroidism, and estrogen excess."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between vascular tone, cellular energy, and conditions like fatigue, aging, hypothyroidism, and estrogen excess.

**RAY PEAT:** "Bacterial endotoxin causes some of the same effects as adrenalin. When stress reduces circulation to the bowel, causing injury to the barrier function of the intestinal cells, endotoxin can enter the blood, contributing to a shock state, with further impairment of circulation. In old age and in 'winter sickness,' something like a chronic borderline state of shock can develop. Intravenous glucose has been used successfully to bring patients out of septic shock. The tonic effects of intravenous local anesthetics are, I think, largely the result of their ability to open the arterioles. Magnesium and vitamin A also have some ability to normalize blood vessel tone, and can help to maintain the barrier function of the bowel."
**CONTEXT:** Endotoxin, stress, bowel barrier function, and the use of glucose and other nutrients in shock and related conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Whether a tissue is hyperactive or underactive, it is possible that a systemic energy deficit is responsible. Symptomatic relief is rational if it is consistent with restoration of energy."
**CONTEXT:** Systemic energy deficit as a potential cause of tissue dysfunction.

**RAY PEAT:** "Glucose is often thought of as the most direct source of energy, but other substances are apparently used even more easily. 'Ketones' (for example, alpha-keto- or hydroxy-butyrate) are used more easily, at least in some circumstances. Short and medium chain fatty acids are used more easily than glucose, and it is apparently this fact which accounts for their presence in milk. Their effects on cells--induction of hormone receptors and other specialized cell functions, suppression of stress-induced enzymes, stimulation of energy production in fat cells, inhibition of cancer cell division and viral expression, etc.--are what we would expect of an ideal energy source. Unfortunately, commercial milk animals are fed large amounts of grain, the oils of which act in opposition to the short and medium chain fats. Some tropical fruits and coconut oil provide some of these efficient and protective energy sources. As little as one or two teaspoonfuls of coconut oil per day appears to have a strong protective effect against obesity and cancer."
**CONTEXT:** The superior energy utilization of ketones and short/medium chain fatty acids, and the protective effects of coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "This type of molecule might be the most common carbon compound in the universe. It is made by single celled organisms, by plants, and by animals, and has many kinds of function. The steroid hormones are involved in all aspects of animal physiology, and overlap with control functions of the nervous system, peptide hormones, metabolites, prostaglandins, cyclic nucleotides, etc. Sometimes people speak of 'steroids' when they mean glucocorticoids such as cortisol or a synthetic like dexamethasone, or, among athletes, when they mean anabolic steroids or synthetic androgens; and so it is common to associate 'steroids' with harmful side effects. All foods contain steroids and sterols (a major type, containing an alcohol group and a side-chain) some of which are beneficial and some of which are toxic or allergenic."
**CONTEXT:** The ubiquity and diverse functions of steroids, and the common negative associations with the term.

**RAY PEAT:** "In animals, cholesterol is the basic sterol molecule, which is massively converted into other substances, including the steroid hormones. Thyroid hormone and vitamin A are required for this conversion. The first step occurs in the energy-producing mitochondrion, where cholesterol loses its side-chain and is slightly oxidized, producing pregnenolone. Being less fat soluble than cholesterol, pregnenolone leaves the mitochondrion, so it can't inhibit its own synthesis. Rather, it seems to stimulate its own synthesis, though this isn't as clearly established as in the case of progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, requiring thyroid hormone and vitamin A.

**RAY PEAT:** "Depending on the tissue, pregnenolone will be converted by enzymes in the cytoplasm into either progesterone or DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone). The fact that progesterone (and probably pregnenolone) stimulates its own synthesis means that taking it does not suppress the body's ability to synthesize it, as happens with cortisol. Sometimes, one dose or a few doses can restore the body's ability to produce enough of its own."
**CONTEXT:** The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone or DHEA, and its self-stimulating synthesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone also allows the thyroid gland to secrete its hormones, especially when the thyroid function has been inhibited by estrogen. Since the thyroid hormone is needed to produce progesterone, a supplement of either tends to normalize both thyroid and progesterone production."
**CONTEXT:** The synergistic relationship between progesterone and thyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone and DHEA are the precursors for the other more specialized steroid hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone (sodium-retaining hormone), estrogen, and testosterone. The formation of these other hormones is tightly regulated, so that taking the precursor will correct a deficiency of a specialized hormone, but will not create an excess. At least in the case of progesterone, an excess tends to balance or neutralize an excess of the specialized hormone, so it has been described as having anti-androgenic, anti-estrogen, anti-aldosterone, and anti-cortisol functions."
**CONTEXT:** Progesterone and DHEA as precursors and progesterone's balancing effects on other steroid hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many steroids have a protective ('catatoxic') action against a wide variety of poisons. Some of the quick effects (e.g., within 10 minutes) of progesterone and pregnenolone probably represent a catatoxic action, as well as a neutralizing or balancing of excessive estrogen or cortisol. Improved metabolic efficiency, sparing oxygen and glucose, will have a quick effect in reducing edema."
**CONTEXT:** The catatoxic and metabolic efficiency-enhancing effects of progesterone and pregnenolone.

**RAY PEAT:** "During pregnancy, very large amounts of progesterone are made. It protects and stabilizes practically all functions of both the mother and the fetus. Progesterone, glucose and the thyroid hormones powerfully influence the brain development and intelligence of the baby, probably by influencing both the number and the size of brain cells, and the quality of their functioning."
**CONTEXT:** The crucial role of progesterone, glucose, and thyroid hormones in fetal brain development.

**RAY PEAT:** "Part of progesterone's protective effect is a result of its quieting effect on cells. For example, it tends to prevent seizure activity in brain cells. During childbirth, its normal function is to act as an anesthetic. When the level of estrogen is too high, progesterone can't achieve this effect. In a non-pregnant person, it is important to determine the minimum effective dose by taking only a few drops at a time, and repeating this small dose about every 20 minutes until symptoms have been controlled. Otherwise, serious 'drunkenness' can be produced, with loss of coordination, and even unconsciousness."
**CONTEXT:** Progesterone's calming effects, anesthetic properties, and the importance of careful dosing.

**RAY PEAT:** "The only solvent for progesterone which isn't toxic and which will dissolve an effective quantity, is vitamin E. In this form, it can be absorbed through the skin or other membranes, or can be taken orally. Taken orally, it is absorbed as chylomicrons, going into the general circulation (as vitamin E does), instead of to the liver where it would be prepared for excretion. In this form, therefore, it is fully and quickly available to all tissues. It is approximately 20 times more powerful in its action than other preparations, so it is important to use it in physiological quantities, rather than in the huge doses commonly given rectally or by injection. Ten or 20 mg. is often an effective dose, though people with low thyroid or high estrogen sometimes use 50 to 100 mg. per day. In the customary 10% solution, one drop contains about 3 mg. progesterone, and 1 ml. (1/4 tsp.) contains 100 mg. The first dose should never be more than 15 mg."
**CONTEXT:** The optimal formulation and dosage of progesterone using vitamin E as a solvent.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pregnenolone, taken orally, does nothing noticeable to a healthy animal or person, but if the stress-related hormones are elevated, they return to normal when pregnenolone is taken. The brain contains much more pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone than do other organs or the blood, and these levels decrease progressively with age. Older people are more likely to feel an effect from pregnenolone, than are young people. A tenth of a gram is a reasonable first dose, though some people seem to need as much as 1 gram per day."
**CONTEXT:** The effects of pregnenolone, its role in stress hormone regulation, and its age-related decline.

**RAY PEAT:** "Measuring the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood isn't a good way to evaluate adequacy of thyroid function, since the response of tissues to the hormone can be suppressed (for example, by unsaturated fats)."
**CONTEXT:** The limitations of blood tests for assessing thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1930's accurate diagnosis was made by evaluating a variety of indications, including basal oxygen consumption, serum cholesterol level, pulse rate, temperature, carotenemia, bowel function, and quality of hair and skin. A good estimate can be made using only the temperature and pulse rate."
**CONTEXT:** Historical methods for diagnosing thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Oral or armpit temperature, in the morning before getting out of bed, should be around 98° F, and it should rise to 98.6° by mid-morning. This is not valid if you sleep under an electric blanket, or if the weather is hot and humid. A person who is hypothyroid produces heat at a low rate, but doesn't lose it at the normal rate, since there is less sweating, and the skin is relatively cool. Many hypothyroid people compensate with high adrenalin production (sometimes 40 times higher than normal), and this tends to keep the skin cool, especially on the hands, feet, and nose. The high adrenalin is the consequence of low blood glucose, so a feeding of carbohydrate, such as a glass of orange juice, will sometimes lower the pulse rate momentarily. Healthy populations have an average resting pulse rate of about 85 per minute. Especially in hot weather it is useful to consider both temperature and pulse rate."
**CONTEXT:** Practical methods for assessing thyroid function through temperature and pulse rate.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Achilles tendon reflex is another quick way to estimate thyroid function. This reflex is used because of the insignificant weight of the toes in relation to contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. The T (repolarization) wave on the electrocardiogram is a similar indicator of the rate of energy production. Thumping the Achilles tendon causes the muscle to contract (unless it is already in a semi-contracted state, which isn't uncommon). The contraction consumes energy, and the muscle can't relax until enough energy has been produced to restore the threshold and the readiness for a new contraction."
**CONTEXT:** The Achilles tendon reflex as an indicator of thyroid function and energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** "If energy production is efficient, relaxation is faster than the passive return motion of the foot, so the foot swings freely back to its original position, and over-shoots slightly, causing a slight swinging action. In hypothyroidism, the foot returns as if controlled by a pneumatic door-closer, and settles slowly and precisely into its relaxed position, sometimes with a hesitating, intermittent motion. This slow replenishment of energy, and slow relaxation, can cause muscles to cramp easily. The aching leg muscles of children at the end of an active day are often a sign of hypothyroidism, and sometimes the gastrocnemius muscle becomes very swollen and hypertrophied in hypothyroid children. The same process, of slow energy regeneration, can cause rhythm disturbance in the heart, and often causes insomnia and restless sleep."
**CONTEXT:** The manifestation of hypothyroidism in the Achilles reflex, muscle cramping, and cardiac rhythm disturbances.

**RAY PEAT:** "The thyroid gland secretes about 3 parts of thyroxin to one part of triiodothyronine, and this allows the liver to regulate thyroid function, by converting more of the T4 to the active T3 when there is an abundance of energy. Glucose is essential for the conversion, so during fasting there is a sharp decrease in metabolic rate, and in experiments, 200 or 300 calories of carbohydrates can be added to the diet without causing fat storage."
**CONTEXT:** The thyroid hormone conversion process and the role of glucose and fasting.

**RAY PEAT:** "When the liver is the main cause of hypothyroidism, your temperature (and especially the temperature of your nose, hands and feet) will fall when you are hungry, and will rise when you eat carbohydrates. If a hypothyroid person has a very slow pulse, and feels lethargic, it seems that there is little adrenalin; in this case, a feeding of carbohydrate is likely to increase both the pulse rate and the temperature, as the liver is permitted to form the active T3 hormone."
**CONTEXT:** Liver dysfunction as a cause of hypothyroidism and the impact of carbohydrates on temperature and pulse.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women often have above-average thyroxin, with symptoms of hypothyroidism. This is apparently because it isn't being converted to the active form (T3). Before using a Cytomel (T3) supplement, it might be possible to solve the problem with diet alone. A piece of fruit or a glass of juice or milk between meals, and adequate animal protein (or potato protein) in the diet is sometimes enough to allow the liver to produce the hormone. If Cytomel is used, it is efficient to approximate the physiological rate of T3 formation, by nibbling one (10 or 25 mcg.) tablet during the day. When a large amount is taken at one time, the liver is likely to convert much of it to the inactive reverse-T3 form, in a normal defensive response."
**CONTEXT:** Hypothyroidism in women, T3 conversion, and the use of Cytomel.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women normally have less active livers than men do. Estrogen can have a directly toxic effect on the liver, but the normal reason for the difference is probably that temperature and thyroid function strongly influence the liver, and are generally lower in women than in men. Estrogen inhibits the secretion of hormone by the thyroid gland itself, probably by inhibiting the proteolytic enzyme which dissolves the colloid. Progesterone has the opposite effect, promoting the release of the hormones from the gland. At puberty, in pregnancy, and at menopause, the thyroid gland often enlarges, probably as a result of estrogen dominance."
**CONTEXT:** Estrogen's impact on liver and thyroid function, and progesterone's supportive role.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid function stimulates the liver to inactivate estrogen for excretion, so estrogen dominance can create a vicious circle, in which excess estrogen (or deficient progesterone) blocks thyroid secretion, causing the liver to allow estrogen to accumulate to even higher levels. Progesterone (even one dose, in some cases) can break the cycle. However, if the gland is very big, the person can experience a few months of hyperthyroidism, as the gland returns to normal. It is better to allow the enlarged gland to shrink more slowly by using a thyroid supplement. If an enlarged gland does begin to secrete too much thyroid hormone, it can be controlled with tablets of propylthiouracil, or even with raw cabbage or cabbage juice, and cysteine-rich meats, including liver."
**CONTEXT:** The vicious cycle of estrogen dominance, thyroid suppression, and the role of progesterone and thyroid supplements in breaking it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides fasting, or chronic protein deficiency, the common causes of hypothyroidism are excessive stress or 'aerobic' (i.e., anaerobic) exercise, and diets containing beans, lentils, nuts, unsaturated fats (including carotene), and undercooked broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, or mustard greens. Many health conscious people become hypothyroid with a synergistic program of undercooked vegetables, legumes instead of animal proteins, oils instead of butter, carotene instead of vitamin A, and breathless exercise instead of a stimulating life."
**CONTEXT:** Common causes of hypothyroidism, including diet, exercise, and stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Cortisol begins to rise as soon as there is darkness, regardless of sleep or waking. Artificial light, and its absence, clearly can determine the time at which cortisol begins to rise."
**CONTEXT:** The relationship between darkness, artificial light, and cortisol levels.

**RAY PEAT:** "Falling glucose is the signal for cortisol to rise. Dreams are closely associated with the chemical-physiological mobilization in response to low blood glucose. (Rising adrenalin probably mediates the cortisol response to decreasing glucose.)"
**CONTEXT:** The role of falling glucose and adrenalin in cortisol release and dream states.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sleep minimizes the increase of cortisol. The inhibitory, sleep inducing brain chemicals, GABA and the sleep peptide, have a quieting, anti-stress effect even during waking stress. Sleep (and the inhibitory chemicals) reduce energy expenditures, conserving glucose."
**CONTEXT:** The cortisol-reducing and energy-conserving effects of sleep and inhibitory brain chemicals.

**RAY PEAT:** "The mitochondria, by their ability to use oxygen, are responsible for the normal efficient use of glucose."
**CONTEXT:** The role of mitochondria in efficient glucose utilization.

**RAY PEAT:** "Beginning at sunset, darkness progressively damages mitochondria structurally and functionally. Mitochondrial damage, and the functional impairment of organs such as the heart muscle, reach a peak at dawn. During the day (in organisms which survive the night), mitochondrial structure is restored, and organ function improves, with the peak being reached at sunset. In winter, there is cumulative damage to mitochondria, because of too few daylight hours to complete the rebuilding of mitochondria. During the summer (in organisms that live long enough) the cumulative damage is mostly repaired. A residue of altered cell and tissue structure, and of impaired enzyme function, remains under natural conditions of day-night cycles."
**CONTEXT:** The damaging effects of darkness on mitochondria and the restorative cycle of daylight.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the dark of polar winter, ordinary artificial light provides some protection during the 16 hours when it is used, but during the dark hours when lights are off, healthy young people show the darkness-related signs that normally occur in older people, such as an accelerated pulse. Although direct sunlight damages skin, people generally are healthier in proportion to their exposure to sunlight."
**CONTEXT:** The protective effects of artificial light and the paradox of sunlight's dual role.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ultraviolet and blue light produce free radicals in living material, but they penetrate only a few millimeters into tissue. Yellow, orange, red, and infrared rays penetrate much more deeply."
**CONTEXT:** The differential penetration of light wavelengths into tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** "Small organisms are able to set their biorhythms by a very weak light. Only bright lights can alter human rhythms. For example, the cycle of body temperature can be changed, or the rhythmic secretion of melatonin can be suppressed by lights stronger than 2500 lux."
**CONTEXT:** The influence of light intensity on human biorhythms and hormone secretion.

**RAY PEAT:** "Three common biological pigments are able to absorb the penetrating red light: Biliverdin, blue copper proteins, and melanin."
**CONTEXT:** Biological pigments that absorb penetrating red light.

**RAY PEAT:** "The presence of melanin in nerves suggests that it should be considered as a candidate for the pigment which allows light entrainment of rhythmic melatonin secretion."
**CONTEXT:** Melanin's potential role in light entrainment of melatonin secretion.

**RAY PEAT:** "The presence of copper proteins in every cell, and in the mitochondria, suggests that they should be candidates for the red light receptor which promotes respiratory function and restoration of the mitochondria."
**CONTEXT:** Copper proteins as potential red light receptors for mitochondrial function.

**RAY PEAT:** "The presence of copper in the crucial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, is of the greatest interest."
**CONTEXT:** The significance of copper in cytochrome oxidase.

**RAY PEAT:** "Both copper and light appear to be involved in other aspects of respiration, including cyanide detoxification, and possibly even in activation of the thyroid hormone."
**CONTEXT:** The involvement of copper and light in respiration, detoxification, and thyroid activation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides darkness, hypoxia and overload stress (which is relative hypoxia, in a sense) are the main things which damage mitochondria. Inhibitory analogs of GABA appear to be protective in all types of stress. The anesthetic steroids, such as progesterone, pregnenolone (and possibly DHEA), also protect against injury by stress, and probably work by some of the same energy-sparing mechanisms."
**CONTEXT:** Mitochondrial damage from darkness, hypoxia, and stress, and the protective roles of GABA and steroid hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "Anti-dark-stress substances would tend to minimize nocturnal hypoglycemia by various mechanisms, including the inhibition of insulin secretion. Acetylcholine and estrogen stimulate insulin secretion, so cholinolytics (e.g., atropine) and anti-estrogens (e.g., progesterone and DHEA) would tend to inhibit it, and GABA helps by causing insulin uptake by red blood cells."
**CONTEXT:** Mechanisms for minimizing nocturnal hypoglycemia and the role of various substances in insulin regulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Both living at a high elevation and having high thyroid function increase the quantity of mitochondria in cells, and this increase appears to be fairly permanent. Pretreatment with thyroid hormone or with a time at high altitude increases the ability to resist stress."
**CONTEXT:** The effects of high elevation and thyroid function on mitochondrial quantity and stress resistance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Living at high elevation or having high thyroid function also increases the vascularity of tissues, that is, the number of capillaries per unit of tissue, and increases the quantity of blood in the tissue, protecting against hypoxia."
**CONTEXT:** Increased vascularity and blood supply as benefits of high elevation and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Avoiding excessive intake of unsaturated fatty acids and iron will decrease the damage caused by unavoidable stress (including darkness)."
**CONTEXT:** Dietary strategies to mitigate stress-induced damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Analogs of the inhibitory nerve transmitter, GABA, protect against damage to the mitochondria in the natural way that sleep does, minimizing the injury caused by cortisol. Milk and various fruits contain close analogs of GABA, some of which specifically block formation of the catabolic stress enzymes."
**CONTEXT:** GABA analogs, sleep, and their protective effects against stress and mitochondrial damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "To the extent that nocturnal stress resembles shock, taking some extra salt at bed-time is logical. It lowers adrenalin, and tends to increase blood volume. In hypoxic stress, tissue retains water, and increasing the sodium content of the blood opposes that tendency. It is often a remedy for insomnia."
**CONTEXT:** The use of salt at bedtime for nocturnal stress, insomnia, and hypoxic conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Penetrating red light is possibly the fundamental anti-stress factor for all organisms. The chronic deficiency of such light is, I think, the best explanation for the deterioration which occurs with aging. Enzyme changes, free radical changes, structural and respiratory changes are all involved as consequences of darkness stress."
**CONTEXT:** Red light as a fundamental anti-stress factor and its role in aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "During the winter when there isn't enough sunlight, it is helpful to use several hundred watts of incandescent lights. If bulbs with internal reflectors are used, 500 or 600 watts can be bright enough to have a protective biological effect."
**CONTEXT:** The use of incandescent lighting to mitigate the effects of winter darkness.

**RAY PEAT:** "My interest in pregnenolone was the result of an accident. I had been experimenting with the solubility of various steroids. I found that pregnenolone isn't very soluble in vitamin E, and I saved the bottle containing vitamin E and pregnenolone to use as a vitamin E supplement. I had another bottle of pure vitamin E."
**CONTEXT:** The accidental discovery of pregnenolone's benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1983, the ocean current called El Nino caused Oregon's weather to stay cloudy and rainy through the summer. I didn't have my usual summer recovery from 'winter sickness,' and by November I was becoming very sick. During a two week trip I felt perfectly well, but except for that short time I kept getting sicker and sicker (with inflammation of arteries, dental abscesses, asthma, migraines, and colitis). Lying in bed one day trying to understand what had happened during that two-week trip, I remembered that I had used the vitamin E containing a residue of pregnenolone on the trip, but used pure vitamin E after I got home. I immediately got out of bed and took a pinch of pregnenolone. In about an hour, all of my symptoms had stopped, and for over a week I was healthy and energetic. But then I got sick again, and was so distracted by the pain that it was several days before I remembered the pregnenolone. Another pinch had the same dramatic sudden effect. Since then I have taken some almost every day. While I was sick I had pictures made for a passport, but they looked so odd that I got several more. The best of those, the least haggard looking, is reproduced here."
**CONTEXT:** Personal experience with pregnenolone's dramatic improvement of multiple health issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pregnenolone is known to be produced (in the mitochondria) from cholesterol. This is the first stage in the production of all of the steroid hormones. If pregnenolone synthesis is insufficient, supplementary pregnenolone would help to maintain an optimum level of the various other steroids. Aging, stress, depression, hypothyroidism, and exposure to toxins are conditions in which synthesis of pregnenolone might be inadequate."
**CONTEXT:** Pregnenolone's role as a precursor to steroid hormones and conditions affecting its synthesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1944 factory workers were given daily doses of pregnenolone and, on alternate weeks, a placebo. During the pregnenolone weeks, their piece-work output was significantly higher. Healthy young people who are not under stress do not feel anything from taking even a very large dose (e.g., one gram), and no changes have been detected in blood glucose, proteins, amino acids, or salts. The urine apparently contains more conjugated steroids (indicated by an increased tendency to foam) after taking a large dose of pregnenolone; I think light is the main factor normally causing changes in the conjugated steroid content of urine."
**CONTEXT:** Pregnenolone's effects on work output and its interaction with light.

**RAY PEAT:** "The skin and the brain are important sites of steroid synthesis, and they are usually ignored by endocrinologists investigating steroid hormones. Papa and Kligman (1965) showed that adding pregnenolone or progesterone topically to skin would restore youthful properties to aged skin. I think DHEA gives similar results, and (like progesterone) is more easily absorbed than pregnenolone. Both progesterone and pregnenolone seem to improve the efficiency of blood circulation. I have seen grey-skinned depressed people turn pink and start smiling shortly after taking pregnenolone."
**CONTEXT:** Topical application of pregnenolone and progesterone for skin rejuvenation and their effects on circulation and mood.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 1950, pregnenolone was tested on several people with exophthalmia from Graves’ disease, and it was reported that their eyes quickly receded toward a more normal position in their sockets. Having read this, I mentioned it to a desperate woman with horribly bulging eyes. Her left eyeball was about 50% exposed, and the other one was less extreme, but still seriously protuberant. She took some pregnenolone as we talked, and within an hour it seemed to me that her eyes were receding. An hour after she took the pregnenolone, she said her eyes were feeling much better. I left her city early the next morning, but she telephoned me the next day and claimed that her eyes were completely normal. Without seeing her, I don't know exactly what she meant by 'normal.' This happened over two years ago, and I hope to visit her city soon to see whether her eyes really became, and stayed, normal."
**CONTEXT:** Pregnenolone's potential efficacy in reducing exophthalmia associated with Graves' disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "For many years it has been known that steroids, including cholesterol, have an anti-toxic effect. The cytochrome P-450 family of enzymes are an important factor in our resistance to toxins. Moderate amounts of cortisol promote this system, but larger amounts degrade it. Pregnenolone doesn't affect the rate of synthesis of these enzymes, but it stabilizes them against the normal proteolytic enzymes, increasing their activity. I believe this stabilizing action is a general feature of these steroids, explaining other anti-toxic effects such as blocking hemolysis, and probably many features of growth and differentiation, including control of cell division and prevention of atrophy."
**CONTEXT:** Steroids, cytochrome P-450, and pregnenolone's stabilizing and anti-toxic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Largely because of Albert Szent-Gyorgyi's explorations in biological pigments as factors in cell-regulation and immunity, I have paid special attention to several pigments, such as melanin, the black or brown pigment of hair and skin, of injured potatoes, and of certain fungi, when damaged. When I lived in Montana, I knew many people whose hair became grey in their late 20s; I wondered whether it was caused by low thyroid, by an odd mineral balance, by frequent chilling of the skin and scalp, or maybe just by their lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. In Mexico, people in warm, humid tropical areas seldom lost their pigment. When I heard Carl Pfeiffer speak, I noticed that both his skin and his hair were free of pigment, though he was not an albino, and I wondered whether his various mineral nutritional supplements had contributed to his fading. (He took sulfur every day, and avoided copper. He also advocated the use of molybdenum as a nutritional supplement.)"
**CONTEXT:** The role of melanin, thyroid, minerals, and diet in hair pigmentation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Until I was 4 or 5, my hair was white, and I took it as a humiliating stigma of sexual immaturity; in fact, everyone tends to darken as they grow up, especially around puberty. Many people have wondered what function the melanin in frogs’ eggs might have, and a few years ago someone demonstrated that it is what binds progesterone in the egg, and suggested that it might have a similar function in other animals and other cells."
**CONTEXT:** Melanin's potential role in binding progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "A Japanese researcher found that each hair color is associated with a certain pattern of several trace minerals. When he removed all the trace minerals, every type of hair became white. When he added a characteristic pattern of trace minerals, associated with a particular hair color, to a sample of demineralized hair, the color which was produced corresponded to the minerals added, and not to what the original color of the hair had been. He concluded that people inherit a tendency to concentrate certain minerals in their hair."
**CONTEXT:** The role of trace minerals in hair color and inherited tendencies.

**RAY PEAT:** "People who studied the effects of steroids on aging skin found that the steroids which reversed structural age changes in the skin (progesterone, testosterone, pregnenolone) sometimes restored hair growth. Occasionally, the hair that grew was pigmented. Estrogen and cortisone accelerated the structural changes of aging in the skin, but their effects on hair were not mentioned. Vitamin A has anti-estrogen effects in skin and other tissues, and part of this effect might result from its ability to promote synthesis of pregnenolone and progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** Steroids, vitamin A, and their effects on skin aging and hair growth/pigmentation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Physicians have mentioned that a depigmented spot sometimes appears in the skin over an area where they have injected cortisone. The familiar association of severe stress with sudden greying of the hair also would suggest that excessive cortisone destroys melanin. The average stress caused by a particular climate would probably combine with any other factors that are involved in regions where there is more or less white hair than average."
**CONTEXT:** Cortisone, stress, and their impact on melanin and hair color.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think oxygen wastage is a central event in aging. Just as a cut potato requires oxygen to make melanin, so do our tissues. Iron tends to keep accumulating in our tissues with aging, and iron appears to be a factor in wasting oxygen (especially in age pigment). When oxygen is deficient, iron becomes very toxic. Copper is involved in a process which restores iron to its non-toxic form."
**CONTEXT:** Oxygen wastage, iron, copper, and their roles in aging and melanin production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin C in excess can contribute to the toxicity of iron, but in the right amount, vitamin C is metabolically linked with vitamin E in protecting against the toxic free radicals produced by iron. Vitamin A also functions as an anti-oxidant, when the amount of oxygen present is very low--which is when iron toxicity is at its worst."
**CONTEXT:** The roles of vitamins C, E, and A in protecting against iron toxicity and free radicals.

**RAY PEAT:** "Someone suspected that copper accelerated aging by causing free radical reactions, and fed a chelator (gluconic acid) to animals, and extended their lives by 10 or 12%. In his next experiment, he fed them both the chelator and extra copper, thinking he would counteract the life extension, but these animals lived 22% longer. He next fed copper alone, and found that it extended the life-span by about 11%, so its effect was additive with that of the chelator. I suspect the chelator was removing iron, and maybe other toxic metals. At a dose about 50 times larger than normal, copper did shorten the life-span by several percent."
**CONTEXT:** The complex effects of copper and chelators on lifespan, suggesting iron removal is key.

**RAY PEAT:** "Black sheep will produce white wool if they are fed an excess of molybdenum. This is supposedly caused by a displacement of copper. I think we probably accumulate too much of the wrong metals, such as iron, with aging and stress."
**CONTEXT:** Molybdenum's effect on wool color and the accumulation of toxic metals with aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "I had some eyebrow hairs that were pure white; when one matured and fell out, another white one would replace it. They grow quickly, and have a short life cycle, so they are nice to experiment with."
**CONTEXT:** Using eyebrow hairs for experimentation due to their rapid growth cycle.

**RAY PEAT:** "I went on a very low iron diet, eating mostly milk, with some eggs, cheese, and citrus fruit, but with very little meat for several weeks. I cooked eggs in a copper pan, to increase my copper intake and to avoid iron absorbed from an iron pan. I found a source of vitamin A without preservative, and began using large amounts of that, which I had not done for several years because of an allergy to the preservative. I increased my doses of DHEA and pregnenolone. Usually on alternate days, I would rub vitamin A and vitamin E (sometimes with DHEA), or a solution of copper acetate, into the skin around the white hairs. Within a few weeks, the bottom of one of the white hairs had begun to darken (Figure 1--the hair on the right). Another hair (the center one) came out a couple of weeks later, and was darkened along about half of its length. The third hair (on the left) came out two or three weeks later, and was all black except for 3 millimeters at the tip, which had begun growing about the time the other two were changing color. It has been about two months since I stopped cooking regularly in copper (the taste gets very tiresome), and none of the hairs has reverted to white. (The black lines were about 2 mm. apart; they allow both colors to be seen in the xerox copy.) The fine tops of the hairs end at lines 8, 9, and 7, going from left to right; each hair has a few mm. of intermediate light brown, which doesn't reproduce well."
**CONTEXT:** A personal experiment demonstrating hair color restoration through diet, copper, vitamin A, DHEA, and pregnenolone.

**RAY PEAT:** "A very healthy 71 year-old man was under his house repairing the foundation, when a support slipped and let the house fall far enough to break some facial bones. During his recovery, he developed arthritis in his hands. It is fairly common for arthritis to appear shortly after an accident, a shock, or surgery, and Hans Selye's famous work with rats shows that when stress exhausts the adrenal glands (so they are unable to produce normal amounts of cortisone and related steroid hormones), arthritis and other 'degenerative' diseases are likely to develop."
**CONTEXT:** The link between stress, adrenal exhaustion, and the development of arthritis.

**RAY PEAT:** "But when this man went to his doctor to 'get something for his arthritis,' he was annoyed that the doctor insisted on giving him a complete physical exam, and wouldn't give him a shot of cortisone. The examination showed low thyroid function, and the doctor prescribed a supplement of thyroid extract, explaining that arthritis is one of the many symptoms of hypothyroidism. The patient agreed to take the thyroid, but for several days he grumbled about the doctor 'fixing something that wasn't wrong' with him, and ignoring his arthritis. But in less than two weeks, the arthritis had entirely disappeared. He lived to be 89, without a recurrence of arthritis. (He died iatrogenically, while in good health.)"
**CONTEXT:** The successful treatment of arthritis with thyroid extract, highlighting the importance of addressing underlying hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Selye's work with the diseases of stress, and the anti-stress hormones of the adrenal cortex, helped many scientists to think more clearly about the interaction of the organism with its environment, but it has led others to focus too narrowly on hormones of the adrenal cortex (such as cortisol and cortisone), and to forget the older knowledge about natural resistance. There are probably only a few physicians now practicing who would remember to check for hypothyroidism in an arthritis patient, or in other stress-related conditions. Hypothyroidism is a common cause of adrenal insufficiency, but it also has some direct effects on joint tissues. In chronic hypothyroidism (myxedema and cretinism), knees and elbows are often bent abnormally."
**CONTEXT:** The limitations of Selye's stress theory and the overlooked role of hypothyroidism in arthritis.

**RAY PEAT:** "By the 1930's, it was well established that the resistance of the organism depended on the energy produced by respiration under the influence of the thyroid gland, as well as on the adrenal hormones, and that the hormones of pregnancy (especially progesterone) could substitute for the adrenal hormones. In a sense, the thyroid hormone is the basic anti-stress hormone, since it is required for the production of the adrenal and pregnancy hormones."
**CONTEXT:** The foundational role of thyroid hormone in stress resistance and hormone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "A contemporary researcher, F. Z. Meerson, is putting together a picture of the biological processes involved in adapting to stress, including energy production, nutrition, hormones, and changes in cell structure."
**CONTEXT:** Meerson's research on stress adaptation.

**RAY PEAT:** "While one of Selye's earliest observations related gastrointestinal bleeding to stress, Meerson's work has revealed in a detailed way how the usually beneficial hormone of adaptation, cortisone, can cause so many other harmful effects when its action is too prolonged or too intense."
**CONTEXT:** The dual nature of cortisone as both beneficial and harmful depending on its duration and intensity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of the harmful effects of the cortisone class of drugs (other than gastro-intestinal bleeding) are: Hypertension, osteoporosis, delayed healing, atrophy of the skin, convulsions, cataracts, glaucoma, protruding eyes, psychic derangements, menstrual irregularities, and loss of immunity allowing infections (or cancer) to spread. While normal thyroid function is required for the secretion of the adrenal hormones, the basic signal which causes cortisone to be formed is a drop in the blood glucose level. The increased energy requirement of any stress tends to cause the blood sugar to fall slightly, but hypothyroidism itself tends to depress blood sugar."
**CONTEXT:** The extensive side effects of cortisone and the role of blood glucose and hypothyroidism in its production.

**RAY PEAT:** "The person with low thyroid function is more likely than a normal person to require cortisone to cope with a certain amount of stress. However, if large amounts of cortisone are produced for a long time, the toxic effects of the hormone begin to appear. According to Meerson, heart attacks are provoked and aggravated by the cortisone produced during stress. (Meerson and his colleagues have demonstrated that the progress of a heart attack can be halted by a treatment including natural substances such as vitamin E and magnesium.)"
**CONTEXT:** The increased need for cortisone in hypothyroidism and its link to heart attacks.

**RAY PEAT:** "While hypothyroidism makes the body require more cortisone to sustain blood sugar and energy production, it also limits the ability to produce cortisone, so in some cases stress produces symptoms resulting from a deficiency of cortisone, including various forms of arthritis and more generalized types of chronic inflammation."
**CONTEXT:** Hypothyroidism's dual impact on cortisone requirements and production, leading to deficiency symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** "Often, a small physiological dose of natural hydrocortisone can help the patient meet the stress, without causing harmful side-effects. While treating the symptoms with cortisone for a short time, it is important to try to learn the basic cause of the problem, by checking for hypothyroidism, vitamin A deficiency, protein deficiency, a lack of sunlight, etc. (I suspect that light on the skin directly increases the skin's production of steroids, without depending on other organs. Different steroids probably involve different frequencies of light, but orange and red light seem to be important frequencies.) Using cortisone in this way, physiologically rather than pharmacologically, it is not likely to cause the serious problems mentioned above."
**CONTEXT:** Physiological use of hydrocortisone and the importance of identifying underlying causes of stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress-induced cortisone deficiency is thought to be a factor in a great variety of unpleasant conditions, from allergies to ulcerative colitis, and in many forms of arthritis. The stress which can cause a cortisone deficiency is even more likely to disturb formation of progesterone and thyroid hormone, so the fact that cortisone can relieve symptoms does not mean that it has corrected the problem."
**CONTEXT:** Stress-induced cortisone deficiency and its impact on progesterone and thyroid hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "According to the Physicians’ Desk Reference, hormones similar to cortisone are useful for treating rheumatoid arthritis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, synovitis of osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute and subacute bursitis, and epicondylitis."
**CONTEXT:** The broad application of cortisone-like hormones in treating various forms of arthritis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although cortisone supplementation can help in a great variety of stress-related diseases, no cure will take place unless the basic cause is discovered. Besides the thyroid, the other class of adaptive hormones which are often out of balance in the diseases of stress, is the group of hormones produced mainly by the gonads: the 'reproductive hormones.' During pregnancy these hormones serve to protect the developing baby from the stresses suffered by the mother, but the same hormones function as part to the protective anti-stress system in the non-pregnant individual, though at a lower level."
**CONTEXT:** The role of reproductive hormones as anti-stress agents and their importance in pregnancy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some forms of arthritis are known to improve or even to disappear during pregnancy. As mentioned above, the hormones of pregnancy can make up for a lack of adrenal cortex hormones. During a healthy pregnancy, many hormones are present in increased amounts, including the thyroid hormones. Progesterone, which is the most abundant hormone of pregnancy, has both anti-inflammatory and anesthetic actions, which would be of obvious benefit in arthritis."
**CONTEXT:** The ameliorating effects of pregnancy on arthritis, linked to increased hormone levels, particularly progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are other protective hormones which are increased during pregnancy. These include DHEA, which is being studied for its anti-aging, anti-cancer, and anti-obesity effects. (One of the reasons that is frequently given for the fact that this hormone hasn't been studied more widely is that, as a natural substance, it has not been monopolized by a drug patent, and so no drug company has been willing to invest money in studying its medical uses.) Some of these hormones also have the ability to control cell division, which would be important in forms of arthritis that involve invasive tissue growth. Since DHEA can be easily metabolized into testosterone (by the skin, for example), and into estrogen, I don't think it should ever be administered alone, without an approximately natural balance of pregnenolone and progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** The potential of DHEA and the importance of hormonal balance.

**RAY PEAT:** "While these substances, so abundant in pregnancy, have the ability to substitute for cortisone, they can also be used by the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and related hormones. But probably the most surprising property of these natural steroids is that they protect against the toxic side-effects of excessive adrenal hormones. And they seem to have no side-effects of their own; after about fifty years of medical use, no toxic side effects have been found for progesterone or pregnenolone."
**CONTEXT:** Natural steroids' protective effects against excessive adrenal hormones and their lack of side effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pregnenolone is the material the body uses to form either progesterone or DHEA. Other natural hormones, including DHEA, haven't been studied for so long, but the high levels which are normally present in healthy people would suggest that replacement doses, to restore those normal levels, would not be likely to produce toxic side effects. And, considering the terrible side effects of the drugs that are now widely used, these drugs would be justifiable simply to prevent some of the toxic effects of conventional treatment. Especially during pregnancy, it would seem logical to use the natural hormones and to avoid toxic drugs."
**CONTEXT:** The safety and rationale for using natural hormones like pregnenolone and DHEA.

**RAY PEAT:** "It takes a new way of thinking to understand that these protective substances protect against an excess of the adrenal steroids, as well as making up for a deficiency. Several of these natural hormones also have a protective action against various poisons--Selye called this their 'catatoxic' effect."
**CONTEXT:** The dual protective role of natural hormones against both deficiency and excess of adrenal steroids.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides many people whose arthritis improved with only thyroid supplementation, I have seen more than 30 people use one or more of these other natural hormones for various types of arthritis, usually with a topical application. Often the pain is relieved within a few minutes. I know of several other people who used progesterone topically for inflamed tendons, damaged cartilage, or other inflammations. Only one of these, a woman with rheumatoid arthritis in many joints, had no significant improvement. An hour after she had applied it to her hands and feet, she enthusiastically reported that her ankle had stopped hurting, but after this she said she had no noticeable improvement. (I applied it the first time, but I never saw her again, and I suspect she didn't apply it as thoroughly as I had, mixing it with oil at the time of application.)"
**CONTEXT:** Topical application of natural hormones for arthritis and inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "We often hear that 'there is no cure for arthritis, because the causes are not known.' If the cause is an imbalance in the normal hormones of adaptation and resistance, then eliminating the cause by restoring balance will produce a true cure."
**CONTEXT:** Restoring hormonal balance as a cure for arthritis.

**RAY PEAT:** "But if it is more profitable to sell powerful drugs than to sell the nutrients needed to form natural hormones (or to supplement those natural hormones) we can't expect the drug companies to spend any money investigating that sort of cure. And at present the arthritis market amounts to billions of dollars in drug sales each year. A drug company representative recently told me that a substance which cures arthritis isn't a desirable product; a good drug (from his company's point of view) is one that has to be used for the rest of the patient's life."
**CONTEXT:** The economic disincentive for pharmaceutical companies to pursue cures for arthritis.

**RAY PEAT:** "When a physician chooses the most profitable diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to a health problem, it is likely to be considered fraudulent if the doctor is a chiropractor, but not if the doctor is a surgeon. If a naturopath tells you that bed rest is the best treatment for a ruptured spinal disc, surgeons will warn you about the dangers of quackery, but the research clearly shows that, for safety and efficacy, surgery is distinctly inferior to bed rest."
**CONTEXT:** The hypocrisy in labeling certain medical practices as fraudulent while accepting others that are less effective.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are many other situations in which doing nothing, or using a more conservative treatment, is clearly superior to the standard medical or surgical treatment, but the medical industry has learned how to control public opinion by manipulating the mass media."
**CONTEXT:** The medical industry's control of public opinion regarding treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** "By consulting with thousands of women who believed they had a hormone imbalance of some sort that their physicians couldn't identify, I began to see several clusters of symptoms that responded immediately to a rational nutritional and hormonal anti-stress program. One of these clusters might be called Subtle Constellation of Absorbed-Mucoprotein-related signs and symptoms, or possibly sub-clinical myxedema, though neither term is likely to be widely adopted in the medical community."
**CONTEXT:** Identifying symptom clusters related to hormone imbalance and sub-clinical myxedema.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women are several times more likely than men to have 'thyroid disease,' simply because estrogen tends to block thyroid function. Estrogen-induced thyroid hypo-function can be compensated to some degree by various hormonal adjustments; elevated secretion of adrenalin and cortisol are common. When the compensation is inadequate, there will often be hypoglycemia and a tendency to form too much histamine. Too much adrenalin will cause cold hands and feet, too little will cause orthostatic hypotension (blacking out when you stand up too quickly) and bowel spasms, for example."
**CONTEXT:** Estrogen's role in thyroid dysfunction and the compensatory hormonal responses.

**RAY PEAT:** "Various water-binding glycoproteins are formed under the influence of hormones or stress, but whatever proteins are in the blood, including albumin, will show up outside the blood vessels, around the tissue cells, when the blood vessels become leaky. Low thyroid, high estrogen, and high histamine are known to increase the permeability of blood vessels."
**CONTEXT:** The formation of water-binding glycoproteins and increased blood vessel permeability due to hormonal imbalances.

**RAY PEAT:** "Patients who have myxedema typically have mitral valve prolapse, and at autopsy it can be seen that the valve is thickened into a jelly-like mass. Many women with the premenstrual syndrome have a mitral valve heart murmur premenstrually, but not at other times of the month. The jelly can be formed and removed fairly quickly."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between myxedema, mitral valve prolapse, and the premenstrual syndrome.

**RAY PEAT:** "Old text-books on the thyroid gland often listed emphysema as a symptom of myxedema. When rats are given a large injection of estrogen, the oxygenation of blood in their lungs is sharply decreased in less than an hour. Although it is not common to test oxygen diffusion in humans, I know of two women in the same family who showed very poor pulmonary oxygen diffusion after they were put on high doses of estrogen. (Since estrogen inhibits thyroid secretion, and hypothyroidism is associated with elevated estrogen, they should be considered together.) Leakage of proteins from capillaries in the lungs is probably responsible for the decreased diffusion, by thickening the layer through which the oxygen must diffuse."
**CONTEXT:** Estrogen's impact on pulmonary oxygen diffusion and its link to hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "When myxedema exists in childhood, the cartilage in joints swells, and is deformed, causing a characteristic knock-kneed appearance. In a milder form, the swelling can cause joint pain that doesn't involve the characteristic inflammation of arthritis. In a mild form, the calf muscles tend to swell after prolonged activity; the 'growing pains' that are so common around the beginning of puberty are probably the result of a temporary hypothyroid edema of the leg muscles."
**CONTEXT:** Childhood myxedema and its effects on joints and muscles.

**RAY PEAT:** "When a tendon swells, it is sometimes the result of a local injury or of a particular over-use of a muscle, and in these cases local treatment can sometimes produce a permanent cure. But when the problem keeps recurring, or keeps showing up in different areas, there is probably a general hormonal problem."
**CONTEXT:** Distinguishing local tendon issues from systemic hormonal problems.

**RAY PEAT:** "When a tendon in the wrist swells, it can cause numbness in the hand, by pressing on a nerve which passes through the carpal tunnel with some tendons. The tunnel is formed by a ligament that holds the tendons in place, and swelling of the ligament itself can contribute to compression of the nerve. Even the connective tissue that forms the nerve sheath itself can swell. Many people with undiagnosed hypothyroidism complain that they 'have poor circulation,' and that their hands and feet go to sleep easily. These are two separate (but related) problems that can be relieved through a nutritional and hormonal anti-stress program."
**CONTEXT:** Carpal tunnel syndrome, hypothyroidism, and circulatory issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Low thyroid people often have cold hands and feet, and they often have nerves that are over-sensitive to compression. Poor oxygenation is involved in edema, both as cause and consequence. (I discuss this in more detail in 'A Unifying Principle,' chapter 7.) Thus, swelling can cause compression and nerve injury in a way that is exacerbated by certain postures or repetitive movements. The medical industry's tendency to treat the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome by surgery or local cortisone injections is often counterproductive, since it doesn't address the underlying hormonal imbalance. Glaucoma, a swelling of the jelly inside the eye, seems to result from a hormonal imbalance, since it can be relieved quickly by a natural hormone. Graves' disease, in which the muscles behind the eyes swell, can also be aided by similar treatments. In addition, 'epilepsy' and symptoms ascribed to 'multiple sclerosis' have been relieved by natural anti-stress and anti-edema hormones."
**CONTEXT:** The underlying causes of carpal tunnel syndrome, glaucoma, Graves' disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, and their relief through hormonal and nutritional approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "For at least 80 years, a syndrome of premenstrual tension has been recognized and considered to be the result of an ovarian hormone imbalance. As early as 1912, Armour & Co. was selling desiccated corpus luteum for use in cases of ovarian failure, and said that it 'prevents nervous symptoms accompanying' menstrual abnormalities. (New and Nonofficial Remedies, 1912, Supplement, pages 158, 160.) It was also used to treat obesity and other physical conditions sometimes associated with 'ovarian deficiency.'"
**CONTEXT:** Historical recognition of premenstrual tension as an ovarian hormone imbalance.

**RAY PEAT:** "By the 1930s, when the specific ovarian steroids were identified, there was a clear consensus that estrogen and progesterone were involved in the syndrome, but there was some confusion over the question of whether the cause was high estrogen or low progesterone. It seems to have been French endocrinologists who pointed out that either high estrogen or low progesterone can cause the typical cyclic premenstrual symptoms, since it is the ratio of estrogen to progesterone which determines the nature of the physiological response. By the mid-1930s pure progesterone was on the market in the United States and Europe, and was widely used to treat problems of pregnancy, menopause, dysmenorrhea, and the premenstrual syndrome."
**CONTEXT:** The consensus on estrogen and progesterone imbalance in PMS and the early use of progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although it has been only in the last 20 years that animal studies of the behavioral effects of the steroid hormones have become subtle enough to explain their role in emotions, depression, aggression, etc., the more physical dangers of excessive or unopposed estrogen were clearly recognized by the late 1930s and the early 1940
