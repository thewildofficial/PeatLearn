**RAY PEAT:** A few years ago, someone found that yellowing deciduous leaves in the fall were in a state of protein catabolism. I have discussed how this parallels the "toxic" effect of night and winter on animals; the darkness damages mitochondria, and red light seems to be the most effective frequency in restoring their function. The observation that cortisone begins to rise (in humans) when lights are turned out, rather than when people begin to sleep, nicely fits with the rabbit mitochondria studies and the autumn leaves: either the cortisone causes the damage, or, more probably, the mitochondrial inefficiency wastes glucose, and increased adrenalin, cortisone—and dreaming—are responses to hypoglycemia.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between darkness, mitochondrial function, and hormonal responses?

**RAY PEAT:** At the moment, I am working on the idea that potato plants, which do not normally produce seeds, can be induced to do so by blue (and other high frequency) light—at least when grown in acidic soil which provides iron or other heavy metals which tend to generate free radicals. This idea is a kind of generalization of the idea I first heard around 1953, from an old forester who knew that a coneless pine tree could be caused to produce a heavy crop of seed by injuring it with an ax. There are many other examples of the same process, such as grass which produces seed early when the weather is dry. The many toxic effects of estrogen caused me to interpret its effects (for example, rapid cell division in the uterus) as another example of the same process. In the 1940s, people often talked about famine causing extremely early fertility in girls; although it wasn’t much discussed at that time, starvation (and other stress) does cause an elevation of estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** How does light frequency and environmental stress relate to plant reproduction and hormonal responses?

**RAY PEAT:** Since Albert Szent-Györgyi died, I have been thinking about his idea that the "Hopkins electron pool," stored in cellular proteins, provides the energy for cell division. Around 1972, someone reported that sunlight shining on dark hair induces free radicals, and that these free radicals persist for hours in darkness. But exposure to red light "quenches" the free radicals within seconds.

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of cellular proteins and light in energy storage and free radical activity?

**RAY PEAT:** My idea of the "toxicity" of darkness is that free radicals (produced by metabolism, or maybe by cosmic rays) accumulate with time, but that the red component of light normally quenches them. In darkness, the excess of excited electrons would begin to spread beyond their safe storage system and to cause toxic effects, such as oxygen wastage. Many toxins and stressors are known to act through a common pathway of free-radical damage; this accounts for the generalized protective effects of certain substances, such as vitamin E (as discussed by Meyerson in Ray Peat’s Newsletter #29).

**CONTEXT:** How does darkness contribute to toxicity, and what is the role of red light in mitigating this?

**RAY PEAT:** One of the most sensitive tests for estrogen’s effect is the reduction of a dye (called TTC) by tissue and whole cells; it is reduced (theoretically) by various "dehydrogenases." (The Hopkins electron pool was called by E. Racker "nothing dehydrogenase"). Progesterone blocks estrogen’s effects on this dye. Since a similar dye has been used to measure the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), it seems that the superoxide radical can reduce the dye. Whatever the source of the electrons, estrogen and progesterone act in different directions on their availability.

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen and progesterone affect cellular dye reduction, and what is the potential link to superoxide radicals?

**RAY PEAT:** Progesterone is known to inhibit cell division in various situations: in the uterine endometrium, in cancer, and in frogs’ eggs. Several years ago, someone found that the progesterone in frogs’ eggs was bound to the melanin—whose function in the eggs was never understood. (Though Szent-Györgyi for many years emphasized that pigments often exist invisibly inside organisms, and probably have electronic-metabolic functions, rather than the decorative function usually associated with pigments). Melanin generally exists as a complex with proteins. If the energy for cell division is stored in proteins, and if progesterone is acting on the eggs to inhibit cell division, and is bound to the melanin—which is known to store electronic excitation—then maybe progesterone is acting to prevent the escape of energy from the protein-melanin system. If it does this generally, that could explain its very general "catatoxic" effects.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed mechanism by which progesterone inhibits cell division, and how might melanin be involved?

**RAY PEAT:** It was around 1954 that I first found some potato fruits, and hoped to get viable seeds with which to grow new strains of potato. Around that time, John Ott found that squash plants he was photographing with pink artificial light produced only male flowers. The next season he used bluish artificial lights, and his plant produced only female flowers. Later, he found that night blooming plants such as the Morning Glory, could keep blooming if exposed to blue light, but when they were exposed to pinkish light their blooms collapsed.

**CONTEXT:** How did light spectrum experiments with plants reveal effects on flowering and reproductive development?

**RAY PEAT:** All of this seems to be converging on the idea that the female reproductive tissues are activated by a free-radical or excited electron promitotic system. But beyond that, it seems to have clear implications for aging, stress, toxicity, energy, tissue repair, regeneration, etc. The key idea is that biological structure and biological energy are delicately linked and balanced even at the finest—molecular and submolecular—levels.

**CONTEXT:** What is the overarching principle connecting light, free radicals, and fundamental biological processes like aging and regeneration?
