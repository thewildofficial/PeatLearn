**RAY PEAT:** "If you suddenly increase your sodium intake, your body will take a day or two to adjust, and during that time you will retain a little extra water, but after the short adjustment time, you lose sodium at the same rate that you take it in. Under the influence of excess estrogen, your body retains extra water, and it is your appetite center which should balance that water by making you crave extra salt. If you learn to avoid salty foods at those times (or if you take a diuretic), your blood can't carry as much water as when it has enough salt, and so the salt stays in the tissues, rather than being carried to the kidneys. Tom Brewer demonstrated the importance of eating enough salt during pregnancy, to maintain adequate blood volume. When salt is restricted during pregnancy, the inadequate blood volume doesn't carry enough oxygen and food to the uterus to allow full development of the baby, and the kidneys secrete a hormone to increase the circulation, creating a tendency toward high blood pressure. Following Brewer's research, I saw that extra sodium should help in other situations involving circulatory inefficiency. Premenstrual edema, insomnia, and even high blood pressure often respond very well to a little extra sodium in the diet. One of the most important effects of sodium is that it tends to spare magnesium, which is likely to be lost during stress and hypothyroidism. If we eat salty foods when we crave them, we are able to retain our magnesium more easily. Sodium also helps to regulate blood sugar, for example by improving its absorption from the intestine. There is even evidence that sodium can spare protein, since, if there isn't enough sodium to excrete into the urine to balance acids, the kidneys will waste protein to produce ammonium as an ionic substitute for sodium. But I think the most important point to remember is that it is essential for maintaining adequate blood volume, and that it is almost always unphysiological and irrational to restrict sodium intake, because reduced blood volume tends to reduce the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all tissues, leading to many problems. The emotional tension many people feel when they crave salt is, in some cases, the result of increased adrenalin, reflecting a real biological problem."
**CONTEXT:** Discussion on the role of salt in the body, particularly in relation to estrogen and blood volume.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several years ago, the death of a young physician from blood clots, while she was using a linseed oil supplement, caused me to realize the urgency of getting more information on the toxicity of unsaturated oils into an easily understandable form. While I was writing my dissertation, more than 20 years ago, I saw that there was already abundant research on their toxicity, but commercial propaganda for the "health benefits" of the "good unsaturated oils" (from seeds, nuts, and fish) had caused many people to overlook their harmful effects. At that time, it was clear that they promoted cancer, heart disease, and various degenerative diseases, and even premature aging. Agricultural research had demonstrated that they promoted obesity, and biochemists could demonstrate a specific interference with our most essential respiratory enzymes. Although I knew of experiments in which rats grew fat according to the degree of unsaturation of the fats in their diet, regardless of quantity, and grew lean in proportion to the percentage of (relatively saturated) coconut oil in their diet, again regardless of quantity, I didn't get around to making practical use of these facts until I had spent several months reading the whole history of research on the biological effects of dietary fats."
**CONTEXT:** Introduction to the toxicity of unsaturated oils and their link to various diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of "essential fatty acids" (sometimes called "vitamin F") appeared in the 1930s, as a result of tests in which rats developed a skin disease on a fat-free diet, and recovered from the skin disease when fed unsaturated fats. (Other researchers at that time observed that the rats became hypermetabolic on the fat-free diet, as though they were taking thyroid hormone; it was later discovered that the unsaturated fats inhibit the secretion and transport of thyroid hormones, and block the ability of tissues to respond to them.) Shortly after the concept of "essential fatty acids" was proposed, another group recognized the rats' skin disease as the typical changes produced by a vitamin B6 deficiency. They fed rats a fat-diet until the symptoms appeared, then cured the disease with a vitamin B6 supplement, without any of the supposedly essential fatty acids. The high metabolic rate of the rats, on a diet without the inhibitory oils, made them eat more, and they needed more vitamins as well as more calories. The high metabolic rate of animals fed coconut oil simply reflects the fact that coconut oil doesn't contain a toxic amount of the anti-thyroid, anti-respiratory unsaturated fatty acids."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of the "essential fatty acid" concept and its relation to vitamin B6 deficiency and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Americans have a lower metabolic rate than some other cultures, and the result is that obesity is a major problem in this country. Since farmers had demonstrated that coconut oil (though it is cheap) was not good for fattening their animals--it made them lean and hungry--and since cancer researchers showed it could lower the incidence of cancer, I began adding it to my diet. At first I noticed that I felt warmer after eating it, as if I had taken a thyroid supplement. Then I noticed that I was losing weight, while eating more calories than normal, because of adding about an ounce of coconut oil to my usual diet. After several months, I leveled off at a weight about 15 pounds lower than my "normal" weight of the previous 26 years. As some of friends learned what I was doing, they began eating coconut oil, with the same results. The biochemical basis seems clear: The easily oxidized short and medium-chain saturated fatty acids of coconut oil provide a source of energy that protects our tissues against the toxic inhibitory effects of the unsaturated fatty acids, and reduces their anti-thyroid effects. The animal studies of the last 60 years suggest that these effects also provide protection against cancer, heart disease, and premature aging. Other effects that can be expected include protection against excessive blood clotting, protection of the fetal brain, protection against various stress-induced problems including epilepsy, and some degree of protection against sun-damage of the skin."
**CONTEXT:** Personal experience and biochemical explanation for the benefits of coconut oil, linking it to metabolic rate, weight loss, and protection against various diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** "While the use of coconut oil makes it possible to go longer without eating, because its pro-thyroid effect increases the liver's ability to store glycogen, frequent snacks are still important for helping to lose weight, or to prevent weight-gain. The mechanism is partly that smaller meals cause less insulin to be secreted, and insulin turns on the fat storage process, and increases appetite. Another important mechanism is that the liver provides about 70% of our active thyroid hormone, by converting thyroxine to T3, but it can provide this active hormone only when it has adequate glucose. Frequent snacks--for example, sipping a few ounces of orange juice about every hour—keeps the T3 level up by providing glucose to the liver. (Snacks shouldn't consist of protein by itself, since protein stimulates insulin, but not T3, secretion.)"
**CONTEXT:** The role of frequent snacks and glucose in maintaining thyroid hormone levels and aiding weight management.

**RAY PEAT:** "When | have observed that estrogen does things to consciousness and behavior, as well as to the body, | have heard these responses: if you say submissiveness is hormonal you are setting the women's movement back a century; if estrogen interferes with memory, then why don't IQ tests show women to be less intelligent than men? and so on. First, | want to call attention to a hidden assumption, namely, that "biological is equivalent to genetic." That is not true, they are not equivalent, but geneticists have been remarkably effective in convincing the public, and the granting agencies, that biology is ultimately nothing more than genetics. A typical argument for that equivalence goes like this: "if you say that an organism is more than its DNA you are a Lamarckian, and possibly even a Stalinist, and those ideas were disapproved by Weismann, who cut the tails off several generations of mice and showed that it didn't influence the inheritance of tails." If you have fallen for that argument (which is repeated from grade school to graduate school), read Zamenhof and A.E. Needham (and their references) on the transgenerational effects of diet and environment. Genetics developed in a context of "social Darwinism", and still has an ideological bias: consider K. Lorenz and G. Stent."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of the reductionist view of biology as solely genetic, emphasizing the influence of diet and environment on transgenerational effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Second, | want to point out that men produce estrogen, especially under stress such as starvation or alcoholism or liver damage. In a famine, men may even lactate. Third, on the question of IQ tests, Dalton has shown that women who are suffering from an excess of estrogen do worse in both mental and physical performance than when their hormones are in balance. Women are not distinguished from men only by having more estrogen, as many people (including doctors) seem to believe. Quantitatively, progesterone is the main female hormone, and progesterone improves brain structure and function. The primary male hormone, testosterone, has chemical and functional properties of both estrogen and progesterone; this combined function gives males a short-term stability (fewer goiters, migraines, etc.) but a lack of adaptiveness in the longer range (higher mortality in infancy and old age). The placenta is a central factor in the development of the brain, but there is very little known about possible differences between males' and females’ placentas, and their effects on such things as the greater mortality of male fetuses and the greater variability of males' intelligence."
**CONTEXT:** Discussion on estrogen production in men, the impact of estrogen excess on women's performance, and the comparative roles of progesterone and testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen does block memory, according to animal studies as well as clinical experience: many of the women | see (especially if they have used birth control pills, have had special social problems, have eaten a vegetarian or soybean-rich diet, and if they have lived in a cloudy region) have very poor memory and a "foggy feeling in their head." High estrogen during pregnancy causes fetal brain damage and retardation. Too much unsaturated vegetable oil during pregnancy has the same effect. Both of these interfere with energy production: wasting oxygen, altering the effects of thyroid hormones, etc."
**CONTEXT:** The negative impact of estrogen on memory and fetal brain development, linking it to birth control pills, diet, and unsaturated oils.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen is the hormone for beginnings, a sort of biochemical eraser which can eliminate recently recorded information, restoring the underlying primitive capacity for growth. When we are threatened, by injury or aging, we need the capacity for renewal of cells. Estrogen promotes production of prolactin, a protein hormone, and its close analog, growth hormone. Ionizing radiation, aging, and oxygen deprivation all cause biochemical changes similar to those produced by estrogen. Excessive estrogen (and the prolactin excess it induces) can be dangerous. A few biologists are talking about a "death hormone" which appears in the pituitary at puberty — | suspect prolactin (or another estrogen-induced peptide) is the hormone producing the effects they see. In salamanders, prolactin initiates the process of limb regeneration. Various cancers depend on estrogen and prolactin. A variety of substances promote tumefaction, lump formation, growth without differentiation. Rather than being hormones of death, | think of these as "renewal hormones," hormones of potential immortality. Anything which produces tissue atrophy will tend to produce cancer. The important question is, what will induce differentiation and useful function in cancer cells? There are many substances which promote differentiation and oppose the effects of estrogen, and some of these have been found to be useful in cancer therapy. Among the substances opposing estrogen are dopamine and nickel, prolactin inhibitors; chalones, the tissue specific proteins which inhibit cell division (and possibly more ephemerally, the peptides of memory); the aprotic solvents, DMF and possibly DMSO; progesterone and testosterone; thyroxin and iodine; magnesium ATP, the stable form of the "biological energy" molecule; vitamin A, a protein-sparing nutrient which promotes differentiation, and vitamin E (and the closely related coenzyme Q, or ubiquinone)."
**CONTEXT:** Estrogen's role as a "renewal hormone," its connection to prolactin and growth hormone, and substances that oppose its effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "What does it mean to be biologically integrated with our environment, or with our experiences of it? For one thing, it doesn't imply a closed perfect timeless system; everything evolves. We have enough integration and consistency that we can survive, but an essential feature of the environment is that it is open and unlimited. When our environment shrinks, when there isn't enough food, we can adapt, for example by replacing muscle with fat and by having small-brained babies (the brain is an expensive organ, energetically, though its efficiency increases with its expense). When our environment meets our needs our brains and muscles expand. The lower leg (like the brain) is a good indicator of environmental support: parents who grew up in a population which has atrophied-looking lower legs can have children with beautifully developed legs, when milk becomes abundantly available. Boas (1912) recorded first generation changes in head shape in the children of immigrants. Brain size is likewise very rapidly increased with a good diet (or, in rats at least, with a more interesting life)."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of biological integration with the environment and how environmental support influences physical and brain development.

**RAY PEAT:** "The brain (and especially its frontal tissue) is like a window onto both present and past environments. It saves as much as it can of past environments, but particularly, it saves those aspects of the environment which seem favorable, which hint at abundance and possibility. The frontal lobes of the brain are like the mainspring of a clock: in "hyperkinetic" people, in some psychotic and some lobotomized people, the mainspring — the energy storing system — is broken or weak: the clock will tick only when shaken. The individual with a defective mental energy storage system might dash around keeping his mind stimulated, or it might be that coffee or other nerve stimulants will raise the level of energy to the point that quiet integration becomes possible. The persistence of attention from one situation to another makes generalization and discovery possible. Given a favorable environment, the passage of time leads to the accumulation of awareness, to the discovery of new aspects of the environment, new ways of living; it leads to doing things more intelligently."
**CONTEXT:** The role of the frontal lobes in processing environmental information and the impact of energy storage on cognitive function.

**RAY PEAT:** "This can be said in physical and biochemical terms: if a shrinking environment doesn't interfere, the passage of time leads to a brain state which is both more energetic and more efficient. Vital stains show that these energetic changes go with structural changes in the cytoplasm, such that high energy efficient metabolism occurs when the cytoplasm has affinity for oily dyes. When water is at a surface it is ordered or structured so that it loses much of its wetness; a bug can walk on it; it contains more heat (or is colder for a given amount of heat). Water is unusual in its capacity for internal structural modification, and for its heat capacity. During cell division, muscle contraction, and nerve stimulation, there is a release of heat (followed by an uptake of heat as the muscle or nerve recovers) which cannot be accounted for by any known chemical change. Its order decreases with increasing temperature, unless order is introduced by other substances. (The brain has used and exaggerated these properties of water.) Biological and environmental influences can modify these substances so that the cell water undergoes a "phase transition," analogous to the melting of ice. Muscle contraction, nerve conduction, synthetic and secretory activity, etc., appear to be regulated by these phase changes. Cooperative, or holistic, changes of cells and tissues are easier to understand from this integrated point of view, than from the conventional molecular and atomistic viewpoint."
**CONTEXT:** The biophysical properties of water within cells and their role in regulating biological processes, suggesting a holistic approach to understanding cellular function.

**RAY PEAT:** "These changes in the "solvent," or the intracellular medium, will alter chemical reactions — by modifying enzymes and by "sequestering" classes of chemicals, much as the aprotic solvents, DMF and DMSO, speed and alter reactivity. Following these "solvent" changes, we should expect the chemical consequences to amplify or "institutionalize" those changes. For example, proteins could be modified to produce appropriate patterns of "memory molecules" and "endorphins" (protein fragments having actions similar to morphine) and chalones. Patterns of excitation become stabilized as knowledge, and as developmental modifications of tissue: growth and aging and their ramifications. An excess of estrogen, or other factors interfering with proteolysis, could block the capacity to experience. The difficulty of recalling dreams probably relates to this synthetic (non-proteolytic) parasympathetic dominance during sleep."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of intracellular medium changes on chemical reactions, protein modification, and the potential for estrogen to interfere with the capacity to experience.

**RAY PEAT:** "The accumulation of aspects of the environment in our tissue, modifying our tissue's functioning and its affinity for various substances, is a short-time analog for the general upward drift of evolution, and it has presently known and distinct links with inheritance: hormonal influences pass both ways across the placenta, and maternal efficiency determines the supply of nutrients — e.g., sugar — to the fetus. "Lingering modifications," transgenerational influences of the environment, are visible in a great variety of organisms and organs, but it is in the brain — the environmental organ — that these Lamarckian effects are so visible and so crucial. If we think of the organism as an accumulation of its past environments, we must keep in mind that the accumulation is always occurring as the residue of the past strives to grasp (and to form) new environments. We do not willingly enter and conform ourselves to an undesirable environment."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of environmental accumulation in tissues, its link to evolution and inheritance, and the role of the brain as an "environmental organ."

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress will cause a rise in estrogen and a loss of anti-estrogens such as thyroid, progesterone, and (in men) testosterone. Male apes who are bullied have decreased levels of testosterone, and this effect persists long after their environment has improved. The stress of subjugation seems to lead to an adaptation of passivity. Their passivity prevents further injury, but we don't know how stressful their continuing submission is. Hans Selye found that the adrenals are a major component of our adaptive system. In the first phase of stress, there is a shock reaction (with changes resembling those of estrogen dominance), with injury to various tissues. In the second phase, the adrenals protect the animal, and this protection continues until something is exhausted. By exposing rats to a preliminary stress, Selye found that he could induce adaptation to other, later stresses — a kind of immunization to stress. About 1957, psychologists noticed that a rat could "learn helplessness": if they held a rat until it stopped struggling, it would then die much sooner than a normal rat does when put into a barrel of water. They also found that they could "immunize" their rats against learned helplessness, by previously allowing them to experience success in a similar situation. The short-term learned helplessness apparently does something to block the efficient use of energy, so that the animal dies of exhaustion very easily, i.e., it has depleted one source of energy without mobilizing another."
**CONTEXT:** The hormonal and physiological effects of stress, including the role of estrogen, testosterone, and adrenal hormones, and the concept of learned helplessness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Energetically, the estrogen-dominated metabolic state is less efficient than the oxidative state which is dominated by thyroid and progesterone (or testosterone). The estrogen state, like the rats' state of learned helplessness, is "parasympathetic," in the sense that many chemical balances have moved away from the mobilized "sympathetic" or adrenergic state. The estrogen state, for example, depresses blood sugar, while the mobilized state spares glucose by oxidizing fat."
**CONTEXT:** Comparison of the metabolic efficiency of estrogen-dominated states versus oxidative states, and their relation to blood sugar regulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since the rats can be "immunized" against becoming helpless during restraint, by previously experiencing success, it seems that something more is involved than Selye's pre-conditioning. It seems to be the meaning of the particular experience of restraint that affects the animals' capacity to struggle. The perception of possibility, of a vista that extends convincingly toward a better future life, seems to modify the metabolic apparatus. Drowning rats, it happens, will drown before they discover the liberating possibilities. Successful struggle takes a little while to get organized. | suspect that life in a rat-box was an essential factor in those experiments, and that a life of reasonable opportunity would prevent such learning of helplessness."
**CONTEXT:** The psychological and metabolic impact of perceived possibility and opportunity on stress adaptation and learned helplessness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Men can be habitually passive, and can also have an excess of estrogen, so | am not implying (when | talk about the estrogenic state) either that the male sex is necessarily the source of human oppression nor that women invite their own subjugation by a hormonal predisposition. | do want to suggest that the hormonal conditions for easy subjugation are alterable, within the individual, from generation to generation and that better social conditions can improve our physiologies. High estrogen traits can be both acquired and passed on to offspring, as discovered by L.C. Strong in his mice, and as confirmed recently in rats that were stressed during pregnancy. | also want to point out that, within some privileged classes, women as well as men seem to actively promote their own role of passivity, relative to their men, probably because they sense that their position (and their children's) is threatened by widespread social and sexual change. Of course, men of various classes also encourage their women to be dependent, but my point is that historical and class processes are involved, and must be understood by those who want to improve human relationships. J.W. Prescott showed that, in all the societies he investigated, an inferior status for women was associated with sexual repression, self-mutilation, mystical-religious attitudes, militarism, and a hierarchical class system. Prescott suggests a two-state system in the brain, such that people do all those unpleasant things when they grow up deprived of pleasure. Interestingly, forty years earlier J.D. Unwin, a Freudian anthropologist who (unlike Prescott) favored repression, militarism, etc., came to the same conclusions. Behavior affects the hormones, and hormones influence behavior. Life in a rat-box society makes brains grow smaller, and makes people do the things that maintain the oppressive conditions. Nutritional and hormonal social intervention can change this."
**CONTEXT:** The interplay of hormones, social conditions, and behavior, and how these factors can contribute to passivity and oppression, with a focus on the potential for intervention.

**RAY PEAT:** "The first time | took enough desiccated thyroid to make my heart speed noticeably, there was a pleasure pushing up from my abdomen through my chest, making me want to smile and laugh. When | have watched suicidal women using thyroid or progesterone, there is a transformation (under an hour with progesterone, a few hours or longer with thyroid) from weeping to smiling and laughing; they speak of unbearable pain being replaced by pleasure. Women who have had orgasms while taking thyroid have lost their sexual responsiveness when they stopped. A woman said, soon after she began using progesterone and thyroid, that, for the first time in her life she felt that her heart and abdomen were opening with feelings of love. Another said "thyroid is love." Since these women were using the hormones for problems that had developed gradually, over several years if not their entire life, the sudden change was dramatic. They had forgotten that life itself was pleasurable. Our culture doesn't explicitly teach us that life is pleasureless, though it does make life pleasureless for many, and it does teach that pleasure is worth less than virtue, utility, possession, etc. By improving life conditions (in many ways) the hormones of pleasure can have a bigger role in our physiology. | think the experience of pleasure (whatever capacity for pleasure there is) increases the ability to experience pleasure, but | don't offer this with much hope as a therapeutic approach, since | know of people who say that running to exhaustion makes them "feel good" — neither "feeling good" nor "having orgasms" has a clear meaning, at present."
**CONTEXT:** The profound positive effects of thyroid and progesterone on mood, pleasure, and emotional well-being, and the cultural devaluation of pleasure.

**RAY PEAT:** "In regions where most people die before the age of five, those who do grow up are severely malnourished, and have brains that are much smaller than normal. Studies in Latin America have compared brain size and neurological development in villages eating "normally," and in nearby villages in which pregnant women and babies received a small nutritional supplement, and have shown that head size (and mental development) can be increased by a little improvement in the diet. Animal experiments, as well as a recent study of Americans, show that this improvement could be cumulative, if continued into the next generations."
**CONTEXT:** The critical role of nutrition in brain development, particularly in early life, and the potential for cumulative improvements across generations.

**RAY PEAT:** "Additionally, when the mothers' general health is so poor that nutrition just during pregnancy can't overcome the lifelong deprivation, the use of hormones could keep the mother in good health during pregnancy, and act as a buffer between the fetus and the mother's metabolic instability. In some areas, thyroid hormone would be crucial. In every area, for a large percentage of women, progesterone can improve gestation. Thyroid supplementation would cost only about $2 per pregnancy, progesterone would cost from $2 to $15. The difference between a passive person with an 85 IQ and an independent person with a 130 IQ is very great; if all the children in a village could be so healthy, many aspects of the society would change. | suppose this explains why none of the people who give money for research or humanitarian projects has been interested in supporting such a project. With adequate support, many foods could be evaluated for their effect, positive or negative, on gestation and brain development."
**CONTEXT:** The potential of hormone supplementation (thyroid and progesterone) to improve fetal development and cognitive outcomes, especially in cases of maternal malnutrition.

**RAY PEAT:** "There is a medical myth about large-headed babies being hard to deliver. When the pelvis is seriously deformed, there is a problem, but the fact is that very large babies are delivered with great ease when the mother is in good health, because the factors which support growth of the baby also promote elasticity of the mother's tissues. Progesterone is such a factor — almost a "chemical obstetrician.""
**CONTEXT:** Debunking the myth that large-headed babies are difficult to deliver, highlighting the role of progesterone in promoting maternal tissue elasticity.

**RAY PEAT:** "It has been observed that the ratio of brain weight to body weight corresponds directly to longevity. The brain has a nourishing, trophic influence on other tissues. A stable, efficient brain is an anti-stress agent. The hormones of stress age various tissues, including the brain, and the collagen in connective tissue. Good nutrition, including the anti-stress substances found in certain foods, will simultaneously optimize intelligence and increase the healthy life-span. Congenital defects are increased by stress and poor nutrition during pregnancy, and reduced by good nutrition, hormone supplementation, and stress reduction. Even in rich cultures, protein deficiency, inappropriate exercise, and emotional tension will contribute to premature aging of the individual, and damage to the offspring."
**CONTEXT:** The link between brain-to-body weight ratio, longevity, and the protective effects of good nutrition and stress reduction on aging and congenital defects.

**RAY PEAT:** "There is a continuity from the molecular level through our physiological states into our way of life. The properties of water, modified by biological substances and biological experience, allow a kind of physiological (and epistemological) unity which is unimaginable for the atomistic genetic determinists. The existence of long-range order in a liquid is now respectable, because liquid crystals are in common use for watch dials and calculator display devices. Long-range order is a principle of biological thinking which brings us into a new phase of theory. Succeeding in biology, this principle can help us to re-evaluate other events in the history of ideas about physical state. For example, it is now clear that Polanyi's adsorption potential was a fact, and Einstein and Haber were dogmatically wrong in their ideas about inter-atomic forces. Seeing this, we should question the many consequences of the same mistaken atomistic view, including Einstein's theory of photoelectricity, which attributed a corpuscular quality to light, because he "knew" that matter was strictly particulate without any of the long-range energy properties that were later demonstrated by Polanyi."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of long-range order in biological systems and its implications for understanding physical states and scientific theories.

**RAY PEAT:** "Biology is now approaching a time when it will be increasingly frustrated by the inability of chemists and physicists to think clearly about the assumptions they have made. A few physical scientists have begun to realize that concepts developed in biology can solve problems in, for example, the physics of absorption. Thinking about life, our assumptions should be fewer and less arbitrary than in simple sciences. When we speak about "our mental state and our physical state," we may eventually achieve the concreteness and generality which a physicist has in describing, e.g., "the solid state," but this will be an expansion of physics, not a reduction of biology."
**CONTEXT:** The limitations of current scientific thinking in chemistry and physics regarding biological phenomena and the potential for biology to inform other sciences.

**RAY PEAT:** "Millions of women with already high estrogen levels are being sold estrogen pills or injections, often prescribed as treatment for symptoms known to result from excess estrogen. When this treatment fails, and symptoms get worse, a tranquilizer is often added to the treatment. Surgery frequently follows. Many healthy wombs are removed as a "preventive" measure. | have talked to many women who have been ravaged by this kind of medical treatment; asking them how their "low estrogen" had been diagnosed, they say "by a Pap smear," or "he could tell by looking at my eyes," or even vaguer methods. | have only talked to one woman who had her blood estrogen level actually measured. Controlled scientific studies don't play much of a role in the practice of medicine. This widespread use of estrogen is not only unsupported by such valid studies, but is in opposition to most of the real data that exist. Foreign physicians have asked how it was possible to speak of "hormone replacement therapy," when the estrogen level in the blood was often maintained at 1000 percent of normal."
**CONTEXT:** Critique of the medical establishment's overprescription of estrogen, often for symptoms of estrogen excess, and the lack of scientific basis for such treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hepatitis and other liver problems are known to be increasing. Women's livers are known to be more sluggish than men's in removing chemicals from the body. When the liver doesn't remove estrogen from the body rapidly enough, estrogen accumulates in the body — this is why male alcoholics often grow breasts. Estrogen pills and tranquilizers add to the liver's burden. Poor nutrition makes it impossible for the liver to function properly. It has been known for several decades that many of the symptoms of hormone imbalance can be relieved with simple nutritional therapy. If doctors don't want to take the time to study the literature, they should at least be referred to one of the simply written articles, such as Biskind's on the liver and hormones in Vitamins and Hormones, 1946."
**CONTEXT:** The liver's role in estrogen metabolism and the impact of poor nutrition and certain medications on its function, highlighting the effectiveness of nutritional therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a recent nutrition class, a young woman who prepared nutritionally perfect meals (even exceeding the established "recommended daily allowances") was getting ready to have breast surgery, because for two years she had had painful cysts. One of the things we discussed was a 1946 paper by Biskind on estrogen and the liver, in which it was pointed out that a B vitamin deficiency slows the liver's elimination of estrogen, so that it accumulates in the body, producing a series of classical symptoms, including cystic mastitis. During the course, we had also discussed how vitamin A can often benefit secretory tissues, such as the glands which maintain hormonal balance. The last day of class, she told me that, for the first time in two years she had no breast pain, and her doctor had told her she was completely free of the cystic condition, and called off the surgery."
**CONTEXT:** A case study illustrating how B vitamin deficiency can impair estrogen elimination, leading to cystic mastitis, and how vitamin A can support hormonal balance, resolving the condition.

**RAY PEAT:** "The other symptoms mentioned by Biskind include adrenal cortex hypertrophy, uterine bleeding, premenstrual tension, diminished libido and impotence in the male and cutaneous vascular spiders. He mentions that the diminished testicular function of diabetes can be improved by nutrition, as can an enlarged liver, and that PABA sometimes improves the libido. He wrote that thiamine and riboflavin seemed to be responsible for the liver's regulation of estrogen, but that the amino acid methionine was also essential. Lipschuts (Steroids and Tumors, 1950) reported that protein is crucial for estrogen removal. Recent studies in monkeys show that menstruation is brought on when the progesterone level falls and the uterine blood vessels dilate, then go into spasm. Many of the symptoms of estrogen excess are equivalent to those of a progesterone deficiency. Progesterone is a direct antagonist of estrogen; Lipschuts (and Korenchevsky) have shown that progesterone causes regression of tumors induced by estrogen. Thyroid hormone and Vitamin A promote protein metabolism and antagonize some of estrogen's effects. In fact, hyperthyroidism is known to be able to cause estrogen levels to fall below normal. Vitamins C and E are also known to help the liver deal with toxins. Puffiness, usually most noticeable in the face in the morning and the feet at night, is another common symptom of estrogen excess, caused by the retention of water and sodium."
**CONTEXT:** A comprehensive list of symptoms associated with estrogen excess, highlighting the role of B vitamins, methionine, protein, progesterone, thyroid hormone, and vitamins A, C, and E in managing these issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "Masters, the sex researcher, recently mentioned that quite a few women have been losing their ability to have an orgasm after being on the pill for 18 months or longer, and that they are also losing their interest in sex, or their ability to be aroused easily. Since this doesn't happen to everyone, and takes a fairly long time to develop. We can probably understand it best by considering other effects of the pill that develop slowly. It's well known that taking estrogen can cause the blood to clot too easily. Other effects include anemia, low blood sugar, and slow functioning of the liver."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of oral contraceptives (the pill) on sexual function, including loss of orgasm, interest, and arousal, and its connection to blood clotting, anemia, low blood sugar, and liver function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some people will say that the pill inhibits estrogen production, and that the loss of sex interest means that these women need more estrogen. However, the other effects produced by the pill are pretty clearly the result of an excess of estrogen, at least in relation to other hormones. And | think it might be dangerous to increase the dosage of estrogen hoping to restore normal sexual function."
**CONTEXT:** Counterargument to the notion that loss of sex interest from the pill indicates a need for more estrogen, emphasizing that it's likely due to estrogen excess.

**RAY PEAT:** "Normally, the liver treats estrogen like a poison, removing it immediately from the body. If the liver gets sluggish from malnutrition or too much estrogen (or other damage), it can allow the hormone to build up to very high levels. Since estrogen is metabolically antagonistic to progesterone and testosterone, i think the pill might decrease libido by counteracting these other hormones. They raise the energy charge of cells, and contribute to a sense of well-being. Testosterone stimulates sexual desire in both sexes. The energy charge of cells can govern nerve reflexes, and so | think it is reasonable to suppose that the quality of sexual arousal and orgasm could be influenced by the relative balance of estrogen and progesterone or testosterone."
**CONTEXT:** The liver's role in estrogen detoxification and how estrogen's antagonism to progesterone and testosterone can lead to decreased libido and altered sexual function.

**RAY PEAT:** "An I.U.D. (intra-uterine contraceptive device) is known to be "luteolytic", meaning it suppresses progesterone formation and leads to a relative excess of estrogen. This suggests that I.U.D.s might also eventually make it hard to have orgasms. Copper seems to be synergic with estrogen, and could have a similar effect — could this have something to do with the de-emphasis of sex among some vegetarians who eat lots of copper-rich soy beans? Copper I.U.D.'s would seem the most likely kind to interfere with sexual satisfaction."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for IUDs and copper to disrupt progesterone formation, leading to estrogen excess and difficulties with orgasm.

**RAY PEAT:** "My impression (from women | have known) is that excessive estrogen will first produce little orgasms, with a need to have many in succession. The low blood sugar resulting from high estrogen can cause depression, irritability and sleep problems. When a lower ratio of estrogen to the other hormones exists, i think the pattern is more likely to be one large, intense orgasm followed by sleep, with the next arousal not coming for about 1 and one half hours."
**CONTEXT:** The progression of sexual response issues with excessive estrogen, from multiple small orgasms to depression and sleep disturbances, and the contrast with a more balanced hormonal state.

**RAY PEAT:** "If a person (especially, though not necessarily, a woman) has unsatisfying orgasms, or no orgasms at all, i think it would be advisable to eliminate the possible causes of a hormone imbalance (including high copper intake), and also to help the liver function as effectively as possible by getting good nutrition.. High protein, all the B vitamins, vitamins A, C, and E, and zinc and magnesium are especially important. Vitamin E does several things biochemically which are exactly the opposite of what estrogen does, so it has been called the "anti-estrogenic vitamin.""
**CONTEXT:** Recommendations for addressing unsatisfying orgasms, including eliminating hormone imbalances, supporting liver function with nutrition, and the specific benefits of vitamin E.

**RAY PEAT:** "Magnesium has a very powerful sedative — even anesthetic — effect, which seems to be especially favorable to healthy sexuality. | suspect that it will eventually be known as an "anti-estrogenic mineral," and, with zinc, may turn out to be effective in a wide variety of sex-related problems. It is already a traditional therapy for prostatitis. Male impotence as well as female sex problems can sometimes benefit from special nutrition."
**CONTEXT:** The potential of magnesium and zinc to address sexual health issues, including their "anti-estrogenic" properties and benefits for prostatitis and male impotence.

**RAY PEAT:** "According to S. Zuckerman (1955), excess estrogen causes enlargement of the prostate in dogs. More recent studies have used progestins to relieve prostate enlargement in men. These observations suggest that excess estrogen may be a frequent factor in male sexual problems. | now suspect low thyroid is a factor in most such cases, and advise the elimination of nuts, beans, broccoli, corn oil, and other thyroid inhibitors from the diet."
**CONTEXT:** The link between excess estrogen and prostate enlargement in men, and the potential role of low thyroid and thyroid-inhibiting foods in male sexual problems.

**RAY PEAT:** "In another section on estrogen, | mention that too much estrogen seems to interfere with sexual responsiveness and orgasm, and | suggested that a tendency to have a series of small or only partly satisfying orgasms could result from an excess of either estrogen or copper, since copper and estrogen have some biochemical similarities and interactions. While zinc can counteract copper, many of the effects of estrogen can be offset by vitamin E. (Vitamin C can also detoxify and help to excrete metals.)"
**CONTEXT:** The role of estrogen and copper in sexual dysfunction and the benefits of zinc and vitamin E in counteracting these effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen seems to increase the body's need for vitamin E, as it does for many other nutrients. Pregnancy, which can leave the woman with an elevated estrogen level, seems to raise the amount of vitamin E needed to sustain the following pregnancy, if we can generalize from animal experiments. During the first year of a rat's life, the amount of vitamin E needed to sustain pregnancy increases by about 65 times (J. of Clinical Nutrition, Sept. 1974)."
**CONTEXT:** The increased need for vitamin E during pregnancy, potentially due to elevated estrogen levels, as supported by animal studies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just as too much estrogen causes sterility, it seems that it can also cause loss of sexual "capacity". Since vitamin E can often restore fertility (e.g.. E.V. Shute, J. Endocr. 2, p.173, 1940), it is likely that it can also sometimes restore the libido."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for vitamin E to restore fertility and libido, mirroring its ability to counteract the effects of estrogen.

**RAY PEAT:** "Newborn rodents often respond to stimulation with the behavior of a mature female in heat, and this doesn't seem to be produced by estrogen. Rather, it seems to be produced by the slight oxygen deprivation at birth. My own experiments have shown that vitamin E tends to raise the oxygen content of tissues, at least when the tissue is under the influence of estrogen. | suspect that estrogen acts largely through its effect on oxygen metabolism — a sort of biochemical breath-holding. For certain nerve systems, both taking vitamin E and having an orgasm might be compared to taking a good deep breath."
**CONTEXT:** The potential link between oxygen deprivation at birth and sexual responsiveness in rodents, and the role of vitamin E in improving oxygen metabolism, possibly counteracting estrogen's effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "To continue the analogy between breathing and orgasm, having an orgasm without enough vitamin E would be like sneezing without first inhaling. Some people really do this, and the effect is a series of very small, quick sneezes. That is, if the nerve-muscle system can't get into the "ready state" the tension can't resolve itself normally. (This "ready state" of the tissues has been studied in the Soviet Union more than in the U.S.; | describe these studies in my book Mind and Tissue)."
**CONTEXT:** An analogy comparing orgasm to breathing and the importance of vitamin E in achieving a "ready state" for proper nerve-muscle function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin E preserves ATP; ATP is a source of biological energy, but it also stabilizes or relaxes tissue. This energized relaxation is the "ready state." In a dead animal, ATP disappears from the tissues and the muscles contract and harden, but if ATP is injected the muscles will become soft again. In a vitamin E deficiency, certain tissues lose enough ATP that they can't function normally. Muscles cramp, and eventually can harden and become dystrophic. Magnesium also helps to maintain ATP levels, and for example can be used to stop menstrual cramps. In an extreme case of vitamin E deficiency, reflexes become abnormal; in some animals, softening of the brain is the first symptom of a vitamin E deficiency."
**CONTEXT:** The role of vitamin E in preserving ATP, its connection to tissue relaxation and function, and the consequences of its deficiency, including muscle dysfunction and potential brain softening.

**RAY PEAT:** "The highest part of the brain, in evolution, is the expectancy/planning system in the frontal lobes. Delayed and appropriate response is impossible if these lobes don't function well. In a healthy animal, arousal means expectation: the longer arousal can be sustained without distraction, the higher the energy charge will be, and the more intense and satisfying the completion will be."
**CONTEXT:** The function of the frontal lobes in expectancy and planning, and how sustained arousal and energy charge contribute to satisfying completion.

**RAY PEAT:** "Trying to sustain excitement too long, for example while waiting for your partner to finish an elaborate preparatory ritual, can exhaust the desire, the emotion and tension; the expectancy pattern fades. Losing sleep, or getting too hungry can have the same effect by causing low blood sugar. The brain needs a large supply of glucose to function well. Incidentally, oversleeping can cause the blood sugar to fall. High estrogen can also cause low blood sugar."
**CONTEXT:** Factors that can exhaust desire and expectancy, including prolonged excitement, sleep deprivation, hunger, and high estrogen levels, all of which can lead to low blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "People have always suspected that sexual desire was part of the highest human functioning. The expectancy process in the most uniquely human part of the brain is as essential for good sex as it is for good art or good science. Adequate nutrition, including vitamin E, is extremely important for the full functioning of this system."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between sexual desire, higher brain function, and the crucial role of adequate nutrition, including vitamin E.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of physiological compensation is sometimes overlooked in interpreting endocrine interactions, with confusing results. The brain-pituitary system (not just the hypothalamus, since the whole brain and sensory system participates as "reflex setter") is probably the main regulatory or compensating system. If estrogen is injected into an animal, the level of thyroid stimulating hormone rises (Brown-Grant, J. Endocr. 35, 263, 1966). This should be taken as a hint that the peripheral effect of estrogen can be compensated for by thyroxin. If thyroid functioning is borderline, it would also suggest that elevated estrogen might be uncompensated peripherally. There are many known examples of metabolic or functional opposition of estrogen and thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** The concept of physiological compensation in endocrine interactions, specifically how the brain-pituitary system regulates and compensates for estrogen's effects, with thyroxin playing a key role.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen lowers blood sugar by stimulating insulin release (Goodman and Hazelwood, J. Endocr. 62, 439, 1974), and also apparently by blocking the synthesis of adrenal corticoids (Turner, General Endocrinology, Sanders Co., Phila., 1966), while thyroxin raises blood sugar (Turner, ibid.)."
**CONTEXT:** The opposing effects of estrogen and thyroxin on blood sugar levels, with estrogen lowering it and thyroxin raising it.

**RAY PEAT:** "Synthesis of lipids is promoted by estrogen (Peat and Soderwall, Physiol. Chem. and Physics 4(3), 295, 1972), while thyroxin promotes lipolysis possibly acting through adrenalin (Turner, op. cit.)."
**CONTEXT:** The contrasting roles of estrogen and thyroxin in lipid metabolism, with estrogen promoting synthesis and thyroxin promoting breakdown.

**RAY PEAT:** "Reflecting an altered respiratory pattern, liver catalase activity seems to be lowered by estrogen (Adams, J. Reprod. Fertil. 12, 9, 1970) and raised by thyroxin."
**CONTEXT:** The influence of estrogen and thyroxin on liver catalase activity, indicating their impact on respiratory patterns.

**RAY PEAT:** "The proliferative response of lymphoid organs, measured as the rate of DNA synthesis, is increased by estrogen or insulin and decreased by thyrotropin (Maor, et al., Acta Endocrinol. 75(1), 205, 1974)."
**CONTEXT:** The differential effects of estrogen, insulin, and thyrotropin on the proliferative response of lymphoid organs.

**RAY PEAT:** "Apparently thymolysis is blocked by thyroxine, and promoted by estrogen (stress, radiation and starvation also cause thymus shrinkage)."
**CONTEXT:** The opposing effects of thyroxine and estrogen on thymolysis, with estrogen promoting thymus shrinkage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Starvation and injection of estradiol both suppress lactation while thyroxine injection stimulates lactation (Oshima, Bull, Natl. Inst. Anim. Ind (Chibal) 26, 45, 1973)."
**CONTEXT:** The contrasting effects of starvation, estradiol, and thyroxine on lactation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Opposing effects of these hormones are also seen in fever and thermogenesis, in fertility (Peat, dissertation Univ. of Oregon 1972; Harrison et al., Principles of Internal Medicine, 1950), and in methionine metabolism (Finkelstein and Harris, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 159 (1), 160, 1973). Brown-Grant, J. Physiol. 176, 91, 1965) has commented on the idea of compensatory cycling of thyroid activity: "... the sudden drop in thyroid activity during metoestrus and dioestrus could well be a compensatory decline below the mean level, resulting from the release of an excess of hormone above the needs of the animal during oestrus." The data showing peripheral opposition of the hormones suggest that the need for thyroxine varies with the estrogen cycle. The fact that myxedema is 5 times more frequent in females (adult) than male also suggests such an effect of estrogen (Harrison, op. cit., p. 611). Water and sodium retention induced by estrogen (Korenchevsky, Physiol. and Pathol. Aging, Hafner, N.Y. 1961) may be hard to distinguish from the water retention of myxedema. lodine, protein and electrolyte balance should be given special attention in women who may have an estrogen imbalance."
**CONTEXT:** The broad range of opposing effects between estrogen and thyroid hormones, including their influence on fertility, metabolism, and water retention, and the implications for women's health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid hormone is necessary for respiration on the cellular level, and makes possible all higher biological functions. Without the metabolic efficiency which is promoted by thyroid hormone, life couldn't get much beyond the single-cell stage. Without adequate thyroid, we become sluggish, clumsy, cold, anemic, and subject to infections, heart disease, headaches, cancer, and many other diseases, and seem to be prematurely aged, because none of our tissues can function normally. Besides providing the respiratory energy which is essential to life, thyroid hormones seem to stimulate and direct protein synthesis."
**CONTEXT:** The fundamental role of thyroid hormone in cellular respiration, metabolic efficiency, and overall biological function, and the consequences of its deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "In hypothyroidism there is little stomach acid, and other digestive juices (and even intestinal movement) are inadequate, so gas and constipation are common. Foods aren't assimilated well, so even on a seemingly adequate diet there is "internal malnutrition." Magnesium is poorly absorbed, and a magnesium deficiency can lead to irritability, blood clots, vascular spasms and angina pectoris, and many other problems. Heart attacks, hardening of the arteries, and both high and low blood pressure can by caused by hypothyroidism."
**CONTEXT:** The digestive and cardiovascular consequences of hypothyroidism, including poor nutrient absorption, magnesium deficiency, and various heart-related issues.

**RAY PEAT:** ""Spotting," "breakthrough bleeding," and abnormally long periods are often caused by hypothyroidism. In the light of this knowledge, i feel that a physician who advocates removal of the uterus for excessive bleeding, without first trying thyroid therapy, is not practicing medicine properly."
**CONTEXT:** The link between hypothyroidism and menstrual irregularities, and a critique of medical practices that overlook thyroid therapy for such conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Low body temperature (below 98 degrees when you wake in the morning) and slow pulse are the simplest indicators of hypothyroidism. Foolishly designed blood tests have caused many people to be taken off thyroid medication, in spite of their symptoms. For 40 years, time after time one blood test has displaced another, and always the one which is in use at the moment is "the correct" one. The oldest test, the BMR, is still the best, in spite of the possibility of a mistake if the test is given when the patient has an infection, but the temperature is also a reliable indicator (except that heat from the environment — an electric blanket or a hot room — can artificially raise temperature to normal.)"
**CONTEXT:** Simple indicators of hypothyroidism (low body temperature and slow pulse) and a critique of the unreliability of blood tests compared to basal metabolic rate (BMR) and temperature measurements.

**RAY PEAT:** "Cysteine, an amino acid which is abundant in muscle and liver, happens to block synthesis of the thyroid hormone. When we are starving or under stress, cortisone causes these protein-rich tissues to be consumed. If metabolism continued at a normal rate, stress or hunger would quickly destroy us. The cysteine which is released from muscle, though, inhibits the thyroid, so metabolism is slowed. Cortisone also inhibits the thyroid. Any stress, including heavy exercise, will cause this protective slowing of metabolism. The slow heart beat of runners is largely the result of this adaptive hypothyroidism. When we eat large amounts of muscle meats or liver the high concentration of cysteine suppresses the thyroid. Heart, eggs, skin (gelatin) and milk are more favorable to the thyroid. Other anti-thyroid foods are peanuts, soybeans, raw cabbage, radishes, broccoli, cauliflower, unsaturated oils (such as safflower, corn, cottonseed, and soy oils), and an excess of iodine. Amygdalin (nitrilosides, laetrile) which occurs in many nuts, seeds and grains, is also a thyroid inhibitor. Because iodate is used as a "dough conditioner" (to make bread water-heavy), the American eater often gets ten times more iodine than is recommended. Combined with unsaturated oils, as organic iodides, excess iodine can powerfully inhibit the thyroid. Manganese is needed to synthesize thyroxin, so a deficiency can interfere with thyroid function (coffee is a major source of manganese, and caffeine also stimulates the thyroid)."
**CONTEXT:** A detailed list of factors that inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, including cysteine, cortisone, stress, certain foods (peanuts, soybeans, cruciferous vegetables, unsaturated oils), excess iodine, and manganese deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "When a baby is being born, or when a person is experiencing other stress, such as an infection, or when a person gets old, the best known thyroid hormone, thyroxine, is not changed to the more highly active form, T3 (triiodothyronine) in the normal way. In these emergency conditions, reduced oxygen consumption is a useful adaptation, since the blood is poorly oxygenated. Eating carbohydrate stimulates this conversion, so many additional calories of carbohydrate can be eaten without causing a weight gain (reviewed by C. Martin, 1978). Many people whose thyroid gland is suppressed by stress cannot respond to synthetic thyroxine, T4, since the same stress can block its conversion to T3. Natural thyroid, USP, is the most generally effective, but a non-prescription thyroid tablet is available at many health food stores."
**CONTEXT:** The conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the more active T3, its impairment during stress, and the role of carbohydrate in facilitating this conversion.

**RAY PEAT:** "Contrary to popular ideas about thyroid, the gland will resume its functioning after stopping the use of a supplement even if it has been suppressed, and sometimes taking thyroid will increase the gland's function to normal. Taking thyroid will sometimes help thin people gain weight, by improving protein metabolism, and it often helps people to sleep more soundly."
**CONTEXT:** The reversibility of thyroid suppression and the benefits of thyroid supplementation for weight gain and improved sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** "In several ways, both progesterone and thyroid can be considered as primary regulatory hormones. Both of them regulate metabolism directly at the energetic and synthetic levels, both have a normalizing, anti-stress action on the pituitary, and each has a promoting action on the other. Both are blocked (or consumed) by stress, and promoted by light, and by good nutrition. Both oppose the effects of stress, and facilitate nutrition. Both are nutrients in cultures which eat the whole animal, including ovaries and thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** The synergistic and regulatory roles of progesterone and thyroid hormones in metabolism, stress response, and overall health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Disregarding most of the information promoted by pharmaceutical companies, and the medical texts and journals which for thirty years have reflected the opinions of those companies (especially regarding the patented synthetic estrogens and glucocorticoids), we can trace a line of research and ideas on the sex hormones, from pioneers such as Loeb, Korenchevsky, and Selye, through a generation that continued to demonstrate the toxicity of estrogen, and the value of progesterone, including people like Lipschutz, Dalton and Soderwall. In my dissertation research under Soderwall, | had the opportunity to collect and assimilate data indicating an increased estrogen effect in aging animals, and recently, using radioimmunoassay for serum estrogen and progesterone, | have found a similar change in menopausal women, and Terry Parkening, who also studied under Soderwall, has used that technique to show that senescent infertility in mice is also associated with an increased ratio of estrogen to progesterone. My research showed that the probable mechanism by which estrogen excess causes infertility is through limiting the availability of oxygen. | showed that anti-estrogenic substances, such as progesterone or vitamine E, increased the oxygen tension in the uterus. This anti-oxygen effect of estrogen suggests a convergence of reproductive aging research with Warburg's theory that damaged respiration is the primary defect in cancer, and also with Selye's observation that estrogen's effect resembles the first, shock phase of the stress reaction."
**CONTEXT:** The historical research on sex hormones, highlighting the toxicity of estrogen and the benefits of progesterone, and the author's own research linking estrogen excess to infertility via oxygen limitation, connecting it to cancer and stress theory.

**RAY PEAT:** "Early research had also shown that estrogen diminishes hepatic glycogen (Brunelli, 1935), while progesterone increases both blood sugar and liver glycogen (Gaunt, et al., 1939). It is well known that hypoxia damages the fetal brain, but probably less well known that hypoglycemia, either chronic or acute, can cause brain damage and retardation. Hypoxia, by lowering metabolic efficiency, will cause hypoglycemia. Estrogen causes hypoxia at every imaginable site, from lung, through vascular fibrin and extracellular collagen and edema, to intracellular metabolism. Estrogen is also synergic with insulin, lowering blood sugar and promoting fat synthesis. Estrogen, and another common respiratory toxin, excessive unsaturated fats, have both been demonstrated to cause the birth of small-brained, retarded animals. Recent studies imply that about half of the children identified as hyperkinetic have experienced gestational stress."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of estrogen and unsaturated fats on fetal brain development, linking them to hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and hyperactivity.

**RAY PEAT:** "The most urgent need for progesterone therapy, | think, is in preventing a continuing epidemic of brain damage. Beyond that, many studies have found that the use of natural progesterone increases the child's IQ, typically by around 35 points (though there are claims of consistent 200 IQ's), and produces personalities that are more "independent, individualistic, self-assured, self-sufficient, and sensitive" (J.M. Reinish, The Female Patient, April, 1978, p. 87). Protection against hypoglycemia is probably the main mechanism — diabetic mothers often have precocious children, if they aren't damaged by drugs and irrational diets. Ten to fifteen grams per pregnancy, at increasing dosage, stopping a few days before expected delivery, seems to be the optimum amount, when there is some sign of excessive estrogen or expected toxemia, such as continuing menstruation in the first 2 or 3 months of pregnancy. The AMA department of drugs has specifically excluded progesterone from the sex hormones which are "now contraindicated in early pregnancy" (JAMA 239 (3) p.236)."
**CONTEXT:** The critical role of progesterone in preventing brain damage in infants and enhancing cognitive and personality development, with specific dosage recommendations for pregnancy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hypoglycemia (which can result from any respiratory defect) can produce malfunction of any tissue, but brain dysfunction and immune dysfunction are very common effects. Adamkiewics has shown that allergic reactions to a given substance will decrease from 100 percent to zero, when the blood glucose increases from, for example, 50 mg.% to 150 mg.% or more (also see Chernigovsky's book, Interoceptors). Progesterone (and thyroid) will help in most allergic diseases, including the autoimmune and "collagen diseases," because it helps to maintain blood sugar (promoting respiration and improving use of fat, sparing glucose) and also because it stabilizes lysosomes. This polar opposition of estrogen and progesterone also involves the polar antagonism of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, and to some extent a related antagonism of various prostaglandins (it has been suggested that this involves different populations of lysosomes, but | suspect it has to do with the superoxide dismutase enzyme system, and its inhibition or activation, since one of my assays to determine the action of estrogen turns out to be an inverse indicator of S.O.D. activity). Although progesterone and cortisone both raise blood sugar and stabilize lysosomes, their effect on the brain is very different: in large doses, progesterone is sedative and anesthetic, while cortisone is stimulating, and cortisone causes changes in the brain which resemble aging. The dopamine-serotonin antagonism (e.g., in the control of prolactin secretion) can be modified by progesterone, thyroid, and other factors."
**CONTEXT:** The broad therapeutic effects of progesterone and thyroid, including their role in managing hypoglycemia, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and their contrasting effects on the brain compared to cortisone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pfeiffer has investigated the relationship of porphyria to certain forms of "schizophrenia," but | don't think he has mentioned that a good dose of glucose, or of an anti-estrogen hormone, such as testosterone or progesterone, will make the symptoms go away, just about as dramatically as Adamkiewics' glucose infusion will block inflammation or anaphylactic shock (incidentally, medical people just recently found that a large infusion of glucose was effective treatment in septic shock). Vitamin E, the old anti-estrogen, pro-fertility, pro-oxygen, anti-clot nutrient, is now recognized as a factor in the control of porphyrin synthesis. Adaptively, it is logical for a lack of oxygen (as at high altitudes) to stimulate synthesis of the porphyrin ring, to use in respiratory systems, as hemoglobin or catalase. Other schizophrenias that Pfeiffer investigated involve disturbances in copper, zinc, and histamine, so it is interesting to note that these are powerfully regulated by estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid. Oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome has been seen in the uterus under the influence of estrogen, with copper as catalyst."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between porphyria, schizophrenia, and hormonal imbalances, and the therapeutic potential of glucose, progesterone, testosterone, and vitamin E.

**RAY PEAT:** "Other investigators have noticed abnormalities of pigmentation associated with psychoses or other nerve-related disease. Parkinson's disease, for example, involves degeneration of melanin-rich nerves, and melanin has now been identified as a "progesterone receptor," at least in some lower animals."
**CONTEXT:** The association between pigmentation abnormalities, neurological diseases like Parkinson's, and the role of progesterone as a potential receptor.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most of the known biochemistry of lithium happens to overlap the actions of progesterone, e.g., aldosterone antagonism. However, while lithium has an anti-thyroid action, progesterone supports secretion of thyroxine, and apparently inhibits the formation of reverse T3, that chemical blocks the action of thyroid hormone. | have seen several women substitute progesterone for lithium, and several of these have then gone on to rely on nutrition and light."
**CONTEXT:** The biochemical similarities between lithium and progesterone, and the potential for progesterone to be a safer alternative to lithium, especially in relation to thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "While progesterone might seem to cure almost everything, we should be careful to use it only when the biochemical mechanism is fairly evident. A progesterone deficiency can be misdiagnosed, as (for example) epilepsy, Bright's disease, multiple sclerosis, or even estrogen deficiency (as in menopause). It can affect susceptibility to many conditions including herpes infections, dizziness, dysperception, varicose veins, mastitis, fibroma, and endometriosis. Cyclic edema, depression, and migraine are, in my experience, always stopped by progesterone. Sexual functions are often improved."
**CONTEXT:** The wide-ranging benefits of progesterone, its potential for misdiagnosis, and its effectiveness in treating various conditions including edema, depression, migraine, and sexual dysfunction.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone is the precursor (following acetate and cholesterol) for all of the other steroid hormones, so it can be used in men. It (or its precursor, pregnenolone) has been used for prostatitis, arthritis, and infertility in men. Large amounts, though, would probably suppress LH, and lower testosterone synthesis, but a smaller amount (especially in old men) seems to increase sperm count and motility. In male and female athletes who become infertile, it would seem to be the appropriate therapy, generally in combination with thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** The role of progesterone as a precursor to other steroid hormones and its therapeutic applications in men, including for prostatitis, arthritis, and infertility.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone has been shown to be effective in many animal tumors, including pituitary tumors and other estrogen-induced tumors, and in human cervical and breast cancers. Since glucose metabolism is disturbed in cancer, it would seem reasonable to combine progesterone therapy with sufficient thyroid to maintain protein assimilation, and to provide a high protein diet to assure that the liver can excrete estrogen."
**CONTEXT:** The efficacy of progesterone in treating various tumors, including human cancers, and the importance of combining it with thyroid therapy and a high-protein diet for optimal results.

**RAY PEAT:** "Even very intense emotional or perceptual symptoms typically disappear within 40 minutes when a dose of 300 mg. is given transdermally, dissolved in vitamin E or olive oil. Ovarian cysts, menopausal flushing, acne, sprains, and menstrual cramps can also be relieved with dramatic speed. In Addison's disease it can prevent some of the side effects of cortisone. Facial hair is often normalized in women. | have distributed about 25,000 doses of progesterone, and failure to use enough has been the most common problem. | always spend at least an hour with each person, learning about them and explaining relevant aspects of physiology and nutrition. | have each person read at least one book on the subject, such as the following: K. Dalton, Premenstrual Syndrome and Progesterone Therapy (1978); B. Barnes, Hypothyroidism, the Unsuspected Disease; R. Peat, Mind and Tissue; Nutrition for Women; and my progesterone papers."
**CONTEXT:** The rapid and dramatic effects of transdermal progesterone, its applications in various conditions, and the importance of adequate dosage and patient education.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since progesterone is not known to have any side effects except for alteration of the menstrual cycle and production of euphoria (until doses of several grams per day are reached, at which point its anesthetic property begins to appear), the basic procedure should be to use it in sufficient quantity to make the symptoms disappear, and to time its use so that menstrual cycles are not disrupted. This normally means using it only between ovulation and menstruation unless symptoms are sufficiently serious that a missed period is not important. The basic idea of giving enough to stop the symptoms can be refined by some information on a few of the factors that condition the need for progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** The safety profile of progesterone and guidelines for its use, emphasizing sufficient dosage and appropriate timing to avoid menstrual cycle disruption.

**RAY PEAT:** "An excessive estrogen/progesterone ratio is more generally involved than either a simple excess of estrogen or a deficiency of progesterone, but even this ratio is conditioned by other factors, including age, diet, other steroids, thyroid, and other hormones. The relative estrogen excess seems to act by producing tissue hypoxia (as reported in my dissertation, University of Oregon, 1972), and this is the result of changes induced by estrogen in alveolar diffusion, peripheral vascular changes, and intracellular oxygen wastage."
**CONTEXT:** The role of the estrogen/progesterone ratio in health and the mechanism by which estrogen excess leads to tissue hypoxia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hypoxia in turn produces edema (as can be observed in the cornea when it is deprived of oxygen, as by a contact lens) and hypoglycemia (e.g., C. Martin: diminished ATP acts like insulin), because glycolysis must increase greatly for even a small deficiency of oxygen. Elevated blood lactic acid is one sign of tissue hypoxia. Edema, hypoglycemia, and lactic acidemia can also be produced by other "respiratory" defects, including hypothyroidism, in which the tissue does not use enough oxygen - the skin will be bluer (in thin places, such as around the eyes) when hypoxia, rather than low oxygen consumption, is involved. Low thyroid is one cause of excess estrogen; when both are involved, the color of the skin is neither red nor blue, but relatively bloodless white or yellow."
**CONTEXT:** The cascade of effects stemming from hypoxia, including edema, hypoglycemia, and lactic acidemia, and the connection between low thyroid, excess estrogen, and skin discoloration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Symptoms in cycling women are most common around ovulation and in the premenstrual week, when the estrogen/progesterone ratio is normally highest - and these are the ages when thyroid disorders are commonest in women."
**CONTEXT:** The timing of hormonal imbalances in women, particularly around ovulation and premenstruation, and their correlation with thyroid disorders.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides a family tendency to have related symptoms, the individual who suffers from one aspect of the progesterone deficiency will tend to develop others at different times. With cyclic depressions or migraine headaches at age 22, there will possibly be breast disease and often there will be problems with pregnancy, and menopause may bring on a complete collapse."
**CONTEXT:** The progressive nature of progesterone deficiency and its manifestation in various health issues throughout a woman's life.

**RAY PEAT:** "Excess stress (by elevating estrogen and/or depleting progesterone, etc.) may bring on symptoms in someone who never had them. Spending a summer in Alaska, with an unusually long day, may relieve the symptoms of a chronic sufferer. Dark cloudy winters in England or the Pacific Northwest are powerful stressors, and cause lower progesterone in women and testosterone in men. Toxins, such as copper and lead, can produce similar symptoms. Porphyria and zinc deficiency are often caused by the hormone imbalance. A very common cause of an estrogen excess is a dietary protein deficiency - the liver simply cannot detoxify estrogen when it is undernourished (see Lipschutz references)."
**CONTEXT:** Factors that can trigger or exacerbate progesterone deficiency symptoms, including stress, environmental factors, toxins, and dietary protein deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "With a diet high in protein (e.g., 70-100 grams per day, including eggs) and vitamin A (liver once a week), | have found that the dose can be reduced each month. Using thyroid will usually reduce the amount of progesterone needed. Storage of progesterone apparently occurs in adipose tissue, so that one dose which is much bigger than needed will sometimes control the symptoms for several days."
**CONTEXT:** Strategies for reducing progesterone dosage through diet and thyroid supplementation, and the role of adipose tissue in progesterone storage.

**RAY PEAT:** "For many years, Katharina Dalton has studied the use of progesterone therapy for the premenstrual syndrome. A typical patient may require ten or more progesterone injections per month, more or less permanently. While this is feasible (at least in some countries) it is not comfortable or convenient, in some cases leads to serious reactions at the injection sites, and in the United States would be too expensive for general use. When the syndrome is disabling, even the burden of frequent and expensive injections is usually seen as a welcome alternative. However, a less expensive and more pleasant form of administration could make the therapy available to millions of women who are now disabled for one or more days each month. We are reporting here on what we believe to be a satisfactory alternative to the injection or implantation of progesterone, namely, a solution of progesterone and vegetable oil in a lotion or "cold cream" base for transdermal use."
**CONTEXT:** The limitations of injectable progesterone for premenstrual syndrome and the development of a more accessible transdermal alternative.

**RAY PEAT:** "After animal experiments revealed that progesterone in vegetable oil was absorbed effectively through the skin, in 1977 we began experiments with women who suffered from the premenstrual syndrome. The effectiveness of the transdermal (absorption) route of administration varies with the individual, but compares favorably with injections in the amount assimilated. Thickness of skin or degree of circulation in the skin (these can be very abnormal in hypothyroidism, for example) and the amount of adipose tissue apparently make some difference in the rate of absorption and response. When a small daily dose (e.g., 5 or 10 mg.) is sufficient, this can be taken as about 250 mg. of a three percent cream rubbed into the throat, where it leaves no noticeable oiliness after a few minutes. For large doses, the appropriate amount can be applied to a larger area of skin after a hot bath, once or twice a day if necessary."
**CONTEXT:** The efficacy of transdermal progesterone absorption, influenced by individual factors, and practical application methods.

**RAY PEAT:** "We have used transdermal progesterone therapy in two hundred women suffering from the full range of perimenstrual symptoms, including migraine, acne, depression, mastalgia, edema, and lethargy, and we found that nearly all of the women, applying the lotion themselves, are able to find the appropriate dosage for controlling their symptoms. Occasionally, thyroid therapy, weight reduction, or change in some aspect of life-style is necessary for complete relief from symptoms. We have learned that it is necessary to be very explicit in describing the amounts that can be used, while leaving it up to the patient to find the dose which controls her symptoms, because some women have an exaggerated idea of the power of a "hormone". We have learned, when some women said the progesterone had no effect, that they were applying it as sparingly as they would a rare perfume, just touching it to their wrists."
**CONTEXT:** The success of transdermal progesterone in treating a wide range of perimenstrual symptoms and the importance of patient education regarding dosage and application.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another problem we have encountered is that a few women have trouble understanding how, if their edema is caused by "hormones", a "hormone" could relieve the edema. We have usually solved such problems by applying one dose (sometimes using a twenty-five percent solution) in the office, and waiting thirty or forty minutes to make sure that it was large enough to take effect. Once having felt sudden relief from this "cold cream", it is easier for the patient to understand how it should be used."
**CONTEXT:** Addressing patient skepticism about hormonal treatment for edema by demonstrating the rapid effects of transdermal progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Unfortunately, many of the solvents which hold progesterone stably in a concentrated solution are highly allergenic. Injectable progesterone in oil could be used transdermally except for this problem. Progesterone can be removed from an injectable water suspension, and dissolved in warm olive or almond oil for transdermal use in patients who react to other solvents."
**CONTEXT:** The challenge of allergenic solvents in progesterone formulations and the alternative of using olive or almond oil for transdermal application.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a previous study which found topical progesterone ineffective as therapy for acne, the investigators used ethanol as a solvent. When water is added to a solution of progesterone and ethanol, the progesterone crystalizes out of solution, because water and ethanol have a fairly high mutual solubility and progesterone is practically insoluble in a water-ethanol mixture. When the progesterone-alcohol solution is applied to the skin, the alcohol takes up moisture from the skin, which is sufficient to cause the progesterone to be left undissolved on the surface. We have tried other solvents, including olive oil and vitamin E, which are stable in the presence of moisture, and we have had consistently positive results in twelve cases of acne associated with the menstrual cycle (usually appearing or getting worse around ovulation or just before menstruation) and in one of two teenage boys with chronic acne."
**CONTEXT:** The ineffectiveness of topical progesterone in ethanol-based solutions for acne and the success achieved with olive oil and vitamin E as solvents.

**RAY PEAT:** "Because of the poor solubility, or instability of solution, of progesterone in natural oils of variable composition, we advised the patients to warm the solution in a hot water bath before every application. The solutions varied from one to ten percent progesterone (i.e., one to ten grams per 100 ml. of oil). Patients applied the oil to the affected skin once or twice a day. The amount of progesterone applied ranged from about 25 mg. per day to about 250 mg. per day."
**CONTEXT:** Practical advice for preparing and applying topical progesterone solutions, including warming the oil and varying the concentration and dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** "The patients (except for one of the teenage boys, who reported no effect), consistently reported that use of progesterone at the first sign of a pimple stopped the development at that stage, prevented the expected outbreak, and within a few days resulted in a relatively clear skin. The improvement ranges from complete freedom from pimples in half of the group, to "improved, but still visible blemishes" in three women. Some of the solvents (sandlewood oil, vitamin E) caused an "allergic" skin irritation in two women, but switching to olive oil eliminated those reactions."
**CONTEXT:** Consistent positive results of topical progesterone for acne, with specific details on its effectiveness and potential skin reactions to certain solvents.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women, more often than men, have "normal" body temperatures which are distinctly below normal, i.e., as low as 97 degrees, especially in the two weeks following menstruation. In men, giving progesterone doesn’t cause an increase in body temperature, though it usually does in women. Progesterone is at its lowest in the two weeks between menstruating and ovulating. The fact that progesterone isn't "thermogenic" in men suggests that its activity relates to estrogen, which is its "antagonist." It is known that thyroid hormone increases heat production, and that estrogen is in many ways antagonistic to thyroxin. Therefore, it is not surprising that progesterone, by blocking estrogen's blockage of the thyroid hormone, should promote the effect of thyroxin and raise the temperature. The metabolism is shifted toward oxidation of fat, with the result that sugar is spared for the brain and kidneys and, in pregnancy, for the fetus."
**CONTEXT:** The thermogenic effect of progesterone in women, its relationship to estrogen and thyroid hormone, and its role in shifting metabolism towards fat oxidation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Nutrition which supports the adrenals, ovaries, thyroid and liver can raise the body temperature toward normal, while reducing premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhea. Usually, vitamins A, E, pantothenic acid, and C will raise the temperature; sometimes other B complex vitamins are needed, as well as minerals such as iodine, manganese, zinc, and magnesium."
**CONTEXT:** Nutritional strategies to raise body temperature and alleviate premenstrual symptoms, emphasizing vitamins A, E, pantothenic acid, C, and essential minerals.

**RAY PEAT:** "During stress, the temperature is often above normal, even when there are symptoms of progesterone deficiency. | have noticed that this is usually associated with enlarged lymph glands, as if the adrenal cortex had become inactive. In this state, adrenalin (and ACTH) would continue to be secreted, possibly at high levels, since the cortex normally makes anti-stress hormones to take over some of the resistance-promoting effects of adrenaline, if the stress lasts more than an hour or so. Adrenaline shrinks blood vessels in the skin (preventing heat loss) while stimulating metabolism and so might account for this fever of stress."
**CONTEXT:** The phenomenon of elevated body temperature during stress, even with progesterone deficiency, and its potential link to adrenal inactivity and adrenaline secretion.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sometimes progesterone seems to be chronically deficient (leading to slight — though possibly prolonged - menstruation, or even amenorrhea), in women who exercise hard. Since progesterone can be converted into cortisone to handle stress, this could explain why well trained athletes (who need lots of cortisone) so often miss periods. It seems to be a simple over-consumption of progesterone, which is probably a reasonable biological adaptation, preventing pregnancy during times of stress."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for progesterone deficiency in women who exercise intensely, linking it to the conversion of progesterone to cortisone for stress management and the resulting amenorrhea.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women with benign breast diseases are likely to have abnormally low progesterone levels, while their estrogen stays relatively high (Mauvais-Jarvis, Annales d'Endocrinologie 37, 309-310, 1976). This same imbalance may also play a role in breast cancer (Sherman and Korenman, Cancer 33, 1506, 1974). Since progesterone is a chemical precursor of cortisol, prolonged stress would tend to lower the availability of progesterone, unless the adrenal glands are very well nourished. Vitamin A is required for progesterone synthesis, as well as for proper maturation of cells in membranes and glandular tissue. Pantothenic acid, niacin and vitamin C are commonly limiting factors in synthesis of adrenal hormones. (Synthetic "progestins" are likely to cause, rather than to prevent, breast cancer, and should never be used; natural progesterone needn't be injected, as some doctors believe, since it can be absorbed through the skin.) Cystic ovaries are often associated with sore breasts. Animal experiments (Janes; Leatham) show that lack of thyroid hormone can cause cystic ovaries. (See article on estrogen-thyroxin antagonism.)"
**CONTEXT:** The link between low progesterone, high estrogen, and breast diseases, including cancer, and the role of stress, vitamin A, pantothenic acid, niacin, and vitamin C in progesterone synthesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sugar can be used to produce energy with or without oxygen, but oxidative metabolism is about 15 times more efficient than the non-oxidative "glycolytic" or fermentive metabolism; higher organisms depend on this high efficiency oxidation for maintaining integration and normal functioning. If there is a small interference with respiration, the organism can adapt by increasing the rate of glycolysis, but there must be enough sugar to meet the demand. A response to stimulation is the production of more energy, with a proportional increase of oxygen and sugar consumption by the stimulated tissue; this produces more carbon dioxide, which enlargies the blood vessels in the area, providing more sugar and oxygen. If the irritation becomes destructive, efficiency is lost: oxygen is either consumed wastefully, causing blueness of the tissue (assuming circulation continues; blueness can also indicate bad circulation), or is not consumed, causing redness of the tissue. As more sugar is consumed in compensation, lactic acid also enlarges the blood vessels."
**CONTEXT:** The fundamental difference between oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, the body's adaptation to respiratory interference, and the role of sugar and carbon dioxide in maintaining tissue oxygenation.

**RAY PEAT:** "If the inflamed or exhausted tissue is small, the lactic acid can be consumed by other oxidizing tissues, sufficient sugar usually can be supplied, and repair occurs. But a large inflammation, or profound exhaustion, will lower the blood sugar systemically, and will deliver large amounts of lactic acid to the liver. The liver synthesizes glucose from the lactic acid, but at the expense of about 6 times more energy than is obtained from the inefficient metabolism — so that organismically, that tissue becomes 90 times less efficient than its original state. Besides this, an idle destruction of energy molecules (ATP or creatine phosphate) will increase the wastefulness even more."
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic consequences of large-scale inflammation or exhaustion, including systemic hypoglycemia, lactic acid buildup, and extreme energy inefficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "When the organism detects the inflammation or other stress (possibly by sensing changes in blood sugar, lactic acid, or carbon dioxide, or all of them) its adrenal glands will secrete anti-stress hormones, including adrenalin and cortisone (assuming these glands are not exhausted or starved). Both adrenalin and cortisone can raise blood sugar to meet the increased need. Cortisone stimulates the conversion of protein to sugar, and since there are no "stored proteins" (other than small amounts circulating in the blood) this means that cortisone starts the conversion of the organism into fuel for the problem area. In acute emergencies, the lymphoid tissues will shrink first, which is all right, since they can be restored after the animal recovers, and their function — immunity — is partly a matter of a longer time scale, days to weeks. But if these tissues are chronically depleted by stress or malnutrition, infection is more likely to be fatal, as in old age or in poor populations. (The connection between infection, stress and sugar was illustrated recently by the discovery that infusing large amounts of glucose can relieve septic shock.)"
**CONTEXT:** The body's stress response, involving adrenal hormones, blood sugar regulation, protein catabolism, and the impact on lymphoid tissues and immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Carbonated water can provide enough carbon dioxide (sometimes) to improve the delivery of blood (and glucose) to the brain. Low thyroid leads to low production of carbon dioxide and to wastage of glucose."
**CONTEXT:** The potential benefit of carbonated water for brain circulation and the link between low thyroid, reduced carbon dioxide, and glucose wastage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Various nutritional, hormonal, or toxic states interfere with respiration in different ways: for example, vitamin E deficiency, estrogen excess, toxic thyroid, and DNP (the formerly popular cancer-causing reducing drug) cause oxygen to be consumed without producing the normal amount of useful energy. Vitamin B2 or copper deficiency can prevent consumption of oxygen. Cancer (contrary to a tenacious establishment doctrine) involves a respiratory defect, and causes a tendency toward hypoglycemia which is often compensated by the conversion of protein to sugar, leading to the terminal wasting state (cachexia). (See Shapot and Blinov, Cancer Research 34, 1827-32, 1974.)"
**CONTEXT:** A list of factors that disrupt cellular respiration, including vitamin E deficiency, estrogen excess, toxic thyroid, and certain drugs, and their connection to cancer and cachexia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vasodilation, edema, local heat and acidity are early responses to an irritant or energy defect; later, increased collagen production and capillary proliferation occur. Tumefaction and tissue death can result if the organism's resources aren't adequate."
**CONTEXT:** The progression of tissue responses to irritants or energy defects, from initial inflammation to potential tissue death.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sugar wastage, leading to lactic acid production, can result from a vitamin B2 deficiency, and lactic acid appears to stimulate vascularization (Imre, 1964; Exp. Eye Res. 25, Supplement, 1977, p. 284). This would relate to the development of blood supply to cancers, and also to the blood-shot eyes and red noses and cheeks of alcoholics and others who are deficient in vitamin B2."
**CONTEXT:** The link between vitamin B2 deficiency, lactic acid production, vascularization, and conditions like cancer and facial redness in alcoholics.

**RAY PEAT:** "In general, stress should be met first by correcting the defect, which may be environmental or nutritional. Increased nutritional needs usually include protein and fat; acute hypoglycemia may require a large amount of sugar, and this suggests that the adrenals may be depleted, in which case pantothenic acid, vitamin C, vitamin A, magnesium and potassium should be provided in addition to other nutrients."
**CONTEXT:** General principles for addressing stress, emphasizing nutritional correction, and specific nutrient recommendations for adrenal depletion and hypoglycemia.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sometimes, sugar has to be eliminated permanently to control hypoglycemia. Some people have to eat a snack (e.g., a small slice of cheese) every hour, but this can often be overcome if the liver is able to recuperate."
**CONTEXT:** Strategies for managing hypoglycemia, including sugar elimination and frequent small snacks, with a focus on liver recovery.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pantothenic acid is needed by the liver to destroy insulin (insulinase), so hyperinsulinism, causing hypoglycemia, can sometimes be remedied with this nutrient."
**CONTEXT:** The role of pantothenic acid in insulin destruction and its potential benefit for hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia.

**RAY PEAT:** "According to Hans Selye, activation or injury of tissue is the beginning of stress. The more cells involved, the greater is the stress. An injury to a leg connected only by blood vessels produces a stress reaction in the animal, so the signal of stress can be transmitted in the blood, though the nerves are normally also involved. Adenine nucleotides have been suspected as a cause of shock (because they are vasodilators, as are many other products of stress, including phosphate), but other possibilities are histamine, various polyamines, and low blood sugar."
**CONTEXT:** Selye's definition of stress, its initiation through tissue activation or injury, and potential signaling molecules involved.

**RAY PEAT:** "Selye divides stress into three phases: alarm, resistance (or adaptation), and exhaustion. Three tissues are usually the first to show effects: thymolymphatic tissue shrinks, gastrointestinal tissue becomes inflamed and bleeds, and the adrenal cortex becomes enlarged."
**CONTEXT:** Selye's three phases of stress response and the initial tissue changes observed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Selye classifies steroids into anti- and pro-inflammatory. Cortisol is a typical anti-inflammatory hormone; DOC (deoxycorticosterone) is considered by Selye to be a natural pro-inflammatory steroid, but other endocrinologists point out that it is normally present only in very small amounts, as a precursor of aldosterone (which helps retain sodium in stress — sodium probably helps activate the glycolytic pathway, speeding the use of sugar). Some of Selye's stress experiments involved giving a large dose of sodium, presumably increasing the amount of DOC in the tissues, and intensifying stress symptoms."
**CONTEXT:** Selye's classification of steroids and the role of cortisol, DOC, aldosterone, and sodium in the stress response.

**RAY PEAT:** "Injury and exertion have in common the need for more fuel. | think the blood sugar level is therefore useful at least for understanding stress, even if other substances are involved in the "signaling" or coordinating process. From my own experience, | am inclined to believe that blood sugar is an important integrating factor, and that the organism can probably sense small or rapid fluctuations that would be very hard to detect by the usual laboratory procedures. For example, males in particular are known to secrete adrenaline under the stress of having blood drawn, and this tends to raise the concentration of blood sugar. Even when extremely large and prolonged variations in blood sugar are found, the concept of "normal range" allows most physicians to dismiss them as being insignificant — even when the patient develops classical symptoms of hypoglycemia: if the patient faints or has convulsions when his blood sugar falls 50 mg.%, the physician is likely to note the "psychosomatic reaction" or the "coincidental epilepsy," since a "normal variation" in blood sugar concentration supposedly couldn't be responsible. More physicians are now recognizing that the rate of fall can be as important as the absolute level."
**CONTEXT:** The critical role of blood sugar in understanding stress and the tendency of medical professionals to dismiss significant blood sugar fluctuations.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hans Selye sometimes used an injected metal, such as iron salts, to experimentally sensitize animals to stress, making it easier to produce arthritis. He found that vitamin E could offset this effect of iron."
**CONTEXT:** Selye's research on iron salts inducing stress and arthritis, and vitamin E's protective effect.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ordinary refined cane or beet sugar is sucrose, a "double sugar" or disaccharide. (Some of this chemical terminology is useful for understanding food labels.) The two units making up sucrose are glucose and fructose. These are monosaccharides, and since they contain six carbon atoms, they can also be called hexoses. Glucose is classed as an "aldose" because it contains an aldehyde group: by just shifting the position of two hydrogen atoms onto this aldehyde group, glucose turns into fructose (a keto sugar or ketose")."
**CONTEXT:** A basic chemical explanation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose.

**RAY PEAT:** "Carbohydrates are usually split into monosaccharides before being absorbed. They are carried to the liver, where glucose can be used to replenish the storage form of carbohydrate, glycogen. If there is more glucose than the liver can store, it reaches the pancreas where it stimulates the release of insulin, which disposes of the sugar by stimulating synthesis of fat and glycogen. The insulin is only slowly degraded, so it will go on lowering blood sugar if sugar isn't being absorbed continuously from the gut. If blood sugar gets too low, an alarm reaction will produce adrenalin to restore blood sugar, with the result that the person may feel anxious."
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic pathway of carbohydrates, from absorption to storage and the hormonal regulation of blood sugar by insulin and adrenalin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Insulin should be about 30% destroyed by the liver each time the blood circulates to the liver, but a pantothenic acid deficiency will prevent this regulation. Low thyroid also interferes with liver function limiting the storage and release of glycogen."
**CONTEXT:** The role of the liver and pantothenic acid in insulin regulation, and how low thyroid function impairs glycogen metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Fructose doesn't stimulate the pancreas as glucose does. It is gradually converted into glucose. In people with high blood lipids, however, it is utilized by liver and fat tissues several times faster than it is in normal people: it is as if the cellular "doors" were already open in these people, maybe as a result of high insulin levels, and the cells accept fructose more rapidly than normal. This doesn't imply that fructose is to be avoided as rigidly as is glucose, since | don't think there is any evidence that it initiates any problem. Grapes are rich in glucose; other fruits have varying quantities of fructose: honey contains some fructose. Jerusalem artichokes that have been kept in storage are a very good source of fructose. Onions are another source. | suspect that even glucose wouldn't be so hard on the body if it were always taken with potassium and other nutrients involved in its metabolism."
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic differences between fructose and glucose, and the importance of potassium and other nutrients for glucose metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Potassium is necessary for utilization of sugar, and should probably always be tried as a supplement in the diabetic diet, especially since fruits, an important source of potassium, may be avoided because of their sugar. Some B vitamins (B1 and B2 and probably niacin) have similar effects on the utilization of sugar. Some forms of diabetes involve normal or high levels of insulin, others, a lack of insulin; both have been found to respond to nutrition, but especially the high insulin form. The pancreas can be damaged by prolonged malnutrition, so that the inability to produce insulin may be permanent. Magnesium and vitamin B6 deficiencies are known to be involved in damage to the pancreas. Insulin itself is only part of the "insulin-like" system (Adv in Metabolic Disorders 7, p.26, 1974); proper treatment requires a proper study of all factors. | know of children who have been put immediately on insulin for life, after one urine test showed glucose, even though the test followed a stressful infection. Stress can cause sugar to appear in the urine, as can many other conditions, and this does not call for insulin treatment."
**CONTEXT:** The role of potassium and B vitamins in sugar utilization, the impact of malnutrition on the pancreas, and the misdiagnosis of diabetes based on stress-induced glucosuria.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just before menstruation begins, and just after giving birth, the level of estrogen in the body can be high, and out of proportion to other hormones. Tension, anxiety, depression, being too easily upset emotionally, and even having hallucinations can result from this hormone imbalance. Excess estrogen causes the body to accumulate copper, and copper poisoning itself (often caused by water that is contaminated, for example by plumbing, a hot water heater, or utensils) is known to cause symptoms of schizophrenia. Menopause is another time of frequent emotional upsets, for many women. A type of psychosis sometimes occurs at menopause. Since it is easier to test for excess copper than for excess estrogen, it might be worthwhile to have this test done when there are emotional problems during menopause, around menstruation, or in the first few weeks after giving birth. Tension resulting from too much copper or estrogen can be relieved nutritionally. Usually a zinc supplement is necessary — about 20 mg. a day; about 30 mg. of vitamin B6 has been recommended for this problem, but the amount varies with the individual. The other B vitamins, and vitamins E and A should also be used. Sometimes as much as 500 mg. of niacin can be required to stop a "hysterical" feeling. The mildly sedative action of magnesium can also have a dramatic effect. One half to one gram of magnesium is enough if it is taken in a highly soluble (and assimilable) form such as magnesium chloride. Since low blood sugar is often a factor in anxiety or depression, adequate protein and calories must be eaten regularly. Biotin (1-2 mg.) can stop some depressions. Fruit is very useful in maintaining blood sugar since it provides sugar with potassium which helps to avoid an insulin reaction."
**CONTEXT:** The link between hormonal imbalances (especially excess estrogen and copper) and emotional problems, including anxiety, depression, and psychosis, and the nutritional interventions that can help.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women are increasingly being diagnosed as "manic-depressive," though this used to be thought of as mainly a man's disease. | think the new popularity of lithium "therapy" has contributed to this diagnostic trend. Even if the problem is what had previously been described as "premenstrual depression," lithium therapy does work, though some patients complain of tremor, dullness, and clumsiness."
**CONTEXT:** The increasing diagnosis of "manic-depressive" disorder in women and the potential role of lithium therapy, with its associated side effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several of the known biochemical effects of lithium are similar to those of progesterone, including antagonism to aldosterone, modification of serotonin metabolism, elevation of nerve thresholds, and facilitated disposition of ammonia. (Other psycho-active chemicals which have some overlap with progesterone are DOPA, bromocryptine, and physostigmine.)"
**CONTEXT:** The biochemical similarities between lithium and progesterone, suggesting potential overlap in their therapeutic actions.

**RAY PEAT:** "One type of "schizophrenia," and the very common symptom of "agoraphobia" or reclusiveness, are associated with high levels of porphyrins and pyrroles. Fasting, liver damage, and increased estrogen levels can raise the concentrations of certain of these substances; they seem to promote urinary loss of zinc and vitamin B6. Estrogen promotes copper (and iron, and calcium) retention, and copper tends to displace zinc. The high levels of copper, iron and lead which are found in many people with mental problems may be secondary to a hormone disturbance. Thyroid gland or progesterone, or both, can produce a complete disappearance of mental symptoms when those symptoms result from any biochemical imbalance that can be rectified hormonally, because these two substances have very generalized regulatory functions. | feel that any "diagnosis" (naming in Latin) of a "functional mental disturbance" is at best irrelevant, and may be very destructive. People with diagnoses of "schizophrenia," "epilepsy," "manic-depressive psychosis," "Parkinsonism," "myasthenia gravis," "involutional psychosis," "neuritis," "sclerosis," etc., have reported that they felt normal or improved after taking progesterone, often within 40 minutes. Magnesium, as epsom salts or magnesium chloride or carbonate, can relieve some cases or irritability and tension, even when something else, such as hypothyroidism, is the basic cause."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between porphyrins, pyrroles, and mental health conditions, and the broad regulatory roles of thyroid and progesterone in addressing these imbalances.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many symptoms have been blamed on cerebral edema, which might result from too much estrogen. However, the speed with which some symptoms disappear suggest other possible explanations. Just as veins in the forehead shrink immediately if a large amount of sugar is taken for a migraine, | have seen veins (back of hand) disappear with progesterone treatment, just when a suicidal depression is lifting. This suggests that there may be a "migraine" condition in the blood vessels of the limbic system of the brain, but there are also very rapid shifts in brain chemistry."
**CONTEXT:** The rapid symptom relief observed with progesterone treatment, suggesting a potential "migraine" condition in the brain's blood vessels and rapid shifts in brain chemistry.

**RAY PEAT:** "Light and smell are known to affect hormone production. A musky material (Le Magnen's "exaltolide," probably includes androstenol) is probably a social regulator of hormones — perfume containing musk might affect the woman who wears it. Bright lights for 18 hours per day can correct some hormone-mood problems."
**CONTEXT:** The influence of light and smell on hormone production and mood regulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Canker sores, herpes infections, and bleeding gums, if associated with mental symptoms, suggest a thyroid and/or progesterone deficiency."
**CONTEXT:** The association of canker sores, herpes infections, and bleeding gums with mental symptoms, pointing to potential thyroid and/or progesterone deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "Cancer overstimulates the anti-stress adrenocortical hormones, and usually produces extreme wasting from mobilization of fat and protein; blood sugar and glycogen storage are disturbed. During or after cancer treatment the "hypoglycemia" diet seems desirable: frequent small feedings, liver (or similar nutrients), magnesium, potassium. Vitamins A, E, C, and pantothenic acid are particularly important in stress, but all nutrients are necessary."
**CONTEXT:** The metabolic impact of cancer, including stress hormone overstimulation, wasting, and blood sugar disturbances, and the nutritional recommendations for managing these issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "In an article on inflammation, the Encyclopedia Britannica makes this comment which is extremely interesting in connection with the fact that cancer involves a failure of the immune reaction: Severe starvation or...deficiency of protein may restrict antibody formation. Hormones of the adrenal cortex in sufficient amounts depress formation of certain types of antibody. The adrenal cortex secretions are capable of altering the inflammatory reaction in several ways: excessive amounts of the hydrocortisone type of secretion reduce the quantity of exudate formed and the amount of fibrous tissue and capillary proliferation."
**CONTEXT:** The link between protein deficiency, adrenal cortex hormones, and impaired antibody formation, relevant to cancer's immune evasion.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 1950, prisoners were experimentally injected with cancer cells; those who already had cancer developed tumors where cells were injected; healthy patients apparently never developed cancer, though a reasonable follow-up wasn't done. Cortisone treatment is known to speed growth and spreading of injected cancer cells. Cancer patients are typically unable to even produce a normal inflammation, as if they are powerfully dosed with the anti-stress cortisone-type hormones. The failure of the immune system, which can normally wipe out cancer cells as they develop, seems to be an essential feature of cancer, and as quoted above, adrenocortical hormones can suppress antibody formation; the conversion of body protein to sugar (an effect of these hormones) causes shrinking of the thymus gland, which is essential for healthy immune reactions. Although there may be other things involved in the immune suppression, part of it appears to be this drain on the body's protein, which can be alleviated nutritionally. Dr. W. D. Kelly (One answer to cancer) describes an interesting test for cancer based on this problem in protein metabolism. A drop of blood squeezed from a puncture in the finger should stand up in a spherical drop, but when a person is developing cancer it spreads instead of rounding up. (See the section on edema)"
**CONTEXT:** The role of cortisone and adrenocortical hormones in suppressing the immune system and promoting cancer growth, and a potential diagnostic test for cancer based on protein metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress apparently increases a person's need for all nutrients including calories and protein. The vitamins most commonly used for resisting stress are A, C, E, and pantothenic acid. The minerals magnesium, calcium, potassium and zinc can help in the first stages of stress, and sodium supplements may be needed in the last extreme stage of stress when the adrenals have been exhausted."
**CONTEXT:** The increased nutritional demands during stress and the specific vitamins and minerals that support stress resistance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Dr. E. C. Barton-Wright and Dr. W. A. Elliot have found pantothenic acid (at least 25 to 50 milligrams per day) useful in arthritis. Arthritis is commonly a result of stress, stress increases the need for that vitamin and also for other nutrients including vitamins A and C. Arthritis often follows surgery. Sometimes surgery can bring on chronic allergic problems (hay fever, gas, fatigue, etc.) but it can also apparently weaken the immune system so badly that old allergies disappear after an operation."
**CONTEXT:** The benefits of pantothenic acid for arthritis and the connection between stress, surgery, allergies, and immune system function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress inhibits the thyroid, and can lower progesterone (and/or testosterone) while raising estrogen. Recent work by Siiteri and his group shows a hormonal involvement in various "autoimmune" diseases. Females are much more susceptible to these sicknesses than are males. Systemic lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis are common."
**CONTEXT:** The hormonal shifts induced by stress, including thyroid inhibition and altered sex hormone levels, and their link to autoimmune diseases, particularly in women.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin A offsets a protein deficiency, and a protein deficiency can damage immunity."
**CONTEXT:** The role of vitamin A in counteracting protein deficiency and its impact on immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Any activity, if planned and completed according to plan without interruption, can reduce stress. Enforced inactivity, and inability to achieve what was intended, are powerful stressors. The adrenal hormones and mineral metabolism are disturbed in stress, whether the cause is a disorganized style of life, or the injury of surgery. The diet should include about 90 grams of protein (in frequent feedings), eggs as a source of sulfur (needed to synthesize joint lubricants, for example), and should keep the ratio of magnesium to calcium high (as with vegetables, bran, fruit), and the phosphate intake low (this would include using green leaves in place of some meat, as well as using cheese). Vitamins C, E, and pantothenic acid are needed in especially large amount in stress. Vitamins A and B2 are also essential for production of the anti-stress hormones. Inositol is known to protect biological materials from many kinds of damage, and might have this effect in arthritis, but | don't know of any research in this particular application."
**CONTEXT:** Strategies for stress reduction, including planned activity, proper nutrition (protein, eggs, magnesium-to-calcium ratio), and specific vitamins (C, E, pantothenic acid, A, B2), with a mention of inositol's potential protective role.

**RAY PEAT:** "Iron salts, and other heavy metals, have been shown by Hans Selye to produce arthritis, possibly by their ability to destroy vitamins E and C."
**CONTEXT:** Selye's findings on iron salts and heavy metals inducing arthritis, potentially by depleting vitamins E and C.

**RAY PEAT:** "Copper is a "specific" oxidant for vitamin C. It is associated with many inflammatory diseases, and should probably be better investigated in "degenerative" diseases, including arthritis and glaucoma."
**CONTEXT:** The role of copper as an oxidant for vitamin C and its potential association with inflammatory and degenerative diseases like arthritis and glaucoma.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pantothenic acid in very large doses was recently found to protect against stress even when an animal's adrenals were removed. Since the nutrient is needed to destroy insulin, | think part of its anti-stress effect comes from minimizing hypoglycemia, and so reducing the amount of cortisone needed."
**CONTEXT:** The potent anti-stress effects of high-dose pantothenic acid, potentially by regulating insulin and minimizing hypoglycemia, thereby reducing cortisone requirements.

**RAY PEAT:** "On the cellular level, stress lowers the energy charge. Systemically, stress inhibits oxidative metabolism. Both of these observations indicate that the "basic" anti-stress hormone would be thyroid. Hypothyroidism often involves arthritis — sometimes the tiny bones of the ear which transmit sound are affected. Ringing of the ears and deafness for high sounds are common in hypothyroidism."
**CONTEXT:** The cellular and systemic effects of stress on energy metabolism and the central role of thyroid hormone as an anti-stress agent, linking hypothyroidism to arthritis and auditory issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 25 years ago cortisone was found to increase the metastatic spread of cancer. Since it raises blood sugar by dissolving protein from the tissues, the immune system and muscles are damaged. When the muscle mass is diminished, loss of fat becomes more difficult. Vitamin A can apparently help offset immunosuppression by cortisone. Use of cortisone can result in puffiness and water retention. It is a way of exaggerating the body's normal hormone response to stress, and may be justified if the adrenal glands are damaged. Pantothenic acid and vitamins C and A can help restore the glands' natural activity."
**CONTEXT:** The detrimental effects of cortisone, including promoting cancer spread, muscle and immune system damage, and water retention, and the supportive role of vitamins A, C, and pantothenic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin B2 deficiency is also known to affect the adrenal glands, and has been suspected of contributing to the development of Addison's disease."
**CONTEXT:** The potential link between vitamin B2 deficiency and adrenal gland dysfunction, possibly contributing to Addison's disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "Cortisone causes the liver to produce estrogen."
**CONTEXT:** The effect of cortisone on estrogen production by the liver.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some people who are supposed to be "experts" quite crazily claim that what you eat has nothing to do with how fast you age. Experiments with animals, observations of other cultures, and even some experiments with humans have shown clearly that nutrition can have a profound effect on the body changes which are called aging. In the three regions where a very high proportion of the population lives to be more that 100, the average daily calorie intake is only about 1500, which is considered "inadequate" by most nutritionists. Animals which are kept on a low calorie diet live much longer than those that are fed more, so we can assume that the low calorie diet contributes to the long life of those three groups. However, other similarities have been found in the diets in those three regions. Their food is fresh, they use a lot of animal fat (e.g., milk and cheese), they regularly eat greens, and some of them tend to drink quite a bit of alcohol, though in unrefined forms such as wine."
**CONTEXT:** The significant impact of nutrition on aging, citing longevity in certain populations with low-calorie, fresh food diets rich in animal fat and greens.

**RAY PEAT:** "All of the essential nutrients are needed constantly to prevent deterioration of the body. At different times, nutrients such as vitamin C, pantothenic acid, or vitamin E, have been identified as methods to prevent premature aging. In our culture, many people do have severe deficiencies of those nutrients, but any dietary deficiency can cause degenerative changes. | have experimentally reversed a variety of degenerative changes with special nutrition, but the problem always exists within a particular person's physiology, and can't necessarily be solved by a standardized diet. You have to learn to know what your body needs at a particular time. This will be made easier if your basic diet is roughly like that described above — moderately low calorie intake, fairly high protein intake, with high quality proteins such as eggs, milk, and leaves, and with fresh fruit or vegetables every day."
**CONTEXT:** The continuous need for essential nutrients to prevent aging and the importance of personalized nutrition based on individual physiology.

**RAY PEAT:** "Study of many different species, including humans, shows that aging is slower in individuals that have a larger brain in relation to body size. Brain size is strongly influenced both by prenatal nutrition and by nutrition in early childhood. The first year and a half is extremely important for the development of intelligence, since brain cells are becoming more numerous up to that age, but growth and development of the brain can still be stunted by poor nutrition later. Progesterone is an important factor in brain development: estrogen inhibits brain development. Unsaturated fats also inhibit brain development if used in excess, and recent studies show that they also increase visible aging of the skin."
**CONTEXT:** The correlation between brain-to-body size ratio and slower aging, and the critical role of progesterone and the detrimental effects of estrogen and unsaturated fats on brain development.

**RAY PEAT:** "| have talked to several women in their 20s who complained of sensations of heat around their heads, night sweats, sudden flushing, and other symptoms that are associated with the menopause. Katharina Dalton has found that premenstrual symptoms, which result from a relative estrogen surplus and a progesterone deficiency, often continue during the menopause. Siiteri and his group have discovered that one of the steroids (androstenedione, usually associated with the male hormones) is converted to a form of estrogen at an increasing rate as a person gets older, at all ages they studied, from 20 to 80, in both men and women. Strickler found that only 10% of his patients with menopausal symptoms such as flushing, could feel and benefit from estrogen when it was alternated with a placebo. These studies, and a few dozen others, have convinced me that the symptoms of menopause result mainly from a progesterone deficiency, relative to the estrogens. The 10% who really feel better from estrogen possibly have an estrogen deficiency, but this has not been determined, and several other things could account for the "lift" they feel for example, a healthy thyroid gland will respond to elevated estrogen with an increased output of thyroxin, which at least would make the person feel different, and might raise blood sugar, increase alertness, etc."
**CONTEXT:** The prevalence of menopausal symptoms in younger women and the primary cause being progesterone deficiency relative to estrogen, with a discussion of estrogen conversion and the potential role of thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1979 menopausal flushing was found to be associated with an elevation of the pituitary hormone, LH. A lack of progesterone is known to cause a rise in LH."
**CONTEXT:** The association between menopausal flushing, elevated LH levels, and progesterone deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "Digitalis and progesterone have very similar effects on the heart (Szent-Gyorgyi, Muscle Contraction). Digitalis is able to raise blood pressure and increase urine production, apparently by increasing the tone of the arterioles (Abram, 1910). If progesterone's effect on muscle includes such an effect on arterioles, then the "puzzle" of menopausal — and premenopausal — flushing is no puzzle, but is merely one symptom of a progesterone deficiency relative to estrogen. Progesterone does have a diuretic effect, but this has been attributed to an antagonism to aldosterone, rather than to an effect on arterioles."
**CONTEXT:** The potential cardiovascular effects of progesterone, similar to digitalis, and its role in menopausal flushing as a symptom of progesterone deficiency.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides the nutrients needed to regulate the estrogen level (protein and B vitamins) and nutrients needed by the thyroid (e.g., iodine, manganese, and cobalt), special attention should be given to the anti-stress vitamins which are involved in progesterone synthesis (vitamin A, pantothenic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E) and to the nutrients that are known to be "wasted" by excess estrogen: folic acid, zinc, and vitamin B6, particularly. Vitamin B6 is needed to synthesize materials that regulate blood vessel tone and that act as brain modulators, governing sleep, emotions, alertness, etc. Memory of dreams is said to be promoted by adequate B6 (Pfeiffer, 1975). White marks on the fingernails, especially of the right hand, are suggestive of a zinc deficiency. Brittle fingernails are likely to result from too much estrogen. or inhibited thyroid function; vitamin A and eggs are useful, but calcium and gelatin are not. Magnesium carbonate is very useful for stabilizing nerves and muscles while raising the energy level: one gram a day of magnesium is a reasonable amount, but many tablets now contain only 15 to 50 mgs."
**CONTEXT:** Nutritional recommendations for managing menopausal symptoms, focusing on progesterone synthesis, counteracting estrogen's effects, and addressing deficiencies indicated by fingernail changes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Excess estrogen is known to cause hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex. Since estrogen stimulates insulin release and lowers blood sugar, the hypertrophy may be to compensate by raising blood sugar."
**CONTEXT:** The link between excess estrogen, adrenal cortex hypertrophy, and the compensatory mechanisms for lowered blood sugar.

**RAY PEAT:** "The distribution of fat is similar in aging and in Cushing's syndrome. Vitamin E is known to shift enzyme activities in a way that would offset this distribution, and this might occur in cases caused by hormone disturbances other than mere aging."
**CONTEXT:** The shared fat distribution patterns in aging and Cushing's syndrome, and the potential role of vitamin E in mitigating these effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "The fall of spermine which occurs in senility, in estrogen excess, and in hypoglycemia should also be investigated in Cushing's syndrome."
**CONTEXT:** The potential connection between spermine levels and aging, estrogen excess, hypoglycemia, and Cushing's syndrome.

**RAY PEAT:** "The changes in endometrium, and the "castrate" type of vaginal epithelium are similar in both states. (Is the influence of contraceptive pills on vaginal epithelium what causes pain in intercourse?)"
**CONTEXT:** The shared endometrial and vaginal epithelial changes in aging and Cushing's syndrome, and a question regarding the impact of contraceptive pills on vaginal health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Osteoporosis and diabetes are frequently part of Cushing's syndrome, and are also more common after the menopause. Cortisone therapy (even when used on the skin) can cause mineral loss — recently an 8 year old girl who had stopped growing was found to have osteoporosis resulting from use of a cortisone ointment. Thyroxine elevates magnesium levels in the tissue and is known to promote bone regeneration and mineralization. Estrogen's antagonism to thyroxin is so general that we could suspect that it would also inhibit healthy mineralization. Estrogen has long been used during and after the menopause for its supposed ability to prevent osteoporosis, but this is now known to be incorrect: any beneficial effect it has on osteoporosis is only temporary (C. Martin, Textbook of Endocrine Physiology, 1976)."
**CONTEXT:** The overlap between aging, menopause, and Cushing's syndrome, including osteoporosis and diabetes, and the detrimental effects of cortisone and estrogen on bone health, contrasting with the benefits of thyroxine.

**RAY PEAT:** "In animal experiments, it has been found that cortisone can produce diabetes, apparently by damaging the pancreas, and it has been suspected that chronic stress (which can be brought on by low blood sugar) can be a factor in producing diabetes."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for cortisone to induce diabetes by damaging the pancreas and the role of chronic stress and low blood sugar in its development.

**RAY PEAT:** "Aging, stress, menopause, Cushing's syndrome, and the premenstrual syndrome all overlap so much that each state can probably give us some insight into the others. An elevated estrogen/progesterone ratio is likely to be a common feature."
**CONTEXT:** The significant overlap between aging, stress, menopause, Cushing's syndrome, and premenstrual syndrome, with an elevated estrogen/progesterone ratio as a common underlying factor.

**RAY PEAT:** "A recent newspaper article about a former Oregon politician says He was in excellent physical condition." "So for all these years, he hasn't smoked, he's kept his weight down to his normal 165 pounds. He has cut down on eating fatty foods and has watched his diet carefully." "| was in good shape," he said in his hospital room after being treated for the nearly fatal heart attack he had while jogging. | quote this because it shows how taking certain stylish "precautions" can give a person a false sense of security. Since a healthy liver will produce cholesterol to make up for what is lacking in the diet, avoiding high cholesterol foods won't necessarily lower blood cholesterol. In an article called "Fat has less cholesterol than lean," Raymond Reiser of Texas A & M University points out that 100 grams of a chicken drumstick has 91 mg. of cholesterol, while pork has only about 60 mg. per 100 grams. "On the calorie basis," he says, the cholesterol content of lean cuts "is about 4 to 6.6 times as high" as that of fat."
**CONTEXT:** The deceptive nature of certain health precautions and the liver's role in cholesterol production, with data on cholesterol content in lean vs. fatty meats.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin C is now known to lower blood cholesterol. Eggs are rich in cholesterol, but they also contain lecithin, which appears to make the cholesterol useful, or at least less harmful. Niacin and vitamin E also help to regulate cholesterol. High insulin levels, caused by eating sugar, seem to be important in allowing cholesterol to damage the blood vessels. Cholesterol is used in the production of many hormones, including sex and anti-stress hormones."
**CONTEXT:** The role of vitamin C, lecithin (from eggs), niacin, and vitamin E in cholesterol regulation, and the detrimental effect of high insulin levels on blood vessels.

**RAY PEAT:** "High cholesterol usually indicates low thyroid function. When thyroid is low, cholesterol isn't converted efficiently into progesterone. The real cause of heart attacks seems to be hypothyroidism and its effects, including loss of magnesium. Stressful exercise can aggravate hypothyroidism."
**CONTEXT:** The connection between high cholesterol, low thyroid function, impaired progesterone synthesis, magnesium loss, and heart attacks, with stressful exercise exacerbating hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although estrogen is known to advance the aging of collagen in all tissues that have been studied, including skin, it has been promoted as a "youth drug." The beef industry uses it because it makes cows swell up with fat and water, to increase profits: it is no longer legal to soak meat — except ham — in water before weighing it for sale. Women, like cows, will puff up with water and fat under the influence of estrogen, and wrinkles will naturally be smoothed out, but the skin itself is actually losing its elasticity faster when estrogen is used. Testosterone and progesterone both have direct anti-estrogen activity. Testosterone lotion was tested on one armpit of an old woman. Her tissue had atrophied so that there was no hair, the sweat glands didn't function, and the skin was thin and wrinkled. After several weeks of daily use of the lotion, hair and sweat glands had returned to normal, and the skin was thicker, firmer, and smoother (photographs were published). Her other armpit remained as before. Progesterone has been found to reverse the chemical changes which occur in collagen with aging. In pregnancy, progesterone is probably responsible for the formation of relaxin, a hormone which makes the fibrous tissues become very stretchy, so the birth canal can open without damage. Some women notice that joints become very limber for a few days every month, suggesting that relaxin can be formed even when the woman is not pregnant."
**CONTEXT:** The aging effects of estrogen on skin and collagen, its use in the beef industry, and the beneficial anti-aging and tissue-regenerating properties of testosterone and progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of the changes of aging probably relate to "auto-immune" reactions, in which the body attacks itself; both testosterone and progesterone normalize the immune system, suppressing auto-immune problems. There are several dietary practices which will promote the formation of progesterone, but the most effective is to use liver once a week, to use eggs daily, and to avoid foods which inhibit the thyroid, such as raw cabbage and broccoli. Butter contains some progesterone. Young women might grow moustaches if they used testosterone cream on their skin very often (one day a month, at ovulation, women normally produce considerable testosterone) but natural progesterone lotion could be used safely for its effect on collagen. Progesterone has also been used to eliminate excess facial hair (photographs of this effect of progestins have been published in the J. of Steroid Biochemistry)."
**CONTEXT:** The role of testosterone and progesterone in normalizing the immune system and suppressing autoimmune problems, along with dietary recommendations for progesterone synthesis and the use of progesterone for facial hair reduction.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen has been promoted (on grounds that are at best dubious) as a therapy for menopause, for aging skin, for heart disease, for cancer, for premenstrual syndrome, for endometriosis, for preventing miscarriages, for nervousness and depression, for abnormal bleeding, and for osteoporosis. From Sept. 21, 1977, drug companies are required to give doctors and druggists brochures with estrogen, warning of the risk of cancer, and advising that estrogen not be given for nervousness, depression, or for "restoring youthfulness" during menopause, because it is ineffective for those purposes (UPI, July 20-21, 1977). However, they failed to mention studies which had already reported that estrogen causes, rather than cures, heart attacks. It causes a magnesium deficiency, which promotes clotting (Seelig and Heggtveit. Amer. J. Clin. Nutr. 27, pp. 59-79, 1974). The magnesium deficiency also promotes abnormal fat metabolism, contributing to heart disease. Even before estrogen was chemically identified, it was known to promote breast cancer; in the 1930s it was shown to cause tissue aging, fibroid tumors, various cancers, premenstrual syndrome and menstrual abnormalities, and to induce abortions. Nevertheless, from 1947 to 1964 a synthetic estrogen, DES, already demonstrated to be highly toxic, was prescribed to millions of women to prevent miscarriages. When women succeeded in having babies in spite of this mistreatment, it typically caused girl babies to later develop vaginal cancer, and many of the boy babies grew up to be sterile. By the early 1960s it was apparent that birth control drugs had a bigger market than drugs for the miscarriage trade, so DES was switched over to use in birth control pills, and is still widely used as a morning after pill."
**CONTEXT:** A critical examination of estrogen's purported benefits versus its known harms, including cancer risk, heart disease, and reproductive issues, highlighting the historical misuse of DES.

**RAY PEAT:** "The same effect of plumpness has been sold to women as "young skin," even though estrogen actually causes aging of the connective tissue in skin.) Meat graders have said that DES lowers the quality of the meat (apart from the residue toxicity), but the increased weight makes it a profitable practice."
**CONTEXT:** The deceptive marketing of estrogen for "young skin" despite its aging effects on connective tissue, and its use in the meat industry for increased weight.

**RAY PEAT:** "By 1950, any normally perceptive person was aware that physicians were doing things exactly backwards in many cases. This was not the result of a new homeopathic philosophy, or the "hair of the dog that bit you" theory. It was the result of drug companies’ having their patented products, and knowing how to use the medical establishment for their own purposes, without regard to science. Their huge profits allowed them to spend several thousand dollars each year on each physician, sometimes including gifts of color television sets and free vacations, and discounts on things for the doctors’ own use. Probably the most terrible use of their wealth was the gradual reversal of scientific opinion, achieved through grants to scientists who got the results they wanted, and cancellation of grants when the results went the wrong way, and through financial support for professional meetings and publications, and through influence on the editorial policies of medical journals by the threatened withholding of advertising."
**CONTEXT:** The influence of pharmaceutical companies on medical practices and scientific opinion, driven by profit motives and marketing strategies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Probably the last, strongest argument for the widespread use of estrogen is that it supposedly delays the development of osteoporosis. The absence of osteoporosis in old women in many other countries is never discussed in the professional meetings on osteoporosis subsidized by the drug companies. Constance Martin, in her Textbook of Endocrine Physiology, (1976), says that "estrogens are not useful if administered over long periods of time...." M.R. Urist (in Biochem. and Physiol. of Bone, vol.2, G.H. Bourne, 1972 ed.) says that estrogen doesn't restore bone mass “to a degree demonstrable by roentgenography," that excess growth hormone "may aggravate" the disorder, and that estrogen stimulates the release of growth hormone. The argument for using estrogen to cure or prevent osteoporosis is based on the fact that estrogen causes diminished urinary excretion of calcium. A vitamin E deficiency (and estrogen is known to increase the need for vitamin E) causes calcium to be retained by muscles. Any toxin, in fact, causes calcium retention in the soft tissues — for example, when the heart is deprived of oxygen, it absorbs calcium. Since no skeletal improvement can be demonstrated by x-rays, | suspect that the improved calcium retention is merely a toxic effect of estrogen. A proper control in this sort of experiment would be to compare the effect of toxins such as iodoacetate and cyanide, with the effect of estrogen."
**CONTEXT:** The dubious claims about estrogen's efficacy in preventing osteoporosis, supported by evidence of its temporary and potentially toxic effects on calcium metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The kidneys produce a material which raises blood pressure, and the production of this chemical is increased when the supply of oxygen is not adequate. Other tissues probably produce similar chemicals. Normally, as soon as the blood pressure is increased, circulation is improved so that an adequate amount of oxygen is delivered to the tissues."
**CONTEXT:** The kidney's role in blood pressure regulation and the link between oxygen supply and blood pressure.

**RAY PEAT:** "However, there are many processes that can waste oxygen, and some of these tend to increase gradually with age, so that the blood pressure rises steadily over the years."
**CONTEXT:** The age-related increase in blood pressure due to processes that waste oxygen.

**RAY PEAT:** "General tissue damage, malnutrition, and hormone imbalance can all produce conditions in which oxygen is consumed without producing a normal amount of energy. Also, a failure of the small blood vessels to open properly can cause oxygen deprivation, as can a tendency to form small clots."
**CONTEXT:** Factors contributing to oxygen deprivation and energy inefficiency, including tissue damage, malnutrition, hormone imbalance, and circulatory issues.

**RAY PEAT:** "All kinds of stress tend to make the liver sluggish. The liver normally removes toxins and excess hormones from the body. Estrogen can accumulate to high levels if the liver isn't fully active. One effect of estrogen is to promote oxidation of a type which doesn't provide energy, thus raising oxygen requirements. Another effect of estrogen is to inhibit a proteolytic enzyme in the blood, which normally dissolves clots. This is why birth control pills can cause blood clotting, strokes and other circulatory problems. Some of the long-recognized signs of excessive estrogen are vascular "spiders," little red dots that some doctors like to burn off, brown spots on the skin, lumps in the breasts, a slight bluish color in some skin areas, puffiness, dizziness, etc."
**CONTEXT:** The impact of stress on liver function, estrogen accumulation, and its detrimental effects on blood clotting and circulation, along with common signs of estrogen excess.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin E promotes oxidation in many ways, and seems to specifically oppose many of the effects of excess estrogen. For example, it can help protect the liver against damage by toxins (all the nutrients are needed by the liver though). It opposes the tendency of estrogen to create "age pigment." It activates the blood protease, and so speeds clot removal and prevents clot formation inside blood vessels, but there is also evidence that it promotes normal clotting in wounds. The products of dissolving the proteins of clots are small peptide molecules called kinins, which act as local hormones to relax the walls of blood vessels, allowing easier flow of blood, better oxygenation, and lower blood pressure. Inside the cells, vitamin E inhibits destructive and wasteful oxidation (such as is involved in aging and cancer) and makes the normal oxidative process more efficient, providing more useful energy for a given amount of oxygen."
**CONTEXT:** The multifaceted benefits of vitamin E in counteracting estrogen's effects, protecting the liver, preventing age pigment, promoting clot removal, and enhancing cellular energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** "One theory of vitamin E action is that it protects progesterone. A recent discovery is that a prostaglandin (a hormone made from fatty acids) regulates blood pressure via the kidney — vitamin E protects fatty acids."
**CONTEXT:** The potential role of vitamin E in protecting progesterone and its interaction with prostaglandins in blood pressure regulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Recently it has been found that some natural vitamin E is contaminated with estrogen from the plant source, e.g., alfalfa."
**CONTEXT:** The discovery of estrogen contamination in some natural vitamin E supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "Part of the reason for the common medical disbelief in the efficacy of vitamin E is that it doesn't work like a drug — a big dose doesn't immediately force the blood pressure down. Sometimes, in fact, the first effect is to strengthen a damaged heart, raising the blood pressure for a few days. But it does eventually remove many of the causes of high blood pressure, and | have never seen it fail to lower high blood pressure. Synthetic vitamin E is dl-alpha tocopherol, and may be associated with the reports of fatigue and headache from 800 units a day (however, this often repeated rumor is hard to track down — sort of like stories of blindness from vitamin A or LSD). Some "natural" vitamin E brands are contaminated with the petroleum distillate used for extraction, and taste like kerosene; the name d-alpha tocopherol indicates that it has been extracted from natural oils and has the "handedness" (chirality) of most biological substances (d and l mean right and left)."
**CONTEXT:** The reasons for medical skepticism towards vitamin E, its gradual but effective action on blood pressure, and the distinction between synthetic and natural vitamin E, including potential contaminants.

**RAY PEAT:** "Other vitamins that can improve circulation by opening the small blood vessels are folic acid and niacin. Vitamin C can help to eliminate toxins that could contribute to high blood pressure. Trace minerals (such as those found in kelp and bran) and magnesium should also be considered in circulatory problems. Magnesium acts against calcium (and estrogen) in the clotting system, can prevent spasms of blood vessels, and can spare oxygen."
**CONTEXT:** Additional nutrients that support circulation and blood pressure regulation, including folic acid, niacin, vitamin C, trace minerals, and magnesium.

**RAY PEAT:** "According to Barnes, nearly all hypertension can be helped with thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** The broad efficacy of thyroid hormone in treating hypertension.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many years ago | noticed that my nearsightedness increased when | was under stress. Many people become slightly nearsighted at night, or in the dark. Since the blood sugar concentration decreases at night, and under certain stress conditions, | guessed that myopia might be caused by chronic deficiency of sugar supply to the eye. This idea was reinforced when | read that tears normally contain more glucose than do the other body fluids, and then found that my tears usually had less sugar than the eyes of people with normal vision or with farsightedness. | found that many people (not just diabetic, whose altered refraction is usually blamed on swelling of the eyeball) had experienced very rapid and large changes in their degree of nearsightedness. In young women, | found that it was very common for them to become myopic within weeks of the time they began taking birth control pills, and that their vision sometimes corrected itself when they stopped taking the pill after a year or two. In women who were on the pill, and then began taking thyroid hormone, the thyroxin tended to correct their vision. Since estrogen tends to lower the blood sugar level, and thyroxin tends to raise it, these observations are consistent with the idea that myopia is caused by a deficiency of glucose in the eye. In the walls of the eyes of chickens, cells which look like smooth muscle cells are present. If smooth muscles in the wall of the eyeball are responsible for maintaining the roundness of the eye, against the near-focus apparatus around the lens, then chronic starvation of those cells would lead to elongation of the eyeball (in proportion to the amount of close work), producing myopia. Besides avoiding the pill, all of the anti-estrogen and anti-stress nutrients should help to prevent the progression of myopia, and being outside in good weather — to promote the tear flow — might even reverse it, as thyroid hormone does."
**CONTEXT:** The hypothesis that myopia is caused by glucose deficiency in the eye, supported by observations linking it to stress, birth control pills, and the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress consumes steroids and produces the many degenerative diseases described by Hans Selye. The gastro-intestinal system becomes inflamed or ulcerated, and fibrous tissue may proliferate. Adrenal glands enlarge, and lymphoid tissue shrinks during the first stage of stress (and may enlarge later). Stress can be produced by dark cloudy northern winters, by inadequate nutrition, by the use of estrogen and many other drugs, and by the use of foods which inhibit the thyroid gland (bakery bread, lacking available manganese and containing iodate and bromate; cabbage family, and many cereals and nuts containing nitriles, cyanide or thiocyanate; meats "refined" from animals whose thyroid tissue is sold to drug companies)."
**CONTEXT:** The link between stress, steroid depletion, and degenerative diseases, including gastrointestinal issues, and the various factors that can induce stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress diseases typically have a dominant allergic aspect, and respond to steroids. Cortisone is used medically, but has side effects which could be avoided by using progesterone (though "medical" progesterone usually contains allergenic solvents and "preservatives" such as phenol). Niacin, vitamin A, vitamin C, etc., help to produce progesterone, and so often help in stress diseases, though the manufactured substances are themselves somewhat allergenic. (Vitamin A is not usually "manufactured.")"
**CONTEXT:** The allergic component of stress diseases, the medical use of cortisone versus progesterone, and the role of niacin, vitamin A, and vitamin C in progesterone synthesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "Light deprivation can be remedied artificially, but the necessary brightness is usually underestimated. Because an adequate diet is hard to get in our culture, which makes it illegal to sell the thyroid gland as food, it is often necessary to buy this powdered meat in tablet form from your physician and druggist. Meat eaters would normally get 1/4 to 1/2 grain of thyroid in their food every day if the whole animal were used. Eggs, sardines, oysters, chicken stew (non-estrogenized chickens), etc., are examples of ‘unrefined" protein foods which shouldn't interfere with thyroid function. Vegetarians often notice temporary exhilaration when they stop eating meat, probably because their thyroid has been suppressed. But a more serious hypothyroid state often follows, from a low protein inadequate vegetarian diet. Low protein diets definitely interfere with the liver's ability to detoxify estrogen and other stressors."
**CONTEXT:** The importance of light, thyroid hormone supplementation, and unrefined protein sources for managing stress diseases, and the potential pitfalls of vegetarian diets.

**RAY PEAT:** "A diet high in animal protein with other nutrients, including an appropriate amount of desiccated thyroid if "refined" proteins are used, can cause an immediate improvement in many diseases which are specifically produced by stress."
**CONTEXT:** The effectiveness of a high-protein diet combined with thyroid supplementation in improving stress-related diseases.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are several reasons to suspect that a magnesium deficiency is often involved in heart disease; in a clinical study, for example, injected magnesium sulphate helped in angina pectoris and coronary thrombosis, and tended to lower blood lipids. Numerous studies have found that a high magnesium intake is associated with low blood cholesterol levels. Magnesium also opposes clot formation and vascular spasm, which can be promoted by an excess of calcium. Estrogen was once used to "prevent heart attacks, but it is now known to induce heart attacks in both men and women. Vascular spasm is now recognized as a cause of heart attacks."
**CONTEXT:** The significant role of magnesium deficiency in heart disease, its benefits for angina and thrombosis, and the counterproductive use of estrogen for heart attack prevention.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Shutes have done extensive research on the use of vitamin E in heart disease, and found that "pharmacological" doses of 400 mg/day or more are beneficial. They have also recommended it for preventing thrombosis elsewhere in the vascular system. In problems such as varicose veins and clots in the legs, they say: It mobilizes collateral or detour circulation about the obstructed veins in the deep parts of the leg. It is the best and safest agent one can use. It not only melts away the existing clot and helps the inflammatory process to subside, but it hinders extension of that process and almost never permits a part of the clot to break loose and strike some other part of the body, such as the lungs or brain (an accident called embolism). We feel that vitamin E is very effective in preventing thrombosis within the vascular system, and acts more simply, more cheaply and much more safely than the rival anticoagulants. Other points relating to heart disease are discussed in the section on high blood pressure. Low thyroid is known to be a cause of both heart attacks and of elevated blood cholesterol. (B.Barnes; Adv. in Lipid Res.)"
**CONTEXT:** The extensive research on vitamin E for heart disease, its benefits in preventing thrombosis and varicose veins, and the link between low thyroid, heart attacks, and high cholesterol.

**RAY PEAT:** "The American Dietetic Association warns about over-dosing with kelp, because of the iodide; but the Japanese eat various iodide-rich seaweeds without the thyroid problems the A.D.A. says might occur on the kelp-lecithin-vinegar B6 diet. In the U.S. people who eat bakery bread receive about 10 times more than the RDA of iodine. Iodides are known to benefit arteriosclerosis, with visible improvement occurring in blood vessels in the retina (see Physicians Desk Reference, iodides). In old age, the walls of blood vessels tend to become hardened with calcium. In at least some tissues, it is known that calcification begins in degenerating mitochondria, and mitochondria tend to deteriorate in aging tissue. Nutrients such as iodine, vitamin E, magnesium and vitamin B2 are especially important for maintaining the function of the mitochondria, which produce most of our energy. An excess of iodine from bread or kelp is much more likely to interfere with the thyroid when the diet contains a large amount of unsaturated fat, such as safflower or soy oil, because these combine with iodine to form substances which inhibit the thyroid. These oils in themselves suppress the thyroid, and this might be a factor in the premature aging and increased cancer rate which have been observed in people who use larger amounts of those oils."
**CONTEXT:** The role of iodine in arteriosclerosis, the potential for excess iodine to interfere with thyroid function when combined with unsaturated fats, and the importance of iodine, vitamin E, magnesium, and vitamin B2 for mitochondrial health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Atherosclerotic damage (fatty deposits) of blood vessels is made worse by sugar supposedly, since insulin is involved in cholesterol damage. There is evidence that lecithin and other phospholipids protect the body against fatty degeneration. Eggs, for several reasons might actively protect against the formation of cholesterol deposits. One of the men who discovered insulin, Best, later showed that choline (a component of lecithin) can prevent fatty degeneration of the liver. Very large doses of biotin cause experimental animals to develop fatty livers (developing into liver cancer), but this effect can be offset by feeding the animal another B vitamin, inositol. Some of these effects have been known for about half a century, but too many "health professionals” are still pretending that no valid data exist. Maybe we should start asking whether these "health professionals" have a valid existence."
**CONTEXT:** The role of sugar and insulin in atherosclerosis, the protective effects of lecithin and choline, and the potential toxicity of biotin, offset by inositol.

**RAY PEAT:** "Muller in Switzerland in 1830 built the steel roller wheat mill. Jacob von Heine first diagnosed polio, 1840. First polio epidemic, Sweden, 1887. Epidemic in some region of U.S. almost every year after 1900. In 1952, epidemics in Denmark, Germany, Belgium, 33,344 cases in U.S. An epidemic of rumors that Mexicans didn't get polio because of the absence of white bread and sugar in their country. (Sugar refining developed in Europe roughly parallel with flour refining.) The white flour producers financed research by a Harvard group to find the cause of Mexicans' apparent resistance to polio. The Harvard scientists concluded that Mexicans are so dirty that they are constantly eating the polio virus and so never catch the disease."
**CONTEXT:** A historical timeline of polio and the controversial findings of a Harvard study on Mexicans' apparent resistance to the disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "According to Harrison's’ Principles of Internal Medicine, polio can be spread by injection, including vaccination. Salk vaccine in many cases apparently brought on polio after the first or second injection in the series of three. Studies in which people were advised to avoid sugar and starch during the (summer) "polio season" never got government or institutional support. However, some studies were done: see the section on infections."
**CONTEXT:** The potential for polio transmission through injections and vaccination, and the lack of support for dietary interventions during polio outbreaks.

**RAY PEAT:** "Roger MacDougall's diet for preventing the progression of multiple sclerosis involves avoidance of gluten and the use of a vitamin-mineral supplement. A letter in The Lancet (Oct. 5, 1974) describes one form of the diet: subject avoids eating wheat, oats, rye and barley...takes less saturated fat, replacing it in part by unsaturated fat, reduces his sugar intake, replacing the remaining white sugar by Barbados’ sugar, and supplements his intake of food with: Vitamin B1 24 mg. (per day), Vitamin B2 12 mg., Vitamin B6 60 mg., Nicotinamide 1 gram, Calcium Pantothenate 120 mg., Vitamin C 600 mg., Vitamin E 180 mg., Calcium gluconate 900 mg., Magnesium hydroxide 900 mg., Vitamin B12 150 micrograms. That writer suggests that the calcium might not be desirable in the formula. | think the magnesium is extremely important, and it might be better to use it in a more soluble form, such as magnesium carbonate or magnesium chloride, or even epsom salts (magnesium sulphate) which in large doses can't be absorbed, but in small doses will be partly converted to the chloride by stomach acid. Some people, suspected of having early MS, have been able to stop the symptoms just by avoiding carbohydrates. Biotin is involved in the synthesis of fats in the nervous system, and so should probably be given special attention in the MS diet. Liver is a good source of it. If it is taken as a supplement, inositol (and probably choline) should be taken with it, because large doses of biotin by itself were toxic in animal experiments."
**CONTEXT:** A dietary approach for multiple sclerosis involving gluten avoidance, specific vitamin-mineral supplementation, and the importance of magnesium and biotin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stress, the immune system, and lipid metabolism have complex interactions. For example, a fat, triolein, is known to stimulate phagocytosis, as does magnesium; sugar in the diet has an opposite effect. Stress increases breakdown of fats, and can decrease the proportion of triglycerides (triolein is a triglyceride, meaning it is composed of glycerin and three fatty acid molecules) in the blood. Avoiding stress (coffee, tea, and other stimulants produce a stress-like reaction in many people) should be part of a multiple sclerosis program."
**CONTEXT:** The complex interplay of stress, immunity, and lipid metabolism, and the recommendation to avoid stress-inducing factors in multiple sclerosis management.

**RAY PEAT:** "Steroids have been used apparently to inhibit an inflammatory process, though it was about 1978 before an active brain inflammation was observed in a person who died with MS. Good nutrition would support the synthesis of natural steroids. Hypothyroidism can mimic the neurological problems of MS, but neurologists are generally willing to diagnose a condition as MS without giving thyroid tests. Vitamin A is needed for steroid production and should be added to MacDougall's program. | think beans and nuts should be avoided as well as the grains."
**CONTEXT:** The potential role of steroids in MS, the link between hypothyroidism and MS-like neurological symptoms, and the importance of vitamin A and avoiding beans, nuts, and grains.

**RAY PEAT:** "Polyunsaturated oils inhibit the immune system and so probably suppress symptoms. The steroids (e.g., progesterone) and thyroid hormones normalize the immune system when they are present in normal amounts."
**CONTEXT:** The immune-suppressing effects of polyunsaturated oils and the immune-normalizing properties of steroids and thyroid hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the winter of 1974 a young professor visited me to talk about Blake College, and we started talking about nutrition and health. After | told him some stories about antibiotics and vitamin A, he mentioned that he had a chronic, active and uncomfortable infection of the urethra (non-specific urethritis, a bacterial infection of the urinary canal, usually involving E. coli, the common intestinal bacteria, and less often Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, etc.) for nearly two years. Twice he had been given a month's course of high potency antibiotics, which suppressed the symptoms while he continued to take them, but the condition returned immediately when he stopped taking the antibiotics. He was interested in trying to nutritionally raise his immunity, so | gave him liver for lunch, and suggested that he eat some daily, and gave him a week's supply of vitamins A, E, folic acid, B6, potassium and magnesium. He was scheduled to come back to town in a week, so | asked him to let me know how he felt then. About a day later, he came back in a very surprised state, and said the infection had already completely cleared up. This spring (1975) he came back and is still free of the infection. This sort of infection is more common in women, and usually takes longer to clear up."
**CONTEXT:** A case study of a chronic urethritis infection successfully treated with liver and a specific vitamin-mineral supplement, highlighting the limitations of antibiotics and the power of nutritional support for immunity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Folic acid, known for its ability to cure some anemias (red blood cell deficiency) also improves the function of white blood cells, improving antibody production. It is also possibly involved in a non-antibody process which allows white blood cells to destroy virus, fungi, and other parasites. Vitamin A, besides strengthening membranes, is necessary for protein synthesis, and so helps form the immune tissue. Zinc has similar general functions in protein antibody production, but also possibly has a direct "viricidal" capacity, as observed in vitro, which would account for its release (and loss) during viral infections. Vitamin A (and possibly folic acid) mediate the body's response to light, and so modify its neural control of immunity, thyroid and adrenal and sex hormone function, etc."
**CONTEXT:** The immune-boosting properties of
