**RAY PEAT:** The "deleterious effects of unsaturated oils" have been clearly established and are recognized by everyone working in the field. They are not "supposed" and are not merely "discussed" subject to disproof "by others." Many people are now investigating a variety of theories that attempt to explain the specific nature of the toxicity.

**CONTEXT:** Charlotte Gerson criticizes Dr. Peat's statements about unsaturated oils. Dr. Peat responds to her criticism.

**RAY PEAT:** The opinions credited to Budwig by Erasmus suggest ignorance of organic chemistry and biochemistry. If someone takes Dr. Budwig’s ideas seriously, they should invite her to explain them herself.

**CONTEXT:** Charlotte Gerson defends Dr. Johanna Budwig and Udo Erasmus, accusing Dr. Peat of making unsubstantiated attacks and false assumptions. Dr. Peat clarifies his position.

**RAY PEAT:** Without knowing more about the publication details of the new version of the book, Fifty Cases, and the letter that Max Gerson supposedly wrote to Schweitzer, I wouldn’t want to analyze all of the ideas ascribed to him. The original book, which I believe was reprinted several times without changes, even after his death, was a coherent scientific document. Posthumous “new editions” always raise questions.

**CONTEXT:** Charlotte Gerson presents information from a later edition of Dr. Gerson's book and an unpublished letter, suggesting Dr. Gerson later incorporated linseed oil into his cancer therapy. Dr. Peat expresses caution regarding posthumous additions to scientific works.

**RAY PEAT:** I am aware that linseed oil has been used by Mexican physicians to treat cancer at least since 1939, and that it can be toxic to cancer cells (though probably less toxic than to normal cells*), and that its laxative action is plausibly effective in treating constipated cancer patients. My primary criticism is that people who get on the big marketing bandwagon (whether the product is linseed oil or germanium or iron supplements) so often — as in the Udo Erasmus book — appear to systematically lead attention away from the possible dangers of their product.

**CONTEXT:** Dr. Peat elaborates on his concerns regarding the marketing of health products, specifically mentioning linseed oil and Udo Erasmus's book.

**RAY PEAT:** *Cancer cells are rich in antioxidants which protect them against free radicals. J, Duchesne, Ann. Biol. XVI (5-6), 1977, discusses this and gives references.*

**CONTEXT:** This is a footnote to Dr. Peat's statement about cancer cells and antioxidants, providing a scientific reference.
