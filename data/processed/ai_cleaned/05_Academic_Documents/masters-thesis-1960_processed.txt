**RAY PEAT:** [This document is a thesis on the mysticism of William Blake, presented in June 1960. It delves into the history and definition of mysticism, analyzing various forms across cultures and time periods, including Eastern rites (Hinduism, Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism) and Western traditions (Judaism, Christianity). The thesis categorizes and analyzes Blake's specific brand of mysticism, examining his epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. It explores Blake's views on the nature of experience, entelechy, ontology, and his concept of worldly eschatology, including the cause, character, and effect of his mystical insights. The document also discusses the scholarship surrounding Blake's mysticism, categorizing different scholarly approaches. It highlights Blake's unique perspective, contrasting it with conventional mystical thought and emphasizing his focus on the immanent and the human form as divine. The thesis draws parallels between Blake's ideas and various philosophical and religious traditions, including Neoplatonism, Buddhism, and Taoism, while also critiquing certain interpretations. It concludes by examining the interplay of imagination, vision, and the senses in Blake's work, and how his "vitalistic" and "perceptual" approach to mysticism, rooted in a monistic worldview, distinguishes him from traditional dualistic or supernaturalistic mystical traditions. The document also touches upon the role of language and symbols in mystical experience, and the potential influence of altered states of consciousness, including those induced by drugs, on mystical perception, referencing figures like Aldous Huxley and R.
