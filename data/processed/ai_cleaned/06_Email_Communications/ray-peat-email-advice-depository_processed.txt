Here are Ray Peat's bioenergetic teachings extracted from the provided text, with all extraneous information removed:

**RAY PEAT:** For several years, I had a similar need to take 100,000 i.u. daily to prevent acne and ingrown whiskers, so I read a lot about its effects. The toxic effects of extremely big doses, such as 500,000 to a million i.u., seem to be from either oxidative processes (rancidity) that are prevented by adequate vitamin E, or by antithyroid effects. I found that when my need for vitamin A began to decrease I tended to accumulate carotene in my calluses; that happens when the thyroid function is lower, reducing the need for vitamin A. Since you are eating foods with carotene, the calluses on your palms or soles should serve as an indicator of when your tissues are saturated with vitamin A. About 100 i.u. of vitamin E would help to keep the vitamin A from being wasted by oxidation, and possibly could reduce your requirement for it.
**CONTEXT:** Inquiry regarding high-dose Vitamin A supplementation and its effect on acne.

**RAY PEAT:** Incandescent bulbs have a continuous spectrum, luminous gases have intermittently distributed wavelengths. Orange and red are the metabolically most important wavelengths. I don't think the far infrared does anything special, besides heat. Ordinary incandescent bulbs have a slightly orange color compared to sunlight, and the bulbs I have mentioned are just slightly warmer in color, with very little blue, and more red. Ordinary incandescent bulbs are good, if there are enough of them, directed toward your skin.
**CONTEXT:** Discussion on the benefits of light therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** Do you know how your thyroid function is? Thyroid regulates copper assimilation, and also the hormones that regulate pigment. I found that applying a weak solution of copper just once would restore color immediately to eyebrows, or to about 10% of sideburn hairs, apparently because the very long-lived hairs have to be in the right phase of growth, and eyebrows, with a very short life, seem to stay receptive to the stimulation. But I also found that a slightly too strong solution could cause a mole to develop almost instantly, with an invasion of pigment cells. I think a safer alternative would be to supplement, either topically or orally, a little DHEA.
**CONTEXT:** Question regarding restoring color to gray hair.

**RAY PEAT:** Small amounts of alcohol can have some good antioxidant effects, but beer, wine, and dark whiskey, etc., contain enough estrogen to be harmful. Cannabis is antiandrogenic or estrogenic, but it can be protective in some situations. Protein, thyroid, sugars, and saturated fats are protective against both.
**CONTEXT:** Inquiry about the effects of alcohol and cannabis.

**RAY PEAT:** In a crisis situation, it (or baking soda in water) can be helpful, but it's more effective to rebreathe in a paper bag.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the effect of carbonated drinks on CO2 levels.

**RAY PEAT:** In old people, a little nicotine can have a balancing effect, improving alertness, and probably protecting nerves, for example in the negative association with Parkinson's disease. But in younger people, its vasoconstrictive effect tends to promote the development of wrinkles in the skin, and I think it's likely to contribute to periodontal disease.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the chronic use of smokeless tobacco like snus.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's a matter of watching for any effects associated with a particular product; if nothing is obvious, the fresher milk is preferable.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the preference of vitamin-free powdered milk over commercial milk.

**RAY PEAT:** If the basic foods were chosen for minimal unsaturated fats, then coconut oil wouldn't add much of value. Coffee is a good source of magnesium and niacin, and has smaller amounts of other essential nutrients, besides the caffeine and antioxidants.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the benefits of coconut oil and coffee.

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on the context; aspirin makes you need more vitamin K, even when you aren't using much. People who use aspirin for arthritis or cancer often take several grams a day.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safe upper limit of aspirin consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** It makes the body's glycogen stores more important, so thyroid function can benefit especially from avoidance of PUFA; coffee's protective effects, increasing metabolic efficiency, are probably especially helpful.
**CONTEXT:** Question about how a large brain affects dietary requirements and the usefulness of caffeine.

**RAY PEAT:** A few other juices are good, for example watermelon. Some fruits contain things that affect the hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Question about why orange juice is emphasized over other fruit juices.

**RAY PEAT:** Corossol, lychee, longan, guaba, papaya, pawpaw, sapota, guanabana.
**CONTEXT:** Question about other safe fruits.

**RAY PEAT:** Some frozen and canned fruits are good; applesauce, corossol, guanabana, longans, and lychees for example.
**CONTEXT:** Question about safe fruits, similar to a previous inquiry.

**RAY PEAT:** Lots of sugar, without coffee, would be quicker for restoring blood sugar. At least a quart of milk shake or ice cream can provide the needed sugar in a form that can be assimilated quickly. 100 mg of progesterone in oil can usually stop it, by stopping the wastage of glucose.
**CONTEXT:** Advice on aborting a migraine.

**RAY PEAT:** The idea is to remove the fat so that it mixes easily with milk.
**CONTEXT:** Question about alkalized cocoa versus normal cocoa.

**RAY PEAT:** I prefer Mexican coke with real sugar (it tastes very different), but metabolically there isn't much difference.
**CONTEXT:** Question about drinking HFCS coke regularly.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, I think that's at least part of how it works.
**CONTEXT:** Question about protein deficiency lowering liver detoxification.

**RAY PEAT:** I haven't seen anything that compares well with the original Armour.
**CONTEXT:** Question about dessicated thyroid products.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes
**CONTEXT:** Question about zinc oxide as a sunscreen.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes
**CONTEXT:** Question about pyruvate's role in oxidative metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** Because of individual sensitivities, each one should be tested carefully. Allergic reactions sometimes show up within a few minutes of contacting your mouth, other times it takes a couple of days to see a bad reaction. The worst one is B2, folic acid is next for allergies. B1, pantothenic acid, niacinamide and B6 are pretty safe.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of pure USP B vitamins.

**RAY PEAT:** Not like caffeine, but if too much is taken suddenly, a person who has been deficient in thyroid is likely to experience an excess of adrenaline. Since the body normally produces about 4 mcg of T3 in an hour, taking 10 or 20 mcg at once is unphysiological.
**CONTEXT:** Question about T3 acting like caffeine in causing nervousness.

**RAY PEAT:** It slows digestion down for a few minutes.
**CONTEXT:** Question about eating baking soda with protein meals.

**RAY PEAT:** Meaning the entry of lactate into the blood stream inappropriately, which would usually be called aerobic glycolysis, though you can't be sure how much oxygen is getting to the cells when CO2 is deficient, since its absence causes many problems in oxygen delivery and use.
**CONTEXT:** Question about CO2's effect on glycolysis.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, as part of oxidative metabolism, it's better than burning too much fat.
**CONTEXT:** Clarification on glycolysis when CO2 is not deficient.

**RAY PEAT:** Slowing metabolism and causing inflammation are its two basic functions.
**CONTEXT:** Question about omega-6 supplementation for eczema.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, avoidance of unsaturated fats is the most important thing. Aspirin, caffeine, and orange juice are protective. Keeping the TSH low is important, because it stimulates melanoma growth.
**CONTEXT:** Question about what to do for skin cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** The only analysis of gelatin that I have seen showed very little fluoride. Since most of the fluoride in an animal is concentrated in the bones, and gelatin is made from skin, it probably doesn't contain much.
**CONTEXT:** Concerns about fluoride in gelatin.

**RAY PEAT:** Besides keeping phosphates low, getting a lot of vitamin K, and maybe rubbing some onto the gums, might help; it's antiinflammatory. Some people have reverse gingivitis by "rinsing" with coconut oil twice a day, swishing it around for a couple of minutes.
**CONTEXT:** Advice regarding oral health.

**RAY PEAT:** It's good to avoid fluoridated water as far as possible. Certain forms of bromine, including bromate and polybrominated biphenyls, are definitely toxic, but simple bromide isn't very toxic; it took large amounts of Bromo-Seltzer used for a long time to produce harmful effects, hundreds of milligrams per day. Seawater contains bromide, so all seafood contains a lot; milk and meat naturally contain it, because soil generally contains a moderate amount. A few of the promoters of large iodine supplements--Abraham, Flechas, and Brownstein--are giving a wrong impression of bromine.
**CONTEXT:** Thoughts on fluoride and bromide, and iodine supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think it's a problem. The soaps and shampoos people use are worse problems. Just washing the skin with pure soap alters the skin's endocrine function for days. and doing it every day is an "endocrine disrupter," even if there are no toxic additives in the soap.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question regarding fluoride in showering/bath water and avoiding fluoride in food.

**RAY PEAT:** .....a starting dose of about 1 mcg can produce a noticeable effect, and can be repeated at intervals according to the effect. 5 mcg with a meal is another way to start it. Thyroid tends to lower cholesterol by converting it into pregnenolone and other steroids, and yours is high enough to easily improve your steroid hormone balance.
**CONTEXT:** Advice on taking thyroid medication.

**RAY PEAT:** A daily raw carrot (shredded, with olive oil and vinegar, for example) can gradually change the ecology. Sometimes very small amounts of an antibiotic can do it.
**CONTEXT:** Advice regarding intestinal bacteria issues.

**RAY PEAT:** Aspirin has a mild germicidal effect. Sometimes 30 to 50 milligrams of tetracycline or penicillin can help. Flowers of sulfur, a pinch a day for a few days will often establish a new flora.
**CONTEXT:** Advice on antibiotics for intestinal bacteria.

**RAY PEAT:** Several things have been very effective, for example the drug Diamox, acetazolamide, stimulates respiration by changing CO2 and pH; caffeine, thyroid, and progesterone are the more natural things that stimulate respiration.
**CONTEXT:** Advice for severe sleep apnea.

**RAY PEAT:** Thyroid is the main regulatory and adaptive substance for respiration. I think it's common to call the apnea "obstructive" when someone is fat, but it's probably essentially the same condition, filtered through the mechanical medical mind.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question regarding obstructive sleep apnea and the Buteyko method.

**RAY PEAT:** High parathyroid hormone will increase calcium and lower phosphate. I regularly use at least two quarts of milk per day, in the past I have averaged a gallon a day, high calcium intake helps to compensate for low vitamin D, but both vitamin D and calcium in the diet tend to lower parathyroid hormone, and the serum calcium level. Quite a few people are now recommending from 2000 to 6000 i.u. of vitamin D3 daily during the winter.
**CONTEXT:** Discussion regarding blood test results, specifically high parathyroid hormone.

**RAY PEAT:** If your vitamin D was very low for a long time, I think your parathyroid glands probably enlarged, and might take some time to normalize under the influence of a generous amount of vitamin D and calcium.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up on vitamin D deficiency and parathyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** Too much pseudoephedrine increases stress hormones, loratadine isn't good for the liver, and anything that irritates the intestine can cause tinnitus by increasing endotoxin absorption.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding medications being ototoxic and causing tinnitus.

**RAY PEAT:** Since reading about the chemicals in mushrooms I stopped eating them, but using them occasionally is o.k., probably better than many vegetables.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on mushrooms.

**RAY PEAT:** I haven't tried magnesium salicylate, but most magnesium compounds have been seriously irritating to my intestine; I have mixed baking soda with salicylic acid, and it seems similar to aspirin. If the magnesium doesn't cause irritation, it would be a good form of salicylate. Magnesium salicylate is popular for arthritis, and it releases salicylic acid in the intestine and blood.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding magnesium salicylate.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, a person relatively free of PUFA will be likely to recover very quickly from prolonged stress.
**CONTEXT:** Question about exercise-induced hypothyroidism and PUFA release.

**RAY PEAT:** As long as you use the vitamin topically it would not do any harm but be careful to not expose your skin to direct sunlight.
**CONTEXT:** Question about topical vs. oral vitamin ingestion.

**RAY PEAT:** 'What would your doctors think about letting you try an antiserotonin drug, like lisuride or ondansetron or bromocriptine, now that your prolactin was measured so high? I think the prolactin should be around 9 to 12.'
**CONTEXT:** Discussion regarding high prolactin levels and potential treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** Bihari thinks naltrexone works by increasing endorphins, I think excess endorphins are often the problem, and the antagonist can sometimes be helpful. The endorphins differ in their effects on the two sides of the body, so when I knew two women (within the same year) who had been having mysterious one-sided symptoms for a few months before discovering that they had ovarian cancer (on the same side), I thought that the endorphins were probably involved, maybe to suppress pain on that side. Naloxone and naltrexone have some effects that aren't directly related to the endorphins, on estrogen and histamine.
**CONTEXT:** Discussion on naltrexone and endorphins.

**RAY PEAT:** If the rest of your diet is good, the energy bursts from sugar should level off, and become a steady increased metabolic rate.
**CONTEXT:** Question about sugar highs and adrenaline response.

**RAY PEAT:** I used to drink at least a gallon of 2% or 3% milk daily, and often ate more than 5000 calories, but when I'm completely sedentary for more than ten hours daily, my energy requirement is much lower. The calorie intake should be balanced to your heat production and activity.
**CONTEXT:** Question about calorie intake and fat content of milk.

**RAY PEAT:** When starch is well cooked, and eaten with some fat and the essential nutrients, it's safe, except that it's more likely than sugar to produce fat, and isn't as effective for mineral balance.
**CONTEXT:** Question about starch consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** But the juices from inside quick cooked meat inactivate those toxins; the inside should be pink. Milk, cheese, and eggs are better proteins, anyway, because of the better calcium/phosphate ratio.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding cooked meats.

**RAY PEAT:** It's usually associated with disturbed muscle action of the whole stomach and intestine and gall bladder. High estrogen, serotonin, prostaglandins, low thyroid, inflammation, and bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine are often involved. Stimulating the intestine with a daily raw carrot often helps.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding gastroesophageal reflux.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, but occasional eggs, liver, oysters, etc., provide enough.
**CONTEXT:** Question about manganese in oranges and milk.

**RAY PEAT:** No, just watch out for any signs of sensitivity to it. Have you seen my article on cascara? Yes. Milk of magnesia is very safe, but cascara has many protective biological effects.
**CONTEXT:** Recommendations for milk of magnesia and cascara.

**RAY PEAT:** The bulk powder from Farmalabor in Italy is the kind I like best, but US Customs can cause problems with that. Naturlich Kost Co-op, 4260 TR 628, Millersburg, OH. 44654, sells it mixed with glycerine, which is o.k.
**CONTEXT:** Recommendations for cascara brands and usage.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, probably better for most things.
**CONTEXT:** Question about pregnenolone dissolved in Vitamin E.

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone doesn't have the direct hormonal effects, but it's the precursor, and by stopping exaggerated stress reactions it is likely to help.
**CONTEXT:** Question about women taking pregnenolone oil.

**RAY PEAT:** It doesn't dissolve very well either way, it just takes some stirring and a little warmth. Vitamin E breaks down quickly when it's hot, so stirring at room temperature is best; not much dissolves. It's much more economical to use it orally, as powder.
**CONTEXT:** Question about pregnenolone micronization and dissolution in Vitamin E.

**RAY PEAT:** I haven't used it for several years, so I don't know.
**CONTEXT:** Question about Knox gelatin.

**RAY PEAT:** If it's in glass it might be o.k. Even the so-called pulp-free juices now might have been processed with enzymes to liquefy pulp. If it separates into an orange-colored sediment and a nearly clear supernatant, it's probably natural, but even the so-called pulp-free juices now often contain the enzyme-solublized pulpy refuse.
**CONTEXT:** Question about canned not from concentrate juice and commercial pulp-free OJ.

**RAY PEAT:** The small amount of oil in a capsule doesn't matter much. Any capsule should have the highest potency in the smallest size, to minimize the junk.
**CONTEXT:** Question about Vitamin A supplements without soybean oil.

**RAY PEAT:** There isn't enough information to judge, but a fair part of the carbohydrate should be in the form of sucrose, fructose, and/or lactose. If it's well cooked, and eaten with butter, it's probably safe for many people.
**CONTEXT:** Question about grams of cooked starchy food.

**RAY PEAT:** I mostly use the pure crystals, but in Mexico I use the Bayer tablets.
**CONTEXT:** Recommendation for aspirin brands.

**RAY PEAT:** No, if the diet and level of activity are right, it shouldn't be necessary.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether all athletes should supplement thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Probably, but the dehydration probably damages it nutritionally.
**CONTEXT:** Question about Argentina Liver Powder for Vitamin B6 supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, eggnogs for example.
**CONTEXT:** Question about raw egg yolk.

**RAY PEAT:** If you have other sources of magnesium, the green vegetables aren't needed.
**CONTEXT:** Question about Vitamin K2 supplementation and the necessity of green vegetables.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes.
**CONTEXT:** Question about avoiding gluten.

**RAY PEAT:** I had some probable melanomas years ago, and I found that progesterone and DHEA and increased thyroid caused them to disappear quickly. His other symptoms are very suggestive of a deficiency of pregnenolone, progesterone, and thyroid, as well as the vitamin and minerals. Once when I had four ounces of beer daily for a few weeks several moles grew rapidly, and I realized it was probably the estrogen in the beer that was responsible, and two weeks after I stopped the moles dried up and fell off. Orange juice contains naringenin which is effective against melanoma, and guavas contain apigenin, also effective. A diet consisting of milk, orange juice, guavas, cheese, and some eggs, liver, and oysters, with aspirin would be protective against the spread of the tumor. Thorne's high potency vitamin K drops would help with the blood pressure, and vitamin K also has some anticancer activity, and is necessary when you use a lot of aspirin. At least 15 milligrams per day would probably quickly regulate his blood pressure.
**CONTEXT:** Personalized advice for eye melanoma and related symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't know anyone who has a stomach reaction when they dissolve the aspirin in hot water, and then take it with food. There are alternatives, such as magnesium salsalate or just plain salicylic acid (which should be used dissolved and with food). People using it with cancer usually take a daily total of 6 grams or more. Vitamin K protects against bleeding and other effects of prolonged aspirin use. Considering all his symptoms, I think he should use pregnenone and progesterone, at least at first; 100 mg of pregnenolone or more. Guava juice is good. I think incandescent light would be good.
**CONTEXT:** Further advice on aspirin, vitamin K, pregnenolone, and light therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** Cyproheptadine, 2 to 4 mg at bedtime, would help with his sleep as well as the cancer. It also has calcium blocking action, aldosterone antagonism, and antagonizes serotonin's antidiuretic effect.
**CONTEXT:** Recommendation for cyproheptadine.

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone isn't a hormone, but it normalizes the steroid hormones, preventing excess cortisol and helping to normalize aldosterone, so it should be helpful for any stress including surgery. Progesterone has a wide spectrum of anticancer activity, but as far as I know only synthetic progestins have been used medically. Although I used myself it on things that appeared to be very active melanomas, I usually recommend a slightly hyperthyroid state for helping to control it.
**CONTEXT:** Explanation of pregnenolone and progesterone's role in cancer and stress.

**RAY PEAT:** The bacterial genes that are meant to be toxic to insects can be allergenic to people.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on GE corn and potential allergens.

**RAY PEAT:** Barbara McClintock's work with corn showed that a change in the plants' environment causes them to shift their genes around, sort of equivalent to internal hybridization. When something new is added to the genome, it changes the results of the rearrangement, unpredictably. Since seeds always contain toxins, anyway, a new allergen probably isn't too important, and the traditional alkali processing of corn might take care of it.
**CONTEXT:** Further thoughts on GE corn and its processing.

**RAY PEAT:** A little is o.k.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on sorbitol in gummy bears.

**RAY PEAT:** I had some probable melanomas years ago, and I found that progesterone and DHEA and increased thyroid caused them to disappear quickly. I usually recommend a slightly hyperthyroid state for helping to control it.
**CONTEXT:** Advice regarding melanoma and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** I think so.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the equivalence of calorie and PUFA intake.

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin K is good for protecting muscles and bones, so 500 micrograms to one milligram is good anyway, and it would be protective against even more aspirin.
**CONTEXT:** Recommended Vitamin K2 dosage when taking aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** Mitochondria have the enzyme for converting T3 to T2. The potency seems crazy, the body needs only about 4 mcg per hour.
**CONTEXT:** Thoughts on synthetic T2.

**RAY PEAT:** By any irradiation, but it's most effective within the first hour.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding red light therapy and damage from irradiation.

**RAY PEAT:** High ferritin suggests that there's continuing inflammation. Iron and calcium interact, so it might be worth having your parathyroid hormone tested. Despite your good vitamin D, you might not be getting enough calcium in relation to phosphate, and elevated PTH can cause generalized inflammation. Safe antiinflammatory things would be aspirin, calcium carbonate, coffee especially when taken with meat or eggs, salt or baking soda, and sugar. In the US and Canada, I have noticed that the "normal range" for prolactin has been expanded upward, after a period in the '80s when it was lowered. I think this reflects a change in the population, from estrogen and PUFA, for example, and that the lower range was better for judging health.
**CONTEXT:** Discussion regarding high ferritin and inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** Although I think knowing your PTH and free fatty acids will be useful (in judging use of calcium, sugar, aspirin, niacinamide, etc.), another test that could help to clarify the nature of the inflammation would be the serum interleukin-18, since it's associated with liver damage and increased ferritin, and symptoms of inflammation. Since TSH increases IL-18, finding it elevated would be another argument for keeping your TSH very low.
**CONTEXT:** Further advice on inflammation and relevant tests.

**RAY PEAT:** It's very common for people in their forties to become deficient in both pregnenolone and DHEA, but occasionally it happens in younger people, usually because of an imbalance of thyroid and estrogen. In women, too much DHEA can have a masculinizing effect, so it's best to work on the diet, or to use pregnenolone, which doesn't lead to an imbalance between progesterone and DHEA, since it turns into either, according to need.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding DHEA deficiency and its effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Ten milligrams of DHEA is pretty safe for men, the most common side effects are pimples, oily skin, and sex dreams.
**CONTEXT:** Safe dosage of DHEA for men.

**RAY PEAT:** If your thyroid is very low, you should be cautious with the DHEA, because stress hormones can cause it to turn to estrogen. 5 mg of DHEA taken with a little olive oil or butter can have a noticeable effect on your mood and muscle tone in a few hours.
**CONTEXT:** Advice on DHEA dosage for hypothyroid individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** Orally.
**CONTEXT:** Method of DHEA administration.

**RAY PEAT:** High ferritin doesn't directly imply high iron stores, it has a defensive effect, and can be increased by inflammation. TSH promotes inflammation. Hypothyroidism usually involves low temperature of the extremities, and the bones of the arms and legs form red cells slowly at low temperature, so it's possible that ferritin is involved in an adaptive mechanism, too.
**CONTEXT:** Discussion on high ferritin and its relation to inflammation and hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** The liver has to convert T4 to T3 for it to be effective. It needs glucose and selenium to make the conversion. Adequate protein, at least 80 grams per day, is necessary. Sea food, once a week will provide selenium, two quarts of milk and a quart of orange juice would provide many of the other essential nutrients. Taking T4 at bedtime sometimes is helpful. Most people feel best on a ratio of T4:T3 of 4:1 or less. Checking the relaxation rate of the Achilles reflex is a quick way to check the effect of the thyroid on your nerves and muscles; the relaxation should be instantaneous, loose and floppy.
**CONTEXT:** Information regarding thyroid hormone conversion and essential nutrients.

**RAY PEAT:** I had similar symptoms, I often ate several thousand calories per day without getting fat, and small noises would shock me awake. Taking thyroid reduced my caloric requirement, and immediately allowed me to sleep deeply. Deficiencies of magnesium, vitamin A, and selenium probably contribute to that metabolic pattern.
**CONTEXT:** Explanation for inability to gain weight despite high calorie intake and hypothyroid symptoms.

**RAY PEAT:** No, it isn't likely to be a problem unless you are very sensitive to it.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding carrageenan in toothpaste.

**RAY PEAT:** About your high metabolic rate and high temperature: In my teens and twenties, I needed about 8000 calories per day when I was physically active, about 4000 to 5000 when I was sedentary, but after I took thyroid, I needed only about half as many calories. Thyroid is the basic regulator of blood glucose, and it causes it to be fully oxidized for energy, so that it produces ATP efficiently, on relatively few calories. If blood glucose falls, because it's being used very quickly, the body responds with stress hormones, including glucagon, adrenalin, and cortisol. They cause fat and protein to be burned for energy, while in hypothyroidism, glucose can still be used inefficiently for glycolysis, producing lactic acid, displacing bicarbonate and carbon dioxide. This causes mineral imbalances, with effects including cramps and nerve-muscle tension, which produce heat and waste energy. When you first start taking thyroid again, your tissues will need some extra magnesium, during the time when the dose is increasing, and when the mineral balance is restored your temperature and metabolic rate might decrease a little. Orange juice, milk, and coffee are good for the main minerals, while salting your food to taste. Supplementing thyroid can sometimes reduce the rate of metabolism, by allowing cells to retain enough magnesium, which stabilizes ATP.
**CONTEXT:** Explanation of high metabolic rate and temperature in relation to thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** I avoid drugs that contain chlorine or fluorine, because of the risk to the liver.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding avoidance of chlorine and fluorine in drugs.

**RAY PEAT:** Our enzymes aren't designed for the combination of chlorine with carbon molecules.
**CONTEXT:** Clarification on the issue with chlorine in drugs.

**RAY PEAT:** The coca leaf and cola seed extracts are valuable antiinflammatories. The amount of phosphate is very small compared to the amount in meat, fish, beans, nuts, and grains.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on phosphoric acid in Coke.

**RAY PEAT:** If it's browned from heating, it's more likely to be allergenic, and even without too much heat, some people are likely to be allergic to it. But if it doesn't cause any reactions, then it's very good, with some nutritional value. Honey is in some ways better than white sugar, but depending on the plants it's derived from, it can be allergenic. White sugar has the advantage of being very clean. Fruits have many valuable nutrients, so are the best way to get sugars, when good ones are available.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on coconut sugar and other sweeteners.

**RAY PEAT:** It often causes gas and irritation symptoms.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on coconut meat.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it's good to avoid it when possible; there's an article by Gerhart Volkheimer, on persorption, that explains how particulate matter of all sorts can enter the blood stream from the intestine.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hypromellose).

**RAY PEAT:** If it is fresh from the coconut, it's good, also if it has been bottled without additives.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on coconut water.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you tried anything topical, such as sulfur, or an antibiotic such as minocycline? 10% sulfur soap leaves an antiseptic residue on the skin that can prevent infection. I think it would be good to try the sulfur soap first. The simple ones are what I use; I haven't tried one with salicylic acid. The sulfur lingers on the skin for at least a day. It can leave you fairly smelly. Either of them can help, but with prolonged use the intestine can develop sensitivity to the sulfur, causing irritation instead of stopping it.
**CONTEXT:** Advice regarding acne treatment.

**RAY PEAT:** Generally positive, but intense arousal can have unwanted consequences, such as herpes virus outbreaks.
**CONTEXT:** Effects of masturbation or sex on hormones or stress.

**RAY PEAT:** If it's comfortable it isn't harmful, but it's easy to burn when they are so close. Your body temperature is likely to rise, otherwise I don't know of any problem from prolonged light (but even incandescent light does have some slightly harmful blue light, so you should watch your own reactions to it).
**CONTEXT:** Regarding light proximity and potential harm.

**RAY PEAT:** Bare skin is best; for effects on the nervous system, shining on head, face, neck and back is good. Not as far as I know.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the direction and clothing for light therapy, and its effect on Vitamin A needs.

**RAY PEAT:** Those, or butter.
**CONTEXT:** Safest ways to cook seafood.

**RAY PEAT:** People react differently to different screens. Keeping the room bright, and the screen not too bright, can reduce the eye strain. This person has very detailed information about them: [ http://www.conradbiologic.com/articles/SubliminalFlickerI.html ](http://www.conradbiologic.com/articles/SubliminalFlickerI.html)
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on LCD screens and eye strain/sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** Just chewing a carrot is best, any saturated fat around the same time is o.k. What doesn't work very well is to grind the carrot very fine.
**CONTEXT:** Advice on consuming carrot salad.

**RAY PEAT:** Convenience, because of the time preparing things.
**CONTEXT:** Comparing daily vs. weekly consumption of liver and oysters.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it would be a balance.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the interaction of cocoa powder with orange juice, milk, and iron absorption.

**RAY PEAT:** Warm showers can lower stress, and if the bath isn't too warm, it's effective, too; if the bath raises the body temperature, that can cause the metabolism to increase, sometimes causing low blood sugar.
**CONTEXT:** Minimizing stress with showers or baths.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes.
**CONTEXT:** Whether 100% cocoa powder can replace coffee for iron inhibition.

**RAY PEAT:** Those can all be helpful. The two things that most often make exercise harmful are activity that keeps the lactic acid high chronically, and "eccentric" exercise, in which muscles are stretched while contracting, as in running downhill.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on stretching, yoga, weight lifting, and sprinting.

**RAY PEAT:** If volume refers to the mass of muscle involved, probably not, depending on the exact intensities and volumes. Ten pound dumbells, lifted quickly for 30 to 60 seconds, for example, is usually good for increasing the anabolic and protective hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Clarification on exercise intensity and lactic acid production.

**RAY PEAT:** It's possible to make them without toxic ingredients, but I don't know of any such products.
**CONTEXT:** Concerns about deodorant or shaving cream.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't think there's nearly enough knowledge about its interactions with diet, stress, and hormones.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on Centrophenoxine/Meclofenoxate, piracetam, or DMAE for lipofuscin removal.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I stopped taking it, partly because of the new manufacturing methods, that were associated for several years with adding soy oil to the product.
**CONTEXT:** Whether Vitamin E is still recommended after avoiding PUFA.

**RAY PEAT:** Besides large amounts of aspirin (grams per day), and vitamin K1 or K2 to prevent abnormal bleeding from the aspirin, I think I would use DCA (dichloroacetate), which is available from Canada on the internet (and forums describe its use), and maybe an enzyme related to vitamin D, called GCMAF, that activates the immune system.
**CONTEXT:** Advice for cancer of the tongue.

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamins and trace minerals have to increase proportionally as the metabolic rate increases.
**CONTEXT:** Explanation for worsening skin problems on a metabolism-increasing diet.

**RAY PEAT:** Most supplements contain enough impurities to eventually cause problems. Thyroid and aspirin are among the safest, and the most likely to be valuable indefinitely. It depends on where you live, but vitamin D3, vitamin K, and selenium deficiencies are extremely widespread.
**CONTEXT:** Safest and most valuable supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** Cyanide is a goitrogen, and its quantity varies with the way the cassava is prepared. It's essential for the starch to be very well cooked, and eaten with some fat.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding cassava.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, although the aspirin and caffeine help to detoxify acetaminophen.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding Excedrin and its effect on the liver.

**RAY PEAT:** If your thyroid is very low, you should be cautious with the DHEA, because stress hormones can cause it to turn to estrogen. 5 mg of DHEA taken with a little olive oil or butter can have a noticeable effect on your mood and muscle tone in a few hours.
**CONTEXT:** Further advice on DHEA dosage for hypothyroid individuals.

**RAY PEAT:** Excipients or impurities in capsules can cause symptoms, by irritating the intestine. In animal studies (and in myself), extremely large doses didn't have any more effects than minimal doses. It's possible to eliminate some of the impurities by mixing it with warm vitamin E, and after stirring it, allowing it to settle, and using only what dissolved in the vitamin E.
**CONTEXT:** Possible side effects of pregnenolone and how to mitigate them.

**RAY PEAT:** I haven't heard of a situation like that; I'll see if I can find any information relating to that possibility.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question regarding pregnenolone converting to estrogen or stress hormones.

**RAY PEAT:** No.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding pregnenolone use for personality disorders.

**RAY PEAT:** Although it's extremely rich in minerals, I think the intense heat used for concentrating it degrades the sugar into things that are likely to be allergens.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on blackstrap molasses.

**RAY PEAT:** I don't recommend the oxide, because it's very poorly absorbed, but the carbonate is well absorbed. I don't recommend chemical supplements of magnesium, though, because they all contain some manufacturing impurities that can cause bowel inflammation, such as hemorrhoids. Well cooked greens are very good sources, coffee and chocolate are, too.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding magnesium oxide and other magnesium sources.

**RAY PEAT:** Topical baking soda, honey, and granulated sugar can be helpful for wounds.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding wound healing.

**RAY PEAT:** With the average diet, that amount is enough. Good thyroid function, and plenty of calcium, potassium, and sodium can decrease the amount of magnesium needed.
**CONTEXT:** Recommended daily intake of magnesium.

**RAY PEAT:** Heavy drinking inhibits cellular respiration and sets up an inflammatory process, involving iron, which will still be harmful, but less so than in the presence of PUFA. If absolutely none of the dietary PUFA were in the body, no one really knows what that metabolic stress would do, maybe nothing cumulative.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding alcohol consumption and its metabolic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** I think prolactin and TSH would be worth checking. I have had bad headaches when I used vitamin A orally, and even getting a little on my lips was enough to do it. It could be that the Nutrisorb-A was the cause, if you used it orally. I use it only on my legs and feet. It's hard now (since the FDA's anticascara action) to find a standardized aged cascara product, but Western Botanical and (in Italy) Farmalabor are two sources that I know of. (Naturlich Kost Co-op in Millersburg, Ohio, has cascara, but I think FDA is currently preventing them from doing business.) The Chinese rhubarb products are probably standardized, but I have never used them. An amount slightly less than a laxative dose has beneficial systemic effects.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding headaches, cascara, and hormone testing.

**RAY PEAT:** When TSH is too high for a long time, it causes inflammation in the gland, and the antibodies are in reaction to that.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding Hashimoto's diagnosis and antibody levels.

**RAY PEAT:** The problem with chicken is that the fat is highly unsaturated, and the meat provides very little calcium. Milk and cheese have a much better ratio of calcium to phosphate. Having the carrots raw (shredded, with a little olive oil, vinegar, and salt) would help with the hormone balance, and protect the intestine against inflammation. Supplementing pregnenolone wouldn't have the risk of the DHEA being converted to estrogen, which tends to happen when thyroid function is low. A small supplement of Armour thyroid or the equivalent could quickly lower the cholesterol, and since cholesterol is converted by thyroid into pregnenolone and DHEA, that would probably help the testosterone. Some shellfish (oysters, shrimp, squid, etc.) or low fat fish would provide trace minerals that might be lacking in your diet. Several eggs per week, or liver once a week, can help with other nutrients that are probably deficient in your present foods. Well cooked potatoes, with butter or cream, fruit, and well cooked greens are other foods have vitamins and minerals that are helpful. Cynoplus (www.farmaciadelnino.com has a good price) is cheaper than Armour, and an eighth to a fourth of a tablet would be a reasonable amount to start with; thyroxine's half-life in the body is two weeks, so the effect is cumulative, and if you get the desired effects in less than two weeks the dose should probably be reduced. At the beginning, once a day, but if your temperature and pulse and symptoms aren't just right after two weeks you could add another dose at a different time of day. Change of seasons affects the amount of thyroid you need, sometimes it isn't needed after using it for a while, but it's always good to watch for signs of change. The body makes up to about 4 mcg of T3 in an hour, so each dose should be small, with food to delay absorption. Are you having orange juice and milk in your diet? Sometimes a B vitamin deficiency, especially B1, can cause the fog. A supplement of 10 mg. is often enough to improve focus and prevent fatigue. When you take T3 without food, it enters the blood stream very suddenly, and the liver is likely to detect an excessive amount, causing it to produce enzymes to eliminate it. The result can be a decrease in T3 for the rest of the day, especially at night if you took it in the morning. Have you tried rebreathing into a paper bag, to see if the increased CO2 affects the fog? It takes time to adapt to decreasing those drugs, keeping sugar up and inflammation down, including bag breathing, should help. Starting with a little, a sixth or fourth of a tablet, of cynoplus in the evening would be the best way to try it.
**CONTEXT:** Advice for low testosterone and high cholesterol, and thyroid dosing.

**RAY PEAT:** I think cascara's most important effect is the reduction of the pro-inflammatory nitric oxide, which poisons mitochondrial energy production. Raw carrot or bamboo shoots can sometimes have a similar effect by reducing NO synthesis.
**CONTEXT:** Explanation for the effectiveness of cascara.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, they rank with oranges for their protective qualities.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the quality of guava compared to oranges.

**RAY PEAT:** I'm looking for one without the citric acid. The benzoate isn't necessary with a lot of added sugar, but it's probably used everywhere.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding additives in fruit juice, specifically sodium benzoate and citric acid.

**RAY PEAT:** At any moment, one's position in the world is part of one's image of the world, and body awareness is part of our consciousness of our position. Being is the basic thing, and there is really no understanding separate from that, although there are symbolic patterns that can be manipulated as if they were separate from the substance, but that's just a matter of habitual attention. The "faint glass" people are identifying with the constructed story about life, rather than seeing it as an aspect of a single substance-awareness. Toes (and internal organs) are part of everything we do, making up part of the substance and meaning of things, except when indoctrination directs attention away from them.
**CONTEXT:** Explanation of consciousness, body awareness, and the influence of language and indoctrination.

**RAY PEAT:** Every tissue contains nerves, and for some of these, the proprioceptive nerves, their object is what we feel as our body. Other nerves sense things that we understand as objects in some sense—sound is felt to come from somewhere in the space around us, smells usually the same, and tastes represent the objects that we are eating. But in each case, it’s possible to experience our sensing without imagining objects as the cause of the sensation. The value of that is that it gives you an absolute, uninterpreted, experience, which makes it possible to put the verbal life history that we normally inhabit, into a new context. In the case of seeing with your eyes closed (with light on the closed eyelids, the situation is similar to looking at an empty sky), a finely granular texture is the retina itself, and/or the optic nerve. A textureless, dreamlike substance of space filling images, a relatively free activity of the visual cortex and more complex brain systems, will gradually be noticed, when there’s the right combination of nervous arousal and relaxation. The behavior of after-images will change according to the state of the whole organism, for example the length of time that it stays positive, and the length of time that a following negative image lasts. It’s the same with after-images of motion; their differences between people are very interesting.
**CONTEXT:** Explanation of sensory perception, awareness, and the role of after-images and visual experiences.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, sea food from the northern Pacific should be tested periodically, but the US government has stopped the radiation testing that had previously been done, which I think means that the radiation is exceeding their previous safety limits.
**CONTEXT:** Concerns about radiation in seafood after the Fukushima disaster.

**RAY PEAT:** If you know the date of the last menstruation, you could go by the calendar, so 6 or 10 or 14 weeks later might coincide with the ovulation cycle; if you have a sensation of ovulation, that would be a signal to start it, or if you see a sudden rise in morning temperature that could indicate ovulation. But if there's no cycle you can detect, just starting the progesterone could renew the rhythm.
**CONTEXT:** Advice on starting progesterone for women with irregular cycles.

**RAY PEAT:** Brains do contain beneficial steroids, but the other fats aren't necessarily good, so I don't recommend them especially as an isolated food. Reduced milk is o.k. if the heat wasn't very high.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on consuming animal brains and reduced milk.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, I never smelled one that I wanted to eat.
**CONTEXT:** Opinion on beef kidney.

**RAY PEAT:** A little DHT should be safe, but I don't think mesterolone is safe in any quantity.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding DHT derivatives and mesterolone.

**RAY PEAT:** They are all known allergens, or "pseudoallergens," and the yellow and red have been associated with hyperactivity, but they aren't excitotoxins in the standard sense.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding ingredients in Haribo Gummy Bears and excitotoxins.

**RAY PEAT:** It can be used alone.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding the use of Niacinamide.

**RAY PEAT:** Salt is often the most important thing for pregnancy nausea. Two quarts of milk daily, cheese, eggs, and orange juice, but with anything salty, even sips of salty water first thing in the morning, should stop it. Low thyroid function, with a low ratio of progesterone to estrogen, causes the kidneys to be unable to retain salt efficiently.
**CONTEXT:** Advice for nausea during pregnancy.

**RAY PEAT:** I think a background of hypothyroidism, even when it's compensated by high production of the stress hormones so that the classical symptoms aren't present, is a major factor in reproductive problems, and in increasing susceptibility to injury by toxins, including DES and anesthetics. Progesterone production depends on good thyroid function, and as it declines cortisol and other stress hormones increase. A few doctors at that time [1956] used real progesterone supplements during pregnancy, but generally they were much more likely to use a synthetic progestin, or DES or estrogen. The prenatal environment can imprint a pattern of hormone balance, especially hypothyroidism, that tends to persist until new patterns can be formed, and that usually requires prolonged supplementation and a very good diet. With a good balance of nutrients and thyroid function, the protective progesterone, pregnenolone and DHEA are produced sufficiently to reduce the burden on the adrenal glands. Gallbladder problems are extremely common in hypothyroidism [family history], and the compensating stress hormones produce problems with blood sugar regulation. C-sections, anesthesia, DES, and mechanical attitudes toward pregnancy and nutrition all have their place in the authoritarian medical culture, part of a generally stressful culture. That culture is coherent and self-validating, and escape from it has to be equally systematic to be able to persist.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding hypothyroid pregnant women in the 1950s, C-section births, and hormonal balance.

**RAY PEAT:** It's important to know how it was measured, and what your platelet count was. Is your intestine inflamed? Since serotonin affects bone metabolism, have your serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D3, prolactin, and cortisol been measured? I don't think doctors know what to do for regulating serotonin. Vitamin B6 helps to direct tryptophan toward niacinamide, away from serotonin. Gelatin contains no tryptophan, so things like consomme can be helpful. Raw carrots, because of their antiseptic effect, help to lower irritation and bloating. Antibiotics can be helpful, when the small intestine is overgrown with bacteria. Thyroid supplementation will lower cholesterol. Some people get very sleepy with just two milligrams of Periactin, so I think it's good to start with one mg. the first night. Two milligrams can make a big difference, and when symptoms stop the effects can last for days without using it.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding high serotonin levels and potential treatments.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's true, that coffee affects mainly non-heme iron absorption. The heme has toxic effects, forming carbon monoxide, apart from the iron. As I understand it, the amount of non-heme iron that's absorbed increases with the extent of its reduction, with ferrous iron being absorbed much more than the ferric form. The presence of reductants in the food will increase absorption.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding heme iron absorption and coffee's effect.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's true, that coffee affects mainly non-heme iron absorption. The heme has toxic effects, forming carbon monoxide, apart from the iron.

**CONTEXT:** Regarding heme iron absorption and coffee's effect.

**RAY PEAT:** When a person has limited money for food, potatoes are a better staple than beans or oats. Starches associated with saponins, alkaloids, and other potentially pro-inflammatory things make them a less than ideal food, if you have digestion-related health problems, and if you can afford to choose. New potatoes are tastier, less starchy, and probably less likely to cause digestive irritation.
**CONTEXT:** Thoughts on potatoes as a food staple.

**RAY PEAT:** PUFA (omega-3 and -6 oils, also called polyunsaturated fatty acids) break down into several toxic things, including acrolein, which oxidizes to form acrylate, and both of them react with ammonia or amines to form acrylamide. I haven't read the article, but it does seem odd that they would think the starch was the source of the acrylamide.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding acrylamide formation and its relation to starch and PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** 2 or 3 times a day will usually do it, you can check blood pressure to see its cumulative effect, but you should see a lingering increase of the pinkness of your nail beds.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding bag breathing and its frequency for increasing CO2 levels.

**RAY PEAT:** I know people who had lifelong "aspirin allergy" who now use it regularly. I think part of it is the metabolic problems caused by PUFA and low thyroid function.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding aspirin intolerance and its potential causes.

**RAY PEAT:** Goat milk contains more copper than cow milk, and copper is important for energy metabolism and blood formation. Thyroid hormone regulates ferritin, so it doesn't indicate iron status. Low thyroid function can increase sensitivity to histamine, and make it harder to adapt to heat and humiditty. When thyroid function is low, the ability to burn calories can be very low, and then the daily protein requirement is likely to be below 80 grams per day. Low fat milk or cottage cheese is a very good protein for stimulating the metabolism, fruits such as oranges, cherries, guavas, cherimoyas, and watermelons are good carbohydrates, and having some mostly saturated fat with each meal helps to regulate digestion and assimilation.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding goat milk, ferritin, histamine sensitivity, and protein requirements in hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, it's part of really good health. However, especially during the last 100 years, that state of consciousness has made people targets for the deranged onlookers. I have found it to be easier in Mexico.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding pursuing a state of heightened consciousness and its potential social implications.

**RAY PEAT:** Feedback of various kinds can be very helpful--sounds, visual, electrical, temperature, breath analysis (CO2, CO, NO, etc.). I think the reason fasting has had a reputation for facilitating enlightenment is that intestinal toxins create a chronic state of depression and sense of helplessness.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding mind-body practices and the influence of intestinal toxins on consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** Things in the LSD and antiserotonin category, caffeine, some of the mushroom chemicals, possibly mescaline.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding psychedelics and consciousness-expanding substances.

**RAY PEAT:** I think intermittent training is good if it avoids increased cortisol. Some nutrients, like vitamin K, can be stored in the fat and liver for a long time. Intense stress activates epigenetic processes that I think are hard to reverse. Temporary excess of some nutrients can probably help to restore processes to normal, or to higher functional levels. Deprivation increases the ability to tolerate deprivation. The mind is always involved, with imagination being part of the body-forming processes, and it's important to keep the whole life development in mind.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding nutrient cycling, training, stress, and the influence of the mind.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that's true, that coffee affects mainly non-heme iron absorption. The heme has toxic effects, forming carbon monoxide, apart from the iron. As I understand it, the amount of non-heme iron that's absorbed increases with the extent of its reduction, with ferrous iron being absorbed much more than the ferric form. The presence of reductants in the food will increase absorption.
**CONTEXT:** Regarding heme iron absorption and coffee's effect.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, that==================================================

**RAY PEAT:** There are some strong nervous and circulatory interactions between the intestine and the mouth, affecting surfaces and periodontal health, tooth sensitivity, etc. I knew a dentist who stopped doing periodontal surgery when he found that his patients were more easily cured with a laxative. Camphoric acid has been used as an intestinal disinfectant to remedy problems such as coated or sore tongue or bad breath. The tetracyclines have similar effects. Vitamins D and K are important.
**CONTEXT:** Question about tongue, teeth, and gum problems.

**RAY PEAT:** Building muscle with an anabolic diet, and the right kind of activity, causes a hormonal shift.
**CONTEXT:** Question about increasing muscle tone to eliminate cellulite.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, any starch can; long cooking, and butter or cream, can reduce that effect.
**CONTEXT:** Question about tapioca starch potentially causing endotoxins.

**RAY PEAT:** If it's from your basic metabolism, it will stay close to that all day while sitting.
**CONTEXT:** Question about body temperature staying under 98F despite thyroid supplementation and elevated pulse rate, suggesting a possible adrenaline surge.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you seen my website article on milk? It mentions some of the things behind gluten sensitivity. Hypothyroidism is one thing that commonly causes leaky gut, as well as leaky liver, muscles, heart, thyroid gland, etc. The immune system reacts to the leakiness, and although it might be an effect, rather than a cause, the presence of antibodies is sometimes said to show autoimmunity.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether leaky gut caused by gluten could be a main causative factor in type 1 autoimmune diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** All those foods contain some thiamine and niacinamide, is there a special reason for that much niacin? Coffee is a good source.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the benefit of specific supplements (niacinamide, pregnenolone, T3, Vitamin D, Cascara Sagrada, coffee, chocolate) for type 1 diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** The presence of specific antibodies means that someone has been exposed to an antigen, but it doesn't indicate that they will react badly to it.

**CONTEXT:** Question about the reliability of Cyrex Lab panels testing blood for cross-reactive foods, specifically molecular mimicry causing gut damage.

**RAY PEAT:** They are interesting, but usually free T3 and TSH are the most important ones. Judging by symptoms, temperature, and pulse rate is really the basic thing.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the worthiness of thyroid blood tests prior to supplementing with cynomel and a pro-thyroid diet.

**RAY PEAT:** Glucose stimulates regeneration, and pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA help to keep them alive. Thyroid and good nutrition gradually help to detoxify the stored fats that are responsible for killing them. Aspirin and niacinamide help in different ways.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the possibility of pancreatic cell regeneration in type 1 autoimmune diabetes and studies to support this.

**RAY PEAT:** I just do occasional seminars. The current culture of colleges and universities in the US favors a career-centered conformism, nothing that I would fit into.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether Dr. Peat still teaches at colleges or universities.

**RAY PEAT:** Increased metabolic rate could increase fat appetite.
**CONTEXT:** Question about craving a higher fat ratio (around 50% of calories) with type 1 diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** Free fatty acids are usually high in diabetes, and interfere with glucose use. Aspirin and niacinamide help to lower stress increased fatty acids, so allow exercised muscles to use more glucose. 2 or 3 mcg of cynomel with some food should help to avoid the adrenaline. Vitamins D and K, and salt and calcium, are other things that improve glucose use. Since the liver needs glucose and glycogen to convert T4 into T3, diabetes usually interferes with the conversion. A blood test could show if the ratio of T4 to T3 is very high.
**CONTEXT:** Question about starting T3 dosage for type 1 diabetes, timing of increases, and the need for both cynomel and cynoplus.

**RAY PEAT:** Because of the harmful effect of PUFA, I think it's good to keep all fat intake somewhat low, because even butter and coconut oil contain about 2% PUFA. Fruits and vegetables have sugar in a good balance with the minerals needed to metabolize it.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether to follow a higher sugar or higher fat diet with type 1 diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you seen effects on your temperature and pulse rate from the Cynomel? The need for T3 increases premenstrually, and is probably greater with diabetes.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the effectiveness of pregnenolone and other supplements for menstrual cramps in type 1 diabetes, and how long it might take to see results.

**RAY PEAT:** It breaks down into salicylic acid and acetic acid, and both of those are safe.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of animal aspirin that smells like vinegar, possibly indicating decomposition.

**RAY PEAT:** A combination of eggs and oysters would cover the main nutrients, but not as well.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the usefulness of desiccated liver tablets or alternative food combinations for nutrients if liver cannot be tolerated.

**RAY PEAT:** The ratio of calcium to phosphate is more important than the absolute amount of calcium. 4 ounces would usually be enough.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the amount of Parmigiano Regiano needed to obtain sufficient daily calcium.

**RAY PEAT:** If thyroid function is good, and inflammation is low, about 5 mg of DHEA is probably safe, but I think pregnenolone and cynomel would probably be as effective.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether pregnenolone (plus cynomel) can convert to DHEA effectively with type 1 diabetes for beta cell regeneration, or if DHEA itself is better.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you kept a record of your (waking and midday) temperature and pulse rate? How were you using the progesterone? Did your blood glucose or insulin requirement change while using those? Has your vitamin D been measured?
**CONTEXT:** Question about severe period pains, heavy bleeds, and clots in type 1 diabetes, and potential dietary or hormonal interventions.

**RAY PEAT:** I think a combination thyroid product (such as Armour thyroid USP, Thyrolar, Cynoplus, etc.) might work better. Clots and pain, and the low temperature, imply that your thyroid function was still very low. What has your TSH level been?
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up to the previous question about period pains, detailing temperature, progesterone use, blood glucose, and vitamin D levels.

**RAY PEAT:** The cynoplus tablets can be divided into pieces so that each dose of T3 is similar to the amount you were taking in cytomel. In diabetes, when cells aren't getting enough glucose, T4 can't be converted to the active T3, and so it can build up in the body to levels that interfere with metabolism, but the advantage of a combination is that T4 inhibits TSH, and TSH is responsible for many of the symptoms.
**CONTEXT:** Question about using Cynoplus for type 1 diabetes and whether it's the same as cynomel.

**RAY PEAT:** Pure colorless highly distilled alcohol is the safest. It can have antioxidant effects, but in some people it can interfere with the respiratory enzymes and lower blood sugar. Fructose is protective against some of its toxic effects.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether alcohol is estrogen promoting and if any types are safe to drink.

**RAY PEAT:** Hypothyroidism is the basic cause of heavy menstruation. Things strong enough to kill an embryo can't be harmless to a person.
**CONTEXT:** Question about safe contraceptive pills as an alternative to addressing heavy periods with diet and lifestyle.

**RAY PEAT:** Polyunsaturated fats damage the pancreas and increase stress hormones, while glucose stimulates the renewal of insulin-secreting cells. Fruits provide minerals that help to regulate glucose metabolism, and help to regulate thyroid function.
**CONTEXT:** Question about how to eat with type 1 diabetes, specifically regarding cravings for fat and sugar, and the preference for sugar as a fuel source.

**RAY PEAT:** Diabetes usually causes some interference with the formation of the active thyroid hormone, leading to increased cortisol relative to progesterone and DHEA. Those vitamins, and pregnenolone and progesterone help to strengthen capillaries.
**CONTEXT:** Question about easy bruising, its potential link to hypothyroidism, low vitamin K/D, and how to stop it, especially with type 1 diabetes and injections.

**RAY PEAT:** Pure aspirin is available by the kilogram. 30 mg of pregnenolone without excipients is o.k.; niacinamide should be tried for allergy reaction, but if there's no reaction, 50 to 75 mg with each meal might help to regulate glucose.
**CONTEXT:** Question about starting doses for pregnenolone and niacinamide, and sourcing pure aspirin for type 1 diabetes, considering issues with UK brands.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, white bread is usually artificially leavened, and so contains unmodified starch and gluten.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether white bread, lacking fiber, would still cause intestinal irritation and endotoxins.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, it's definitely a problem for people who are sensitive to gluten. Homemade bread, that's soaked for about 12 hours during leavening, is much safer than the typical commercial bread.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about whether white bread is okay to eat occasionally if gluten sensitive.

**RAY PEAT:** Since the half-life of T4 is about two weeks, your adaptations to it have just begun, but your TSH would already be significantly lowered by it. After you have been on a certain dose for at least two weeks, the blood tests would be easier to interpret. Did the supplement affect the night sweats?
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether to stop taking cynoplus prior to a thyroid panel test for night sweats and anemia in type 1 diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** Pregnenolone does convert to either DHEA or progesterone. Sugar and brewer's yeast are other things that help with the regeneration. Keeping free fatty acids low is important, and niacinamide could help with that.

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that it will age the skin. Have you tried topical sulfur and oral tetracycline?
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of benzoyl peroxide for acne, especially during pregnancy.

**RAY PEAT:** Antibiotics generally shouldn't be used during pregnancy. Sulfur (precipitated or sublimed) can be mixed into a slurry with water and patted onto the area. Dissolved aspirin used with it increases the antiseptic effect and reduces inflammation.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up questions about topical sulfur use for acne and the safety of tetracycline during pregnancy.

**RAY PEAT:** The people who wrote the label should be removed to fresh air immediately, their brains aren't getting enough oxygen. There are forms of sulfur that are ground, rather than precipitated, and they aren't as effective, but they aren't harmful. If it has a very strong smell, it might be contaminated; the smell should be mildly unpleasant. Ground sulfur/brimstone is commonly used in animal feed, so it isn't toxic.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the type of sulfur powder for a face mask, specifically if yellow brimstone powder is safe.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the smell varies slightly. When there's a skin fungal infection, there's a hydrogen sulfide stink, which is what kills the fungus.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about the smell of precipitated sulfur.

**RAY PEAT:** If you wake up feeling refreshed, I think it's very good to now and then get some extra sleep. Under-sleeping increases nitric oxide, and catch-up sleep lowers it. Niacinamide, coffee, and aspirin are things that lower NO.

**CONTEXT:** Question about whether sleeping for long periods and skipping meals is okay with type 1 diabetes, considering thyroid function and cortisol.

**RAY PEAT:** Endoscopy and biopsy can identify it, blood tests are often not reliable. Home made, slowly leavened bread contains much less gluten than the instantly leavened bread most bakeries sell.
**CONTEXT:** Question about a definitive way to tell if a person has gluten sensitivity, especially with type 1 diabetes.

**RAY PEAT:** Diabetes tends to interfere with the activity of thyroid hormone, and low thyroid function is closely connected to gall bladder problems. It's important to have some carbohydrate with protein foods, to prevent decreased blood sugar symptoms.
**CONTEXT:** Question about nausea after high-fat foods with type 1 diabetes, and potential causes including pregnancy or gallbladder issues.

**RAY PEAT:** No.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of various supplements and foods during pregnancy or when trying to conceive.

**RAY PEAT:** Aspirin helps to increase the oxidation of glucose, reinforcing the effects of thyroid hormone. It can antagonize vitamin K, potentially increasing a bleeding tendency, but with a supplement of K it's safe to test the effects of a standard 5 grain tablet with a meal twice a day, to see if it helps to prevent hyperglycemia. The cynoplus should start with a sixth of a tablet per day, watching for effects during the first two weeks. Too much could raise blood sugar rather than regulating it; I hope no one is suggesting beginning with a whole tablet per day. The appropriate amount of progesterone depends on the need and time of month. Vitamin B1 helps to oxidize glucose, so its use should be adjusted according to need.
**CONTEXT:** General advice on thyroid supplementation, aspirin, and vitamin B1.

**RAY PEAT:** Zinc isn't directly an oxidant, but when it's used as a chemical supplement it can cause problems that it wouldn't in the form of foods. Both vitamin A and zinc are essential in the right amount for good skin health, but too much of either can disturb the immune function. Irritation of the intestine is often involved in skin problems, and supplements always contain trace contaminants that can cause reactions. When ADM bought Distillation Products from Eastman several years ago, the composition of their vitatmin E products went through several changes, and competing companies began making similar changes. Since then research results haven't been as consistent as they were 40 to 60 years ago, and I stopped recommending amounts up to a few hundred units per day, waiting to see more results of research. Some of the products sold as vitamin E now contain significant amounts of PUFA, and lack some of the substances such as octacosanol that were in traditional products. The right amount of thyroid is essential for skin immunity and metabolism of steroids in the skin. Topical anti inflammatory things such as tetracycline and aspirin often produce the quickest response.
**CONTEXT:** Discussion on skin health, acne, and the role of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin E, and thyroid.

**RAY PEAT:** Antibiotics can be used topically, but the tetracycline type is usually taken internally, for their antiinflammatory effect. Changing the diet while using an antibiotic can make the effect permanent.
**CONTEXT:** Discussion on topical antibiotics for acne.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the easiest thing would be an over-the-counter neomycin lotion.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the best topical form of tetracycline for acne obtainable from a UK GP.

**RAY PEAT:** The liver, intestine, and lungs interact very closely, and supporting the liver with nourishment and adequate thyroid, while avoiding irritating foods such as salads, beans, and allergens, will usually prevent recurring respiratory problems.
**CONTEXT:** Question about a protocol to prevent recurring pneumonia and lung scarring.

**RAY PEAT:** Some condoms are coated with silicone lubricant, and could cause allergic or immune problems. A fitted cervical cap, as described by Barbara Seaman, is probably the ideal. Some women have had success with a plastic diaphragm coated with progesterone.
**CONTEXT:** Question about chemical-free or safe contraception methods, considering body temperature monitoring and condom ingredients.

**RAY PEAT:** Rinsing the mouth right after eating.
**CONTEXT:** Question about reducing excess tartar from a higher fruit and sugar diet, and damage from coffee with sugar and fruit.

**RAY PEAT:** Do you have liver or brewers' yeast occasionally? Have you tried supplementing vitamin B1 and pantothenic acid? Do you use any aspirin?
**CONTEXT:** Question about controlling blood sugar levels with fruits in type 1 diabetes, and the effectiveness of current supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin B1 helps to oxidize glucose, so if you try 50 or 100 mg with a meal you should watch for possible hypoglycemia from the insulin. Pantothenic acid is safe in doses of 100 or 200 mg, and helps to limit hypoglycemia. Brewers' yeast has other nutrients that help with repairing the pancreas, but can cause gas, so it's best to start by pouring hot water over an ounce or two of it, and using just the liquid.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up questions about brewers' yeast, B1, pantothenic acid, and aspirin for type 1 diabetes blood sugar management.

**RAY PEAT:** Was your TSH tested? Usually the antibodies just mean that the thyroid gland is inflamed, and increased TSH can be responsible for that. T4 can suppress TSH protectively, but since intracellular glucose is needed for making T3, diabetes can interfere with that. I think some T3 is always appropriate with diabetes.
**CONTEXT:** Question about TPO antibodies showing up in a type 1 diabetes patient, gluten avoidance, and the appropriateness of cynomel with diabetes and potential T4 conversion issues.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the high TSH explains the antibodies, and a combination of T4 and T3 is usually all that’s needed; it usually takes a few months after suppressing TSH for the antibodies to decrease. Cortisol would be important to know, also estrogen and prolactin would be more informative than the common thyroid tests.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about thyroid blood panels and dosing T3 based on symptoms for type 1 diabetes with TPO antibodies.

**RAY PEAT:** I think Triyotex is T3, 75 mcg, which would be three times as much as Cynomel, but I haven’t tried it, and don’t know how effective it is. Usually, a 5 mcg dose of T3 with each meal is effective. Anti-aging Systems in England has a large variety of thyroid products.
**CONTEXT:** Question about obtaining T3 and T4 for type 1 diabetes, specifically regarding a product called Triyotex and tablet splitting.

**RAY PEAT:** Brands that I have used are Armour, Cynoplus, Novotiral, and Proloid-S. People have told me they have good results from WP-thyroid and Thyroid-S. Have you tried farmaciadelnino.com?
**CONTEXT:** Question about obtaining thyroid medication for type 1 diabetes, considering cold extremities, low pulse, high TSH, and unavailability of certain products.

**RAY PEAT:** Starches and polyunsaturated fats keep stressing beta cells as they regenerate. Endotoxin and nitric oxide cause insulin resistance, besides being toxic to the beta cells, so it’s essential to keep the small intestine relatively free of bacteria. A daily raw carrot salad is helpful; well cooked mushrooms every day can help in a variety of ways.
**CONTEXT:** Question about whether long-standing type 1 diabetes can be eradicated, and for research pointers.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it’s valuable to have a blood test for vitamin D to regulate the dose; TSH can be useful, too, but it’s very important to check your temperature and pulse rate regularly to judge the effects of a thyroid supplement, since the need for it varies with season and type of activity. Has your cortisol been checked occasionally? I think it’s common for kids to be diagnosed as diabetic when they have high blood sugar following a sickness such as flu; insulin treatment can institutionalize an over-production of the stress hormones. Inflammation of the intestine (which can start with an infection) can be sustained by undigested starches, and the resulting endotoxin/nitric oxide/serotonin can cause insulin resistance, so it’s important to keep the small intestine relatively germ-free. Melons and potatoes can feed bacteria if they are present. Adequate calcium is extremely important, because of the interactions of parathyroid hormone and serotonin with stress and glucose metabolism. Daily protein should be at least 80 grams, and fruit should provide a large part of the calories. A little vitamin B6 (10 mg) can help with amino acid metabolism.
**CONTEXT:** General advice on managing type 1 diabetes, including vitamin D, TSH, temperature/pulse monitoring, cortisol, intestinal health, calcium, protein, and vitamin B6.

**RAY PEAT:** It could show whether it’s chronically high. It can help to judge the doses of the things that lower it—pregnenolone, progesterone, aspirin, sugar, thyroid, calcium, etc.
**CONTEXT:** Question about the usefulness of a cortisol test 28 years after type 1 diabetes diagnosis.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you tried various cheeses? Orange juice is good, though the quality of the commercial products varies. Some people do well with well-cooked potatoes with butter, but the condition of the intestine affects the reaction. A daily raw carrot is sometimes enough to disinfect the intestine.
**CONTEXT:** Question about recommended foods for bowel movements with type 1 diabetes when dairy cannot be consumed, the suitability of pasteurized orange juice, and the potential issues with potatoes.

**RAY PEAT:** Tillamook vintage white sharp cheddar (2 or 3 years aged), Parmigiano reggiano, and pecorino romano are currently the safest. The Tillamook cheese process has been changed, so only what’s currently aging has the traditional composition.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about which cheeses are best to start with, and recommended calcium intake from eggshells.

**RAY PEAT:** Have you had blood tests for hormones? The whole complex of symptoms including hiatal hernia is usually caused by a general weakness of digestive and hormonal processes, and it’s especaily imortant to check thyroid function carefully, with a blood test and recording waking and midday temperature and pulse rate, and average caloric requirement.
**CONTEXT:** Question about hiatal hernia symptoms and potential recovery approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** It is most likely to develop as a result of reduced thyroid hormone and increased stress hormones (especially cortisol, in relation to testosterone and DHEA), weakening connective tissues. Some foods that cause intestinal irritation can make it worse; a simplified diet makes it possible to identify any specific foods that make the problem worse. Keeping a record of temperature and pulse rate can help to recognize any hormonal problems.
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about the cause of hiatal hernia after finasteride use, and its impact on eating.

**RAY PEAT:** The only other one that I’ve tried was Pro T3 from Anti-aging systems.
**CONTEXT:** Question about recommended brands of T3-only medication now that Cytomel is out of production.

**RAY PEAT:** During the first week or two of supplementing thyroid, there is usually an intensification of the effect of adrenaline. It’s necessary to watch a variety of signs, especially the temperature of hands and feet and the amount of water evaporated, to judge the actual effect of thyroid. The effect of thyroid after the level of adrenaline has normalized is to increase the depth of relaxation.
**CONTEXT:** Question about experiencing a complete alleviation of hypothyroid symptoms for one week with a T3/T4 combination, followed by a reversion to hypothyroid state despite the same dose.

**RAY PEAT:** I think an oil or cream with real testosterone (and DHEA) is much better than the injections, which are usually an ester of testosterone in a toxic solvent.
**CONTEXT:** Question about testosterone injections for someone with good thyroid function but low testosterone levels, and whether gels or creams are superior.

**RAY PEAT:** Your comments and suggestions are so insightful, I’m surprised to hear that you’re a math student. I think the serotonin aspect is involved, with “inescapable stress” a part of the culture. (For rats, biting the source of the stress is therapeutic.) I think a profession attracts people with a certain personality type, and then reinforces certain traits and biochemical balances. All of the mathematicians that I’ve known held a platonist view of math, that affected their general mentality—an avoidance of ambiguity and perceptual richness, an inflexibility or authoritarianism in everything. Alfred North Whitehead was a mathematician who very successfully got out of the platonist culture/personality; he recognized that the body is always a part of the cognitive processes.
**CONTEXT:** Question about why mathematics professors tend to be authoritative and dislike questioning, and whether it's due to culture, brain structure, or personality.

**RAY PEAT:** Adrenaline can increase to compensate for low thyroid function, and causes pupils to dilate. Thyroxin by itself works when your liver is in good condition, supplied with enough glucose, and not stressed by adrenaline and other stress hormones. Something that contains both T4 and T3 is better for getting out of a stress pattern. Armour thyroid or Novotiral might work better than Eutirox. Too much of the weed interferes with liver function, and while it’s recovering it’s necessary to be careful to get enough protein and other nutrients every day, for example orange juice, eggs, milk, cheese, cooked mushrooms, occasional shellfish.
**CONTEXT:** Question about severe pelvic floor dysfunction, reliance on marijuana for sleep and restless leg syndrome, pupil dilation, and the effects of T4 and T3.

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin A oxidizes easily and an excess can create symptoms of a deficiency, so vitamin E is the most important thing for correcting it; excess vitamin A, like PUFA, interferes with thyroid hormone transport, so it’s important to balance the two.

**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of lactose-free milk containing lactase enzyme.

**RAY PEAT:** The dry skin and weak pulse suggest very low thyroid function. The salmon, avocado, and rice are a good balance of fat, protein, and carbohydrate; maybe fat cheese could be substituted for the salmon sometimes. Both sugar and fat stimulate the digestive system hormone that stimulates brain cell renewal. Progesterone helps to reduce tension and excitation, and protects nerves. Pregnenolone reduces stress, and protects nerves.

**RAY PE==================================================

**RAY PEAT:** "My myopia improved about 3 diopters when I spent a few months at high altitude, and took some pregnenolone. I think it's the CO2 balance in the tissues with reduced oxygen pressure, Bohr effect. If you are adapted, the higher altitudes have more effect. The time I noticed the biggest change I was only at 6600 feet altitude, but shorter stays at 8700 feet caused quick improvement. I used that method for several years and stopped the progression while I did it, but when I started to read all day year after year, I neglected it. I got it from Aldous Huxley's Art of Seeing, describing the Bates method. I worked with an optometrist who had studied at Ohio State, when their optometry school was progressive."
**CONTEXT:** Question about myopia improvement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Having liver and shellfish once a week to help with the vitamins and trace minerals, and two quarts of milk per day, and plenty of fruit, should help with the sensitivity and night blindness."
**CONTEXT:** Question about light sensitivity and night blindness.

**RAY PEAT:** "The calcium, accompanied by some saturated fat, is a major benefit of milk and cheese."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the major benefits of milk and cheese.

**RAY PEAT:** "Colostrum is probably o.k., but increasing glutathione isn't necessarily evidence that something is beneficial; it's a common reaction to injury."
**CONTEXT:** Question about colostrum and increased glutathione.

**RAY PEAT:** "Too much liver can inhibit thyroid function, so the amount depends on the individual. I think there are other reasons, but the high A content is the main one. A high ratio of phosphate to calcium contributes."
**CONTEXT:** Question about liver consumption.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some people feel better with a tablespoon or two of gelatin with their regular foods."
**CONTEXT:** Question about gelatin.

**RAY PEAT:** "I had a two dollar bag of corn meal that got moist and metabolized for several months, but the movement of air in a house is usually too much for a bag to make a noticeable difference."
**CONTEXT:** Question about CO2 bags.

**RAY PEAT:** "Salt appetite is usually a good indicator of need."
**CONTEXT:** Question about salt.

**RAY PEAT:** "Avoiding stress, with occasional liver in the diet, regular eggs, to keep the vitamin intake high."
**CONTEXT:** Question about eye floaters.

**RAY PEAT:** "Enlarged vessels in the eye, especially if there's yellow around them, are suggestive of a B vitamin deficiency, especially B2, but there are no really safe supplements of B2, so having liver once a week would be reasonable."
**CONTEXT:** Question about bloodshot eyes.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think a little aspirin, regularly if not daily, is good prevention, if you are sure to get enough vitamin K, to prevent excess bleeding. The amount depends on how you react to it, and can change as your metabolism adjusts. Taking some at night can be very helpful for sleeping; sometimes I take about 500 mg at night, but other times just a little. I think the crystals are more stable, but I keep the big container (a multi-year supply) in the freezer, and keep out enough for a couple of months. The powdered forms developed an acetic acid smell with time, the crystals don't."
**CONTEXT:** Question about aspirin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Intestinal bacteria are an important source of B12, and many plant materials contain some. Carotene can be converted to vitamin A when B12 is available. I don't think the real causes of a B12 deficiency are known. A generous dietary source of both A and B12 is desirable, but usually not essential. I think the main reason for having a significant amount of fat in the diet is for its effect on digestion."
**CONTEXT:** Question about nutrient requirements of a pure fruit/no-fat diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "Shea butter has about 3 times as much linoleic acid as coconut oil."
**CONTEXT:** Question about shea butter.

**RAY PEAT:** "I use either coconut soap or baking soda for washing my hair. I rarely use soap on my skin."
**CONTEXT:** Question about hair washing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Getting enough sodium in the diet helps to retain magnesium, but both of them are lost easily when thyroid function is low; when the thyroid status is good, the requirement for magnesium is easily met by ordinary foods. The things I most often recommend for magnesium are the water from boiling greens such as beet, chard, turnip and kale, and coffee. Magnesium carbonate is a very good supplement, except that it can cause intestinal irritation. People tell me that they don't have bowel irritation from magnesium glycinate. Either Mg chloride or Mg sulfate with baking soda can be absorbed through the skin."
**CONTEXT:** Question about magnesium requirement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Growing children need quite a bit of protein containing tryptophan."
**CONTEXT:** Question about a children's protein requirement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Dark roast coffee provides the most niacin."
**CONTEXT:** Question about coffee and niacin.

**RAY PEAT:** "Magnesium supplements often cause bowel inflammation, and intestinal irritation can cause insomnia."
**CONTEXT:** Question about magnesium supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "I always take my cynoplus at night, to go to sleep faster; it has an antiinflammatory effect."
**CONTEXT:** Question about thyroid/Cynoplus.

**RAY PEAT:** "Keeping the TSH a little lower is the best way to assure balance of the minerals, since it helps with the retention of sodium and magnesium. Drinking milk and salting food to taste will provide a good balance when the stress hormones are low."
**CONTEXT:** Question about mineral balance.

**RAY PEAT:** "When you are hypothyroid, there’s usually an increase of stress hormones in compensation, and they hold up the pulse rate and temperature, especially in the early morning. T4 builds up in the body in the first few weeks, so it’s good to stay on a certain dose for at least two or three weeks, watching its effects, then adding a little to the dose, and watching for gradual reduction of stress (lower morning numbers, higher midday numbers) and increase of metabolic rate. It’s best to absorb it slowly, to imitate the normal pattern of secretion, and food helps to slow the absorption. In the evening a little milk, rather than a whole meal, is usually enough."
**CONTEXT:** Question about thyroid supplementation dosage and timing.

**RAY PEAT:** "In principle it could increase circulation to the thyroid, possibly increasing secretion, but I doubt that it has much effect."
**CONTEXT:** Question about exposing the neck/thyroid area to red light to entice metabolism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don’t think I would for a broken bone, unless it happened in Romania or some other less medicalized country, but I don’t suggest that other people should be so cautious."
**CONTEXT:** Question about going into the hospital for ailments other than broken bones.

**RAY PEAT:** "1982 I slipped on ice while carrying a heavy machine, and sat down on my ankle, causing a sharp pain in the lower half of my fibula; the area was swollen, with a discolored area along the bone, and for a few weeks I couldn’t put my weight on it. Nothing was displaced noticeably, so there was nothing to do but let it heal. I had known people with broken bones that had been badly set by doctors, and others whose bones had been perfectly set by farmers, so I would have had a friend help if I couldn’t reset a major fracture by myself. If a person doesn’t understand what’s happening to them, and thinks it’s something that a hospital could help, they should go, but they should also have a reasonable amount of knowledge about their body, and about the dangers of hospitalization. A couple of years ago I was involved, by telephone, with someone who suddenly developed extreme weakness and bleeding in his lungs, and whose doctor quickly did a series of appropriate tests and used appropriate treatments, and brought him back from a comatose state in a few days. It was the sort of thing that Dr. House might have done, the intelligent application of a large amount of knowledge. Such things are possible, but after having seen hundreds of people ruined by medical ignorance, I was surprised to see that it could actually happen."
**CONTEXT:** Question about reasonable symptoms for visiting a hospital.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think 1%-fat milk is best for most people."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the optimal type of milk.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don’t think it will have a similar effect, but it might provide its own unique benefit."
**CONTEXT:** Question about using taurine instead of glycine/gelatin to reduce muscle meat's anti-thyroid effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends greatly on the person’s skin, and how well it’s rubbed in and how long it’s left on; sometimes it’s a lot less."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the transdermal availability of vitamin D in MCT oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Considering those reports of its toxicity, I can’t think of a worse place to use it."
**CONTEXT:** Question about using DMSO on the scrotum with vitamin K2.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think a combination or natural thyroid such as Thyrolar, Cynoplus, or Armour is usually best. A basic antistress action of thyroid is to convert cholesterol into pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA, but that requires adequate cholesterol, and a good mixed diet helps to maintain that."
**CONTEXT:** Question about supplementing thyroid during periods of irregular stress.

**RAY PEAT:** "Having a distinct symptom that is uncomfortable is a reason for looking for the cause; if a symptom is frequent and disabling to any extent, then it’s appropriate to invest some time and effort in figuring it out. When anxiety is the problem, people sometimes interpret insignificant sensations as danger signals instead of attending to the causes of the anxiety."
**CONTEXT:** Question about hyperchondria versus reasonable concern for health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Often it’s some simple thing, such as hypothyroidism. A chronic external stress (such as crocodiles or secret police) can lead to an internal change, such as thyroid failure."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the causes of anxiety.

**RAY PEAT:** "They can be good, but there’s so much junk, it takes some effort to find the good ones."
**CONTEXT:** Question about cinema and TV shows.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it depends on a person’s intestinal bacteria, but there are some potentially irritating or allergenic chemicals in carrots that don’t occur in mushrooms. Cooked bamboo shoots are another alternative to carrot."
**CONTEXT:** Question about differences between mushrooms and carrots, and why someone might tolerate one but not the other.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s nice that they noticed that there’s a difference between better and worse orange juice. It’s odd that nutritionists haven’t noticed that a 75 gram glucose tolerance test is stressful, and that stress hormones create free radical oxidative damage; and that, under more realistic circumstances, glucose or other carbohydrate lowers stress hormones and ROS."
**CONTEXT:** Question about orange juice and its effects on glucose tolerance.

**RAY PEAT:** "I always have them with other foods; the intestine makes appropriate adjustments when the diet is consistent."
**CONTEXT:** Question about eating fibers with or without other foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "I have noticed that, when my thyroid activity has been good and my glycogen stores are high, salty fat cheese helps me to tolerate stress, but with lower thyroid function and poor glycogen stores, sugar is essential for keeping stress under control."
**CONTEXT:** Question about sugar versus fat for stress response.

**RAY PEAT:** "I hadn’t noticed that recently, but about 25 years ago a group of women had some effect on the way the media spoke about it. I think the composition of the fat, and the person’s general health history, affect the risks of being fat. In some cultures, fat has corresponded to social-financial status, so its negative effects have been offset by the benefits of wealth."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the negative effects of excess body fat.

**RAY PEAT:** "Anything without harmful additives. Mozzarella and Oaxaca, and some kinds of feta, often don’t have the harmful additives."
**CONTEXT:** Question about cheeses besides Parmigiano-Reggiano.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it’s safe if the bone is thoroughly sterilized."
**CONTEXT:** Question about bone grafts.

**RAY PEAT:** "We make fats from sugar, starch, and amino acids. Even the brain has enzymes to make new fats."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the raw material for fat synthesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "They can take up fatty acids that are free or bound to albumin."
**CONTEXT:** Question about muscles burning fat.

**RAY PEAT:** "They are the best available, as far as I know. I have known people who were planning to have artificial joints, who changed their plans after using progesterone."
**CONTEXT:** Question about titanium implants.

**RAY PEAT:** "Resting muscle burns mostly fatty acids, and the amount of glucose used increases with the intensity."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the fat-burning zone during exercise.

**CONTEXT:** Question about the negative effects of male vasectomy.

**RAY PEAT:** "If they are eaten without pulverizing the seeds I think they are o.k."
**CONTEXT:** Question about berries versus starches.

**RAY PEAT:** "The newer information about it and the structure of hyperforin look good, but the photosensitizing effects of hypericin seem risky, likely to damage the eyes; maybe someone will separate the chemicals."
**CONTEXT:** Question about St. John's Wort.

**RAY PEAT:** "I know a few people besides myself who have had very good results from swallowing a little lidocaine; absorbing it through the skin works too, if you use enough."
**CONTEXT:** Question about lidocaine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Histamine and serotonin promote wakefulness, and cyproheptadine blocks those, but its other effects aren’t very pleasant. Have you tried diphenhydramine? Endotoxin from intestinal bacteria increases histamine and serotonin; poor digestion is probably the most common cause of insomnia. Avoiding starches is often helpful. Small amounts of some excipients in supplements, and allergens in some foods, can increase the nighttime absorption of endotoxin. The antimicrobial/antiinflammatory effects of cascara can improve sleep; an antibiotic such as tetracycline can reduce the intestinal inflammation."
**CONTEXT:** Question about insomnia and potential causes/solutions.

**RAY PEAT:** "In general, cellulose fibers do protect against bowel cancer, but a few plant fibers that contain lignin or that are fermentable increase cancer. Wheat bran is the only common cereal fiber that’s protective."
**CONTEXT:** Question about other fibers that protect against bowel cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Have you tried other types of antihistamine, such as ketotifen, diphenhydramine, or cyproheptadine?"
**CONTEXT:** Question about antihistamines for hay fever.

**RAY PEAT:** "Coffee, aspirin, and pregnenolone are usually helpful; Benadryl works for some people, though its excipients can be allergenic."
**CONTEXT:** Question about hay fever remedies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, but I weigh it against the alternatives."
**CONTEXT:** Question about concerns regarding frozen concentrate orange juice packaging.

**RAY PEAT:** "The fresh ones shouldn't have any problems, but some of the pasteurized kind seem to have been processed in other ways. I just use the kinds that taste o.k. and don't produce bad reactions."
**CONTEXT:** Question about problems with reconstituted or fresh commercial orange juices.

**RAY PEAT:** "All the major companies now say that they aren't using the pulp-melting enzymes; I think they were afraid of getting sued."
**CONTEXT:** Question about changes in frozen concentrate orange juice production.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think that was referring to its use as eye drops, where it’s extremely well absorbed."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the dilution of T3 for topical use.

**RAY PEAT:** "Every tissue of the body that has been tested for it has the enzymes needed to metabolize thyroxine; toxins, such as lipid peroxides, can affect some tissues more than others, making a T3 supplement more valuable for them. Systemic changes, such as in calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and sugar, can affect them, and a higher-than-normal concentration of hormone on the skin, can sometimes overcome those regional defects. One researcher found that T3 is normally converted into 3,5-T2 by functional mitochondria."
**CONTEXT:** Question about topical T3 effectiveness on other body parts.

**RAY PEAT:** "If it penetrates about half a centimeter into the skin before it’s greatly diluted by the blood, the local concentration could be high with moderate absorption. People have had good results using a solution with 10 mcg in 100 ml. on skin rashes."
**CONTEXT:** Question about topical T3 concentration and effectiveness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Correcting a magnesium deficiency can help to correct excessive prolactin, but I haven’t heard warnings related to prolactin. When an excess of magnesium is taken up very quickly it can cause profound anesthesia, but the kidneys soon excrete enough to correct it."
**CONTEXT:** Question about dangers of taking magnesium with high prolactin.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think you’re right about keeping the roots to reduce bone loss; rinsing the mouth with coconut oil reduces bacteria. Dental abscesses probably originate with digestive problems; a dentist I knew discovered that he no longer had to treat his patients’ periodontal disease surgically when he prescribed laxatives for them. I think the “silent infection” doctrine is mostly an excuse for expensive treatments. The association between jaw abscesses and heart disease is probably by way of a more general problem involving low vitamin D, a low ratio of calcium to phosphate in the diet, intestinal inflammation, and chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system."
**CONTEXT:** Question about dental health, jawbone infections, and heart disease.

**RAY PEAT:** "With pure vitamin E as a solvent it might be o.k., but I think it’s risky to alter the lipids in the environment of the gonads."
**CONTEXT:** Question about applying fat-soluble vitamins or hormones to the testicles.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don’t think it’s something that a person should spend a lot of time doing."
**CONTEXT:** Question about swimming in public swimming pools.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ratio of potassium to sodium, and the avoidance of polyunsaturated oils, were basic principles of Gerson’s. I think his objection to milk and cheese was based on their high fat content, and the addition of salt to cheese. The nutritional composition of milk from grass fed animals is very similar to that of the grass they ate, apart from the saturation of the fatty acids. The current ideas of the Gerson diet don’t accurately reflect Gerson’s ideas; for example, the book his daughter published about 20 years after his death advocated using linseed oil, on the pages where he had warned in capital letters against using any oil, and she claimed that she had found information in his office indicating admiration for Johanna Budwig’s ideas, including the use of linseed oil."
**CONTEXT:** Question about vegetarianism and the Gerson diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "That has been my impression, but I haven’t seen any organized tests of it."
**CONTEXT:** Question about Coke versus Pepsi nutritionally or allergy-wise.

**RAY PEAT:** "The last three are safe."
**CONTEXT:** Question about safe antiparasitic/antifungal agents.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s the time of soaking that lets the enzymes break down the gluten, so I think the longer time is probably better, but I haven’t had experience with longer than about 16 hours. The nature of the starter makes a difference, and adding sugar is a way to prevent the development of a bad taste. It’s essential to use flour that hasn’t been heat treated."
**CONTEXT:** Question about sourdough fermentation time.

**RAY PEAT:** "The steroids are probably valuable; although I’m skeptical of the mad cow disease theory, I don’t eat ruminant brains."
**CONTEXT:** Question about eating ruminant animal brains.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the (liver, brain) toxicity of the commercial aromatase inhibitors is too great except for treating cancer. A diet, with good thyroid function, that corrected the bloating should gradually shift the fat distribution. Hypothyroidism would greatly increase the toxicity."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety and hormonal consequences of estrogen inhibitors like Arimidex.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it’s best to grind them, because the fibrous material isn’t digestible; steroids will be emulsified with the various lipids."
**CONTEXT:** Question about mushroom preparation and absorption of beneficial compounds.

**RAY PEAT:** "I’ve never known a literal flat earther, but I’ve known several physicists and mathematicians who passionately believe that number is the basis of existence. Their timeless and colorless world is worse than a simply flat world. Our culture is swamped with highly authoritative disinformation; maybe the flat-earthers can be persuaded to be skeptical about other elements of the predominant world view. In Generative Energy I wrote about the expanding earth theory, and I’ve commented favorably on Halton Arp’s work on galaxies, and Kozyrev’s theory of stellar energy, Hannes Alfvén’s plasma cosmology—nothing that’s easy to interpret as flatness."
**CONTEXT:** Question about Earth's nature, reality, and disinformation.

**RAY PEAT:** "About 20,000 iu."
**CONTEXT:** Question about vitamin D dosage for skin application during winter.

**RAY PEAT:** "My particular grinder works better when they are cooked. No, I don’t know of any value of leaving some unground."
**CONTEXT:** Question about grinding mushrooms before or after cooking.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s o.k., if the context is clear."
**CONTEXT:** Question about sharing Ray Peat's emails on a forum.

**RAY PEAT:** "In general, I think white rice is safer. Real sourdough bread, in which most of the gluten has been degraded, is probably about as safe as rice. I think nixtamalized corn is the safest."
**CONTEXT:** Question about choosing between white bread and white rice.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think large amounts like that (I averaged about 3 grams/day for a year) are acting to inhibit inflammation and shift water balances, as well as inhibiting the stress hormones via the GABA system. Reducing sources of inflammation (for me it was grains and starches mostly) as well as regulating thyroid can take the place of the pregnenolone."
**CONTEXT:** Question about needing large amounts of pregnenolone to feel good and relaxed.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s o.k. on the skin if it’s allowed to evaporate quickly."
**CONTEXT:** Question about using isopropyl alcohol as a solvent for topical preparations.

**RAY PEAT:** "If you start with a small dose, you can usually increase it slightly at intervals of about two weeks while keeping the pulse fairly steady. Other things that improve glucose metabolism help to lower the stress hormones."
**CONTEXT:** Question about adjusting thyroid dosage during the period adrenaline is coming down.

**RAY PEAT:** "Those steroids can be absorbed through any skin, and I think the arms or legs would be better. I don’t think it’s a good idea to put anything odd into the proximity of testes or ovaries, and since I think even the purest DMSO will hold only about 3 or 4% of a steroid like DMSO in solution, the effect of the solvent might be greater than that of the DMSO. Taking the DMSO powder orally is very effective, too."
**CONTEXT:** Question about applying DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone to the testicles.

**RAY PEAT:** "For the present, I think having sodium chloride or baking soda in your bath might be more helpful than the magnesium, though they could be combined. I suspect that increased aldosterone could account for the anxiety/panic, and extra magnesium, potassium, or phosphate could make it worse; sodium, calcium, and vitamin D would tend to lower it."
**CONTEXT:** Question about anxiety and magnesium baths.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pregnenolone has multiple favorable effects. Sometimes thyroid can improve the ratio of androgens to cortisol and estrogen. Aspirin, by lowering cortisol, can improve the ratio. DHEA, in doses of 5 to 10 mg, can have a positive effect if thyroid function is good."
**CONTEXT:** Question about supplements to raise serum androgens safely in men.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think daily use of fluoride is likely to be harmful to the gums, but applying it occasionally to the teeth can harden the enamel, improving its resistance to cavities. I think the alkaline effect of baking soda is helpful for thorough cleaning."
**CONTEXT:** Question about daily teeth cleaning and fluoride toothpaste.

**RAY PEAT:** "I suppose there is some variation in the personalities at the different institutions in the US, but I think an essential part of medical authoritarianism is the curriculum. If a person can stay aware, year after year, that the curriculum is an ideology with many facts embedded in it, then it should be possible to get through it without seriously impaired intelligence."
**CONTEXT:** Question about medical schools and aspiring physicians.

**RAY PEAT:** "An intense stress can cause the hormones to get stuck in an inefficient state, often with suppressed thyroid function and decreased steroid production. Sometimes foods that are essential nutrient rich -- eggs, orange juice, oysters, liver -- or just pleasurable, milk shakes, ice cream etc. (especially at bedtime, to improve sleep), can break the pattern, and sometimes supplementing thyroid or pregnenolone can do it. Changing your view of your job is a possibility, but a healthy attitude in an unhealthy environment usually causes problems. I think real mindfulness is incompatible with nearly all the contemporary work environments."
**CONTEXT:** Question about mental stress, sleep quality, digestion, anxiety, and mindfulness.

**RAY PEAT:** "In addition to a few quarts of milk with added vitamin D, and eating liver, I rub several drops of the vitamin D oil onto my skin, and occasionally use an ultraviolet light."
**CONTEXT:** Question about vitamin D levels in winter.

**RAY PEAT:** "The liver catalyzes the hydroxylation of cholecalciferol to 25-OH-colecalciferol, and many nutritional deficiencies can effect the liver's functions. I've known several liver-avoiders whose serum 25-OH-Vitamin D stays low despite big doses, and I suspect their general nutrition is responsible. It's reasonable to feed their liver optimally."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the relationship between liver and vitamin D.

**RAY PEAT:** "David Ray Griffin's Process Theology would be similar to my view."
**CONTEXT:** Question about belief in God.

**CONTEXT:** Question about what to do if stuck on a long airline flight.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it’s best to use it regularly. The caffeine and other things are still working even when you have adapted so that the caffeine is less stimulating."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the regular consumption of coffee.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think I average about 60 grams."
**CONTEXT:** Question about personal daily fat intake.

**RAY PEAT:** "When a non-starchy fruit is available I think it’s always preferable to starch. Alkali-processed corn is the only kind that I’m willing to eat, and seldom that (e.g., corundas made with wood ashes)."
**CONTEXT:** Question about starches versus fruits.

**RAY PEAT:** "It activates the “helplessness” reactions in the body, stress weakening your own life, and I think it can help to get out of that if you think of your life as a continuation of theirs—the same life, though with fewer bodies."
**CONTEXT:** Question about grief and loss.

**RAY PEAT:** "I use hydrogenated coconut oil and sugar, and I think the combination is good for most people; in situations such as heart failure, more sugar would be preferable."
**CONTEXT:** Question about sugar versus saturated fat as fuel, and hydrogenated coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "At present about 500-600."
**CONTEXT:** Question about personal daily caffeine intake from coffee.

**RAY PEAT:** "Statistically, people who drink 5 or more cups per day are the healthiest, but in many places it’s common for coffee to have only about 100 mg per cup."
**CONTEXT:** Question about optimal daily caffeine intake from coffee.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most of the evidence suggests that it increases prostate cancer but decreases other cancers, especially colon, and is protective in other ways."
**CONTEXT:** Question about dairy and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "If it decreases many other risks, it’s healthful."
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about milk increasing prostate cancer risk.

**RAY PEAT:** "A gallon provides enough vitamin C. The vitamin C in meat is usually also much higher than the charts say. At a time when my diet was mostly milk, meat, eggs, cheese, oatmeal, and bread, I decided to check the amount of vitamin C in my urine, and over the period that I checked it, it was steadily more than 2000 mg per day."
**CONTEXT:** Question about vitamin C intake from milk and other foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think one of its good effects is stimulating the intestine, both secretions and motion. When its use is started in middle age, it’s less addictive."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the benefits of nicotine or tobacco.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are many well documented instances of very long lived people whose diets were probably low in PUFA, often based on milk, for example Old Thomas Parr: “He existed and even thrived on a diet of “subrancid cheese and milk in every form, coarse and hard bread and small drink, generally sour whey”, as William Harvey wrote. … "On this sorry fare, but living in his home, free from care, did this poor man attain to such length of days". Parr purportedly had an affair when he was over 100 years old and fathered a child born out of wedlock. After the death of his first wife, he married his child's mother at the alleged age of 122. Pine, L. G. (July 1965). "Thomas Parr – the most long-lived Englishman". Shropshire Magazine. Famous Shropshire sons – no. 5. 17 (5): 26–7. About 20 years ago, a Florida newspaper interviewed a man whose records showed an age of 135, who said his diet was mainly the oranges he ate while picking them; that had been his occupation for most of his life."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the potential lifespan increase from a very low PUFA diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think some would still accumulate in the fat tissues, unless total fat intake was low, and PUFA intake was half a gram or less."
**CONTEXT:** Question about PUFA accumulation with age on a low PUFA diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of the most potent are also destructive to all tissues. The safest are sugar, aspirin, pregnenolone, DHEA, progesterone, thyroid hormone, lidocaine, testosterone, and food sources of magnesium and calcium."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the most anti-inflammatory substances.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it’s a matter of the balance with other nutrients, keeping all the inflammatory things low, and the metabolic rate high. The calcium of milk is protective."
**CONTEXT:** Question about tryptophan intake and its balance with other nutrients.

**RAY PEAT:** "A friend and her two kids were living with us, and everyone marked their height on the door frame; I was about 40 at the time. About a year before we moved out of the house, I was experimenting with DHEA; I had previously been handling progesterone occasionally for several years. I probably took 10 or 15 mg per day, and after a few days there was a sudden change in a mole on my belly, and my horizontal, semi-impacted lower wisdom teeth suddenly began erupting; over a period of a few weeks, they moved into a fully erupted position. I was about 45 at that time. I noticed that my belt was looser, and I had a visible waste, so I checked my weight, and found that I hadn’t lost weight, though considerable fat had disappeared. We were moving out of the house, and before we left we checked our height on the door frame. My younger girl friend was about the same as before, I was considerably taller."
**CONTEXT:** Question about alleged DHEA-induced height growth.

**RAY PEAT:** "We can make fat from protein and carbohydrate; proteins, vitamins, and minerals are the main things for skin health."
**CONTEXT:** Question about low-fat diets and skin health.

**RAY PEAT:** "I have seen the “saturated fat increases endotoxin uptake” idea, but they ignored the bacteriostatic action of the saturated fat, and also its acceleration of the degradation process. I consider it to have been a typical misleading propaganda piece."
**CONTEXT:** Question about low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets to avoid endotoxin exposure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, like cabbage, cauliflower, mustard and radish it’s _possible_ to eat enough to cause enlargement of the thyroid gland, especially when the traditional diet favors a bitter, acidic variety of bamboo, but the blanched, mild tasting variety that’s popular in the US and China doesn’t seem to cause problems."
**CONTEXT:** Question about bamboo shoots and thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, I mean the PUFA, oleic acid is safe, and we synthesize it ourselves from carbohydrates."
**CONTEXT:** Question about unsaturated fats, specifically oleic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so, because of its high bioavailability in milk. Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2014 Apr;36(214):287-90. [Dairy products as source of folates]. [Article in Polish] Kowalska M, Cichosz G. Abstract Dairy products, especially yoghurts and blue cheeses, are underestimated source of folates in human diet. Though foliates content in dairy products is lower than in vegetables and cereals, nevertheless their bioavailability and stability is much better. High folate stability results from presence of hydro- and lipophylic antioxidants efficiently protecting folates and other bioactive compounds against oxidation processes on synergic way. On the other hand, high bioavailability is a consequence of folic appearing in milk mainly in form of mono glutamates and also of a presence of a protein ready to bind folates (FBP--folic binding protein). FBP makes easier folates transport through cell membranes. Moreover, present in milk sphingolipids and cholesterol stimulate activity of FBP. Mould cheeses and milk fermented beverages contain the highest amount of folates. However, cottage cheese contain considerable amount of folic binding protein. Regular consumption of milk fermented beverages and eating them together with vegetables and fruits rich in folates is a chance to increase covering of folic demand."
**CONTEXT:** Question about milk providing enough folic acid.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sometimes slightly low thyroid function can cause the cartilage in joints to swell, and sometimes to accumulate fluid. Slight nutritional deficiencies can contribute to it. Having some seafood once a week often helps, and having enough protein (80 to 100 grams) and calcium (about 1500 mg) is important."
**CONTEXT:** Question about popping joints.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the amount that would make a difference with heavy metals might be allergenic. Having coffee, milk, and orange juice as regular parts of your diet help to move iron out safely."
**CONTEXT:** Question about cilantro for heavy metal chelation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone is highly protective for the skin and follicles, preventing the formation of harmful prostaglandins, for example."
**CONTEXT:** Question about male pattern baldness and hypothyroidism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I found that a pinch, about 200 mg, daily for 3 or 4 days was effective for changing my intestinal flora; the effect lasted a few months. After using it occasionally for many years, I became sensitized to it, and it produced intestinal irritation."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety and dosage of flowers of sulfur for ingestion.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s good for flavor in small amounts, but in a high concentration it’s toxic to both human and bacterial cells."
**CONTEXT:** Question about raw garlic in carrot salad.

**RAY PEAT:** "I’ve occasionally mentioned that the typical calorie restricted diet increases the metabolic rate and decreases oxidative damage by reducing PUFA, cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and iron, possibly some random toxins. In one of the big nurses studies, someone noticed that those who ate the most lived the longest, i.e., had the highest metabolic rate."
**CONTEXT:** Question about caloric restriction and optimal diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "High phosphate and low vitamin D are probably the main things. Meat, beans, nuts, and grains have a very high ratio of phosphate to calcium. I think milk is protective, with its good ratio of calcium to phosphate."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the causes of kidney stones.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it depends on the level of activity and energy use. Milk fat has protective, stabilizing effects, and having it available for muscle metabolism spares glucose for the brain."
**CONTEXT:** Question about saturated fat intake and brain energy use.

**RAY PEAT:** "The excess sugar helps to keep tissue fats saturated, resisting oxidation-inflammation, but if the thyroid is a little low, so that digestion slows down, bacteria have a better chance to thrive when fat in the food is lower. If a little fat is taken with some fiber, for example olive oil with carrot salad, or butter on cooked mushrooms, the antiseptic effect is spread along the intestine."
**CONTEXT:** Question about replacing dietary fat with sugar-derived fat.

**RAY PEAT:** "It depends on whether it’s for eliminating small intestine bacteria that cause symptoms, or for treating cancer, etc. I have started with 100 mg twice a day and had immediate results, but for intense acute symptoms I would use twice as much."
**CONTEXT:** Question about tetracycline dosage and frequency.

**RAY PEAT:** "Individuals vary in the amount of each that they need. During northern winters, most people benefit from a supplement of vitamin D. Because of manufacturing impurities, any supplement can be irritating to the digestive system, but usually taking it with food is o.k. When an oral supplement causes problems, the oily vitamins can be used on the skin, but the amount absorbed is usually much less. I think a blood level of 50 to 55 ng/ml is optimal. I have noticed that I tan easily rather than burning when I have supplemented vitamin D."
**CONTEXT:** Question about optimal vitamin D levels and topical supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** "If it looks bright where you spend most of your time. Stimulation of the eyes is important for hormone activation."
**CONTEXT:** Question about light exposure and testosterone production.

**RAY PEAT:** "T3 can help, but the basic cause seems to be high cortisol and adrenalin, probably other stress hormones. Keeping vitamin D in the normal range, avoiding unsaturated fats, and having some sugar such as orange juice frequently can help."
**CONTEXT:** Question about lowering reverse T3.

**RAY PEAT:** "Basements are usually moldy; if a person lives in a basement, an air filter would be important. They can be allergenic, but their toxicity has been exaggerated."
**CONTEXT:** Question about mold in basements.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, it’s a safe way to do it."
**CONTEXT:** Question about low-intensity walking to burn stored PUFA.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s important to use the natural form of vitamin E, either mixed tocopherals or d-alpha tocopherol; because of changed methods of extracting vitamin E, I think it’s generally best not to use over 50 i.u. per day, until there’s more research using the new products."
**CONTEXT:** Question about optimal vitamin E intake after a high PUFA diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although thyroid is the essential basic thing, I have known people who were able to stabilize their blood sugar quickly by using a small amount of coffee (with cream) with meals."
**CONTEXT:** Question about caffeine and poor sugar storage ability.

**RAY PEAT:** "After draining them thoroughly, I think once or twice a month is good."
**CONTEXT:** Question about eating canned, smoked oysters in sunflower oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "The smoke and oil together would make any carcinogens in the smoke be absorbed."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the limiting factors in consuming canned, smoked oysters.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are many ways they make evidence seem to disappear, but the animal evidence is clear. The apologists for carcinogens say animals are different, but animal research has been the basic evidence for much of medical practice. Exposure to electromagnetic energy other than from telephones has been increasing steadily."
**CONTEXT:** Question about microwave radiation and brain cancer rates.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s good to keep the historical information in mind, looking for what accounts for the difference—food changes can be responsible for different sensitivities as well as basal rates."
**CONTEXT:** Question about a mouse study on microwave radiation and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "There is no evidence that nuclear war would end the human species, but the precautionary principle is that we should make intelligent judgments about important issues. People like the Koch brothers have organized campaigns against the precautionary principle, and corporations (for example, asbestos, cigarettes, estrogen) and the military (atmospheric bomb tests) have always insisted on perfectly clear evidence of causality before accepting restrictions. The media—medical journals, television, etc.—are in the business of supporting business. Science’s War on Medicine."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the interpretation of scientific studies and corporate influence.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pinker is possibly the worst of the ruling class apologists. Bill Gates might just be a little stupid, but this guy seems to be consciously evil."
**CONTEXT:** Question about Steven Pinker's "Enlightenment Now" and Bill Gates.

**RAY PEAT:** "A friend of mine did a study of the Matlatzincas of the Toluca area, who had a reputation for unusual strength and vigor, and who had a very mixed diet. They were put to work by the Spanish, and converted to a bean and tortilla diet, and faded away. I think the story of dying from European infections is just to avoid thinking of the extent of the genocides."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the decline of Native American populations after European contact.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1994, Donna Shalala, US Secretary of Health and HS, declared victory in the war on cancer. I pointed out that she was using absolutely fraudulent statistics, and observed that, with the aging of the baby boomers, who were just arriving at the age of high cancer incidence, by the year 2000 her phony calculations would no longer work in the war on cancer, and that some radically new method would be needed to hide the facts about the cancer trend. At the beginning of the new century, the US Bureau of Statistics changed its reporting practice, no longer publishing the annual raw death numbers, but only age standardized numbers, without publishing their reference year. Some agencies are now age standardizing mortality figures based on a reference year of 2030, i.e., fantasy."
**CONTEXT:** Question about rising cancer rates in some countries versus falling rates in others.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think Gilbert’s syndrome is just one of the many patterns that can develop with hypothyroidism. Liver enzymes usually rise in hypothyroidism before the “muscle enzymes,” but all cells tend to leak out of their contents when their energy level is low."
**CONTEXT:** Question about elevated bilirubin and Gilbert's syndrome.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s produced during the stress of darkness, by adrenergic nervous stimulation, and I think one of its functions is to neutralize serotonin, which could be an important antistress function. An amount much smaller than a milligram can bring on sleep, but I doubt the safety of larger amounts. Here are some articles about its involvement in inflammation: [References provided]."
**CONTEXT:** Question about melatonin and its safety.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it might be good, for example a wire to a water pipe would be an effective ground."

**RAY PEAT:** "And possible liver toxicity."
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about potential demethylation concerns with oral lidocaine.

**RAY PEAT:** "Quinones in the presence of reductants and catalysts can become semiquinones in a cycle that produces reactive oxygen species, so I think it’s risky except for treating an existing cancer."
**CONTEXT:** Question about thymoquinone dosage and safety.

**RAY PEAT:** "Menadione, K3, more water soluble, is used with vitamin C to treat cancer, creating free radicals similar to radiation. The reductive cytoplasm of cancer cells maintains the toxic effect. The oil soluble quinones are less reactive in the body, especially when they are in an oxidizing intracellular environment, which they help to stabilize. I would be inclined to use quinones other than thymoquinone for cancer, along with activated carbonyls such as fisetin."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of vitamin K2, emodin, cascara, and pau d'arco, and thymoquinone dosage for cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "You should be able to tell quickly whether it’s benefitting you. I just heard from another person, 85, who has used supplements for many years, with hypertension, swollen legs, and typical degenerative diseases, who recently stopped all supplements, and his blood pressure returned to what it was 30 years ago, the other symptoms completely disappeared. It isn’t at all rare for people to have chronic disease cause by supplements."
**CONTEXT:** Question about vitamin B supplements.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s safe, and in some situations it seems to have good effects."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety and usefulness of molecular hydrogen therapy.

**CONTEXT:** Question about lab values indicating too much T3 in the thyroid ratio.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don’t know of any safe ink, and people’s reactions vary; the body can begin to react long after it was done."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of tattoo ink.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes."
**CONTEXT:** Question about adjusting thyroid dosage more drastically after adrenaline levels normalize.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of it breaks down to form NO; it isn’t the most harmful anesthetic, but it can be slightly harmful."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the safety of nitrous oxide inhalation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Progesterone and cortisol both prevent leakiness of capillaries and are antiinflammatory, though they are antagonists in other situations. They both stabilize mast cells, decreasing histamine and serotonin, and inhibit phospholipase and prostaglandin formation and release of various inflammatory cytokines, and protect the glycocalyx."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the anti-inflammatory mechanism of cortisol and its similarity to progesterone.

**RAY PEAT:** "Tumors have multiple causes, so I think it’s best to use things that are known to be protective against known causes. I think cancers are continually produced and maintained by general metabolic conditions, and if those are ignored while trying to kill all of the abnormal cells, those cells release signals to recruit replacement cells, which, encountering the same or worse metabolic conditions, renew the tumor. Known causes involve inflammatory, excitatory processes, and when those are eliminated, tumors tend to disintegrate, undergoing “apoptosis,” a form of cell death that doesn’t create new inflammation. Here are some articles describing the effects of some of these antiinflammatory, antiexcitatory, substances— aspirin, caffeine, tetracylines, antihistamine/antiserotonin/anti-nitric oxide agents, progesterone, pregnenolone, antagonists of excitotoxicity, estrogen antagonists, vitamins D, E, and K, etc. Vitamin E (500 mg mixed tocopherols) and aspirin are things that the medical authorities might not object to."
**CONTEXT:** Question about treating stage 4 incurable brain cancer (GBM).

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it’s risky to supplement hormonally active intermediates in steroid metabolism, since it can have widespread unexpected effects."
**CONTEXT:** Question about 11-keto-DHT and other steroid intermediates.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think I might use DHT, but not androsterone or the ketos."
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about androsterone and DHT supplementation.

**RAY PEAT:** "The immediate feeling is so good that people usually overdose, risking long term imbalance in metabolism."
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about androsterone and potential imbalances.

**RAY PEAT:** "In general, one milligram/day of the strong androgens is safe. 2.5 mg wouldn’t be dangerous, but the absorbed percentage can vary a lot. For a young person, 5 mg DHEA orally is a very effective amount, very old people could use 10 to 15 mg. For a year I took an average of 3000 mg of pregnenolone daily, with nothing but good effects, but when I tried different brands (that was from Syntex), even 20 mg caused intestinal inflammation symptoms. I haven’t used androsterone, but if it functions as a pheromone, as some people have said, I think that could activate the pituitary in possibly harmful ways."
**CONTEXT:** Question about safe doses of androgens and pregnenolone.

**RAY PEAT:** "It takes a larger dose on the skin than orally. Male pheromones cause a surge of estrogen in females. For example, a young woman who hadn’t menstruated in many months visited on a spring afternoon to ask my advice, and she stayed until it was getting cold so she borrowed my sweater. She returned it the next day, and said her period had started. That has been called the “male mouse effect,” a surge of estrogen that will cause a pregnant female to abort if it smells a new male, but it seems to be very strong in humans and mammals generally."
**CONTEXT:** Question about topical DHEA dosage and male pheromones.

**RAY PEAT:** "I know a couple of people who have used refined coconut oil in their eyes, as a solvent for other things, and they say it isn’t especially uncomfortable, but for some people, any oil in the eye can be painful. I think an emulsifier, even egg yolk, would have an effect similar to soap in the eye."
**CONTEXT:** Question about preparing ophthalmic solutions with coconut oil and T3.

**RAY PEAT:** "I’ve accidentally got some in my eye when I was putting it on for sunburn, and it was very uncomfortable."
**CONTEXT:** Question about tocopherols as eye irritants.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think fibrous foods and milk are the most protective things, along with good thyroid function, and avoiding polyunsaturated fats."
**CONTEXT:** Question about preventing bowel cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "They are very good nutritionally, if they don’t cause any problems of intestinal inflammation (even cooked peppers and tomatoes cause problems for lots of people)."
**CONTEXT:** Question about overcooked vegetables.

**RAY PEAT:** "Green leaves used in salads very commonly support bacterial overgrowth; seeds, nuts, and grains, and some starchy vegetables, especially when they aren’t cooked until they soften."
**CONTEXT:** Question about vegetables that cause inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think the total effect of each food has to be considered. Polyamines are needed for renewal and regeneration, but I don’t think it’s safe to supplement them."
**CONTEXT:** Question about spermidine and its role in health and cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it’s plausible as an antiinflammatory supplement. I think any produced by bacteria might be beneficial too."
**CONTEXT:** Question about hydrogen gas therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** "Impurities would be my concern with the tablets."
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about hydrogen-producing tablets.

**RAY PEAT:** "Inflammation in the intestine can raise systemic or regional histamine and serotonin enough to cause prostate swelling. Avoiding starchy vegetables, might help; supplementing vitamin D and thyroid can reduce inflammation. An antihistamine (diphenhydramine or cyproheptadine) and aspirin can reduce prostate swelling, and might help the intestine too."
**CONTEXT:** Question about reducing prostate swelling.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pregnenolone has its own effects distinct from DHEA’s; I think it’s important to find a well refined pregnenolone."
**CONTEXT:** Question about DHEA versus pregnenolone for thyroid function.

**RAY PEAT:** "Does the certificate of analysis show where it’s made?"
**CONTEXT:** Follow-up question about pregnenolone sourcing.

**RAY PEAT:** "It’s pretty standard soap stuff, isn’t likely to be harmful."
**CONTEXT:** Question about shaving products containing soap.

**RAY PEAT:** "Hundreds of years."
**CONTEXT:** Question about the shelf life of steroids in the freezer.

**RAY PEAT:** "I don’t know that anyone has ever worked out the details of a Lingian approach to the effect of potassium on aldosterone, but now I’ll start thinking about it."
**CONTEXT:** Question about potassium, aldosterone, and mineral balance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pulse rate, combined with temperature, helps, and the temperature of the fingers and toes is very useful. A person can learn to interpret feelings of anxiety or depression, but it’s good to have something objective. The Achilles reflex relaxation rate is good, if you have someone to thump, and don’t follow the advice of internet doctors."
**CONTEXT:** Question about using anxiety or depression as indicators for thyroid dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think so."

**RAY PEAT:** I think the ratio of sugar to caffeine in coke is right, for most people. Most of the beliefs about tryptophan, serotonin, and sugar are wrong. Free fatty acids bind to albumin more strongly than tryptophan, and so make it available to the brain. Sugar generally inhibits lipolysis, so it would decrease brain tryptophan and serotonin. I think that accounts for some of sugar’s anti-stress effect.

**RAY PEAT:** Br J Pharmacol. 2005 Feb; 144(4): 528–537. Malonate induces cell death via mitochondrial potential collapse and delayed swelling through an ROS-dependent pathway. Francisco J Fernandez-Gomez,1 Maria F Galindo,1 Maria Gómez-Lázaro,1 Victor J Yuste,2 Joan X Comella,2 Norberto Aguirre,3 and Joaquín Jordán1,4,* Abstract Herein we study the effects of the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor malonate on its primary target, the mitochondrion. Malonate induces mitochondrial potential collapse, mitochondrial swelling, cytochrome c (Cyt c) release and depletes glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme (NAD(P)H) stores in brain-isolated mitochondria. Although, mitochondrial potential collapse was almost immediate after malonate addition, mitochondrial swelling was not evident before 15 min of drug presence. This latter effect was blocked by cyclosporin A (CSA), Ruthenium Red (RR), magnesium, catalase, GSH and vitamin E. Malonate added to SH-SY5Y cell cultures produced a marked loss of cell viability together with the release of Cyt c and depletion of GSH and NAD(P)H concentrations. All these effects were not apparent in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing Bcl-xL. When GSH concentrations were lowered with buthionine sulphoximine, cytoprotection afforded by Bcl-xL overexpression was not evident anymore. Taken together, all these data suggest that malonate causes a rapid mitochondrial potential collapse and reactive oxygen species production that overwhelms mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and leads to mitochondrial swelling. Further permeability transition pore opening and the subsequent release of proapoptotic factors such as Cyt c could therefore be, at least in part, responsible for malonate-induced toxicity. Introduction Mitochondria are involved in a number of important cellular functions, including essential pathways of intermediate metabolism, amino-acid biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation and steroid metabolism. Of key importance is the role of mitochondria in oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis. Thus, mitochondria are considered the headquarters in apoptosis pathways (for a review, see Susin et al., 1998; Kroemer & Reed, 2000; Jordan et al., 2003). Many apoptotic stimuli cause either functional or morphological mitochondrial alterations such as collapse of the transmembranal potential or swelling. Hallmarks of these mitochondrial alterations are increased free radical production and release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria to the cytosol through the permeability transition pore (PTP) (Kroemer & Reed, 2000; Vila & Przedborski, 2003). The Bcl-2 family of proteins, which is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis by modulating PTP aperture, comprises members that have either antiapoptotic (such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) or proapoptotic (such as Bax and Bak) effects (Brenner et al., 2000; Gross, 2001). In this sense, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression has been shown to confer protection to cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli including staurosporine (Yuste et al., 2002), 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (Galindo et al., 2004), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyride (MPTP) (Yang et al., 1998) or 3-nitorpropionic acid (3-NP) (Bogdanov et al., 1999). There is substantial evidence indicating that oxidative stress plays a role in the progression of a constellation of neurological disorders. Mitochondria have been proposed to be the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal cells. Cells contain antioxidant systems to block ROS overproduction, including glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme (NADH/NAD+) and its derivatives (NADPH/NADP+) (NAD(P)H), which play a crucial role as part of the primary cellular defence against oxidative stress. It has been shown that GSH levels in the cerebrospinal fluid decline during aging (Cudkowicz et al., 1999). The involvement of GSH in the control of cell death in neurodegenerative diseases is striking and it has been suggested that GSH depletion might be an upstream biochemical event in neurodegeneration (Dexter et al., 1989a, 1989b). We and others have also observed a GSH depletion after different apoptotic stimuli including 6-OHDA (Galindo et al., 2004), veratridine (Jordan et al., 2002), MPTP (Selley, 1998) or malonate (Ehrhart & Zeevalk, 2003). On the other hand, it is clear that impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism is the key pathogenic factor in a number of neurodegenerative disorders (see review by Schon & Manfredi, 2003). Accordingly, toxins that affect mitochondria are being used as pharmacological tools to mimic several of these diseases. Among others, 3-NP, MPTP, rotenone and malonate are well-established mitochondrial complex inhibitors frequently used to investigate the key cellular pathways that provoke neurodegeneration in Parkinson's or Huntington's diseases (Browne & Beal, 2002). Malonate has been shown to cause dose-dependent neurotoxicity both ‘in vivo' and ‘in vitro' by inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase and depletion of striatal ATP (Beal et al., 1993; Greene & Greenamyre, 1995; Stokes et al., 2001, Van Westerlaak et al., 2001) resulting in neuronal depolarization and secondary excitotoxicity (Henshaw et al., 1994; Greene & Greenamyre, 1996). In a recent study by Schulz et al. (1998), it was suggested that malonate toxicity involves neurons dying not only by secondary excitotoxicity but also by delayed caspase activation and apoptosis (Schulz et al., 1998). Thus, the exact mechanism by which malonate induces toxicity remains unclear. The aim of this study was to analyse the role played by mitochondria in the mechanisms underlying malonate-induced cell death. We used isolated mitochondrial preparations to study the effect of malonate on this organelle. We present evidence showing that malonate induces mitochondrial potential collapse and depletion of mitochondrial antioxidant defence which leads to mitochondrial swelling and release of proapoptotic proteins including Cyt c. The role of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL in these processes is also addressed.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the lack of CO2 increases lactate; too little vitamin D and/or calcium in the diet increased parathyroid hormone, increasing lactate and intracellular calcium.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the difference between cells accumulating too much calcium leading to excitotoxicity and cells where calcium remains outside, and why cells might accumulate excess calcium. They also mention CO2 expelling excess calcium and ask if a lack of CO2 contributes.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Histamine activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is involved in nausea. Pure diphenhydramine is better than Benadryl. Cyproheptadine is another antihistamine. Histamine supports wakefulness, and too little lowers alertness.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the safety and mechanism of diphenhydramine for motion sickness and daily histamine control.

---

**RAY PEAT:** My experience has been that cyproheptadine had a reparative effect, so that after a few days using a milligram, a half or fourth worked as well, and then I didn’t need it again for a long time.

**CONTEXT:** Following up on the previous question, a user asks if cyproheptadine is safer than diphenhydramine and if minimal doses are safe long-term.

---

**RAY PEAT:** No.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking if histamine acts as a protective mechanism against high levels of serotonin, referencing a study in mice where LPS injection lowered brain serotonin and increased histamine.

**RAY PEAT:** “Live blood analysis” isn’t based on science.

**CONTEXT:** A user describes a live blood analysis showing parasites and clumped red blood cells, contrasting it with their girlfriend's results. They believe pathogenic activity is behind their problems and are asking for Ray Peat's opinion on the results and how to improve the body's ability to deal with pathogens.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The liver enzymes, ALT and AST, are good indicators of continuing liver damage. Also, serum vitamin D and TSH are important.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking for recommended blood work to assess liver health and iron overload, and for markers that reveal a higher pathogenic/toxic/bacterial load or infectious problems.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I don’t think any of the “markers” is very reliable; restriction of iron in the diet is safe and protective.

**CONTEXT:** Following up on the previous question, a user asks for other important markers for iron overload and how to interpret them to identify tissue accumulation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think the only storage of an event is in the interpretation (made by the whole organism), and so a slight insight is enough to break the pattern.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the most important thing to do to break out of a cycle of "learned helplessness" and inescapable stress, believing the memory is stored in cells.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Sardines in olive oil are safe enough to have about that often; palm oil has a lot of PUFA, probably isn’t so safe.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the safety of consuming potato chips in palm oil and sardines in olive oil 2-3 times a month.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Good nutrition and thyroid function will help to normalize your vitamin D.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking what they should avoid supplementing or eating if their Vitamin D is low and supplementation isn't helping, and if thyroid or other hormones/vitamins should be put aside until Vitamin D levels improve.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about Ray Peat's view on iodide for atherosclerosis, referencing his statement about publications showing disappearance of arteriosclerosis with iodide treatment and inquiring about dosages and the effect of thyroid hormone.

---

**RAY PEAT:** “Live blood analysis” isn’t based on science.

**CONTEXT:** A user describes a live blood analysis showing parasites and clumped red blood cells, contrasting it with their girlfriend's results. They believe pathogenic activity is behind their problems and are asking for Ray Peat's opinion on the results and how to improve the body's ability to deal with pathogens.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The liver enzymes, ALT and AST, are good indicators of continuing liver damage. Also, serum vitamin D and TSH are important.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking for recommended blood work to assess liver health and iron overload, and for markers that reveal a higher pathogenic/toxic/bacterial load or infectious problems.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I don’t think any of the “markers” is very reliable; restriction of iron in the diet is safe and protective.

**CONTEXT:** Following up on the previous question, a user asks for other important markers for iron overload and how to interpret them to identify tissue accumulation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think the only storage of an event is in the interpretation (made by the whole organism), and so a slight insight is enough to break the pattern.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the most important thing to do to break out of a cycle of "learned helplessness" and inescapable stress, believing the memory is stored in cells.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Sardines in olive oil are safe enough to have about that often; palm oil has a lot of PUFA, probably isn’t so safe.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the safety of consuming potato chips in palm oil and sardines in olive oil 2-3 times a month.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Good nutrition and thyroid function will help to normalize your vitamin D.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking what they should avoid supplementing or eating if their Vitamin D is low and supplementation isn't helping, and if thyroid or other hormones/vitamins should be put aside until Vitamin D levels improve.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I don’t think it would be possible to identify any continuing effects from the particular vaccine.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking how much their Hepatitis B vaccine might be responsible for their declining health and what can be done to restore equilibrium.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The bigger the better.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking for recommendations on plants that emit higher CO2 in a home, referencing Ray Peat's statement about plants emitting CO2 at night being helpful.

---

**RAY PEAT:** It depends on your body temperature. If it is 36 C before, it’s o.k. to increase it to 37.5, keeping your blood sugar up.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the usefulness of saunas for detoxification and lowering PUFAs/iron, inquiring about duration and optimal temperatures, and mentioning loading up on glucose and minerals before and after.

---

**RAY PEAT:** It would be o.k.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the method of preparing tea, specifically cooking green leafy vegetables, straining the water, adding a tea bag and honey, and then adding milk.

---

**RAY PEAT:** As far as I know, low LDH is usually good.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking if a low LDH level on a blood test means lactic acid is low and if there are side effects of low LDH.

---

**RAY PEAT:** They have a high fat content that could antagonize thyroid function. Supplementing thyroid would be safer and more reliable.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about using fish heads from European sprat for thyroid support, inquiring if it's a good fish and if 250g would be enough for a thyroid effect.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Trace minerals (e.g., having sea food once a week) and coffee have helped to improve the sense of smell in some studies.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about new research on losing the sense of smell and taste due to COVID-19, as they have experienced a 100% loss.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Usually, a sudden multiplication of moles is a sign of hypothyroidism.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the cause of sudden bursts of black moles on their face, which started after high doses of Vitamin D, alongside mast cell activation, high histamine, and calcemia.

---

**RAY PEAT:** You can find the research under “linear energy transfer,” high energy radiation, cosmic rays, etc. It’s well known basic science, but medical people rarely understand it.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking for studies supporting the idea that higher altitude or airplane radiation is less dangerous due to lower penetration, referencing a Russian researcher.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, the lack of CO2 increases lactate; too little vitamin D and/or calcium in the diet increased parathyroid hormone, increasing lactate and intracellular calcium.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the difference between cells accumulating too much calcium leading to excitotoxicity and cells where calcium remains outside, and why cells might accumulate excess calcium. They also mention CO2 expelling excess calcium and ask if a lack of CO2 contributes.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Histamine activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is involved in nausea. Pure diphenhydramine is better than Benadryl. Cyproheptadine is another antihistamine. Histamine supports wakefulness, and too little lowers alertness.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the safety and mechanism of diphenhydramine for motion sickness and daily histamine control.

---

**RAY PEAT:** My experience has been that cyproheptadine had a reparative effect, so that after a few days using a milligram, a half or fourth worked as well, and then I didn’t need it again for a long time.

**CONTEXT:** Following up on the previous question, a user asks if cyproheptadine is safer than diphenhydramine and if minimal doses are safe long-term.

---

**RAY PEAT:** No.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking if histamine acts as a protective mechanism against high levels of serotonin, referencing a study in mice where LPS injection lowered brain serotonin and increased histamine.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Malic acid is o.k.; malonic acid is what makes unripe apples toxic.

**CONTEXT:** A user is asking about the safety of malonic acid, noting its presence in fruits and vegetables, and referencing a study on malonate promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think it’s important to have some tests, at least vitamin D, PTH, and TSH.

**CONTEXT:** A user reports developing atherosclerosis and aortic calcification after supplementing with K2 and D3, experiencing stiffening of blood vessels, chest pressure, breathing difficulties, and kidney pain. They also mention a family history of aortic calcification. They are asking for recommendations.

---

**RAY PEAT:** CO2 does help, and magnesium bicarbonate probably does too.

**CONTEXT:** Following up on the previous question, a user asks if CO2 baths and magnesium bicarbonate would be useful for their symptoms, and if aspirin is problematic due to tinnitus. They are also using progesterone.

**RAY PEAT==================================================

**RAY PEAT:** I think it might be quite a bit shorter than 440 when thyroid level is best.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about the QTc interval as an indicator of hypothyroidism and if 440 msec is a correct cutoff value.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think that’s the effect of a mild hypothyroidism, in which the morning food increases the conversion of T4 to T3. In more serious hypothyroidism, the stress hormones can rise excessively during the night, raising the waking temperature; in that situation, having carbohydrate in the morning lowers the stress hormones, allowing the temperature to fall.

**CONTEXT:** The user is reporting a waking temperature of 96.9°F that rises to 98.3°F.

---

**RAY PEAT:** T4 accumulates, building up over a period of weeks. Sunlight exposure can help to increase the metabolic rate.

**CONTEXT:** The user is taking 50 mcg of T3, plus T4.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Adapting to altitude is probably better than the bag because of electrical air ionization effects and the sunlight. Lidocaine has some antistress, antiinflammatory effects, stabilizing cells.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about sitting in a CO2 bag and feeling good in Santa Fe, mentioning lidocaine.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I’ve known a couple of people with that diagnosis who were just poorly nourished and very hypothyroid.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about a 'BPD' diagnosis.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Vitamin D deficiency, various vitamin B deficiencies, hypothyroidism, and poisoning from bad intestinal flora, especially when the diet contains starches and raw vegetables. When the problem is nutritional or toxic, increased thyroid dosing increases the stress hormones, instead of decreasing them.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about particular biological problems or deficiencies for 'BPD'.

---

**RAY PEAT:** A small amount of testosterone either in olive oil or as powder seems fully effective when swallowed; DHEA, similarly effective, but with about 3 times the dose.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about testosterone being active orally.

---

**RAY PEAT:** It’s what could happen if the proposed universal application of these experimental genetic treatments takes place. I’ve been following the biological warfare research for many years, and I think it’s plausibly deliberate. Ron Unz describes it as the “excluded third possibility.” [American Pravda: 'The Truth' and 'the Whole Truth' About the Origins of Covid-19](https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-the-truth-and-the-whole-truth-on-the-origins-of-covid-19/) If a nucleic acid code for the viral spike protein becomes integrated into our system, the expected outcome would be a chronic decline in vitality and general health, a tendency toward increased inflammation, and an accelerated rate of aging and the diseases of aging, such as circulatory disease, cancer, and rheumatic diseases.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about the long-term effects of RNA vaccines and if deaths will occur over decades, reported as increases in cancer and heart disease.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The prospect of inflation makes land in Mexico, with its low taxes, seem very desirable. If the area is very rainy, it might be possible to collect enough water (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/371867), but I would want something with a well or stream access, and water rights. The growing season is short at 7800 ft. There’s a lot of nice looking land around Zacapu, but something to investigate, if the land has a well, is what the trend in the water table has been—in Coeneo, the water level in the wells has fallen seriously in recent years.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about land near Zacapu.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Big sheets of plastic to line cisterns aren’t very expensive. I made a concrete tank, one meter deep, that’s about half above ground, that I intended as a small swimming pool, and during the rainy season we pump some of the water into the well, helping with the ground water. Plastic-lined ponds work in some areas. Friends in Coeneo had a big house built in 1900, and they used city water, but when the city’s pump failed, having thousands of gallons under the patio was convenient.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about collecting rainwater versus using a well.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think it’s safe. Limit guidelines in U.S. are from 200 uW/cm2 to 1000 uW/cm2 (2 W/m2 to 10 W/m2) for RF radiation depending on frequency. Countries developed different standards based on either *Thermal Effects *Non-Thermal Effects or *Precautionary Considerations. Conversion Chart, World Exposure Limits, Human Exposures ... https://mdsafetech.org › conversion-and-exposure-limit…

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about the safety of an RF radiation level of .0030 miliwaters / m2 compared to a reading of .0004.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I was thinking of the Mixtecos of the Oaxaca-Veracruz area. The Tarascans of Michoacan probably contributed to the conservatism there, very good at staying independent by outwitting the Spaniards.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about which Mexican subcultures are considered the most open, suggesting Michoacan but perceiving conservatism.

---

**RAY PEAT:** In small tribal villages, everyone functioned as family members, and the “extended family” function persisted longer in agricultural societies, but has disintegrated in recent times. The idea of wives and children as a man’s property blended with the doctrine of “genes,” so that ownership and inheritance of property/genes became a deep part of our culture’s ideology. I think the sense of sharing, participating in, contributing to social life is primary, and the sense of private ownership usually has harmful effects on the people involved. Have you had tests recently for TSH and cholesterol?

**CONTEXT:** The user is discussing dealing with the grief of not having children.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think Sorel cement is the best filling material, but few dentists know about it. Gold is safe in the presence of RF radiation. The zinc eugenol fillings are often used, and they can last a long time; I’ve known several dentists who were willing to use them, but they call them “temporary.”

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about dental fillings.

---

**RAY PEAT:** They are all very safe (especially the real baked ceramic used for inlays and crowns).

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking if zinc eugenol fillings are safer than ceramic or gold.

---

**RAY PEAT:** If they are very small they are probably o.k.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking if composite resin fillings are toxic.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Without progesterone it can cause a moustache to grow. Tests could show whether it’s being converted to estrogen.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking if 10 mg of DHEA is a good dose for a woman over 40 to help prevent dementia, fatigue, and obesity.

---

**RAY PEAT:** That’s the kind I use. Distillation can produce purer water, but it’s probably expensive and unnecessary.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about reverse osmosis water from supermarket stations.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think the small town is safer.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking a complex question about choosing between housing options in relation to cell tower proximity.

---

**RAY PEAT:** If it doesn’t have a shiny glaze, it’s probably not a lead problem. I use glass and a paper filter, but I’ve often thought that a perforated ceramic or glass dripper would be more convenient. I like to start with some warm water before adding hot water, to avoid breaking down aromatic things before extracting the caffeine.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about lead in ceramics from China for making coffee.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The shiny, high nickel kind can when it’s new, but nearly all the mobile nickel goes into the first ten batches.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about nickel in a stainless steel coffee maker.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I normally use glass pans, Pyrex or Vision, but sometimes use the steel pans without nickel. Although they darken a little when they age, they don’t rust. There are two main types of stainless steel, magnetic and nonmagnetic. The nonmagnetic form has a very high nickel content, and nickel is allergenic and carcinogenic. It is much more toxic than iron or aluminum. You can use a little "refrigerator magnet" to test your pans. The magnet will stick firmly to the safer type of pan. I think the nickel content should be less than 2%; the magnetic pans are hard to find (used stores sometimes have old ones), because people generally prefer the slick high nickel type.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about cookware.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Most often it was a single dose of about 100 mg. I’ve heard from women who didn’t have shrinkage with progesterone but did with prolonged high thyroid supplementation. Fluid filled capsules anywhere in the body respond to hypothyroidism by swelling, and they shrink in the presence of increased thyroid hormone. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1973 Jun 15;116(4):551-6. Preoperative hormonal therapy of cystic adnexal masses W J Spanos PIP: 286 patients between ages 16-48 with cystic adnexal masses were treated with estrogen and progesterone for 6 weeks. Persistence of the adnexal mass occurred in 81 patients and surgical exploration was done. All patients explored with an ovarian enlargement had an ovarian neoplasm causing the enlargement. There were 7 patients with normal sized ovaries but an associated paraovarian cyst or unilateral hydrosalpinx was found. No patient was subjected to surgical exploration with the finding of a physiologic cyst causing the adnexal mass. In this series, suppression of the pituitary gonadotropins for 6 weeks was long enough to cause all significant physiologic cysts to regress. It would seem that menstruating women with a cystic adnexal mass and a differential diagnosis that included a physiologic cyst should not be subjected to operations without a trial of pituitary suppressions. Also, the use of pituitary suppression with estrogen and progesterone removes indecision as to how long a physiologic cyst will remain before undergoing regression.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about a large ovarian cyst.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think the lingering effects involve changes in the brain’s metabolism of neurosteroids. Just saturating the system with the hormones has to be combined with redirection of attention, until new habits of attention and brain metabolism are formed. Ordinary authoritarian relationships, which are the norm, make everyone forget what it felt like to just be a self, before language and assigned identities existed. When relaxing after a very nice meal, pleasant feelings pass through the torso. Getting into the habit of looking for those feelings whenever you have a free moment, you can make them occur more often; they represent part of self-possession. The state of the brain models the state of those perceptions; the crucial neurosteroids that let new patterns develop are pregnenolone, progesterone, vitamin D, and (cautiously) a little DHEA; the energy-supporting high calcium diet supports their metabolism. With practice, this sense of well being and wholeness grows.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about healing emotional trauma from childhood.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Have you tried things to change your intestinal flora, such as antibiotics or bacteriophage? Have you used cyproheptadine for the anxiety? I use mostly penicillin, but erythromycin is good for preventing constipation and reducing inflammation.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking for things to try when not tolerating thyroid.

---

**RAY PEAT:** People vary greatly in sensitivity, but I find that 250 mg once a day has a strong effect on the bowel.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking for the dosage of erythromycin.

---

**RAY PEAT:** It’s commonly associated with deficiency of vitamin D and niacin. Besides watching thyroid function, blood CO2, and TSH, using acetazolamide might be helpful if tumors are identified. BMC Cancer. 2013 Aug 8;13:378. Combination of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, and sulforaphane, reduces the viability and growth of bronchial carcinoid cell lines. Mokhtari RB(1), Kumar S, Islam SS, Yazdanpanah M, Adeli K, Cutz E, Yeger H. (1)Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. [ hermie@sickkids.ca ](mailto:hermie@sickkids.ca) . BACKGROUND: Bronchial carcinoids are pulmonary neuroendocrine cell-derived tumors comprising typical (TC) and atypical (AC) malignant phenotypes. The 5-year survival rate in metastatic carcinoid, despite multiple current therapies, is 14-25%. Hence, we are testing novel therapies that can affect the proliferation and survival of bronchial carcinoids. METHODS: In vitro studies were used for the dose-response (AlamarBlue) effects of acetazolamide (AZ) and sulforaphane (SFN) on clonogenicity, serotonin-induced growth effect and serotonin content (LC-MS) on H-727 (TC) and H-720 (AC) bronchial carcinoid cell lines and their derived NOD/SCID mice subcutaneous xenografts. Tumor ultra structure was studied by electron microscopy. Invasive fraction of the tumors was determined by matrigel invasion assay. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to study the effect of treatment(s) on proliferation (Ki67, phospho histone-H3) and neuroendocrine phenotype (chromogranin-A, tryptophan hydroxylase). RESULTS: Both compounds significantly reduced cell viability and colony formation in a dose-dependent manner (0-80 μM, 48 hours and 7 days) in H-727 and H-720 cell lines. Treatment of H-727 and H-720 subcutaneous xenografts in NOD/SCID mice with the combination of AZ + SFN for two weeks demonstrated highly significant growth inhibition and reduction of 5-HT content and reduced the invasive capacity of H-727 tumor cells. In terms of the tumor ultra structure, a marked reduction in secretory vesicles correlated with the decrease in 5-HT content. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of AZ and SFN was more effective than either single agent. Since the effective doses are well within clinical range and bioavailability, our results suggest a potential new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bronchial carcinoids.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about a carcinoid tumor diagnosis.

---

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think good tests of 5-HIAA, serotonin, and platelets, while doing the corrective things, is the right approach. Have you used ciproheptadine for symptoms?

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking if imagining and scope are useful to verify carcinoid tumor presence.

---

**RAY PEAT:** The MRI technology was developed (in the 1970s, by Ray Damadian) specifically because of its ability to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue without using a contrast medium, because of the appearance of the cell water even if the shape of the tissue hasn’t changed, but since the tumors they are looking for form actual lumps, it doesn’t take any specialized MRI technique. Science. 1972 Dec 22;178(4067):1288-90. Recognition of cancer in vivo by nuclear magnetic resonance. Weisman ID, Bennett LH, Maxwell LR Sr, Woods MW, Burk D. Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance has been used to differentiate in vivo between normal mouse tail tissue and a malignant transplanted melanoma, S91, located on the tail. **The tumor displayed a nuclear (proton) spin-lattice relaxation time of approximately 0.7 second contrasted with the simultaneously measured normal tail tissue relaxation time of approximately 0.3 second.** Magn Reson Med. 1992 Mar;24(1):53-63. **Proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies on water structure in peritumoral edematous brain tissue.** Iwama T, Yamada H, Era S, Sogami M, Andoh T, Sakai N, Kato K, Kuwata K, Watari H. Department of Neurosurgery, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan. Spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) of water protons and **cross-relaxation times** (TIS) between irradiated protein and water protons were measured to study the water structure in peritumoral edematous brain tissue of rats. Despite small changes in T1, water, and electrolyte contents, TIS values of water protons were significantly reduced in peritumoral edematous brain tissue when compared to those of the controls. **Results indicate that the water structure in brain tissues may become altered at an early stage of edemic formation without causing any significant changes in cellular hydration.** TIS might serve as a sensitive parameter for studying the water structure in a variety of tissues, such as in edematous brain tissue.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about doctors wanting to use MRI with gadolinium.

---

**RAY PEAT:** For such different substances to have similar effects, I think it’s likely that they were acting on the intestinal bacteria, temporarily changing their production of toxins.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about the mechanism by which myo-inositol, metformin, and niacinamide alleviate hunger symptoms for periods of a few weeks.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Have you tried psyllium hulls or ground flaxseed? A bacteriophage, such as Florassist or Floraphage sometimes changes the intestinal flora helpfully. Two antiseptic bacteria are sometimes available in a supplement to improve intestinal ecology: Bacillus subtilis and Bacillis licheniformia.

**CONTEXT:** The user is following up on a question about intestinal bacteria.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I don’t know of any research on that.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking if it's important to combine myo-inositol with d-chiro-inositol for PCOS.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I get mine from a welder’s shop, and the valve on the tank works for filling a big plastic bag, but because the tanks are heavy, it’s convenient to use a hose for filling a tub. My tank’s valve is like a water faucet, and a simple rubber hose screws onto it, it doesn’t need a pressure gauge or anything fancy. A lighted candle is good for telling when the tank is full enough, it goes out when the CO2 reaches the flame. The flow should be fairly slow so that it doesn’t create turbulence that blows the gas out of the tank.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about CO2 from a welder's shop for immersion therapy.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Eugene used to be the least conservative town, with a history of wobblies, socialists, and communes. Ashland has had a slightly progressive aspect, but generally southern Oregon was dominated first by the early immigrants, then the immigrants from the southern US states in the depression, and more recently by the creepy right-wingers who didn't go to Idaho. California is horribly expensive, crowded, and just generally awful, with fumes from crop dusting and millions of cars.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking why Eugene is mentioned.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Addison’s disease should be immediately recognizable by any medical student; prescribing thyroxine for Addison’s disease is the sort of thing they call medical mistakes, and try not to admit to in court. Active thyroid hormone is needed for the adrenals to use cholesterol to make the hormones, and nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamin A, can limit the ability to produce the steroids. Selenium is needed for local conversion of T4 to T3. Supplementing T4 will reliably increase T3 in healthy people, but not in sick people.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking why thyroxine precipitates adrenal crises and if the same would happen with T3.

---

**RAY PEAT:** If it’s integrated with meals it’s safe.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about the significance of caffeine inhibiting human acetylcholinesterase and if Ray Peat knows of anyone with problems indicating elevated acetylcholine from coffee or caffeine.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Pre-ground coffee is good, but freshly ground beans have a little more flavor. Products with silicon dioxide should be avoided.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about silicon dioxide in caffeine tablets and whether Ray Peat consumes coffee from whole beans or pre-ground coffee.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Hydrogenated coconut oil doesn’t contain any PUFA; I have used larger amounts of that, with no visible effects.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking if exceeding 30% dietary fat, even with only saturated fats and no PUFA, causes metabolic problems.

---

**RAY PEAT:** That was to point out how bad science is predominant in some areas.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking what about the mountains is catabolic.

---

**RAY PEAT:** I think it would help with your symptoms and hormone regulation if you raise the vitamin D to 50 or 60 ng/ml. If you take the glandular thyroid in one dose, it’s best around bedtime. Have you kept a record of its effects on your pulse rate and temperature, especially before getting up in the morning? By powdering the Cynomel, and dividing each tablet into about 20 pieces, each dose will be just enough to be able to sense an effect, starting within seconds, and then fading away in the next few hours. By checking your pulse rate, you’ll be able to correlate the dose with changes in the fatigue and weakness. If you space the doses by 3 or more hours, after several days you should be able to see some slight but consistent changes in your pulse rate, and when you do, whether it’s slower or faster, wait for it to be steady at that rate for a few days before deciding to increase the dose. T3 and vitamin D work closely together, and help to keep calcium out of soft tissues; that lets them store up more energy, while reducing inflammation and anxiety.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about T3 intolerance.

---

**RAY PEAT:** Has your vitamin D been tested? It can alleviate a GH deficiency. It should be around 50 ng/ml, or 125 nmol/l. Endocrine Abstracts (2016) 41 EP908 Vitamin D status of adults with growth hormone deficiency Ivayla Uzunova1, Georgi Kirilov1, Sabina Zacharieva1 & Krassimir Kalinov2 Introduction: Vitamin D and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis are reported to interplay at both endocrine and paracrine levels, with a positive correlation between IGF-1 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in healthy subjects. Hyposomatotropism is among the conditions predisposing to lower vitamin D status due to several direct and indirect mechanisms. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate vitamin D status in a representative sample of adults with GH deficiency (GHD) and to investigate the association between serum 25(OH)D and age, gender and onset of hyposomatotropism. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 129 adults (aged 42.1±16.6 years, 70 males) diagnosed with GHD (41.9% with childhood-onset GHD (COGHD)) in the Clinical Centre of Endocrinology in Sofia, Bulgaria. Total serum 25(OH)D was the vitamin D metabolite used to assess vitamin D status and was measured by electro-chemiluminescence binding assay. Vitamin D status and GHD were defined according to the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline recommendations. Results: Major part of the patients was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency (79.1%, n=102) and another 14.7% (n=19) had vitamin D insufficiency. 25(OH)D levels >30 ng/ml were found in only 6.2% (n=8) of the subjects. Mean 25(OH)D levels (15.1±7.6 ng/ml) did not differ between men and women (15.7±7.2 vs.14.5±8.1 ng/ml, P=0.387) and correlated negatively and weakly with age (r=−0.256; P=0.003). In the AOGHD subgroup, however, mean serum 25(OH)D was significantly lower compared with COGHD participants (14.0±7.2 vs.16.8±8.0 ng/ml, P=0.039). Conclusion: Data from our study demonstrated considerably high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in GHD adults, with lower 25(OH)D concentrations among the subgroup with AOGHD. Therefore, 25(OH)D testing is highly recommended in patients with hyposomatotropism. Normalization of vitamin D status might have beneficial effects in GHD subjects, especially considering the additive effects of vitamin D and GH replacement.

**RAY PEAT:** Both of those articles are mostly about medical ineptness, more concerned with words than with a particular person’s problem. There are many ways to reduce cortisol, and they can be combined. Saliva tests could conveniently show the immediate effects on cortisol of a particular dose of aspirin or cyproheptadine or progesterone, etc., making it possible to adjust the dose. Bromocriptine and cabergoline are also often used for treating Cushing’s.

**RAY PEAT:** Cyclic progesterone is safe, but the need for it decreases as thyroid function increases. A couple of people have found that they could increase their tolerance for thyroid by starting with a transdermal solution, very diluted in water--e.g., ten mcg in three ounces of water, starting with a drop of solution on the hand. It was an allergist who discovered that, from his experience with desensitizing doses. If your cortisol is steadily extremely low, then taking some with each bit of thyroid would be appropriate, since it takes effect immediately. Prolonged use, combined with low thyroid function, wouldn't be good. Have you used the progesterone on a monthly cycle? Was the estrogen measured when you were using progesterone? Has your cortisol been measured? The slightly high DHEAS suggests that your adrenals are being slightly over-stimulated. Do you eat shellfish regularly? A copper deficiency can cause microcytosis; excess zinc, molybdenum, and sulfur can contribute to a copper deficiency. Increasing thyroid helps with copper assimilation and hemoglobin production, and would lower your cholesterol. Normalizing your vitamin D might help to increase the hemoglobin.

**RAY PEAT:** Too much iodine interferes with thyroid function, and that slows down the liver, letting T4 accumulate. The high TSH shows that your T4 isn’t high now, and selenium and progesterone will help to restore functions. Cynomel is the product with the least iodine, and it would be good to periodically test doses of about one microgram (starting by dissolving a tablet in an ounce or two of water, and testing the water starting with just a drop or two per day).

**RAY PEAT:** Yes, more than 20 years ago, I pointed out the amount of heavy metal contamination, and the frequent reactions I had seen, to Pauling, and he just said I should use Bronson's C, as if that would have been made with anything except Hoffman-LaRoche's stuff. (It was Pauling's own description of the manufacturing process for sulfuric acid, using a "lead room," that got me thinking about the dangers of things manufactured with it.) I guess ADM is making a large fraction of ascorbic acid now, so I wouldn't be surprised if some of it was worse than when the heavy metal studies were published several years ago. The alteration of production processes in vitamin E manufacture when the evil soybean monopoly bought the industry from Eastman Chemical is analogous to what happened earlier in the vitamin C industry, as profits were maximized. The dramatic vitamin C studies in the 1930s often used only 15 or 25 milligrams per day. In 1953, my first experience with it (which was still sold as "cevitamic acid") involved 50 mg per day, and over a period of just 2 or 3 days, my chronic awful poison oak allergy disappeared. Up until this time, it was still too expensive to sell in large doses. Around 1955 or '56, new manufacturing methods made it cheap (and, for some reason, the name changed from cevitamic to ascorbic) and the average tablet went up to 500 mg. The first time I tried the new form, around 1956, I developed allergy symptoms within a couple of days. Over the next 20 years, my own increased sensitivity to synthetic ascorbate led me to look for such reactions in others. The same people who reacted to it often reacted similarly to riboflavin and rutin, which were also made from cornstarch by oxidation. I ascribed the reaction to some industrial contaminant that they had in common, possibly the heavy metals introduced with the sulfuric acid. The heavy metal contamination of synthetic ascorbate is so great that one 500 mg tablet dissolved in a liter of water produces free radicals at a rate that would require a killing dose of x-rays to equal. The only clean and safe vitamin C now available is that in fresh fruits, meats, etc. The commercial stuff is seriously dangerous.

**RAY PEAT:** 5000 feet is helpful, higher is better. The low latitudes from Bolivia to Mexico have many comfortable little cities at good altitude. I have usually preferred places between 2000 and 2600 meters. Since the days warm up quickly at high altitude, the old houses were designed to retain the heat during the cold nights, by having thick adobe walls, about a meter thick. If you are eating enough protein, about 100 grams, and salt and thyroid, then I would consider the steroids--something might be interfering with your production of pregnenolone and DHEA. Things that could do that would be very low cholesterol, or a deficiency of vitamin A (retinol), or possibly other deficiencies. If your cholesterol is above 200, and the thyroid supplements didn't warm you up, it's possible that something is interfering with your steroid synthesis, which might be a deficiency of something like vitamin A, or interference from something like iron or carotene. Have you tried a supplement of pregnenolone or DHEA? Were any other hormones, such as prolactin, measured? If you are taking the aspirin regularly, you should make sure to get vitamin K, from kale, liver, or a supplement. Anemia, like cold feet, is a common sign of low thyroid function.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about humidity in Colorado and the benefits of higher altitude. They also mention their coffee preparation method.

**RAY PEAT:** Both pregnenolone and progesterone are safe in large amounts (except that progesterone can be anesthetic if hundreds of milligrams are taken at once), and help with nerve repair and restoration. Vitamin K (Thorne Research drops, 10 mg/day) and aspirin help to normalize brain metabolism. Symptoms are partly from a poor balance of dopamine and serotonin, and cyproheptadine could help by reducing the serotonin dominance. Bright incandescent bulbs, especially the clear front reflector bulbs that are used for heating, sold at farm and hardware stores, have the red-orange wavelengths that are beneficial; they can shine on the head (all sides) and neck, the red light penetrates very well. They can be used all day if you like, as long as they don't cause over-heating. Those people were given a brief trial of pregnenolone by relatives, and weren't responsible for taking it themselves; they weren't in situations that would have supported the necessary changes, I think people with that diagnosis are just too hard to deal with. It's pretty standard to give thyroid to kids, Barnes was more perceptive than most doctors, and knew what to look for. I made some devices for exposing the legs or abdomen to about 100 red LEDs for use during the night, to avoid the annoying effect on the eyes. They were too bothersome to use regularly. 12 to 15 hours/day exposure to bright daylight or good incandescent light is enough therapeutically. The main issue currently with pregnenolone is the presence of trace allergenic impurities. I ate an average of about 3000 mg/day for a year, then to economize, reduced it to about 500 mg for a few years, then the factory I was getting it from closed, and I was allergic to other brands. I don't recall describing relapses. Does that institute have the video on their website? I spoke to the Smart Life Forum, which later changed its name. Since even a moderate amount of progesterone can shrink the penis, young men typically use it only for seizures. I've had a couple of friends who were classically manic-depressive. I watched the woman go through several of her annual cycles, a few weeks of suicidal depression, and a few of really psychotic mania, and saw that I could see them coming a few weeks in advance, with changes in her sleep cycle and temperature cycle. When the mania was coming on, her waking temperature would be higher than usual, and then by 10 or 11 a.m. it would be much lower. I knew that was the pattern of high nocturnal cortisol, from hypothyroidism. Her cycles had been getting worse for 20 years, but when she used thyroid to normalize her temperature cycle, there were no more psychotic cycles, and there hasn't been a recurrence in over 20 years. I've known a few schizophrenics who began acting more normally immediately after taking pregnenolone or progesterone, but who relapsed when they stopped taking it; I think it would be necessary to change their diet and keep them supplemented with those, and thyroid, for a few weeks, to allow their nervous systems to repair themselves.

**RAY PEAT:** Yandell Henderson died in 1944, and V.I. Vernadsky died in 1945. With the accession of Truman to the US presidency, cultural and scientific progress has been operating in reverse. Here and there bits of knowledge have been created, but they drift in the sewage tsunami of Big Science. My article on cascara talked about the analogous effects of carbon dioxide, vitamin K, emodin, and the tetracyclines. Some of the experiments with Buckyballs show similar effects of a large resonant system, an electron-withdrawing effect that lowers inappropriate excitation and inflammation. A direct current flow through the body towards the oxidizing brain can be intensified or dulled by an external field. For rats, the alternative to an enriched environment has been living in a rat box, sort of the equivalent of a Tokyo apartment. Gardening, learning to play a musical instrument, sculpting and drawing, are good; practicing the martial arts, going to new places and taking different routes to old places, listening to an unfamiliar language--anything that involves participation and action or learning. Finding novelty and opportunity in a large context, rather than habitual, ritualized, or trivial activity. Stimulating conversation and spontaneous sex are good examples. Our (industrialized corporate) cultures are designed to exclude meaningful activity as far as possible. Music, theater, literature, research, adapting to a new culture, and political innovation are activities that can be meaningful. The brain is always organizing itself, and although some of the DC, AC, and magnetic stimulation effects are positive, I think they are also likely to have other harmful effects. Any stimulating radiation is a potentially disorganizing influence (red light has an antiexcitatory effect). I think supporting the brain's own organizing processes is the right approach to therapy. Neurosteroids stabilize nerves, and allow repair processes to proceed. Good nutrition, light, thyroid, etc., provide the energy. Meaningful activity is the other necessity. The southeastern states are remarkably unhealthy. In general the high altitude of Colorado and New Mexico is very good for health, but there are some areas with pollution from the military and mining, that should be investigated carefully before moving. When I'm in Bayard, NM, I feel very good, but I have never seen so many people carrying oxygen tanks anywhere else, probably former miners, but windstorms and forest fires can put a lot of bad stuff into the air.

**CONTEXT:** The user is asking about the effects of radiation and the importance of meaningful activity for brain health.

**RAY PEAT:** It's pigmentation that I've seen go away completely when people used thyroid or pregnenolone or (women) progesterone. It's usually thought to be related to allergy and adrenal deficiency. The dark around the eyes is caused by slightly leaky capillaries, and they are commonly blamed on allergies. Although glucocorticoid treatment sometimes helps, my experience has been that hypothyroidism was responsible. The dark eye circles are usually considered to be from an adrenal problem, and thyroid deficiency is one thing that can be responsible, but there are other things that could be responsible, and blood or saliva tests could give you a better idea". I've never measured it, but it's probably about half a cup of dry coffee to make two cups of liquid. I start with warm water, and end with boiling water, so the temperature of the product probably doesn't get much above 45 degrees C; it loses the red-orange color if it gets too hot.

Measurements of gravity are so imprecise, I wonder if it's really known exactly where a center of gravity is.

**RAY PEAT:** Einstein was working with the junk that had accumulated in the 19th century, and I think the main reason he treated it seriously was to show the German academicians what jerks they were.

With that, it was logical to see light as particulate.

**RAY PEAT:** Shellfish are good sources of several trace minerals, cooked greens (with the water they cook in) are good sources of molybdenum and calcium. I think the decrease of temperature after eating breakfast explains more about the stress hormones than saliva tests could.

**RAY PEAT:** I have noticed that when I'm most relaxed and at high altitude my oxygen saturation is in the range of 89% to 94%, lower with more relaxation. When I'm walking fast uphill, it is around 99% (I think that could mean that my fingers are consuming less). If my fingers are cold (i.e., not using much oxygen) the number is higher. If you pump blood through a cold corpse, the hemoglobin will stay 100% saturated." Changing bacteria can make a big difference, but I think cultural-psychological factors can cause effects like that. There have been times when I would have bad reactions to many foods in the US, and a day or two later in Mexico I would be able to eat anything. The familiar culture is full of inconspicuous signals that activate inflammatory-stress hormones, and a complete change of culture activates a different set of more adaptive hormones. I think the experimental analogy is the restraint stress syndrome in animals; if they can do something to counter the stress, they don't develop the inflammatory reactions. High thyroid activity is somewhat protective against the everyday restraint stressors." I don't think there is a functional ratio between them (A & D), independent of everything else. Calcium, phosphate, protein, vitamins and minerals are involved in preventing improper calcification.
