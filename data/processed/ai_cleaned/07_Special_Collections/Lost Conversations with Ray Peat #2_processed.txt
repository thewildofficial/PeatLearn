**RAY PEAT:** I ran across his work 1959 just after his first publication on generative grammar. I very quickly got the impression that, not that he was a Pentagon agent directly, but that he was working against life and humanity by that approach to what others were calling computable information approach to logic and language. Computable meaning that it never changes. The ideal language, that's what I was studying in '59 and '60 was the history of ideal languages. By, I think it was 1920 when Bertrand Russell realized that language just doesn't work that way, and that not only are ideal languages for communication, not only are they impossible, but the impossibility extends to philosophical logic. The computers can compute, but they always miss the subtlety of context.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks about Noam Chomsky's rationality.

**RAY PEAT:** Chomsky does very good work on describing imperialism, except when he gets to the colonial Israel relation to the Palestinians. He doesn't want to take a stand there, but everything he does on describing empire is perfectly valid, but it's at the very base of his professional linguistics doctrine where his mind is absolutely defective.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks about Chomsky's work.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, it's the idea of overlapping fields in the material world, as well as the communication logic world. Everything is changing through time, whether it's a word, or an organism, or a thing. The world around it changes, and so its relationships change. Overlapping fields are everywhere. Anything that's accurate is only a rough approximation.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if consciousness is inherently empathetic and has implicit mutual aid.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. The project of showing the manipulative quality, culture as political imposition, it's good to break that down and show how phony it is, but they break everything down including animal reality. I think you have to start and end with the experience of being an animal in the world.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if postmodernists are right in a way, given the idea of changing relationships.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. They, people like Chomsky call us vitalists, and animists, and primitive thinkers.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if his approach has a name, as he feels Ray Peat is the only one saying it.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Bertrand Russell, besides being a ruling class jerk, he was really intelligent and realized, he basically said, "Philosophy like this is impossible," and went into social thinking. Around 1920, he said, "The Leibniz idea that to define anything, you have to specify where it is in time and space, and things are always, any single thing is infinitely complex because of the way it's related to other things." He said, "If we think that way, we can't do logic."
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Ray Peat thinks Chomsky is not accounting for animal nature or inherent properties of consciousness with his ultra-logical position.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I think it's like tennis.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if it's a fool's errand to get into these style of debates or if it's a path to truth.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, existence. I think Lenin gave a very good definition of matter. He said, "Everything we know is just memory and it's not matter. Everything we know comes from matter, and so matter is everything we don't know. Matter is possibility in the future." Nothing like the so-called materialists or religionists think of matter. Matter is nothing except what we can know and become.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Ray Peat would replace God with consciousness in the idea of process theology.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. You could make good guesses in all directions, but you can't work anything out in terms of forms, like that idea of Greek forms and atoms being number.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if his simplistic thinking about matter being obscure is an admission of not knowing about consciousness and memory.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. If you have to leap, you're not there. The experience of, like Lenin said, that we have knowledge and experience, but where it comes from is always beyond what we know. It's always the future and potentiality. That means we're experiencing the nature of matter constantly. The present and the potential of our experience is what matter is. That's also the creative essence, which they call, "God," and put remotely somewhere else.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if taking the leap to a specific creator is not warranted.

**RAY PEAT:** Yep, yep.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if the idea of continual creation and things being in flux trends into William James’ radical empiricism.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. All of those topics are very important to analyze, and discuss, and break down.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if the philosophy or the CIA stuff is important to analyze.

**RAY PEAT:** No, the conspiracy stuff, yeah, that he talks about.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if the CIA culture stuff is important to analyze.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. There's a Russian guy that did really good analysis of the pictures [https://www.aulis.com/stereoparallax.htm]. Not just the direction of shadows, but multi-point of view analysis of the landscape. It's the best one I've seen. I don't remember his name, though. I have a copy somewhere.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if the analysis showing the moon landing is phony is correct.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. I think the main thing is indoctrinating the public with their unlimited power.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks why they go to such great lengths to instill a view of space and science to the public, referencing ISS videos and augmented reality.

**RAY PEAT:** I have no idea.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if they have ever left low Earth orbit.

**RAY PEAT:** Not economically. The shielding that it takes is so immense. I think the only technology would be that tower at the equator. A big elevator a hundred miles tall, skyscraper tower.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks about the possibility of getting out of the Van Allen belts unscathed.

**RAY PEAT:** No, but the calculations have shown that it would be a very economical, a dollar or two for electricity to hoist you up into orbit.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if they built something like a space elevator.

**RAY PEAT:** At that time, I considered the government to be pure, pure demons all the way through. I just didn't think that was needing any interpretation at the time. I was interested in who was about to be murdered by them.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Ray Peat thought the Apollo missions were fake.

**RAY PEAT:** At that time, that was where vote no for president originated. People were saying, "This guy is campaigning on the basis that Nixon was soft on communism, and we've got to be more militant." He had been briefed that Eisenhower was preparing to invade Cuba. He was supposed to keep that quiet, but he campaigned and said, "Eisenhower's a wimp. We gotta go after Cuba."
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks for specifics about Ray Peat's view that Kennedy was a bad person.

**RAY PEAT:** Yes. Very more pro-war than anyone had been up to that time.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Kennedy was instigating the whole mess in Cuba.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. When he got more information, he saw that it would be a very stupid thing, but still, he was letting Dulles prepare clues. Just before he died, he said, "Well, we won't do it right away, but be ready to overthrow Goulart in Brazil." He set that up, which happened a year or two after he died. It was a lance for progress and Peace Corps were purely integrated into imperialism.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Allen Dulles was instigating the Cuba situation and Kennedy didn't want to go into Cuba.

**RAY PEAT:** No. In 1968 and '69, I was teaching a whole bunch of free university courses in Eugene. One of them was on, I think in the fall of '69, it was something to do with the CIA's actions. People, maybe 20 people came. We talked for an hour and a half or so. Most of the people left. One guy in his 20s hung back, and after everyone had left, he ... I think his phrase was, "Do you have a number?" I said, "What do you mean?" He made gestures and meant did I have any marijuana? He was trying to be friendly and I didn't understand him, but anyway. He explained that he was interested in thinking that because I was a graduate student in biology and talking about the CIA that I would be a person for him to talk to.
He said he had just quit his job at Fort Detrick, because he was so horrified by what they were doing. I think it was, maybe it was the winter term of '69, but at that time, the, what do you call it? The human complex, their initials for it referred to the category on white blood cells. Anyway, the human antigen complex specifies what tissues can be transplanted easily. That wasn't in our journals, in the public journals and in the graduate school courses that I was aware of. That hadn't been invented yet. He was talking about this racial differences in immune complexes on the surfaces of cells that made racially specific viruses possible. He said, "That's their main project is to create a virus that will destroy the population of Africa, as well as most American blacks."
Since none of that stuff was known in conventional biology, I thought it didn't seem like a big threat. It was so hypothetical that there would be racial differences that viruses could recognize and kill, but anyway. We talked for a couple of hours. I guess he wasn't satisfied that he had made me aware of the evil things that were happening at Fort Detrick. But what he was doing obviously was what could get him killed. If I had believed him, it could have been worse for him. Never saw him again.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Fort Detrick and MKNAOMI, mentioning Robert Gallo, were what Ray Peat was referring to regarding biological warfare atrocities.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Two different people analyzed the, after the HIV virus was identified, two different virologists identified the components as the visna. V-I-S-N-A. Maedi-visna virus. A well established, so-called slow virus combined with another virus. It showed that it had been engineered genetically from existing viruses.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions a video claiming Robert Gallo created HIV by combining viruses.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. The different, hepatitis B and C are probably endogenous in a large part of people. At least the antigens that they are studying for HIV have, when they looked back at the inducted military blood tests that were frozen going back to about 1960, I think they had representative blood samples of draftees. Over the decades, there was, I think it was my first, what I heard first was .5% are positive. When I mentioned that to Peter Duesberg, he said, "No, .4% positive," I think is what he said. But anyway, the military information showed that there was an endemic, stable percentage of the population that showed that particular antigen.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if a person can express HIV retrovirus under extreme stress, or if he is thinking about hepatitis.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. A great part of our genes, I think some people have said 60% or more of our genes might be retrovirus residue. A German guy has been publishing for several years showing that when we eat food, cabbage, or beef, or whatever, we assimilate and our cells take up and integrate the DNA from our food, so we're-
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if the antigen that can stay with somebody forever is part of their genes.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. That probably is part of how evolution happens, that we store up everyone else's DNA that we can get, and check it intermittently for its potential usefulness to us.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy makes a comment about "cabbage DNA."

**RAY PEAT:** Sidney Fox showed that you can create, in a lab with a hot rock and powdered free amino acids, and splash some water onto a gob of simple amino acids at a high temperature. 240 degrees or something like that. They spontaneously polymerize into proteins. The proteins spontaneously form little one micron spheres. There happen to be precursors to the nucleic acids added. The proteins in these little micro spheres, some of them act as enzymes that form changes of the nucleic acid precursors. They made nucleic acids. All of the components, Sidney Fox showed you can make in a high school chemistry lab in a couple hours.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Szent-Györgyi was right about life originating in the ocean and if Ray Peat subscribes to the typical description of evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. They're designed to trigger inflammation. We normally deal with antigens, like when we eat them, they don't cause inflammation. When you look at what's circulating in the blood, we're always having little vesicles containing nucleic acids. Some just balls of pure nucleic acid floating around in our blood. Everyone does, all the time. Some of those are coming from a cell that's under stress sending out signals to other cells that can respond and send back repair information. They've demonstrated that a stressed lung cell emits these vesicles with nucleic acids. The liver picks them up, identifies them, and sends back basically lung stem cells [crosstalk 00:29:04]-
Interacting, and renewing, and repairing. But when we eat nucleic acids, those join that stuff that's circulating in the bloodstream. They don't cause inflammation. Normally, they get apparently inserted and integrated into our DNA. That probably is a reservoir for nonrandom, when you're under stress, you blow out some of this antigenic material that shows up as having hepatitis C or B, or HIV, or whatever. But under stress, what it's doing is increasing our ability to adapt. That was what Lysenko showed way back, 1930s, and what Barbara McClintock showed in 1950 that got her very unpopular with the genetics people. Until the genetic engineers wanted to make artificial food organisms using, moving around genes. They gave the MacArthur Prize, or Nobel Prize, or both to McClintock, just to resurrect someone that they had knocked out of the science world.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if vaccines are really risky.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions reading about the cerebral cortex's susceptibility to glycogen depletion and the impact of insulin resistance or stress.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, because when your blood sugar goes down, you release into the blood free fatty acids. If those get into the brain, and the brain being very fatty, it takes up huge amounts of fat out of the blood. If you have PUFA circulating as free fatty acids, then you're constantly poisoning your brain every time your blood sugar goes down, which happens generally at night.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if stress or insulin resistance would have a devastating effect on the cerebral cortex.

**RAY PEAT:** Oh, yeah. Yeah, the blood-brain barrier really hasn't existed forever, but people are still ... The first thing I saw about fat, they injected an emulsion of soy oil into rats with a labeled, carbon label. They think, or maybe tritium, but anyway, it instantly got into their brain. They showed that 17, injecting it into the carotid artery and measuring what came out in the jugular vein and what stayed in the brain, 17% of a single injection stuck in the brain.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if a normal, mainstream person would say the blood-brain barrier protected against PUFAs.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. The cortex is, the most massive part of it is the frontal lobes. It has a temperature gradient, and has to be cool to get organized, and keep things in order. I think that's what the forehead should be bare to have that temperature gradient. Hot in the center and decreasing temperature in the cortex, but especially at the frontal cortex where planning happens.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions Pavlov and the idea of the cortex being the link between the organism and its environment, and how dullness of life dulls the brain, lowers metabolism, and causes hair loss.

**RAY PEAT:** I think that the speech center is somewhat being cleared out to have that planning function, where it's cooler than the core and rear part of the brain.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if temple hair loss in puberty is associated with the stress of high estrogen and if it's near the dorsal lateral areas of the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** No. I think there's a healthy cooling of the frontal lobes.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if it would be completely incorrect to say the parts where hair was being lost was associated with problematic or deprived regions of the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, yeah. The normal, little kids generally have very high foreheads. I think that's part of the, they grow hair on the back and sides, and then top. I think they leave the front bare so it can cool itself more easily by radiation.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if some degree of hair loss would be desirable.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Disorganizing the whole organism, because the reductase inhibitor is messing up all parts of your body. It just happens to affect hair growth, but it messes up deeper parts of the brain and other organs.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks about the effect of 5AR inhibitors like dutasteride and if regrowing hair with Propecia would be a bad thing.

**RAY PEAT:** If it's just topical, I don't think that does too much to the rest of the organism, but when they take it systemically, I think that's very dangerous.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if regrowing hair with Propecia would be a bad thing.

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that, that's how it's working.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions that castration virtually gets rid of testosterone and estrogen, and radically lowers serotonin.

**RAY PEAT:** Pseudo in what sense?
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks for Ray Peat's perspective on pseudo hermaphrodites.

**RAY PEAT:** No, I haven't paid much attention to them. In Greece, there was a group that had both organs.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy describes the phenomenon of "penis at 12" in Papua New Guinea, where individuals are raised as women until puberty.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. I think it's something interfering with the basic development early in the embryo.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if the pseudo hermaphrodite phenomenon is just a problem with development.

**RAY PEAT:** In large amounts, it is very, very slightly potentially carcinogenic to the liver, but no one has ever seen it happen. It's that it's metabolized when concentrated and given separately are carcinogenic, but giving the lidocaine, all the effects are anti-carcinogenic.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if lidocaine is safe to use every day.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if 50 to 100 milligrams of lidocaine per day is overkill.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. I for a while kept a dish, and tried to remember to take some all the time, but something happened and I forgot about it, but it's something I would mean to do if I remembered.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if lidocaine would be considered an anti-stress, anti-aging, extremely safe thing for prolonged use.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. It's water-soluble is the difference.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if lidocaine hydrochloride is safe.

**RAY PEAT:** Caffeine, progesterone, aspirin, and when I remember it, lidocaine.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Ray Peat feels he has fulfilled his search for a safe antihistamine, mentioning mushrooms and cyproheptadine.

**RAY PEAT:** I think it generally increases it.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if a progesterone and DHEA mixture should not interfere with a person's libido.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. I think it's safe up to around, depending on your age, but a 15-year-old makes maybe 15 milligrams a day of DHEA. A 90-year-old makes one or so milligrams. If you're 80, probably 15 milligrams might be safe, but I limit myself to about two milligrams still.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy discusses his experimentation with progesterone and DHEA and asks about the dosage.

**RAY PEAT:** It's very similar. You need lots of it in the 40s, generally, but that's when your accumulation of PUFA tends to start producing problems. But still, the ratio of a little more progesterone to DHEA, I think, is always good.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks about the progesterone difference between ages.

**RAY PEAT:** That was a mixture that I made for people with various problems, especially arthritis. Both men and women had the need for one or the other. I found that the progesterone wouldn't de-testeronize the man, and the DHEA wouldn't grow whiskers on the women if there was that, I think it was a three to one ratio. It worked adequately for both of them, and it was just that it was practical to mix it once and give it to both.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks where the 1:3 ratio of progesterone to DHEA came from.

**RAY PEAT:** In Mexico, do you know where you get, what they're feeding their chickens?
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if it is ever useful to eat less than one egg per day, or if that is always detrimental.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. When you know they're getting a lot of tortillas and such things with the corn extracted, so it doesn't have so much PUFA in it, those are the best. Then, I think it's better than eating liver once a week, to have one or two of those good eggs every day.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions a good market with farm-fresh eggs and asks about their quality.

**RAY PEAT:** Very similar. Uh huh.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if eggs can replace liver.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. Just very rough, but as long as you're well under four grams a day, you're pretty safe. But I just like to be as extreme as possible. You know the experiment of William Brown?
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions a post about Ray Peat aiming for 1.5 grams of PUFA per day and asks about milk, eggs, and cheese.

**RAY PEAT:** We've had it for years. We just looked up, I guess, Consumers Report or something. We have our TriField Meter. If you stand three or four feet away from it, you can't detect any field.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks what kind of microwave Ray Peat has, as he has had trouble finding one that doesn't leak.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, you probably should, do you have a ground connection on your electric circuit?
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions his RF meter registering high levels from his microwave in another room.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. If you just look inside the box and see three wires, one of them is a ground.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks how to check for a ground connection.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if a lack of a ground connection would explain the high readings.

**RAY PEAT:** Well, it depends. The new 5G thing is so high frequency. With the old wavelengths where they were a few inches, chicken wire on the wall facing the transmitters, if you put a wire down and stick a nail in the ground and attach it to the chicken wire on that side of your house, that's enough.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks for recommendations for shielding a room.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah. The grid has to be a smaller mesh if it's 5G.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if chicken wire would work with 5G.

**RAY PEAT:** No. This one is a cement block house, and I guess it has reinforcing bars in it that seem to shield it. Telephones don't work inside the house.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if Ray Peat's house is painted for shielding.

**RAY PEAT:** And-
If you can see a tower, then you should put some chicken wire between you and the tower, and any kind of a ground connection. Plumbing is a good ground. Put a little wire to your closest faucet.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy expresses that getting a meter was enlightening and stressful.

**RAY PEAT:** Yeah, that's deeply embedded in the ground.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks if he could attach a wire to the actual faucet for grounding.

**RAY PEAT:** Mm-hmm.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy confirms his understanding of attaching a wire to a faucet for grounding.

**RAY PEAT:** I think the next newsletter is just going to be on supplements and some on pollution. The various particulate things in the environment in particular. I'm getting tired of the silica titanium dioxide poisoning that everyone is getting. I'm gonna give some more propaganda against it.
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy asks what Ray Peat is currently working on.

**RAY PEAT:** Really? What did we talk about then?
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions that the supplements episode was their most popular conversation.

**RAY PEAT:** Really? What did we talk about then?
**CONTEXT:** Danny Roddy mentions that the supplements episode was their most popular conversation.
