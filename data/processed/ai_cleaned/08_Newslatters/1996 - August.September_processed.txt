**RAY PEAT:** The yams used by the steroid industry were the same as edible yams. (There are about 600 types of steroid-rich yam; a typical one looks like Bigfoot, weighs as much as 90 pounds, and is poisonous.)

**CONTEXT:** The editor notes a statement in JAMA about yams and steroids.

**RAY PEAT:** Far from saying that diosgenin is converted by the adrenals to pregnenolone and estrogen, Rao, et al., say it has not been ascertained whether it acts directly or by being metabolized. Their evidence argues against that, by “excluding any possibility of diosgenin having progesterone-like activity in mouse,” since any pregnenolone produced would be far more likely to produce progesterone-like effects than estrogenic effects. A. Lipshutz’s work made that clear.

**CONTEXT:** The editor quotes a statement from McDaniel's letter regarding diosgenin conversion in animals.

**RAY PEAT:** I don’t doubt McDaniel’s claim that the statements he makes “reflect the consensus of a research pharmacologist, biochemist, molecular biologist, gastroenterologist and gastrointestinal physiologist, as well as physicians who interpret scientific data....”

**CONTEXT:** The editor acknowledges McDaniel's claim about the consensus of his specialists.

**RAY PEAT:** Although I am not familiar with dioscoretine, and haven’t read the paper by M.M. Iwu, et al., their abstract strongly suggests that it has nothing to do with diosgenin, because their hypoglycemic substance has an LD50 in mice of 0.58 g/kg, and diosgenin isn’t likely to be that toxic. The paper by Iwu, et al., wasn’t about “reversing diabetes,” but only about the observation that dioscoretine lowered blood sugar after four hours in rabbits. Thousands of other seriously toxic substances can cause a sudden decrease in blood sugar.

**CONTEXT:** The editor discusses the paper by Iwu, et al., concerning dioscoretine and its potential hypoglycemic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** Beneytout, et al., describe the HEL cells as a human erythroleukemia cell line, which isn’t the same as McDaniel’s description of them as “stem cells,” and they compare the effect of diosgenin to that of phorbol myristate acetate treatment, and say nothing that could be construed as “a demonstration of hormonal regulatory influence at the cellular level expressed free of other sources of endocrine influence.” Phorbol myristate esters are recognized as potent co-carcinogens. Both diosgenin and PMA caused an increase in the number of cells containing 4 or more nuclei. Diosgenin, we might conclude, is as effective as PMA in promoting abnormal development in cancer cells. This would suggest that diosgenin is something to be avoided.

**CONTEXT:** The editor critiques McDaniel's interpretation of the Beneytout, et al., study on HEL cells and diosgenin.

**RAY PEAT:** Malinow, et al., studied the effects of oral diosgenin on cholesterol, but, as their title says, they were examining digitonin, a toxin from a different family of plants. Since McDaniel brought up the subject by citing this digitonin study, I should mention that one of the effects seen by other researchers, with Dioscorea-derived compounds, is chronotropic heart stimulation, suggesting a parallel to digitalis.

**CONTEXT:** The editor addresses McDaniel's reference to the Malinow, et al., study on cholesterol and diosgenin.
