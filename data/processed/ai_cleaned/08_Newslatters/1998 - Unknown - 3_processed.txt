**RAY PEAT:** The space between cells is of interest to many specialists, but it is relegated to the background in mainline medical thinking. In reality, the stuff between cells is the biggest part of a complex organism, and it contains many of the answers to questions of individuality, immunity, growth, aging, healing, sickness, and regeneration.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of the extracellular space in understanding biological processes?

**RAY PEAT:** Respiration is essential for the existence of higher organisms, making it possible to maintain complex and adaptive structures, containing appropriately differentiated cells. I want to introduce some ideas about how respiration is involved in the creation of structures both inside cells and in the spaces between cells.

**CONTEXT:** How is respiration linked to the formation of cellular and extracellular structures?

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of "containment in the cell" has directed attention away from the ways in which a cell knows what it is and where it is, and where it should be, what it should do. The material in between cells has been dismissed as little more than glue, but it is where some of our most important things happen.

**CONTEXT:** What is the prevailing, yet flawed, view of cellular function, and what is the true significance of the extracellular matrix?

**RAY PEAT:** In dead vegetable matter, "cells" were the empty spaces in the fibrous framework. Plants could be grafted or propagated from cuttings, making it clear that one type of plant tissue could generate the other types. The “essence” of plants was considered to be little more than growth, and their seeds had the disadvantage of introducing individual variation. Grafting and cloning animals didn't seem to work, and the idea grew up that the animal's essence was contained in the germ cell, while the plant's essence was in its vegetation. "Contained" in the "cell," our "essence" had only to reveal itself. A man's semen was his essence, which introduced the soul into the egg, animating it. Replacing "preformationism” with "epigenesis" simply introduced the idea of individualism, by saying that a new individual came into existence by fertilization, but it didn't end the belief that our identity was “contained” "genetically" within the cell. The neat little compartments seen in plant tissues became a sort of mental armature that no one questioned. Almost all of biology has been reduced to the idea that “the necessary information is contained within the cell, in its genes." The "Central Dogma" of molecular biology was stated as "information flows from DNA to RNA and from RNA to protein, and not the other way."

**CONTEXT:** How has the historical understanding of biological essence and cellular information flow shaped modern biology, and what is the "Central Dogma"?

**RAY PEAT:** To speak of cellular sensitivity (as Lamarck did) is to assert that information flows into cells; the fanatical opposition to Lamarck that has characterized biology in the 20th century has blended into a general hatred of "vitalism," the idea that life could be explained in terms of its special, living qualities. The dogmatists insist that life must be explained in terms of physics as they understand it, and it happens that their "physics" is nothing but a doctrinal relic kept in place to justify their conceptions of biology. The idea that cells are governed by their responses to whatever surrounds them has taken a long time to develop, and the dogmatists still feel that there is something impermissibly "vitalistic" in the idea that cells are sensitive or responsive. To be sensitive is to receive information from “outside,” and so the anti-Lamarckian ideas of evolution and adaptation were extended into the fields of development, immunity, aging, even learning. "Clonal selection" has been proposed to explain everything that happens in the organism, from development to cancer, because this view is compatible with the doctrine that information flows only from the genes to the cell; the cells simply die if they don't contain the necessary information. "Programmed cell death," in which a genetic code--a program, like a computer program--specifies the time at which a cell will die, is a characteristic part of this doctrine about the nature of a complex organism.

**CONTEXT:** What is the "bias against sensitivity" in biology, and how has it led to concepts like "clonal selection" and "programmed cell death"?

**RAY PEAT:** I think it is necessary to look at these established ideas, which are absurd and unfounded, because we are forced to wallow in them every day, until people have come to treat them as if they were intelligent, intellectually responsible, descriptions of reality; if we realize that silly ideas and connotations have been built into our language, then we can begin to give serious attention to the "anomalies" of science. "Anomalies" are facts that don't obey the law, and so they are of special importance for anyone who cares about understanding things. If you have some parts left over after you have assembled a puzzle, maybe the puzzle wasn't correctly assembled. So-called anomalies are often the most productive places to look for solutions.

**CONTEXT:** Why is it important to critically examine established biological ideas, and what is the significance of scientific "anomalies"?

**RAY PEAT:** That cells may be small or large or giant hasn't seemed problematic to most biologists. The assumption seems to have been that they "are big enough to contain their essential genes." Once or twice, I have got biologists to talk about the question of how a cell knows that it is big enough to divide. I think the essence of their answer is something like "they count the molecules," which is to embarrassingly compound the puzzle, like the farmer who explained his marvelous ability to rapidly count the cows in a field by saying that he "simply counted the teats and divided by four." The same kind of question can be applied to the thickness of layers of extracellular material, such as the basal lamina of capillaries. For example, granted that a cell should rest on a structure of a certain uniform thickness, how does a cell know when to stop secreting the material? When it is modifying the chemical composition of its extracellular matrix, how does it determine that the right composition has been achieved, when the substance is outside the cell?

**CONTEXT:** How do cells "know" when to divide or when to stop secreting extracellular matrix, and why are current explanations inadequate?

**RAY PEAT:** Cells have to, in some sense, perceive themselves and their environment, because their environment is an essential part of their existence, governing what they are and what they can become. To understand the nature of cellular perception, we have to look beyond existing descriptions of what cells are.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental requirement for understanding cellular behavior?

**RAY PEAT:** In plants, the fibrous, cellulose-based walls between cells don’t prevent all interactions between cells, but they do keep the cells from wandering, and they act as stable regulators of the cells’ functions. Animal cells also have a carbohydrate-rich layer surrounding them, which powerfully regulates their functions, but this layer is much more adjustable than the cellulose framework of plants. The chemical and structural plasticity of this intercellular material is an essential part of the greater sensitivity and complexity of animals, and while it is now conventional to describe this material as part of a signalling and regulatory system, I think it might also be appropriate to think of it as part of the cell’s sensory system. It forms a buffer zone around a cell that is strongly conditioned by the cell’s own activity, and when this zone is altered by the presence of another cell, or when its composition changes because of injury or infection, the influence from that buffer zone has to change processes in the cell. For example, if we compare these layers to a film of soap around a drop of oil, the surface tension--and therefore the shape—can change radically under the influence of physical and chemical agents, such as temperature, salts or acids. The forces inside cells that contribute to their shape, interact with external forces and with internal and external chemical reactions. The composition of the extracellular matrix is now known to have a profound regulatory influence on the cell's genes. The cell's "phenotype" (our phenotype is what we appear to be) is regulated by the extracellular matrix, in combination with a variety of hormonal, nutritional, and metabolic factors.

**CONTEXT:** How does the extracellular matrix in animals differ from that in plants, and how does it function as a sensory system for the cell?

**RAY PEAT:** In the study of cohesion, adsorption, radiation, diffraction, and resonance, there has been a strong tendency to avoid questions of the "ensemble," in favor of the unique, or at most double, event or situation--one or two atoms or molecules, one or two frequencies--and beyond that, to describe things with "statistical, stochastic, colligative" assumptions and methods. Crystallography is an attempt to understand ensembles of atoms or molecules, but it represents the opposite extreme of abstraction, letting geometry replace concrete data about events in time and place. What has always been left out is the way in which long range order interacts with local, and delocalized, energy. There have been observations with relevance to these issues, but they have been "left out" because they were “anomalous.” These interactions of the parts of an ensemble over distances many times greater than the size of an atom are of special importance for biology; they are where we find all the most interesting questions in biology. The way the various “anomalies” fit together is a matter for a general revision of science, but in biology, the work of Alexander Rothen gives us a tool for beginning to make sense of some of the realities of biology that have seldom been thought about.

**CONTEXT:** What is the limitation of current physics in understanding biological systems, and how does the work of Alexander Rothen offer a new perspective?

**RAY PEAT:** When I began studying biology at the University of Oregon, the bulletin board near the electron microscope room displayed some photographs of crystals that professor Bajer had been making. One of them showed a quartz crystal, over which a thin film of plastic had been coated. On top of the plastic film sodium atoms had been deposited, showing that they were being aligned in a pattern conforming to that of the underlying quartz crystal. The film was much thicker than the units of silicon dioxide in the underlying crystal, so the arrangement of the sodium atoms was obviously not being determined by either the position of the plastic polymer molecules, or the relatively remote individual silicon and oxygen atoms below the film, but somehow by a projection of the pattern of the quartz crystal. Order had been projected through the disordered layer of polymer. Earlier, I had read some of Michael Polanyi's work with long-range effects in crystals, and knew about his adsorption work, in which the adsorptive force of the underlying charcoal was able to make itself felt through several layers of atoms, continuing to cause more atoms to condense from the gas phase. Later, multilayer adsorption was explained as the result of electronic resonance. Rothen, using the techniques he had invented for measuring the thickness of extremely thin films, found that metal-plated glass slides, coated with albumin, would bind multiple layers of antibodies which were specific for the albumin. Or, before the slide was exposed to antibodies, it could be coated with a plastic (Formvar) film 120 Angstrom units thick, and still, layers of antibodies up to 80 Angstroms thick could be adsorbed. Polanyi's multilayer adsorption was considered impossible by the leading physicists of the time, but the simple idea of electronic resonance eventually made it possible for them to accept the facts. But Rothen's adsorption of multilayers of immunologically specific proteins was just too much.

**CONTEXT:** What experimental observations by Bajer and Rothen demonstrated long-range order and resonance phenomena in biological systems?

**RAY PEAT:** A couple of years after I had seen Bajer's micrographs, I asked him about them, and he said he didn't remember; already, the opinion makers in science had reacted to experiments in which cells appeared to be "feeling" an artificially constructed gradient through a plastic film, by claiming that photographs had revealed tiny holes in the films, and the cells had been reaching through the holes and feeling the gradient directly. The cheating cells (like mind-readers who peek through their blindfolds) had been “exposed,” and all the long-range transmembrane phenomena had fallen into disrepute. Even if the cells were "cheating" by reaching through holes in the film, the fact that they could sense the direction of the gradient, and move consistently “up the gradient," was never challenged, and it wasn't explained how reaching through the plastic could allow them to evaluate the gradient on the basis of a few samples--that in itself might require a more complicated explanation than the original idea, sensing the gradient through a film, required. The meaning of this episode is that the most influential scientists will seize even an irrelevant criticism as an excuse for ridiculing ideas that violate their dogma. But pores in plastic films, that cells might poke their fingers through, had no conceivable relevance to Rothen's work (nor to Bajer's). Rothen's technique could measure the thickness of the layers of antibodies, and show that they were continuous layers, several antibodies thick. Antibodies to albumin aren’t supposed to bind to themselves. The technique was so simple that a physicist visited Rothen’s lab, learned his technique, and then claimed to have invented it as a method for simplifying immunological testing. But he wanted only the commercial value of Rothen's discovery, and ignored its essential importance.

**CONTEXT:** How did the scientific establishment dismiss evidence of cellular sensitivity to extracellular gradients, and what was the underlying motivation?

**RAY PEAT:** Rothen’s specific long-range adsorption, like Polanyi’s earlier work, simply couldn’t be responded to in a rational way. A rational response might have been to reason this way: If the organization of the underlying material projects itself strongly into the environment, then patterns in the environment must also make themselves felt in the underlying material. The same mechanism would amount to an action and a perception. There were fields such as metallurgy, in which long-range forces, and the effects of surfaces on crystal structure, were “normal science,” but in biology, physics had been reduced to the ideas that were dominant in 1915.

**CONTEXT:** What is the rational interpretation of Rothen's and Polanyi's findings, and why was biology resistant to these concepts?

**RAY PEAT:** The conformation of a large molecule is part of its biological or immunological specificity. The specificity of conformation of any molecule must participate in the specific nature of the ensemble, and that of the ensemble, in the individual molecule. For example, certain enzyme molecules are known to arrange themselves one way in the cytoplasm, and another, random way when they are examined in the unnatural environment of a biochemist's test-tube. Since Polanyi’s multilayer adsorption was explained as a resonance phenomenon, the same term could be applied to Rothen’s specific adsorption, without implying that we understand exactly how it works.

**CONTEXT:** How does molecular conformation relate to specificity, and what is the role of resonance in these phenomena?

**RAY PEAT:** Rothen also showed that enzymes can act across the films. To me, the main importance of this would be to highlight the extent to which an archaic physical view has governed biochemical thinking. The action of an enzyme at a distance means that its catalytic region might be larger than previously supposed, but it also suggests that we can’t generalize from the behavior of an enzyme dissolved in water, to its behavior in the cell, where it would be subject to the reciprocal effects of many other components of the complex system. Biochemists have claimed that “biochemistry couldn’t exist if you doubted that the function of enzymes in solution is identical to the function of enzymes in the cell,” but other biochemists have demonstrated that some of the most basic assumptions of biochemistry were mistaken (Bernhard, 1988), including the assumption that the enzymes of glycolysis act on substrates that are floating around in solution. Digestive enzymes, added to a solution containing the food materials normally digested in the intestine by those enzymes, failed to alter the food materials at a rate that could be compared to that of normal digestion. But when a formaldehyde-fixed piece of intestine was added to the mixture, the reactions occurred at approximately the rate that is normal for digestion. Although in young infants digestion does happen in the fluid contents of the intestine, after the age of one, most of the action of the digestive enzymes occurs at or near the surface of the intestine, under the influence of the adsorbed enzymes. This is another clear example of the idea that enzymes are dependent on their environment.

**CONTEXT:** What is the significance of enzymes acting across films, and how does this challenge conventional biochemical assumptions? Provide an example of enzyme function in the digestive system.

**RAY PEAT:** Whether or not cells are able to “feel” what is beneath a plastic film, recent evidence indicates that the thickness and composition of the material they sit on does make a difference. Their genes are turned on by the structures that are sensed in the extracellular matrix, and the longevity, growth, function and death of the cells are determined by the nature of the substances outside the cell. The implication of much current research is that if all of the specific protein filaments can be identified that form links between the structural filaments inside cells and the matrix materials outside the cells, the powerful influence of the external matrix on the cells’ functions will somehow be explained without having to think in terms of physical ensembles. "This protein on one side of the [imaginary] cell membrane tugs on a protein on the other side," and then maybe the little homunculus who counts molecules will decide the time is right for him to carry a message to the correct gene to turn it on. It is probably true that a general picture can be completed after all of the details are present, but it isn't necessarily true that the specific interpretation will be meaningful. But at the present, we can see some of the meanings of the interaction between matrix and cell.

**CONTEXT:** What is the current research direction regarding cell-matrix interactions, and what is the potential pitfall in this approach?

**RAY PEAT:** The importance of carbon dioxide for respiration has been established, and its essentiality for even single-celled organisms has been reported. Whenever there is respiration, carbon dioxide is produced. By maintaining the effective concentration of Krebs cycle material, it protects the efficiency of respiration. Carbon dioxide is very soluble in water, but it is even more soluble in living tissue, so soluble that it will move from a low concentration in bath water into the body, where its concentration is already much higher. Its high concentration in bone is not usually appreciated, but calcium carbonate is the form in which calcium is first deposited in new bone. Carbon dioxide reacts spontaneously with ammonia, and with other amines. The reaction of ammonia with carbon dioxide is the first step in the formation of urea, protecting against the potential toxicity of ammonia. Proteins probably bind a little more carbon dioxide on their amino groups than the amount that dissolves in a similar quantity of water, but biologists generally talk only about the carbamino content of hemoglobin, since the binding of carbon dioxide to this protein regulates the blood's ability to deliver oxygen to the tissues. Carbon dioxide strongly influences the way in which water interacts with proteins, and it participates in the ability of iron-binding molecules to carry iron. Although carbon dioxide probably associates with most of the amino groups in the body, only a few of these reactions have been studied. For example, it is known to bind to insulin, affecting its conformation. I think this is likely to explain some of the effects of the thyroid hormone in diabetes, since thyroid increases the production of carbon dioxide.

**CONTEXT:** What is the fundamental role of carbon dioxide in respiration and cellular metabolism, and how does it interact with biological molecules?

**RAY PEAT:** Mucins, or mucopolysaccharides, are combinations of proteins and polysaccharides, which make up a large part of the extracellular matrix; the blood-type substances are mucopolysaccharides, as are chondroitin and hyaluronic acid. The carbohydrate chains of the mucins are made up of alternating sugars and amino sugars. When the amino groups are free, they will tend to associate with carbon dioxide, and so the way they interact with water, with each other, and with proteins, will be modified according to the amount of carbon dioxide present. The simplest way to visualize the effect of carbon dioxide on mucopolysaccharides is to think of its action as an expectorant, in which it decreases the viscosity of bronchial mucus, allowing it to be reabsorbed or expelled. Since iodide also has a long history of use as an expectorant, we should compare the effects of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid with the effects of iodide in other situations.

**CONTEXT:** What are mucins, and how does carbon dioxide influence their properties, similar to an expectorant?

**RAY PEAT:** The transparent structures of the eye are interesting places for considering the effects of carbon dioxide. I think carbon dioxide has a role in maintaining the clarity of the lens, as I discussed in the cataracts newsletter, by preventing swelling. The connective tissues of the eye's sclera and cornea are rich in mucopolysaccharides, and the vitreous body and the aqueous humor are very much like more dilute solutions of the same materials--the cornea is the most dense, and the aqueous is the most dilute. The fluidity of the aqueous is important because it circulates nutrients and oxygen from the blood, to sustain the lens and the cornea. The individual molecules in the aqueous are larger than those in the vitreous, but because there are fewer of them, the aqueous isn't very viscous. If carbon dioxide affects these molecules as it does the mucins in the bronchial secretions, then we can infer that it is important in maintaining the fluidity of the aqueous humor; this would suggest that hypothyroidism, leading to a substitution of lactic acid for carbon dioxide, might contribute to the development of glaucoma by increasing the viscosity of the aqueous humor.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide influence the structures of the eye, and what is the potential link between hypothyroidism, lactic acid, and glaucoma?

**RAY PEAT:** Among mountain climbers, it has been reported that after staying several hours at a very high altitude, there is a decrease in the degree of myopia. Because of the Haldane-Bohr effect, in which carbon dioxide is retained when less oxygen is available, I think the high altitude effect on myopia involves a condensation of the connective tissue. In experimenters wearing gas tight goggles, and in scraped corneas kept in tissue culture, carbon dioxide has been found to have an anti-swelling effect on the cornea.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed mechanism for the reduction of myopia at high altitudes, and what is the effect of carbon dioxide on corneal swelling?

**RAY PEAT:** When rats have their thyroid glands removed, they become nearsighted, but if their pituitary glands are removed at the same time, they don't develop myopia. Hypothyroidism is classically associated with "myxedema," in which the tissues become overloaded with the glycoproteins or mucins. Several pituitary hormones are known to stimulate the overproduction of mucins. In several of my classes, I asked students if they remembered when they became nearsighted. Although puberty is the usual time for myopia to begin, several girls mentioned that they had needed glasses within a month of beginning the oral contraceptive pill, and some of them found that their vision returned to normal when they stopped the pill, or began using thyroid supplements. High prolactin (associated with high estrogen or low thyroid) may be one of the factors in myopia.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between thyroid function, pituitary hormones, mucin production, and myopia? What factors can influence the onset of myopia?

**RAY PEAT:** Another experimental method for producing myopia is to cover the eye of a growing animal, or to keep the animal in constant darkness. In darkness, the eye grows larger than normal, causing the refractive error of myopia, and the sclera is soft and weak. Since stimulated nerves consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide, I think darkness might mimic hypothyroidism, allowing the connective tissues to swell.

**CONTEXT:** How can darkness or covering the eye induce myopia, and how might this relate to hypothyroidism and carbon dioxide levels?

**RAY PEAT:** The sea cucumber has been used to study the physical properties of connective tissue, and it has been found that certain salts tend to soften the connective tissues, but that iodide doesn't. The well-established use of iodide to resolve granulomas, even when it doesn't eliminate the infectious agent, might suggest that it is protecting against something which is disrupting the connective tissue structure. The only publications I have seen that presented clear evidence of the disappearance of arteriosclerosis involved treatment with iodides. In the retina, blood vessels can be seen to return to their normal appearance following a course of iodide treatment. Besides its possible direct effects on the mucins, iodide might help to eliminate calcium from the walls of blood vessels, since calcium iodide is very soluble.

**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of iodide on connective tissue, and what is its potential role in resolving granulomas and arteriosclerosis?

**RAY PEAT:** In aging, connective tissue becomes hardened by chemical cross-linking of the large molecules. If amino groups are well saturated with carbon dioxide, this type of reaction should be inhibited. (Carbon dioxide also inhibits the production of free radicals, which are involved in some types of cross-linking reactions.) The waterlogged condition seen during shock or stress in blood vessels, lungs, and other organs, and the edema of the brain and cataracts of the lenses that follow metabolic impairments of various sorts, seem to involve the uptake of "free" water, at the same time that "bound" (unfreezable) water is lost. Carbon dioxide seems to promote the retention of bound water, and protects against the edematous conditions. The swelling of muscles during hypoxic stress probably represents the basic process, in which lactic acid and pH increase, while CO2 is lost.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide prevent the hardening of connective tissue with aging, and how does it influence water balance in tissues?

**RAY PEAT:** Whatever the cell's "membrane" structure may be, Rothen's demonstration of the deep interactions of adjacent layers showed that the conditions on either side of the surface of a cell are very sensitive to conditions on the other side. Since the mucopolysaccharides regulate cell division, cell shape and motility, cell longevity and cell death, and carbon dioxide has very powerful structural effects on the mucopolysaccharides, the cell, by producing carbon dioxide, is stabilizing its regulatory framework, the extracellular matrix, at the same time that it stabilizes the intracellular proteins and systems of metabolism. The thyroid hormone is the most important promoter of carbon dioxide formation.

**CONTEXT:** How does carbon dioxide contribute to cellular stability and the regulation of the extracellular matrix, and what is the role of thyroid hormone in this process?
