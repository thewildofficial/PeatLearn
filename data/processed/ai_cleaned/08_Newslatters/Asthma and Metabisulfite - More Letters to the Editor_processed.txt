**CONTEXT:** A letter to the editor of JAMA regarding the use of Alupent, an asthma medication, which contained metabisulfite, a known irritant for asthmatics. The letter highlights the potential for this ingredient to cause severe reactions, including sudden death, which the author argues is not truly paradoxical given the known effects of sulfites.
