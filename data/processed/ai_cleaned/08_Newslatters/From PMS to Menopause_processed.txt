**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen is a shock hormone with pro-aging effects. It interferes with oxidative metabolism, promotes the formation of lipofuscin (age-pigment), causes iron retention, produces free radicals and lipid peroxides, promotes excitotoxicity and nerve cell death, impairs learning, increases blood clotting and vascular spasms, causes autoimmunity and thymus atrophy, elevates prolactin, thins the skin, increases cancer susceptibility, lowers body temperature, reduces serum albumin, promotes edema, and mimics shock.

**CONTEXT:** What are the harmful effects of taking estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen causes breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, fibroid tumors, pituitary tumors, lung cancer, liver cancer, bowel cancer, kidney cancer, malignant melanoma, meningioma and other brain cancers, cancers of other organs, osteoarthritis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, porphyria, optic neuritis, epilepsy, depression, suicide, accidents, anxiety, agoraphobia, amnesia, nerve cell damage, low blood pressure, fainting, shock, migraine, varicose veins, irregular heart beat, blood vessel spasms, intestinal spasms, inflammatory bowel disease, gall stones, gall bladder spasms, blood sugar disturbances, hypothyroidism, blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, miscarriage, birth defects, endometriosis, excess hair and loss of hair, skin discoloration, thinning of the skin, water retention and obesity.

**CONTEXT:** You mention that estrogen can cause both excess hair and loss of hair. What do you mean?

**RAY PEAT:** By suppressing the thyroid and stimulating the pituitary's secretion of prolactin, estrogen can have a variety of complex effects on hair growth; usually, thinning of the hair on the head is a consequence of hypothyroidism. In both men and women, loss of hair from the scalp is associated with low thyroid, but "male pattern baldness" has been held to be produced by a male hormone; but even the male hormones can be turned into estrogen by enzymes in the skin, and experiments show that it is estrogen which causes the hair follicle to become inactive, while an estrogen-blocker can stimulate the renewal of hair. (R. C. Smart, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sciences, Oct. 29, 1996.)

By stimulating the adrenal glands, estrogen can increase the production of the "male" hormones that are associated with whiskers and chest hair. [E. C. Ditkoff, et al, "The impact of estrogen on adrenal androgen sensitivity and secretion in polycystic ovary syndrome," J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 80(2), 603-607, 1995.] This usually happens when a progesterone deficiency is combined with an excess of estrogen, as in the polycystic ovary syndrome and sometimes at menopause. In animals, polycystic ovaries are caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone, and the same regulatory mechanisms seem to operate in women. The polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder in women during the reproductive years, and may occur in 10% of them. [A. Dunaif, et al., eds. The Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell Scientific; 1992.]

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned that estrogen causes pituitary tumors. If the pituitary is the "master gland," isn't that very serious?

**RAY PEAT:** In the early 1970s, researchers at Johns Hopkins studied a group of 300 young women living in their region who had pituitary tumors. Previously, that kind of tumor was very rare, and the researchers suggested that the estrogen in the oral contraceptive was causing this epidemic. Estrogen's ability to produce this kind of tumor is now firmly established. This type of tumor secretes prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone which is known to cause osteoporosis, and which also has a role in breast abnormalities, including cancer. It can suppress the ovaries’ ability to make progesterone, and it affects sweat glands and hair follicles. If the tumor is very large, its pressure on the optic nerve can cause visual disturbances.

Normally, by the age of 50, most people have an enlargement of the pituitary, and this is undoubtedly a factor in the menopause and other conditions that occur in aging. A blood test for prolactin will usually show whether a tumor is forming or not. A drug is available that will shrink the tumor and normalize the gland's function.

**CONTEXT:** What are some of the emotional symptoms of excess estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen excess can cause suicidal depression, or milder forms of depression and lethargy, as well as irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, fear of public places, forgetfulness, a feeling of confusion, and a tendency to cry easily. Post-partum depression (following childbirth) is associated with high estrogen and low thyroid, and insomnia is common at that time, and during menopause. Sometimes insomnia is associated with night-time worrying.

Migraine headaches are strongly associated with high estrogen and low thyroid. The traditional view that they are caused by emotions probably came from the observation that migraines are frequently associated with the monthly hormone cycle.

According to German documents [investigated by Jean Jofen of Baruch College, reported at the Fifth World Congress of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem], the Nazis put estrogen in the food at concentration camps, to make the prisoners helpless and unable to organize resistance. They certainly weren't doing it to slow the aging process.

**CONTEXT:** What caused your interest in estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Between 1950 and the early 1960s I knew three women who used estrogen. One developed an extreme case of rheumatoid arthritis, which got worse with each dose of estrogen, and disappeared when she stopped using it. Another woman had a mental breakdown within an hour of her estrogen injection, and was hospitalized for six months. Her daughter began using the contraceptive pill, and died of a stroke at the age of 28. It was clear to me that estrogen had harmful effects, and that it was being promoted without adequate warnings. Magazine articles described massive testing programs in Puerto Rico and claimed that the women were healthier after using the pills, but in reality the contraceptive Enovid was approved on the basis of only 135 women who were studied for a year or more; three young test subjects died. When I went to graduate school in 1968, I began projects in brain physiology, aging, and cancer, and in each of those areas I found that estrogen was an important factor.

**CONTEXT:** What should I do if I want to stop the pill?

**RAY PEAT:** In the case of birth control pills, you can simply stop taking them, with few symptoms of withdrawal, but it is important to be alert to the possibility that your own hormone balance might not spontaneously return to normal. Some women are unable to get pregnant after using the pill. If your normal cycles don't resume within a few months, it would be useful to have tests done for prolactin, progesterone, and thyroid, since those hormones are modified by estrogen use. And you should be aware that estrogen use increases the risk of birth defects. Since natural progesterone has been found to reduce the incidence of birth defects, it would seem reasonable to be sure that your own progesterone has returned to normal before getting pregnant.

**CONTEXT:** How can I tell if my natural estrogen level is too high?

**RAY PEAT:** Only a blood test can tell for sure whether your estrogen is higher than it should be, and it is necessary to measure your progesterone at the same time, since it is best to have five or ten times as much progesterone as estrogen. If your progesterone level is low, even an average estrogen level can cause serious symptoms, because its effects are not balanced and opposed by progesterone.

Generally, people whose temperature (measured by an oral thermometer) is below normal or whose thyroid function is low are likely to have high estrogen and low progesterone. (Low temperature stimulates the ovaries to produce excess estrogen, and retards the liver's ability to excrete it.) A deficiency of protein and B vitamins can make it impossible for your liver to excrete estrogen, leading to a chronically high estrogen level. Excess fat tissue, especially after the age of 40 when progesterone and thyroid may be low, is a major cause of chronically high estrogen levels, and therefore is associated with an increased incidence of breast and uterine cancer.

Estrogen usually causes fat to be deposited on the thighs and hips.

**CONTEXT:** How can I get my natural estrogen level to be lower?

**RAY PEAT:** Adequate protein and B vitamins are essential. Vitamin A protects some tissues, such as the breasts, against estrogen's effects, including cancer, and generally offers protection against estrogen by increasing progesterone. Several studies found that vitamin E protects against estrogen's harmful effects. A thyroid supplement can reliably lower estrogen, by increasing the liver's ability to excrete it. Unsaturated oils have a strongly estrogen-promoting action, and should be avoided. Raw carrots can help, by preventing the reabsorption of estrogen which has been secreted into the intestine with the bile. Adequate sunlight helps to maintain a healthy balance of the hormones. In certain circumstances, natural progesterone can help to reestablish a balance of hormones.

**CONTEXT:** Will lowering my estrogen have any harmful effects?

**RAY PEAT:** No. Natural estrogen is closely associated with stress, and this "anti-estrogen" program is essentially an antistress program, which is likely to improve many aspects of your health.

**CONTEXT:** What are your options for birth control if I don't take estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Human fertility, like that of birds, reptiles, fish, and other animals, has declined so steeply during the last 20 years, as a result of the industrial pollutants with harmful estrogen-like effects, that it is very likely that every form of birth control has become more effective than it was found to be in the 1960s and 1970s. This means that even the rhythm method, using temperature or mucous tests to determine the fertile time, should be more effective than it used to be. The barrier methods--condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps--will tend to be more effective even without the toxic spermicidal drugs that are now normally used with them.

The traditional cervical cap was illegal in the United States for many years. (In fact, contraception was a crime not very long ago. And when I first considered including contraception in a course I taught, I learned that even teaching about it would have been illegal. It was undoubtedly lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry that contributed to the changed legal situation.) When a so-called cervical cap was finally approved for use in this country, it was actually an unworkable, ludicrously designed receptacle for a spermicidal drug, and not actually an effective barrier. The actual cervical cap, if it can be obtained "illegally," is a safe, easy, comfortable and effective means of contraception.

The IUD (intrauterine device) actually works by causing serious hormonal disruptions, blocking the ability to produce progesterone.

Natural progesterone has been added to plastic IUDs, but this doesn't correct the general hormone imbalance that can be produced by the presence of an object in the uterus.

Synthetic hormones which are implanted under the skin increase the risk of cancer, and can cause disfiguring injury at the site of implantation.

Natural progesterone placed in the vagina during intercourse has been very effective in my studies, but is not officially approved. Progesterone's normal effects include maintenance of pregnancy, and that requires the prevention of additional pregnancies during the course of an established one. Its presence in the vagina during intercourse causes the cells to react as if there were already an established pregnancy. There are various reasons that this method of contraception hasn't been generally accepted; for example, progesterone's very name suggests that it promotes pregnancy, and the bureaucratic mentality sees things in simplistic ways.

Incidentally, I think the evidence is absolutely clear that the estrogen pills are not contraceptives. They don't prevent conception, they prevent implantation of the embryo into the uterus. That is abortion, so the industry had to make up a theory in which the pills could be marketed as a contraceptive, to avoid the religious reaction to the abortion pill. This theoretical gimmick took nearly twenty years to develop.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen can cause breast cancer, heart disease, strokes, accelerated aging, and many other serious problems. There is no valid scientific evidence of its safety in any amounts. Estrogen is dangerous, in any amounts, unless it is balanced by an abundance of the natural forms of thyroid, progesterone, and DHEA. Estrogen can be produced in practically every part of the body, especially in fat tissue. Estrogen's only clearly established useful functions are to prepare for reproduction by stimulating growth of the uterus, the breasts, and the pituitary gland, and to influence behavior during reproduction. Even in these specialized functions, it has an absolute requirement for a complex and precise balance of other hormones. The body's normal defenses against estrogen fail with aging, causing many symptoms associated with menopause.

**CONTEXT:** Summary of Estrogen's Dangers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Replacement" is a trick word in this context. At a European conference, a researcher asked "why do you Americans use the word ‘replacement,’ when you are administering doses that give them 15 times more estrogen than normal young women have naturally?" Rather than bringing the blood level of estrogen up to normal, most physicians ignore the amount of estrogen already present in the blood, and give a dose of estrogen sufficient to suppress the pituitary hormones, FSH and LH, which are sometimes called "the menopause hormones."

But the menopausal excess of those pituitary hormones is caused by estrogen's chronic damage to the nerve cells that regulate the pituitary, which causes the nerves to become insensitive to normal stimulation by estrogen.

Cholesterol is turned into hormones such as progesterone in the brain and the adrenal glands, as well as in the ovaries and testicles, but estrogen can be produced in practically every part of the body. For example, even when the ovaries are removed, hormones from the adrenal glands can be turned into estrogen in fat cells. In general, the fatter a person is, the higher their estrogen levels are. This is why the risk of cancer increases in proportion to obesity.

The stimulating effect some women experience when they are given large, unphysiological doses of estrogen seems to be produced partly by an effect of estrogen that resembles stimulation by cocaine. In a variety of ways, estrogen is a powerful brain excitant: it can provoke epileptic seizures, and it increases the effects of some of the excitatory substances and processes that contribute to brain aging.

**CONTEXT:** You point out the dangers of estrogen, but don't women need to replace it at menopause?

**RAY PEAT:** It simply isn't safe to take estrogen. Safety implies that adequate studies have been performed, and have found that the treatment has done no harm. The first such large scale study to examine the general effects of estrogen replacement is just beginning. Many studies which looked for particular effects in humans have already found harm, and the huge amount of research that has been done on animals strongly indicates that the over-all effects of estrogen will be found to be harmful.

During the 20th century, animal studies have revealed almost an infinite variety of harmful effects of estrogen. Cancer, blood clots, miscarriage, shock-like effects, and accelerated aging are among its longest-established toxic effects. Some medical publications have claimed that estrogen-treated women live longer than untreated women, but as Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor (UCSD) has observed, the women who received estrogen were healthier before the study began than the women who didn't receive estrogen, and in such a biased situation no meaningful conclusion is possible, except that some women can survive treatment with estrogen. There are many scientifically sound studies that show estrogen treatment to be seriously harmful to women. Even some of estrogen's less deadly effects, such as memory impairment and water retention, should be taken more seriously.

**CONTEXT:** How safe is estrogen in very low doses?

**RAY PEAT:** "Low estrogen" birth control pills contain about 30 micrograms of estrogen, and since this amount prevents pregnancy, it is significantly "large" in physiological terms. It is low only by reference to earlier pills.

Even young women have had strokes caused by the estrogen in birth control pills, and tumors of the pituitary and liver have been linked to use of the pill, as have cancer, heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, suicides, and accidental death. Since many environmental pollutants (DDT, phenolic compounds, smoke and dioxins, for example) act like estrogen, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish the effects of medical estrogens from the general effects of pollution, but the higher background level of estrogenic stimulation suggests that more and more people will be injured by the additional burden of "low dose" estrogen treatments. (Skin patches for menopause treatment are intended to deliver 50 or 100 micrograms of the powerful natural estrogen, estradiol, per day, vaginal creams deliver similar amounts (probably causing higher blood concentrations at times, because of the greater permeability of vaginal membranes), and the suggested oral dose of estradiol for menopause symptoms is 1 or 2 mg., that is, 1000 or 2000 micrograms per day. Tablets of conjugated estrogen for oral use range from 300 micrograms to 2,500 micrograms. As a vaginal cream, the applied dosage suggested is 1,250 or 2,500 micrograms per day for the conjugated estrogen, somewhat lower than the suggested amount of estradiol cream.)

**CONTEXT:** Why would the medical establishment prescribe estrogen if it's not safe?

**RAY PEAT:** Hundreds of millions of dollars of annual profits from estrogen products allow the drug companies to subsidize medical conferences, medical research, medical journals, and medical schools. The information physicians receive is heavily biased in favor of estrogen treatment by that funding. Physicians are not regularly taught in medical school or in continuing education courses, that they should measure the amount of estrogen in the blood before they prescribe a treatment to "replace" it, and the amount commonly prescribed has no meaningful relationship to the amount which is normal in young women. Many women have told me that their doctors have measured their estrogen level, but when they look at their medical records they often find that only the pituitary hormones or the vaginal cells have been examined.

**CONTEXT:** Doesn't taking estrogen prevent aging and increase energy?

**RAY PEAT:** Because of the claims that estrogen protects the skin against aging, investigators have tested its effects when rubbed onto guinea pigs (Pliske, 1953), or injected into rats (Hooker and Pfeiffer, 1943). It caused hair loss and thinning of skin in the rats, and in guinea pigs it caused degeneration and vacuolization of connective tissue. Animal experiments show clearly that estrogen accelerates the aging of connective tissues, and it causes the accumulation of "age pigment."

When a rat is treated with estrogen, it is likely to run 30 miles a day, because of the brain excitation it causes. Some women like this sensation of "energy," but biochemically, the stimulation isn't unlike that received from cocaine, and accordingly the estrogen-induced excitation seems to be addictive. Cocaine doesn't have some of estrogen's side effects. Estrogen tends to deprive all tissues of an adequate supply of oxygen, so the "energy" it provides isn't protective in the way that a good reserve of biological energy is, and in fact it activates brain pathways that involve potentially deadly over-excitation, which are responsible for the aging and death of brain cells.

**CONTEXT:** Why do so many women I know look and feel better when they take estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Cows and other animals that have been given estrogen treatments to make them put on extra weight, are fat and waterlogged, but none of their functional systems are improved. When a woman's skin is aging and slack, it becomes tighter and smoother if she gains weight, even if the weight consists of fat and retained water. But the skin itself becomes thinner, less elastic, and “older" in several structural and functional ways when it is treated with estrogen.

Estrogen, as discussed above, can act as a stimulant, and give an increased sense of energy. Estrogen can be metabolized into a form which promotes the actions of the catecholamines, such as adrenalin. In this form, estrogen produces toxic free radicals, which contribute to aging and cancer.

In those senses--tightening the aging skin by causing water retention and obesity, and acting as a stimulant--estrogen can make you "look better" and "feel better." But personality studies show that women who trust their physicians more than they trust themselves are the ones who are likely to use estrogen. What they say they feel tends to be what their physicians have told them they should feel.

**CONTEXT:** Doesn't estrogen prevent osteoporosis?

**RAY PEAT:** No. It is said that estrogen slows the rate of bone loss, while progesterone, thyroid, and DHEA actually shift bone metabolism into the growth phase. (Around the time of menopause, there is a steep decline in the levels of these three protective hormones.) But there are serious reasons for believing that estrogen is a factor in causing bone loss. Young women have thinner bones than men of the same age, because even at a young age estrogen is acting to inhibit bone growth. (Men's bones are 50% bigger.) Prolactin, a pituitary hormone which is increased by estrogen, has a powerful bone-weakening effect and it is often produced in excess around menopause. Cortisone, another bone-weakening hormone, also tends to be increased by estrogen. The thyroid hormone, which fundamentally supports the bone-building process, is inhibited by estrogen. And progesterone, which has a bone-protecting and bone-building effect, is inhibited by these estrogen-induced hormonal changes. When bone loss begins at the onset of menopause, it is progesterone (which normally keeps estrogen in balance) which has suddenly decreased, leaving estrogen undiminished and unopposed, usually for years, during which the worst symptoms of menopause occur.

In egg-laying chickens, estrogen promotes the storage of calcium, largely in the soft interior of bones, but if combined with a high calcium intake, extra estrogen can be toxic. To the extent that estrogen does increase the mineral content of bone, it seems to be in the spongy cancellous bone around the marrow, rather than in the strong cortical bone. In the complexly organized hormonal environment of pregnancy, estrogen's ability to stimulate the retention of iron and calcium fits into the whole scheme, in which the growing baby is consuming those substances. Poisoning by cyanide, or oxygen deprivation, can increase the retention of calcium by tissue, and since an immediate effect of estrogen is to decrease the oxygenation of tissue, I see estrogen's effect on calcium metabolism as analogous to its effect on iron: In stress, organisms absorb calcium and iron. In dying cells, both calcium and iron tend to be deposited together. Estrogen has its place in normal growth and development, but the people who advocate its use as a supplement seem to have no respect for the complexity of its relation to the developing organism.

In young animals, estrogen retards the growth of cartilage. Physicians sometimes give estrogen to tall children, when their parents want their growth to stop, because it does stop bone growth.

Estrogen is not an anabolic hormone, like testosterone, which builds up bone and muscle. In fact, it strongly opposes the effects of those hormones. In the polycystic ovary syndrome, an excess of estrogen stimulates the adrenal glands to produce a large amount of the androgenic steroids, probably to balance estrogen in the way progesterone does when the ovaries are functioning properly. These anabolic/androgenic hormones apparently have some of the good effects of progesterone, such as reducing the incidence of cancer, but many women are disturbed by the increased growth of body and facial hair; facial features also tend to be masculinized. In France, progesterone lotions have been in use for several years for reversing some of these effects of the adrenal hormones, and for balancing estrogen.

Considering this sort of information, it is very unfortunate for women that the osteoporosis problem is so often seen simply as an opportunity for prescribing estrogen. In some countries, old women don't have a problem with osteoporosis. Shouldn't physicians pay more attention to emulating the factors that prevent osteoporosis, instead of thinking that it is a pharmacological problem?

Studies of both animals and humans show that estrogen contributes to a variety of inflammatory degenerative diseases, and one condition known to be aggravated by estrogen is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is sometimes referred to as a matter of "wear" of the joints, but estrogen's contribution seems to be that it structurally weakens the joint tissues, after binding to estrogen-sensitive receptors. This research should be kept in mind when listening to the claims about its "protecting the bones." Other studies have implicated estrogen in other types of arthritis.

**CONTEXT:** What about taking estrogen to avoid Alzheimer's disease and heart attacks?

**RAY PEAT:** Several years ago it was noticed that estrogen treatment caused changes in the types and amounts of fat carried in the blood. Ordinarily, unexpected changes caused by drugs are treated as abnormalities, and bring the drug into question. But with estrogen, the situation is different: Recently, a reviewer noted that estrogen alters the triglyceride (simple fat) levels in the blood, but dismissed the change as "probably benign." In the case of cholesterol, the abnormality was interpreted as a virtue. Estrogen increased the ratio of HDL (high density lipoprotein--"good"--cholesterol) to LDL (low density lipoprotein--"bad"--cholesterol). In other situations, a high ratio of HDL to LDL has been found to be associated with a lower incidence of heart attacks (but a higher incidence of cancer), and this single trait has been considered alone, out of context, to allow many people to claim that estrogen "protects against heart attacks," since it shifts that indicator in the direction associated with fewer heart attacks. But estrogen also does many things that are more directly associated with heart attacks: It increases the tendency to form blood clots, and it increases the tendency of blood vessels to go into spasm during stress (synergizing with adrenalin). When men were given estrogen following a heart attack, it was found to increase--rather than decrease--the risk of another heart attack.

In the famous Framingham study, it was found that post-menopausal estrogen use increased heart attacks by 50% and increased strokes by 100%. "Estrogen's heart protective effect" is a clear example of taking one feature (the cancer-associated HDL/LDL ratio) out of context for the purposes of advertising a product. It is a good idea to read the literature that comes with estrogen prescription products, because even though it is printed by the pharmaceutical company, the law requires that some truthful warning information must be provided.

It is known that cancer (and other degenerative diseases) take a long time to develop, often more than 20 years after the crucial damage was done. Many studies have been able to find that estrogen has no harmful effect by stopping the study at an age at which no damage would be expected to show.

In 1993, a study in California found that women who took estrogen were less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. The first study was done in a little town where I had done some lectures and consultations, and I was aware that a local doctor was giving his patients natural progesterone whenever he prescribed estrogen, and that he usually gave estrogen only when they specifically asked for it. I suspect that the women who chose to use estrogen were (as in other studies) more affluent and healthier, and that many of them were at the same time taking natural progesterone.

Another more recent study showed that women who take estrogen are not less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, but were more highly educated than those who don't use estrogen. Several studies have found that poorly educated people are much more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, because of the way the mental tests are designed and interpreted. These relationships show how it is possible to get a mistaken impression of the effects of estrogen treatment.

Since it is harder to do an accurate study of humans than of animals, we should examine the effects of estrogen on the brains of animals much more carefully before making any more claims about its "protective" effects. We should remember that it was claimed to prevent miscarriages (it actually causes them), to prevent skin aging (it accelerates it), to delay menopause (in animals, it accelerates the onset of sterility and the loss of cyclic pituitary function), and to prevent heart attacks in men (it caused them). As far as the brain is concerned, estrogen is known to "erase" memories, to induce seizures, to cause the exhaustion or death of particular types of nerve cell, and to be very toxic to the developing fetal brain, retarding its growth. The adrenalin-like derivative of estrogen which is responsible for much of its brain-stimulating action is known to produce toxic free radicals. Free radicals are considered to play an important role in the development of both Alzheimer's disease and heart disease.

**CONTEXT:** Do you mean estrogen might accelerate brain aging?

**RAY PEAT:** In animal studies, it accelerates age-related changes in every organ examined. In P. M. Wise's studies, it appeared to exhaust and kill specific brain cells that are involved in fertility. Recent studies of brain physiology show that estrogen and cortisol both promote the "excitotoxic" processes, which are increasingly believed to be implicated in the processes of brain aging and degeneration.

Since excess iron is now thought (as discussed in the chapter on iron) to contribute to cancer and heart disease, and is a factor in brain degeneration, and since iron assimilation is promoted by estrogen, I would expect there to be an intensification of the toxic effects of dietary iron supplementation by estrogen treatment. For example, both iron and estrogen can destabilize liver protein synthesis, they are both involved in the formation of "age pigment," they both seem to facilitate epileptic seizures, and so on.

Menstruation, I suspect, is protective (by causing some iron loss), and estrogen (by promoting iron retention), harmful.

The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is higher in women than in men [A. F. Jorm, 1990; W. A. Rocca, et al., 1991], osteoporosis is mainly a disease of American and European women, and men have more heart attacks when they are given estrogen. According to the Framingham study, women who use estrogen have more heart attacks and strokes than those who don't. Considering those simple facts, one has to wonder how the estrogen promoters came up with the theory that estrogen is "protective" against heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis.

**CONTEXT:** My doctor said estrogen is safe if I take it with "progesterone" or progestin or testosterone.

**RAY PEAT:** Physicians often confuse the synthetic progestins with natural progesterone. The brand of medroxyprogesterone acetate called Provera is often mistakenly called progesterone. Each steroid hormone has a range of biological effects, and generally the synthetic progestins contain some very powerful estrogen-like or testosterone-like effects. Natural progesterone's effects on the uterus can be achieved to some extent by some of the synthetic hormones, but the natural substance also has a powerful and pervasive balancing effect on other hormones, and serves as the material out of which other natural hormones can be formed. The synthetic progestins lack that balancing effect, and can't be transformed biologically into any of the other natural hormones.

The synthetic progestins can protect the uterus from the carcinogenic effect of estrogen. Even testosterone's anti-estrogen action seems to protect the uterus and the breast from estrogen’s effects. But the famous studies on female beagles showed that a commonly used synthetic progestin can cause breast cancer, and similar results have been seen with other synthetics. One of progesterone's most important effects is its protection of the brain's structure and function; the use of a synthetic substitute for it often causes nervous and emotional symptoms, and I think it is reasonable to be concerned that the synthetic may have harmful long-range effects on the brain that haven't been discovered yet.

Adding testosterone to estrogen treatment reduces some of the risks of estrogen treatment, and it definitely improves bone metabolism. Testosterone is a powerful sexual stimulant, and this has probably increased the popularity of the treatment, but many women dislike the growth of whiskers that testosterone stimulates. [Estrogen itself can sometimes stimulate the growth of whiskers, by over-stimulating the adrenal glands. E. C. Ditkoff, et al., "The impact of estrogen on adrenal androgen sensitivity and secretion in polycystic ovary syndrome," J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 80(2), 603-607, 1995.] Both testosterone and estrogen cause the thymus gland to shrink, with serious consequences for immunity, and they also seem to have some similar toxic effects on the brain.

If estrogen is not balanced by hormones such as progesterone, DHEA, pregnenolone, and testosterone, even a very small amount of the substance has a very large effect on the body. Even when the ovaries have been removed, the body's fat tissues can produce significant quantities of estrogen. Various stresses and injuries can cause the body to produce more estrogen. When large amounts of estrogen are given, the body is unable to produce enough of the other hormones to balance it, and these other hormones fail at an earlier age than estrogen production does. "Ovarian failure" always involves a progesterone deficiency, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is an estrogen deficiency.

Natural progesterone is a cheap material which is effective when taken orally dissolved (not just packed) in oil, but many physicians are confused about it, because the FDA lists only the injectable form (which is in a toxic solvent) as the "approved" form. Natural progesterone, when not in an injectable form, doesn't need the FDA's approval, because it is a natural hormone which was in use before the FDA law was passed.

To be effective, it has to be fully dissolved and not visible as a white powder. This is why some studies have claimed that it is not effective, or is effective only when administered in very large doses.

**CONTEXT:** What about estriol and other estrogen choices, such as phytoestrogens (estrogens derived from plants such as soybeans)?

**RAY PEAT:** Estriol is a slightly weaker variant of the stronger natural estradiol. It is more water soluble than estradiol, so it is slightly easier to excrete in the urine. When it is used as a drug, the body can change it into the more active estradiol.

The phytoestrogens, or plant-derived estrogens, have been promoted recently as safer alternatives for therapeutic use. In the sense that these weaker estrogens can modify the actions of strong estrogens, they might be protective in certain circumstances involving excess estrogen, but this protection is more theoretical than practical, and the harm they can do is real. Sheep farmers learned long ago that the phytoestrogens in clover can cause miscarriages, animal studies show they cause genital deformities, and recent tests are suggesting that they are, like other estrogens, carcinogenic. This is similar to the situation with Tamoxifen, which is an anti-estrogen used to treat breast cancer. It, in itself, is carcinogenic. (See my discussion of estriol and other "weak" estrogens in section 4.)

**CONTEXT:** Doesn't everyone have the right to decide what is best for them? What if they feel estrogen is working for them and eliminates symptoms?

**RAY PEAT:** That is reasonable, if you have access to the best information on the beneficial and harmful effects of the treatment. This book is to help you to decide whether you have the information you need on questions of this sort. Many people have felt that they understood a treatment, and benefitted from it, but later learned that it had seriously harmed them. For example, many people were given large doses of X-rays to treat their acne or ringworm or sinus inflammation or "enlarged thymus gland," with their physicians’ assurance that it was the safe and effective and universally accepted treatment, only to discover that the treatment caused cancer or brain damage or deformity or loss of immunity. Many people, including physicians, do not realize that there is a very large and persuasive scientific literature that indicates that estrogen is neither safe nor effective for the various uses which are currently advertised.

**CONTEXT:** What are the pros and cons of other treatment regimes if I go off estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Many physicians prescribe clonidine patches to prevent hot flashes in women who don't want to use estrogen. Clonidine is a drug that blocks adrenalin. Since hot flashes can be caused by excess cortisone, and adrenalin triggers the release of cortisone, this procedure seems to have a logical foundation. Cortisone excess causes osteoporosis, so clonidine could protect the bones while preventing hot flashes.

Natural progesterone strengthens the bones by blocking cortisone and prolactin, it normalizes thyroid and energy metabolism and thereby helps with insomnia, it prevents the growth of excess facial hair, steadies the emotions, and sometimes even helps to control hot flashes.

Natural thyroid supplements can help to avoid weight gain, depression, and hot flashes; this will be discussed in the chapter on thyroid. The claims that thyroid contributes to osteoporosis are not true, according to the relevant human and animal studies (for example, Franklyn, 1994), and that myth was based on a few unscientific reports.

There is a drug which is sometimes more powerful than thyroid and progesterone in correcting abnormal pituitary function, and this has been used to relieve some of the symptoms of menopause, including osteoporosis.

The diet should support optimal functioning of the thyroid and other glands, as discussed in other chapters.

**CONTEXT:** How do I get off estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Keeping estrogen’s stimulating action in mind, women who want to stop using estrogen prescribed "for menopause" usually find that they can withdraw from it by decreasing the dose gradually over a period of two or three months, while using some harmless stimulants such as tea or coffee as needed to smooth the process of withdrawal.

**RAY PEAT:** The idea of "running out of eggs" can be settled simply by demonstrating the presence of viable eggs at the time reproductive ability has ended. In the 1940s, menopause was "explained" in terms of an estrogen deficiency, without a basis in fact, and now an "egg deficiency" is combined with the "estrogen deficiency," compounding the confusion. Facts aren't everything in science; it is necessary to look at the context from which these ideas develop.

Two of America's most productive researchers in reproductive physiology, Edgar Allen and Herbert M. Evans, made observations that they believed showed that the germinal epithelium of the ovary goes through a cycle of cell proliferation that produces a new generation of oocytes during each menstrual cycle. It is recognized that new egg cells appear in the ovaries of adult prosimian primates, and at puberty in cats and pigs. Observations of newly developed egg cells have been reported in some other species. But the dominant view prefers to see the number of egg cells declining from birth, or earlier, with absolutely no new egg cells being formed later.

During gestation and infancy, the gonadotropins are very high. These hormones decline during childhood, during the time that the number of egg cells is so visibly declining. The high level of the gonadotropins during infancy hasn't been explained, but it is reasonable to suppose that it has something to do with the development of the ovaries, since a "developmental" function can be demonstrated for the gonadotropins in the ovaries and testes of older animals.

The number of brain cells peaks a few months before birth, just as the number of egg cells does. Many people have argued that this somehow means that brain cells are incapable of dividing after infancy, though there is no factual basis for making that argument, and in fact adult brain cells are now known to be able to divide. (That is true of heart cells, too.)

In a variety of tissues, it can be shown that the presence of mature cells inhibits the division of other cells. If part of the liver is removed, the remaining cells divide to replace the lost tissue. If the skin is cut, cells divide to help fill in the defect. If there is an adequate number of egg cells, this principle suggests that there is no need to produce more. There is a treatment for polycystic ovaries called "wedge resection." This can reduce the production of masculinizing hormones. By analogy with other tissues, it seems likely that the removal of a mass of malfunctioning tissue leads to the growth and development of new cells which function the way a new ovary would. Regeneration seems to be a capacity of every tissue, given the right environment. If the ovary were studied after such treatment, I suspect that "new eggs" would be found. (But even in the seemingly simple process of healing a wound in the skin, there is still disagreement as to the relative contribution made by local cell division, and the invasion of the region by structural cells from elsewhere in the body. The appearance of a cell can be misleading; histology is often a matter of making educated guesses. For example, white blood cells can look like epithelial cells.)

Although the question of whether all the woman's eggs are in existence at or before birth doesn't logically have anything to do with the other question, whether there are still eggs in the ovary at menopause, there is a reason that people connect them. This has to do with the idea of a "germ line" as distinct from the "somatic cells." The eggs are "from the germ line," all the rest of the body (and much of the ovary) is a different sort of stuff. The "germ line" has the special property of immortality and it is "isolated" and independent. The body is susceptible to being modified by the environment, and is mortal. These are the traditional formulations of the idea, and the people who learn their orientation from textbooks are not necessarily conscious of how the ideas fit together. For biologists of my professors’ generation, these ideas seemed to be a sacred core of biology, but with their death, maybe biology can be liberated.

August Weismann, working at the end of the last century and the beginning of the 20th century, created the basic ideology of genetics, to combat the idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which had been supported by Darwin and others. He argued that the hereditary substance, or germ plasm, was derived only from preexisting germ plasm, and couldn't be formed anew, or modified by the environment. It created every part of the perishable body, by a process in which traits were segregated, so that the germ plasm contained the full complement of hereditary material, and each part of the body contained only the limited fraction needed for its characteristics. Thus, the body was inferior created material, while the germ line was the immortal creative stuff. Since the body adapts in response to the environment, it had seemed that these changes would be passed on to descendants, until Weismann's argument showed that it was only the perishable, dead-end body lacking the hereditary principle which was adapting. The germ line was somehow isolated from the body and from the environment.

Weismann's theoretical germ line became identified with the chromosomes and the genes. His theory was shown to be simply wrong, in that each type of cell in the body contains a full complement of chromosomes and genetic information. Although his facts were wrong, his ideology became deeply embedded in the culture of genetics. To keep the idea that the "germ line" is somehow something distinct from the body required a special effort, once the chromosomes were seen to be identical in every part of the body. Weisman's whole point in his "germ line" idea was to show an absolute distinction between the body and the hereditary substance. If his ideology that had been built to deny the inheritance of acquired characteristics were to be saved, the isolated germ line would have to be found elsewhere than in the chromosomes.

The idea of "germ line (or Keimbahn) determinants" now took over, and was believed to be something in a certain spot in the egg. As the egg divided, into cells that look very much like each other, the cells which came from that part of the egg represented the germ line. As the embryo developed, the region that seemed to be traceable back to that part of the egg, represented the germ line. As the gonad began to grow, cells from the region representing the germ line were thought to travel over and invade the gonad, where they multiplied into vast numbers, but always remained the same isolated strain of germ cells with their "separate" history that could be traced back to the determinants in the special place in the egg. During the early days of embryonic development, these immigrant cells looked exactly like their neighbors which were somatic cell sprouts from the embryonic kidney region.

If it weren't for the ideology of absolute isolation of the hereditary substance, an embryologist might have suggested that cells or material of one part of the embryo induced a specialized, differentiated state in some cells that happened to be suitably located. If the cells derived from that certain part of the egg didn't carry unique genetic material--and they didn't--then what they carried with them was an incipient state of differentiation. Why the big deal about that particular history of differentiation? It was because the ideology that motivated Weismann was still active, and its purpose was to argue that only the "gene" was the creative productive source, and that the body--the "somatic cells"--was the passive product, whose adaptations meant nothing in the long run. This has been called the "central dogma" of genetics, that information flows only from the gene to the cell, and not back from the cell to the gene. That ideology forced geneticists to deny the existence of RNA viruses (including retroviruses such as the HIV-"AIDS" virus), and is still active in blocking research on the prion or scrapie virus, which is a protein. To say it bluntly, many highly respected biologists acted stupidly because they blindly believed in a false ideology.

Incidentally, this ideology was always impossible for horticulturists to accept, since they were in the habit of grafting (cloning) vegetative (somatic) parts of plants, which would then produce flowers and fruits. For them, the "germ" was often a product of the "body." Luther Burbank's work was consistently ridiculed by the academic biologists, who believed his achievements were impossible, that is, fraudulent. Many of Burbank's perceptions have been supported by recent evidence, but they couldn't be accepted by people whose ideology of the germ line/somatic distinction seemed to be contradicted by his work.

Another problem with the doctrine of the germ line was revealed when embryologists separated the embryo at a very early stage into two groups of cells, and found that each was able to grow into a complete animal. The idea of the germ line predicts that one member of the pair of twins could get the ability to reproduce while the other would be sterile. Some important ideas can survive their disproof.

It is exactly the same academic ideology of the priority of the germ line which blames the whole complex process of reproductive aging on the mechanical process of an "ovary running out of eggs." The ovary doesn't run out of eggs, and running out of eggs would have no great consequences if it did happen, because the main events in ovulation are produced by cells other than the eggs. But the ideology says that the "germ line" controls everything, and the eggs are the germ line. In other words, genes control the organism, and eggs control the woman.

After I had written the preceding paragraphs, Jan Wilmut's success in cloning a sheep from an adult's cell was announced. Those who still argued for Weismann's genetic interpretation of the germ line will probably stop talking about it, but generally, the "germ line" advocates will keep their doctrine (as empty as it is) by acknowledging the role of the cytoplasm in differentiation. The cytoplasm of the egg is constructed with the assistance of the surrounding cells of the ovary, so the important questions regarding the production of eggs will no longer be quite so obstructed by the ideology of the "germ line."

Another idea about aging of the ovary was that "old eggs" contained "old DNA," and so were defective. This was just a derivative of the idea that aging was a genetic phenomenon, and it appears that Wilmut's cloning experiment will make that argument extremely difficult to sustain. According to two variants of this theory ("Hayflick's limit," and "telomere depletion"), the cells of an adult had exhausted their "quota" of cell divisions, and so wouldn't be able to undergo enough divisions to multiply into a new animal. The end of a dogma was mildly recognized by Professor Franklin Stahl's comment, "One often had reason to imagine that DNA suffered from irreversible changes during development." One could have imagined many things, if dogmas such as Weismann's hadn't obstructed biology for a century.

I think it will be instructive to consider the three steroid secreting glands--ovaries, testes, and adrenals--together, to see what they might have in common. In the testis, it is generally believed that pituitary gonadotropins regulate steroid synthesis and gametogenesis. In the ovaries, the gonadotropins also regulate the production of steroids, and--to some extent--the production of eggs, if not the whole gametogenic process. In the adrenal, ACTH governs the production of cortisol and sex steroids, and the transformation of the glomerulosa cell type into the other types, which secrete those hormones.

The outer layer of cells in the adrenals can form the other two cell types, and since stress-ACTH converts them to the other types, new ones must be formed. If the inner layers are removed, the whole adrenal cortex can regenerate from the outer layer. Obviously, if stress causes cells to multiply and differentiate, cells are disappearing from the inner layers.

When I was in graduate school, immunologists were aware that new cells were continually appearing in the thymus gland, but the gland didn't get bigger, and there was no visible trace of dying cells. At that time, it was considered a major puzzle, but gradually it came to be understood that a special kind of cell dissolution (called apoptosis) was occurring that accounted for the missing cells.

In the testes, apoptosis or cell-dissolution is always occurring, even though sperm cells are being produced and leaving the organ.

In the ovary, "waves" of egg cell degeneration are constantly taking place in young women. Radioactive labelling that has been used to argue that egg cells aren't being replaced seem to show that there is continual cell division in all the other ovarian cells. Interestingly, those researchers didn't seem to be interested in this apparent regeneration of the other parts of the ovary.

Apoptosis always seems to be part of a shaping process of the organ in which it occurs. Regeneration provides new cells, apoptosis recycles the substance of certain fraction of the tissue's cells. We are just starting to notice that various hormones inhibit or promote apoptosis, and so participate in the "shaping" of the organism. In many systems, it seems that the need for a cell type or function calls it into existence, while idleness makes a cell susceptible to dissolution.

I have been referring to the “pituitary gonadotropins," and deliberately avoided referring to them as LH--luteinizing hormone--and FSH--follicle stimulating hormone--because their names reflect a theory of what they do. In some textbook descriptions of testicular function, for example, it has been said that LH produces testosterone, and that negative feedback from testosterone suppresses LH, while FSH governs the formation of sperms. That description is completely worthless, and probably was largely built up by analogy with their supposedly neatly divided functions in the ovary, reflected in their names. These gonadotropins participate in the development, maintenance, and functioning of the ovaries, and their effects depend on their timing, their balance with each other and with the steroids produced by the ovaries in response to their stimulation, and their actions are modified by many other factors, ovarian, nervous, pituitary, uterine, and immunological. During youth, the system functions in a coordinated way, with ovulation as a consequence. During aging, the crucial changes appear to be a decreased ability of the ovary and the brain to produce progesterone. Thyroid hormone, cholesterol, vitamin A and efficient cellular respiration are essential factors for synthesizing progesterone. Accumulated iron, unopposed estrogen, and impaired use of cholesterol and oxygen are factors known to contribute to the widespread and variable damage to the system of coordination.

Two things can cause the pituitary to secrete excessive amounts of the gonadotropins: A deficiency of the steroids, and damage to the steroid-sensing nerves that regulate the pituitary. When an ovary is moved (transplanted into the spleen) so that its hormones are destroyed before getting to the brain, there is hypersecretion of gonadotropic hormone, and tumors develop in the ovary. The interpretation, that hypersecretion causes the tumors, is supported by other observations, e.g., that removal of one ovary increases the chance of developing a cancer in the other ovary and that prolonged use of estrogen (known to create the conditions for later hypersecretion of gonadotropin) increases the risk of ovarian cancer after menopause.

Psychologists have noticed that naming an object according to a certain function often limits the way people will be able to use it. This happens in science. If we know one function of a substance, and name it for that function, we will find it harder to think of its other possible roles. Hans Selye argued that steroids, for example, should be named according to their place of origin, rather than by a single aspect of their function. I think this applies even to the phrases "male hormone" and "female hormone": it's better to think of them in terms of their origin, and not to count on them to promote femininity or masculinity.

A note about "the female hormone." In the absence of the testicular or "male" hormones, animals differentiate as females. Recent evidence indicates that the mechanism by which testosterone masculinizes the brain requires that it be converted (in the brain) into estrogen. In this crucial event, estrogen is functioning as "the male hormone." Over the last 20 years, some types of experiment indicate that estrogen is necessary for the aggression-promoting effect of testosterone.

Progesterone is an anti-androgen, and blocks testosterone's effects. When testosterone is given to newborn or very young rats, it sets up a male pattern of hormone development, but if progesterone is given at the same time, that doesn't happen. Progesterone prevents the differentiation. away from the basic female path into the male specialization. Later in life, a deficiency of progesterone in a woman can again lead to masculinization of some features, such as musculature and facial or body hair. When progesterone is given to men in large doses, it blocks various typically male processes, such as growth of whiskers. In the brain, it has a protective function in both sexes.

Estrogen promotes cell division, and is involved in essentially every tissue, in both males and females. If it is to be called a "female hormone," maybe it also has to be called "a male hormone." It does have to be present for breast development, though it is just one of many factors. In this instance, it is contributing to feminization. In other instances, it seems to contribute to virilization.

At menopause, estrogen excess can promote the production of androgens, in the absence of progesterone, which tends to defeminize the woman. This is often a result of stress, and sometimes is a consequence of hypothyroidism. In situations of this sort, estrogen is seen not to be a feminizing hormone; it is unable to neutralize the male hormones the body produces in response to the estrogen excess.

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen, at least when it is not opposed by a very large concentration of progesterone, creates all of the conditions known to be involved in the aging process. These effects of estrogen include interference with oxidative metabolism, formation of lipofuscin (the age-pigment), retention of iron, production of free radicals and lipid peroxides, promotion of excitotoxicity and death of nerve cells, impaired learning ability, increased tendency to form blood clots and to have vascular spasms, increased autoimmunity and atrophy of the thymus, elevated prolactin, atrophy of skin, increased susceptibility to a great variety of cancers, lowered body temperature, lower serum albumin, increased tendency toward edema, and many of the features of shock. In recent years, it has been found to be responsible even for neonatal masculinization and the masculinization of the polycystic ovary syndrome. Although the pharmaceutical industry has often referred to it as "the female hormone," I don't know of any competent scientist who has ever called it that.

Since the 1930s, estrogen's toxic potential has become very clear. However, the estrogen industry doesn't want people to understand what estrogen is, because it is the source of billions of dollars per year for them. Estrogen is a shock hormone with pro-aging effects. In the 1930s and 1940s Loeb, Lipschutz, the Shutes, Selye, L.C. Strong, and others showed that it causes cancer, excessive clotting of the blood, shock, miscarriage, and tissue degeneration, but at the same time, the shills of the drug companies were promoting its use for preventing miscarriages and even for preventing the complications of pregnancy and toxemia it was known to cause.

The diuretic industry complemented the estrogen industry in its assault on pregnancy, creating a myth of pregnancy as a sodium-retention syndrome, when in fact an increased intake of salt is highly protective against the effects of excess estrogen and toxemia of pregnancy. (In hypovolemic shock, even a hypertonic salt solution is known to be therapeutic, and hypovolemia with hypoalbuminemia was clearly recognized as a feature of eclampsia). Thousands of well-meaning teachers and physicians helped to spread and perpetuate the fraudulent ideas originating with the corrupt pharmaceutical industry. (The U.S. Dept. of Justice and FBI found fraud in connection with research on diuretics, but it didn't affect the FDA's approval.) After Tom Brewer's work (which built on R. Ross' and M. B. Strauss's 1935 work, and many other studies in the 1940s and 1950s), the FDA's continued approval of those drugs could only be characterized as malfeasance. (In 1834, J. Lever recognized that malnutrition and restricted salt intake could cause eclampsia. "Cases of puerperal convulsions," Guy's Hospital Reports vol. 1, series 2, 495-517, 1843.) By 1950, there was sufficient knowledge available for controlling this disease of estrogen-excess, but the mere concept of too much estrogen was anathema to the industry-agency conspirators. This is a disturbing issue, because even in 1996, prestigious professors of medicine (NPR's "Science Friday") are pretending that toxemia and eclampsia are mysterious.

Histamine mimics estrogen's effects on the uterus, and antihistamines block estrogen's effects (Szego, 1965, Szego and Davis, 1967). Estrogen mimics the shock reaction. Stress, exercise, and toxins cause a rapid increase in estrogen. Males often have as much estrogen as females, especially when they are tired or sick. Estrogen increases the brain's susceptibility to epileptic seizures, and recent research shows that it (and cortisol) promote the effects of the "excitotoxins," which are increasingly implicated in degenerative brain diseases.

Just after Szego's work was published, I suggested that antihistamines might be used to resist some of estrogen's toxic effects, including cancer. A few people tried the idea, with some benefit, but the basic idea of a physiological counterforce is opposed by the ideology of "specific chemotherapy," in cancer, epilepsy, arthritis, infertility, osteoporosis, immunodeficiency, Alzheimer's disease, etc.

The pooling of blood in veins, a basic feature of shock, has recently become another of estrogen's "protective" features for the circulatory system--the reasoning seems to be that reduced circulation of blood makes life easier for the circulatory system. The relevant contexts, though, are the contribution this makes to the formation of blood clots, and the quality of oxygenation of all tissues.

Besides causing stress, estrogen levels are increased by stress. For example, a male runner's estrogen is often doubled after a race. Men and women who are hospitalized for serious sickness typically have greatly increased estrogen levels. Estrogen's role in terminal illness, a vicious circle in which stress decreases the person's ability to tolerate stress, is seldom appreciated. Circulatory collapse, multi-organ failure, intravascular coagulation (and the consequent depletion of fibrinogen, leading to internal bleeding) are so commonly seen in the people who die in hospitals that it would seem scandalous to suspect that estrogen could be a major contributing factor. The willingness to cover up estrogen's involvement in strokes was evident in a recent newspaper report in which a woman won a large financial settlement after her husband died from a series of strokes, caused by a pharmacy's mistakenly giving him "a female sex hormone." The mass media seem to have a "speak no evil about estrogen" policy.

Estrogen marketing involves manipulation of the mass media and the medical media. Currently, there is emphasis on appearance, heart disease, and the danger of osteoporosis. Undesirable evidence is simply ignored. I have never met a physician who had considered that estrogen might contribute to thinning of the skin and bones. Why are women's skeletons lighter than men's? This issue is sometimes noted in a tangential way (for example, see the discussions of osteoporosis and prolactin, and of prolactin and estrogen, in the Yearbook of Endocrinology, in the 1980s), but the relevant information is ignored by the influential media.

Estrogen's brain-toxic effects have been known since the 1950s, or earlier. Textbooks in the 1960s discussed experiments in which either estrogen or insulin stopped growth of the fetus's brain, and also in the 1960s experiments were showing that progesterone fosters brain growth and intelligence. Zamenhoff's work showed that the prenatal abundance of glucose is a central factor in brain growth. Since estrogen and insulin lower blood sugar, and progesterone and thyroid sustain it, Zamenhoff's work showed that the level of glucose was a common factor in many of the previous experiments, though other factors, including blood volume and body temperature, are also important. The epidemiological evidence is clear that women with toxemia of pregnancy, which involves inadequate delivery of glucose to the fetus, have babies with subnormal intelligence. Among obstetricians, it used to be common knowledge (before insulin treatment became common) that diabetic women were likely to have intellectually precocious children. As the work of Shanklin, Hodin, and the Brewers shows, there is a large group of Americans with neurological damage resulting from their mothers' treatment during pregnancy.

While I was studying the effects of light on health, many of the women with the pre- or peri-menstrual syndrome told me that they had few symptoms during the summer months, so I began in the 1960s to examine the role of progesterone in health, because its synthesis is promoted by long days. I saw that many of the sicknesses that mainly affect women had often been described as the consequence of an excess of estrogen. When animal experiments support the clinical reports and epidemiological evidence, as they do in the case of the "estrogen sicknesses," the goal of research becomes understanding the mechanisms involved, and discovering the safest way to avoid or to correct the problem. In the period between 1940 and 1960, thyroid, progesterone, and vitamins E and A had often been described as antiestrogenic substances, and some of this information persists in classical textbooks, in spite of the efforts of the drug industry to suppress the facts by giving their financial support to journals and symposia which exclude research which uses the concept of excess estrogen. For example, Goodman and Gilman's text on pharmacology discusses the ability of estrogen to make animals susceptible to seizures, and progesterone's opposing effect. One might suppose that the fact that all of the "official" approved drugs for treating epilepsy are teratogens should have been mentioned at that point, so that it would be brought to the attention of physicians that they had the option of using natural hormones to prevent seizures during pregnancy, instead of making women choose between having a baby with birth defects, or having seizures during pregnancy. But that is not how the subject of epilepsy is presented to medical students.

It turns out that the meaning of "excess estrogen" has to be interpreted in relation to the balance of estrogen (and the multitude of factors which mimic estrogen's effects) with all of the antiestrogen factors. I have concentrated on thyroid, progesterone, and red light as the most important factors that protect against estrogen, and these all turn out to be protective against stress, shock, ionizing radiation, free radicals, lipid peroxidation, thymic atrophy, osteoporosis, arthritis, scleroderma, apoptotic cell death, and other problems that are involved in tissue degeneration or aging.

**RAY PEAT:** "As the result of industrial promotion, including product advertising and grants for research, “weak estrogens" and "antioxidants" derived from soy are being discussed as means to prevent breast and prostate cancer, heart disease, stress and aging. Japanese women used to be very free of breast cancer, and when their children grew up in the U-S., their incidence of the disease was like that of Americans. How odd that the soybean should be singled out for responsibility. Japanese breast cancer incidence has risen sharply in recent years. Did they stop eating tofu? Did their traditional use of seaweed as food have nothing to do with their health? Did the traditional home-bound isolation of Japanese women, their avoidance of smoking and drinking, have no effect on hormones and cancer? Their calorie intake? Iodine and trace minerals? What types of protein and fat, in what quantities, did they use?"

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to the promotion of soy-derived products and their purported health benefits.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another so-called weak estrogen, estriol, is being promoted by drug companies for the “alternative medical" market, with the circulation of an editorial from JAMA, recommending it for preventing breast cancer. A review of the use of estrogens reported in JAMA (only up to 1987) found nearly 200 different "indications" for its use. (Palmlund, 1996.) Using the conservative language of that journal, such use could be said to constitute wildly irresponsible "empirical" medical practice. More appropriate language could be used."

**CONTEXT:** The conversation continues to critique the promotion of "weak estrogens" like estriol.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pollution of the environment and food supply by estrogenic chemicals is getting increased attention. Early in the study of estrogens, it was noticed that soot, containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was both estrogenic and carcinogenic. Since then, it has been found that phenolics and chlorinated hydrocarbons are significantly estrogenic, and that many estrogenic herbicides, pesticides, and industrial by-products persist in the environment, causing infertility, deformed reproductive organs, tumors, and other biological defects, including immunodeficiency. {n the Columbia River, a recent study found that about 25% of the otters and muskrats were anatomically deformed. Estrogenic pollution kills birds, panthers, alligators, old men, young women, fish, seals, babies, and ecosystems. Some of these chemicals are sprayed on forests by the US Department of Agriculture, where they enter lakes, underwater aquifers, rivers, and oceans. Private businesses spray them on farms and orchards, or put them into the air as smoke or vapors, or dump them directly into rivers. Homeowners put them on their lawns and gardens. Natural estrogens, from human urine, enter the rivers from sewage. Many tons of synthetic and pharmaceutical estrogens, administered to menopausal women in quantities much larger than their bodies ever produced metabolically, are being added to the rivers. In the same way that weak estrogens in the environment may become hundreds of times more estrogenic by synergistic interactions (J. A. McLachlan, et al., Science, June 7, 1996), combinations of natural, medical, dietary, and environmental estrogens are almost certain to have unexpected results. The concept of a "protective estrogen" is very similar to the idea of "protective mutagens" or "protective carcinogens," though in the case of estrogens, their promoters don't even know what the normal, natural functions of estrogen are."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion shifts to environmental estrogenic pollution and its widespread effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "In November, 1995, an international conference was held to study the problem of "Environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals," and to devise strategies for increasing public awareness of the seriousness of the problem. Their "Statement from the work session" says "New evidence is especially worrisome because it underscores the exquisite sensitivity of the developing nervous system to chemical perturbations that result in functional abnormalities.". "This work session was convened because of the growing concern that failure to confront the problem could have major economic and societal implications." "We are certain of the following: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can undermine neurological and behavioral development and subsequent potential of individuals....". "Because the endocrine system is sensitive to perturbation, it is a likely target for disturbance". "Man-made endocrine-disrupting chemicals range across all continents and oceans. They are found in native populations from the Arctic to the tropics, and, because of their persistence in the body, can be passed from generation to generation." "...many endocrine-disrupting contaminants, even if less potent than the natural products, are present in living tissue at concentrations millions of times higher than the natural hormones." "The developing brain exhibits specific and often narrow windows during which exposure to endocrine disruptors can produce permanent changes in its structure and function."

**CONTEXT:** The severity of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and their impact on the developing nervous system is highlighted.

**RAY PEAT:** "In spite of this increased exposure to estrogens, there is a new wave of advertising of estrogenic substances, based on the idea that weak estrogens will provide protection against strong estrogens. The environmental background of estrogenic pollution already provides a continuous estrogenic exposure. In the 1940s, Alexander Lipshuts demonstrated that a continuous, weak estrogenic stimulus was immensely effective in producing, first fibromas, then cancer, in one organ after another, and the effect was not limited to the reproductive system. How is it possible that the idea of "protection" from a weak estrogen seems convincing to so many? Isn't this the same process that we saw when the nuclear industry promoted Luckey's doctrine of "radiation hormesis," literally the claim that "a little radiation is positively good for us"?"

**CONTEXT:** The promotion of "weak estrogens" as protective agents is questioned, drawing a parallel to the concept of radiation hormesis.

**RAY PEAT:** "DES (diethyl stilbestrol) is one of the most notorious estrogens, because studies in humans revealed that its use during pregnancy not only caused cancer, miscarriages, blood clots, etc., in the women who used it, but also caused cancer, infertility, and deformities in their children, and even in their grandchildren. (But those transgenerational effects are not unique to it.) Besides the absurd use of DES to prevent miscarriages, around 1950 it was also used to treat vulvovaginitis in little girls, for menstrual irregularity at puberty, to treat sterility, dysfunctional bleeding, endometriosis, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, migraine headaches, nausea and vomiting, and painful breast engorgement or severe bleeding after childbirth."

**CONTEXT:** The history and severe consequences of DES use are detailed.

**RAY PEAT:** "DES is a "weak" estrogen, in the sense that it doesn't compete with natural estrogens for the “estrogen receptors." (Estriol binds more strongly to receptors than DES does: "Cytosolic and nuclear estrogen receptors in the genital tract of the rhesus monkey," J. Steroid Bioch. 8(2), 151-155, 1977.) Pills formerly contained from 5 to 250 mg. of DES. The 1984 PDR lists doses for hypogonadism and ovarian failure as 0.2 to 0.5 mg. daily. In general, dosage of estrogens decreased by a factor of 100 after the 1960s."

**CONTEXT:** The definition of DES as a "weak" estrogen and its dosage changes are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "An aggressively stupid editorial by Alvin H. Follingstad, from the Jan. 2, 1978, issue of JAMA, pages 29-30, "Estriol, the forgotten estrogen?" is being circulated to promote the use of estriol, or the phytoestrogens. It argues that women who secrete larger amounts of estriol are resistant to cancer. By some tests, estriol is a "weak estrogen," by others it is a powerful estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** An editorial promoting estriol and phytoestrogens is criticized.

**RAY PEAT:** "When estriol was placed in the uterus of a rabbit, only 1.25 meg. was sufficient to prevent implantation and destroy the blastocyst. (Dmowski, et al., 1977.) Since the effect was local, the body weight of the animal doesn't make much difference, when thinking about the probable effect of a similar local contentration of the hormone on human tissues. The anti-progestational activity of estriol and estradiol are approximately the same. (Tamotsu and Pincus, 1958.)"

**CONTEXT:** The abortifacient and anti-progestational effects of estriol in rabbits are presented.

**RAY PEAT:** "When 5 mg. of estriol was given to women intravaginally, this very large dose suppressed LH within 2 hours, and suppressed FSH in 5 hours. Given orally, 8 mg. had similar effects on LH and FSH after 30 days, and also had an estrogenic effect on the vaginal epithelium.. These quick systemic effects of a "weak estrogen" are essentially those of a strong estrogen, except for the size of the dose. (Schiff, et al., 1978.) When administered subcutaneously, estriol induced abortions and stillbirths (Velardo, et al.)"

**CONTEXT:** The systemic hormonal effects of estriol in women are detailed, demonstrating its potency.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another indication of the strength of an estrogen is its ability to cause the uterus to enlarge. Estriol is slightly weaker, in terms of milligrams required to cause a certain rate of uterine enlargement, than estradiol. (Clark, et al., 1979.) But isn't the important question whether or not the weak estrogen imitates all of the effects of estradiol, including carcinogenesis and blood clotting, in addition to any special harmful effects it might have?"

**CONTEXT:** The uterine-enlarging effect of estriol is compared to estradiol, raising questions about its overall impact.

**RAY PEAT:** "When added to long-term culture of human breast cancer cells, estriol stimulated their growth, and overcame the antiestrogenic effects of tamoxifen, even at concentrations hundreds of times lower than that of tamoxifen. "The data do not support an antiestrogenic role for estriol in human breast cancer." (Lippman, et al., 1977.)"

**CONTEXT:** Estriol's role in stimulating breast cancer cell growth is presented.

**RAY PEAT:** "Studies of the urinary output of estriol/estradiol in women with or without breast cancer do not reliably show the claimed association between low estriol/estradiol and cancer, and the stimulating effect of estriol on the growth of cancer cells suggests that any alteration of the estrogen ratio is likely to be a consequence of the disease, rather than a cause. The conversion of estradiol to other estrogens occurs mainly in the liver, in the non-pregnant woman, as does the further metabolism of the estrogens into glucuronides and sulfates. The hormonal conditions leading to and associated with breast cancer all affect the liver and its metabolic systems. The hydroxylating enzymes are also affected by toxins. Hypothyroidism (low T3), low progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, etiocholanolone, and high prolactin, growth hormone, and cortisol are associated with the chronic high estrogen and breast cancer physiologies, and modify the liver's regulatory ability."

**CONTEXT:** The relationship between urinary estrogen ratios, liver metabolism, and breast cancer is explored.

**RAY PEAT:** "The decreased output of hormones when the fetal-placental system is dying is a natural consequence, since the placenta produces hormones, and during pregnancy converts estradiol to estriol. Since estradiol in excess kills the fetus, its conversion by the placenta to estriol is in accord with the evidence showing that estriol is the more quickly excreted form. (G. S. Rao, 1973.) The conversion of 16-hydroxy androstenedione and 16-hydroxy-DHEA into estriol by the placenta (Vega Ramos, 1973) would also cause fetal exhaustion or death to result in lower estriol production. But a recent observation that a surge of estriol production precedes the onset of labor, and that its premature occurrence can identify women at risk of premature delivery (McGregor, et al, 1995) suggests that the estriol surge might reflect the mother's increased production of adrenal androgens during stress. (This would be analogous to the situation in the polycystic ovary syndrome, in which excessive estradiol drives the adrenals to produce androgens.)"

**CONTEXT:** The role of the placenta in converting estradiol to estriol and the implications for fetal health are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estetrol, which has one more hydroxyl group than estriol, is a "more sensitive and reliable indicator of fetal morbidity than estriol during toxemic pregnancies," because it starts to decrease earlier, or decreases more, than estriol. (Kundu, et al., 1978.) This seems to make it even clearer that the decline of estriol is a consequence, not a cause, of fetal sickness or death."

**CONTEXT:** Estetrol is presented as a more sensitive indicator of fetal morbidity than estriol.

**RAY PEAT:** "A 1994 publication (B. Zumoff, "Hormonal profiles in women with breast cancer," Obstet. Gynecol. Clin. North. Am. (U.S.) 21(4), 751-772) reported that there are four hormonal features in women with breast cancer: diminished androgen production, luteal inadequacy, increased 16-hydroxylation of estradiol, and increased prolactin. The 16-hydroxylation converts estradiol into estriol."

**CONTEXT:** Hormonal profiles associated with breast cancer are outlined, including the conversion of estradiol to estriol.

**RAY PEAT:** "A new. technique for radiographically locating a hormone-dependent breast cancer is based on the fact that estriol-sulfate is a major metabolite of estradiol. The technique showed the tumor to have about a six times higher concentration of estriol-sulfate than liver or muscle. (N. Shimura, et al., "Specific imaging of hormone-dependent mammary carcinoma in nude mice with ['*'l]-anti-estriol 3-sulfate antibody," Nucl. Med. Biol. (England) 22(5), 547-553, 1995.)"

**CONTEXT:** A new technique for locating hormone-dependent breast cancer using estriol-sulfate is described.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another association of elevated conversion of estradiol to estriol with disease was found to occur in men who had a myocardial infarction, compared to controls who hadn't. (W. S. Bauld, et al., 1957.)"

**CONTEXT:** Elevated conversion of estradiol to estriol is linked to myocardial infarction in men.

**RAY PEAT:** "The estrogens in clover have been known for several decades to have a contraceptive action in sheep, and other phytoestrogens are known to cause deformities in the genitals, feminization of men, and anatomical changes in the brain as well as functional masculinization of the female brain. (Register, et al., 1995; Levy, et al, 1995; Clarkson, et al., 1995; Gavaler, et al., 1995.) The effects of the phytoestrogens are very complex, because they modify the sensitivity of cells to natural estrogens, and also modify the metabolism of estrogens, with the result that the effects on a given tissue can be either pro-estrogenic and anti-estrogenic. For example, the flavonoids, naringenin, quercetin and kaempherol (kaempherol is an antioxidant, a phytoestrogen, and a mutagen) modify the metabolism of estradiol, causing increased bioavailability of both estrone and_ estradiol. (W. Schubert, et al. "Inhibition of 17-beta-estradiol metabolism by grapefruit juice in ovariectomized women,” Maturitas (Ireland) 30(2-3), 155-163, 1994.)"

**CONTEXT:** The effects of phytoestrogens, including their contraceptive and teratogenic properties, are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since phenolic compounds often function as "antioxidants," as well as estrogens, we are seeing an epidemic of marketing claims for plant substances that are “better than vitamin E" and “better than Premarin," but something that these super-antioxidants have in common with all estrogens is that they are easily oxidized, forming cycles of oxidation-reduction that consume oxygen, waste energy, and produce immense quantities of free radicals, causing genetic damage as well as other changes. That the damage might lead to cancer or seizures is bad enough, but the awful thing is that some of the changes are passed on in heredity, as cancer, or anatomical or neurological abnormalities.. L.C. Strong pioneered in the study of the hereditary toxicity of estrogen, generations ago, and transgenerational effects have been seen with DES and other estrogens."

**CONTEXT:** Phenolic compounds, while marketed as antioxidants, can also act as estrogens and contribute to oxidative damage and hereditary toxicity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Why do plants make phytoestrogens? There is some information indicating that these compounds evolved to regulate the plants' interactions with other organisms--to attract bacteria, or to repel insects, for example, rather than just as pigment-forming materials. (Baker, 1995.) The fact that some of them bind to our “estrogen receptors" is probably misleading, because of their many other effects, including inhibiting enzyme functions involved in the regulation of steroids and prostaglandins. Their biochemistry in animals is much more complicated than that of natural estrogens, which is itself so complicated that we can only guess what the consequences might be when we change the concentration and the ratio of substances in that complex system. (See quotation from Velardo, et al., page 6)"

**CONTEXT:** The evolutionary purpose of phytoestrogens and their complex biochemical interactions are explored.

**RAY PEAT:** "These "natural" effects in sheep were forerunners of the observed estrogenic effects in wild animals, caused by pollutants. Twenty-five years ago I reviewed many of the issues of estrogen's toxicity, and the ubiquity of estrogenic substances, and since then have regularly spoken about it, but I haven't concentrated much attention on the phytoestrogens, because we can usually just choose foods that are relatively free of them. They are so often associated with other food toxins--antithyroid factors, inhibitors of digestive enzymes, immunosuppressants, etc.--that the avoidance of certain foods is desirable. Recently an advocate of soybeans said "if they inhibit the thyroid, why isn't there an epidemic of hypothyroidism in Asia?" I happened to hear this right after seeing newspaper articles about China's problem with 100,000,000 cretins; yes, Asia has endemic hypothyroidism, and beans are widely associated with hypothyroidism."

**CONTEXT:** The connection between phytoestrogens, pollutants, and hypothyroidism is discussed, with a specific example of Asian populations.

**RAY PEAT:** "When I first heard about clover-induced miscarriages in sheep, | began reading about the subject, because it was relevant to the work | was doing at that time on reproductive aging. Sheep which are adapted to living at high altitude, where all animals have reduced fertility, have an adaptive type of hemoglobin, with a greater affinity for oxygen. Fetal hemoglobin, in animals at sea-level, has a great affinity for oxygen, making it possible for the fetus to get enough oxygen, despite its insulation from the mother's direct blood supply. The high-altitude-tolerant sheep have hemoglobin which is able to deliver sufficient oxygen to the uterus to meet the needs of the embryo/fetus, even during relative oxygen-deprivation. These sheep are able to sustain pregnancy while grazing on clover. It seemed evident that estrogen and high altitude had something in common, namely, oxygen deprivation, and it also seemed evident that these sheep provided the explanation for estrogen's abortifacient effects."

**CONTEXT:** The abortifacient effects of estrogen are linked to oxygen deprivation, drawing parallels with high-altitude adaptation in sheep.

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen's effects, ranging from shock to cancer, all seem to relate to an interference with the use of oxygen. Different estrogens have different affinities for various tissues, and a given substance is likely to have effects other than estrogenicity, and the presence of other substances will modify the way a tissue responds, but the stressful shift away from oxidative production of energy is the factor that all estrogens have in common. Otherwise, how could suffocation and x-irradiation have estrogenic effects?"

**CONTEXT:** The common mechanism of estrogen's diverse effects is proposed to be interference with oxygen utilization and oxidative energy production.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pharmaceutical misrepresentations regarding the estrogens rank, in terms of human consequences, with the radiation damage from fall-out from bomb tests and reactor-leaks, with industrial pollution, with degradation of the food supply--with genocide, in fact. Advertising gets a bad name when it can't be distinguished from mass murder. At a certain point, we can't afford to waste our time making subtle distinctions between ignorance and malevolence. If we begin pointing out the lethal consequences of "stupid" or quasi-stupid commercial/governmental policies, the offenders will have the burden of proving that their actions are the result of irresponsible ignorance, rather than criminal duplicity. From the tobacco senators to the chemical/pharmaceutical/food/energy industries and their agents in the governmental agencies, those who do great harm must be held responsible."

**CONTEXT:** The author expresses strong criticism of pharmaceutical misrepresentations and corporate/governmental policies related to estrogens, equating their consequences to mass murder.

**RAY PEAT:** "The idea of corporate welfare, in which public funds are given in massive subsidies to rich corporations, is now generally recognized. Next, we have to increase our consciousness of corporate responsibility, and that ordinary criminal law, especially RICO, can be directly applied to corporations. It remains to be seen whether a government can be made to stop giving public funds to corporations, and instead, to begin enforcing the law against them--and against those in the agencies who participated in their crimes."

**CONTEXT:** The concept of corporate welfare and the need for corporate responsibility and legal accountability are discussed.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the U.S., the death penalty is sometimes reserved for “aggravated homicide." If those who kill hundreds of thousands for the sake of billions of dollars in profits are not committing aggravated homicide, then it must be that no law written in the English language can be objectively interpreted, and the legal system is an Alice in Wonderland convenience for the corporate state."

**CONTEXT:** The author argues for holding corporations accountable for harm caused by their profit-driven actions, questioning the legal system's definition of "aggravated homicide."

**RAY PEAT:** "For example, it can cure depression, improve immunity, stimulate our metabolism while decreasing food craving, and increase our intelligence."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about the benefits of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although exposure to sun does contribute to aging of the skin, people who spend years working outdoors have a reduced incidence of cancer of internal organs. For many years, it has been known that the death rate increases during the winter months and also increases at night (winter or summer). Most deaths occur just before dawn when the body is in its least efficient state. It is just in the last few decades that we have been learning the reasons for this beneficial effect of light. It turns out that daylight stimulates our ability to use oxygen for energy production, and protects our tissues from some of the free-radical toxins that are produced by normal metabolism, by stress, or by radiation."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about the benefits of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "While ultraviolet light, and even blue light, tend to suppress our cells' ability to produce energy, those types of light penetrate only a short distance into living tissue, and so it is mainly the skin which is damaged by too much sunlight. Since blood does circulate in the layers of skin which receive ultraviolet rays, prolonged sun exposure can damage the immune system by injuring white blood cells, but usually the stimulating effect of the other types of light that penetrate more deeply offset this effect on the immune system."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about the benefits of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many health food stores are now selling melatonin, to induce sleep and "prevent cancer." They have taken some information out of context, and don't realize how dangerous melatonin is. It makes the brain sluggish, causes the sex organs to shrink, and damages immunity by shrinking the thymus gland. It suppresses thyroid and progesterone, and increases estrogen. It is the hormone of darkness and winter, and is produced by the pineal gland by any stress which increases adrenalin. Adequate sunlight suppresses the formation of melatonin."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about the benefits of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "This means that the immune system is most responsive in the summer, when days are long. Daylight stops the stress reaction, and protects our immune system."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about the benefits of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "Long hours of daylight increase progesterone production, and this contributes to a sense of well-being, and to the protection of all our tissues,"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about the benefits of sunlight.

**RAY PEAT:** "This effect is variable, and depends on our hormones and diet."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether sun exposure ages you.

**RAY PEAT:** "The unsaturated oils have been identified as a major factor in skin aging. For example, two groups of rabbits were fed diets containing either corn oil or coconut oil, and their backs were shaved, so sunlight could fall directly onto their skin. The animals that ate corn oil developed prematurely wrinkled skin, while the animals that ate coconut oil didn't show any harm from the sun exposure. In a study at the University of California, photographs of two groups of people were selected, pairing people of the same age, one who had eaten an unsaturated fat rich diet, the other who had eaten a diet low in unsaturated fats. A panel of judges was asked to sort them by their apparent ages, and the subjects who consumed larger amounts of the unsaturated oils were consistently judged to be older than those who ate less, showing the same age-accelerating effects of the unsaturated oils that were demonstrated by the rabbit experiments."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether sun exposure ages you.

**RAY PEAT:** "While it is important to avoid overexposure to ultraviolet light, the skin damage that we identify with aging is largely a product of our diet."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether sun exposure ages you.

**RAY PEAT:** "The type of skin cancer which is clearly caused by sunlight is a relatively harmless type of cancer, which appears only in sun-damaged skin. Melanoma, which is often called a skin cancer, because it sometimes begins in moles, does not have such a simple relationship to sunlight, and its incidence is significantly increased by the use of estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about avoiding sunlight due to skin cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "It is often said that the great increase in deaths from melanoma during the last 60 years has been caused by an increased popularity of sunbathing, but during the same time there has been a great increase in the incidence of cancer of the prostate, which is in a location that gets very little exposure to light. What these two cancers have in common is a sensitivity to estrogen, and it is during this same period of time that we have been exposed to increased amounts of estrogen-like chemicals in the environment as a result of industrial pollution: Dioxins, phenols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, DDT, smoke, etc. It is likely that these cancers (and others) are caused by the estrogenic pollutants."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about avoiding sunlight due to skin cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "The incidence of melanoma is consistently lower at greater elevations, where ultraviolet light is more intense, than at lower elevations. It is common for melanoma to develop on relatively shaded areas, including the middle of the back and the inside of the thigh, unlike the ordinary less malignant skin cancers, which develop most often on the forehead, nose, ear, cheek, and lip, where sun exposure is greatest. People who work outside have a low incidence of melanoma according to some studies, and this is sometimes said to be because they don't get sunburned, as pale people do when they spend time in the sun after being indoors for long periods. Sunburn does cause freckling, which is a clumping of pigment cells, but recent studies show that children who get sunburned are not at increased risk for melanoma. Sunburn causes complex changes in the tissue, including weakened immunity."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about avoiding sunlight due to skin cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "To avoid the aging and immunosuppressive effects of sunlight, it seems best for sunlight to come through a window glass which removes most of the ultraviolet light, and some of the blue light. Plastic film is available which contains copper that removes this harmful .part of sunlight, and can be applied to ordinary window glass. Sitting in sunlight coming through a window of this sort, for short times during the day, is very protective. Besides protecting against cancer, it helps to keep the mood and energy level high, by keeping melatonin low and stimulating metabolism."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about avoiding sunlight due to skin cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "Recently, the polyunsaturated oils have been identified as the main thing in cells that radiation interacts with, to cause cellular damage. Vitamin E, taken internally or even applied to the skin, has been found to reduce the damage produced by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which is logical, since it interrupts the chain reactions of toxic free-radicals produced when unsaturated oils are oxidized by radiation or other injury. Aspirin has been found to have a similar effect in reducing the harmful effects which develop in the skin after sunlight over-exposure. Coconut oil has been used for generations in "suntan lotions," and whether it is absorbed through the skin or eaten as a food, it clearly has a protective antioxidant function. Carotene seems to work with vitamin E in the skin to reduce injury by ultraviolet radiation. Caffeine also has shown a protective action against radiation, but its mechanism of action isn't clearly understood."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about avoiding sunlight due to skin cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "If a sunscreen lotion is based on the use of an opaque reflective material, such as zinc oxide or titanium oxide, that substance remains mostly on the surface of the skin. This should make it fairly harmless, though it is possible that traces of titanium could be absorbed with oils into the skin, where it could be made toxic by interaction with ultraviolet rays. However, other chemicals used in the sunscreen lotions, such as PABA derivatives, also react dangerously with light, and are easily absorbed in significant quantities into the deeper layers of the skin, where they can cause mutations."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why not use sun-blockers.

**RAY PEAT:** "For example, several recent studies have found that the sun-blockers, which decrease the ordinary skin damage caused by ultraviolet rays, actually increase the risk of developing melanoma, by causing mutations when the cells’ chromosomes interact with the sunscreen and the light. (Something similar happens in the disease, porphyria. A pigment that accumulates causes the skin to become very sensitive to the sun. Estrogen is known to intensify the disease.) Even natural colored compounds, which have sometimes been used in suntan lotions, should be avoided, since they might be able to transmit the energy of light to the chromosomes, causing mutations."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why not use sun-blockers.

**RAY PEAT:** "Radiation from the sun reacts with the unsaturated fats you have eaten to cause oxidative damage to skin cells. Vitamin E, vitamin A and carotene are antioxidants that prevent skin cell damage, when they are taken internally or applied to the surface of the skin.. None of these causes any harmful effects in the sun. Aspirin reduces the iron content of the blood serum, and also inhibits the formation of the sometimes-toxic prostaglandins from fatty acids. Coconut oil is very resistant to radiation damage and, like vitamin E, tends to stop the chain reactions that occur in unsaturated fats. The old formula for suntan oil, cocount oil with iodine, might turn out to be a safe sunscreen, since the brown iodine absorbs light, as other "U.V. blockers" do, but iodine is also an effective chain breaker that inactivates free radicals, and it can't be absorbed into cells in its brown form. It doesn't have the potential for causing cancer that the popular sunscreens do."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why not use sun-blockers.

**RAY PEAT:** "The popular chemical sun blockers are meant to stop the ultraviolet rays. If they can do that, without increasing the risk of melanoma, then they are very beneficial, because this will allow you to get a long exposure to direct sunlight, which penetrates deeply and has an antistress effect. But so far, there is no research that shows any of the chemical ultraviolet blockers is safe."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether sunlight is still beneficial if you use a safe sun blocker.

**RAY PEAT:** "Nights are much longer in the winter, and even in the summer, death rates are higher during the night than in daytime. December 21 is the day with the fewest hours of sunlight, but the cumulative damage of prolonged darkness reaches its peak about a month later. Cold temperatures do have some harmful effects, but by keeping people indoors, or bundled up in thick clothing, cold weather also causes us to get very little exposure to sunlight. Winter sickness is mainly the result of a "light deficiency.""

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why people get sicker in the wintertime.

**RAY PEAT:** "When young sailors spent 6 months in the continuous polar night of Antarctica, they developed the same signs of nocturnal stress that are common in old people during the night. Many old people habitually get up before dawn, because they find it impossible to stay asleep. Even healthy young people (and animals) experience some degree of nocturnal stress as soon as the light is turned off at night, and their body responds with an increased production of adrenalin and cortisol."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why people get sicker in the wintertime.

**RAY PEAT:** "The energy-producing part of cells, the mitochondrion, shows signs of being increasingly damaged as the night progresses, but they are gradually restored to their normal condition during the daytime light hours. This means that our greatest ability to resist stress is in the late afternoon, and we are most susceptible to injury at dawn. In the winter, nights are long and days are short, so we experience a cumulative increase in our susceptibility to stress-injury during the winter months."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why people get sicker in the wintertime.

**RAY PEAT:** "The light which penetrates deeply into our tissues (mainly orange and red light) is able to improve the efficiency of energy production, and to suppress the toxic free-radicals that are always being formed in cells."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why people get sicker in the wintertime.

**RAY PEAT:** "No, many of the beneficial effects of bright light disappear during just a few hours of darkness, though the restoration of our tissues that happens during the summer puts us into a better state for surviving the winter, for example by allowing massive regeneration of the thymus to occur. (This occurs in adults, not just in children. The idea that the thymus disappears after puberty is based on autopsies. If a person lives for even 3 hours after an accident or the onset of sickness, the thymus has had time to shrink.)"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether you can get enough sunlight during the summer to hold you through the winter.

**RAY PEAT:** "Frequent short exposures to bright light is almost as valuable as continuous sunlight, and it is less likely to cause skin aging."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how much sunlight we need a day for general health.

**RAY PEAT:** "If artificial light is bright enough, it is as effective as sunlight at stopping the stress reaction, but people seldom use lights that are bright enough. Generally, people and animals are healthier when days are longer than 12 hours, that is, after March 21 and before September 20. When days are shorter than 12 hours, artificial lights should be used from sunset until bedtime, but the greatest brightness probably doesn't have to be continuous. Studies on isolated organs and tissues suggest that a few seconds of penetrating bright light are enought to break the free radical chain reactions, slowing the production of toxic substances, which tend to increase in concentration during nocturnal stress. A few seconds’ exposure to the direct light of ten 150 Watt incandescent bulbs, for just a few minutes every two or three hours, might provide more effective protection than continuous exposure to a single 100 Watt light."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how much sunlight we need a day for general health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Mainly, I'm referring to soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil, canola, sesame oil, sunflower seed oil, palm oil, and any others that are labeled as "unsaturated" or "polyunsaturated." Almond oil, which is used in many cosmetics, is very unsaturated."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what vegetable oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Chemically, the material that makes these oils very toxic is the polyunsaturated fat itself. These unsaturated oils are found in very high concentrations in many seeds, and in the fats of animals that have eaten a diet containing them. The fresh oils, whether cold pressed or consumed as part of the living plant material, are intrinsically toxic, and it is not any special industrial treatment that makes them toxic. Since these oils occur in other parts of plants at lower concentration, and in the animals which eat the plants, it is impossible to eat a diet which lacks them, unless special foods are prepared in the laboratory."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what vegetable oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "These toxic oils are sometimes called the "essential fatty acids" or "vitamin F," but this concept of the oils as essential nutrients was clearly disproved over 50 years ago."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what vegetable oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Linoleic and linolenic acids, the "essential fatty acids," and other polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are now fed to pigs to fatten them, in the form of corn and soy beans, cause the animals' fat to be chemically equivalent to vegetable oil. In the late 1940s, chemical toxins were used to suppress the thyroid function of pigs, to make them get fatter while consuming less food. When that was found to be carcinogenic, it was then found that corn and soy beans had the same antithyroid effect, causing the animals to be fattened at low cost. The animals' fat becomes chemically similar to the fats in their food, causing it to be equally toxic, and equally fattening."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what vegetable oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "These oils are derived from seeds, but their abundance in some meat has led to a lot of confusion about "animal fats." Many researchers still refer to lard as a "saturated fat," but this is simply incorrect when pigs are fed soybeans and corn."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what vegetable oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ultimately, all systems of the body are harmed by an excess of these oils. There are two reasons for this. One is that the plants produce the oils for protection, not only to store energy for the germination of the seed. To defend the seeds from the animals that would eat them, the oils block the digestive enzymes in the animals' stomachs. Digestion is one of our most basic functions, and evolution has built many other systems by using variations of that system; as a result, all of these systems are damaged by the substances which damage the digestive system."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how these oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "The other reason is that the seeds are designed to germinate in early spring, so their energy stores must be accessible when the temperatures are cool, and they normally don't have to remain viable through the hot summer months. Unsaturated oils are liquid when they are cold, and this is necessary for any organism that lives at low temperatures. For example, fish in cold water would be stiff if they contained saturated fats. These oils easily get rancid (spontaneously oxidizing) when they are warm and exposed to oxygen. Seeds contain a small amount of vitamin E to delay rancidity. When the oils are stored in our tissues, they are much warmer, and more directly exposed to oxygen, than they would be in the seeds, and so their tendency to oxidize is very great. These oxidative processes can damage enzymes and other parts of cells, and especially their ability to produce energy."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how these oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "The enzymes which break down proteins are inhibited by unsaturated fats, and these enzymes are needed not only for digestion, but also for production of thyroid hormones, clot removal, immunity, and the general adaptability of cells. The risks of abnormal blood clotting, inflammation, immune deficiency, shock, aging, obesity, and cancer are increased. Thyroid and progesterone are decreased. Since the unsaturated oils block protein digestion in the stomach, we can be malnourished even while "eating well.""

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how these oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "Plants produce many protective substances to repel or injure insects and other animals that eat them. They produce their own pesticides. The oils in seeds have this function. On top of this natural toxicity, the plants are sprayed with industrial pesticides, which can concentrate in the seed oils."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how these oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "It isn't the quantity of these polyunsaturated oils which governs the harm they do, but the relationship between them and the saturated fats. Obesity, free radical production, the formation of age pigment, blood clotting, inflammation, immunity, and energy production are all responsive to the ratio of unsaturated fats to saturated fats, and the higher this ratio is, the greater the probability of harm there is."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how these oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are interesting interactions between these oils and estrogen. For example, puberty occurs at an earlier age if estrogen is high, or if these oils are more abundant in the diet. This is probably a factor in the development of cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how these oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "All systems of the body are harmed by an excess of these oils. There are three main kinds of damage: one, hormonal imbalances, two, damage to the immune system, and three, oxidative damage."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how these oils are hazardous to health.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are many changes in hormones caused by unsaturated fats. Their best understood effect is their interference with the function of the thyroid gland. Unsaturated oils block thyroid hormone secretion, its movement in the circulatory system, and the response of tissues to the hormone. When the thyroid hormone is deficient, the body is generally exposed to increased levels of estrogen. The thyroid hormone is essential for making the "protective hormones” progesterone and pregnenolone, so these hormones are lowered when anything interferes with the function of the thyroid. The thyroid hormone is required for using and eliminating cholesterol, so cholesterol is likely to be raised by anything which blocks the thyroid function. [B. Barnes and L. Galton, Hypothyroidism, 1976, and 1994 references. ]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how they cause hormonal imbalances.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vegetable oil is recognized as a drug for knocking out the immune system. Vegetable oil emulsions were used to nourish cancer patients, but it was discovered that the unsaturated oils were suppressing their immune systems. The same products, in which vegetable oil is emulsified with water for intravenous injection, are now marketed specifically for the purpose of suppressing immunity in patients who have had organ transplants. Using the oils in foods has the same harmful effect on the immune system. [E. A. Mascioli, et al.,Lipids 22(6) 421, 1987.] Unsaturated fats directly kill white blood cells. [C. J. Meade and J. Martin, Adv. Lipid Res., 127, 1978.]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how they damage the immune system.

**RAY PEAT:** "Unsaturated oils get rancid when exposed to air; that is called oxidation, and it is the same process that occurs when oil paint "dries." Free radicals are produced in the process. This process is accelerated at higher temperatures. The free radicals produced in this process react with parts of cells, such as molecules of DNA and protein and may become attached to those molecules, causing abnormalities of structure and function."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how they cause oxidative damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "Even without the addition of agricultural chemicals, an excess of unsaturated vegetable oils damages the human body. Cancer can't occur, unless there are unsaturated oils in the diet. [C. Ip, et al., Cancer Res. 45, 1985.] Alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver cannot occur unless there are unsaturated oils in the diet. [Nanji and French, Life Sciences. 44, 1989. ] Heart disease can be produced by unsaturated oils, and prevented by adding saturated oils to the diet. [J. K. G. Kramer, et al., Lipids 17, 372, 1983.]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about eating only organically grown vegetable oils.

**RAY PEAT:** "Coconut and olive oil are the only vegetable oils that are really safe, but butter and lamb fat, which are highly saturated, are generally very safe (except when the animals have been poisoned). Coconut oil is unique in its ability to prevent weight-gain or cure obesity, by stimulating metabolism. It is quickly metabolized, and functions in some ways as an antioxidant. Olive oil, though it is somewhat fattening, is less fattening than corn or soy oil, and contains an antioxidant which makes it protective against heart disease and cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what oils are safe.

**RAY PEAT:** "Israel had the world's highest incidence of breast cancer when they allowed the insecticide lindane to be used in dairies, and the cancer rate decreased immediately after the government prohibited its use. The United States has fairly good laws to control the use of cancer-causing agents in the food supply, but they are not vigorously enforced. Certain cancers are several times more common among corn farmers than among other farmers, presumably because corn "requires" the use of more pesticides. This probably makes corn oil's toxicity greater than it would be otherwise, but even the pure, organically grown material is toxic, because of its intrinsic unsaturation."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what oils are safe.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the United States, lard is toxic because the pigs are fed large quantities of corn and soy beans. Besides the intrinsic toxicity of the seed oils, they are contaminated with agricultural chemicals. Corn farmers have a very high incidence of cancer, presumably because of the pesticides they use on their crop."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what oils are safe.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although I don't recommend "palm oil" as a food, because I think it is less stable than coconut oil, some studies show that it contains valuable nutrients. For example, it contains antioxidants similar to vitamin E, which lower both LDL cholesterol and a platelet clotting factor. [B. A. Bradlow, University of Illinois, Chicago; Science News 139, 268, 1991.] Coconut oil and other tropical oils also contain some hormones that are related to pregnenolone or progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what oils are safe.

**RAY PEAT:** "Coconut oil is the least fattening of all the oils. Pig farmers tried to use it to fatten their animals, but when it was added to the animal feed, coconut oil made the pigs lean [See Encycl. Brit. Book of the Year, 1946]."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether coconut oil is fattening.

**RAY PEAT:** "In this case, as with coconut oil, "fattening" has more to do with your ability to burn calories than with the caloric value of the oil. Olive oil has a few more calories per quart than corn or soy oil, but since it doesn't damage our ability to burn calories as much as the unsaturated oils do, it is less fattening. Extra virgin olive oil is the best grade, and contains an antioxidant that protects against cancer and heart disease. [1994, Curr. Conts.]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about olive oil and whether it is more fattening than other vegetable oils.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some studies in Europe suggest that, but studies in animals show that when the total calorie intake Is excessive, even a small amount of linoleic acid is enough to increase the incidence of cancer, and olive oil contains some linoleic acid. The people who use more olive oil might eat less bread and pasta, and as a result might be less obese, and so less likely to get cancer. Eating any fat with a starch makes the starch less harmful, and it’s clearly better to use olive oil than the more highly polyunsaturated seed oils."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether using olive oil helps to prevent cancer.

**RAY PEAT:** "No. Now and then someone learns how to make a profit from waste material. "Knotty pine" boards were changed from a discarded material to a valued decorative material by a little marketing skill. Light olive oil is a low grade material which sometimes has a rancid smell and probably shouldn't be used as food."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether "light" olive oil is okay.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are several problems with margarine. The manufacturing process introduces some toxins, including a unique type of fat which has been associated with heart disease. [Sci. News, 1974; 1991.] There are likely to be dyes and preservatives added to margarine. And newer products contain new chemicals that haven't been in use long enough to know whether they are safe. However, the basic hardening process, hydrogenation of the oils, has been found to make the oils less likely to cause cancer. If I had to choose between eating ordinary corn oil or corn oil that was 100% saturated, to make a hard margarine, I would choose the hard margarine, because it resists oxidation, isn't suppressive to the thyroid gland, and doesn't cause cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether margarine is okay.

**RAY PEAT:** "Butter contains natural vitamin A and D and some beneficial natural hormones. It is less fattening than the unsaturated oils. There is much less cholesterol in an ounce of butter than in a lean chicken breast [about 1/5 as much cholesterol in fat as in lean meat on a calorie basis, according to R. Reiser of Texas A & M Univ., 1979]."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about butter.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some of the unsaturated fats in fish are definitely less toxic than those in corn oil or soy oil, but that doesn't mean they are safe. Fifty years ago, it was found that a large amount of cod liver oil in dogs' diet increased their death rate from cancer by 20 times, from the usual 5% to 100%. A diet rich in fish oil causes intense production of toxic lipid peroxides, and has been observed to reduce a man's sperm count to zero. [H. Sinclair, Prog. Lipid Res. 25, 667, 1989.]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether fish oils are good for you.

**RAY PEAT:** "In this country, lard is toxic beause the pigs are fed large quantities of corn and soy beans. Besides the natural toxicity of the seed oils, the oils are contaminated with agricultural chemicals. Corn farmers have a very high incidence of cancer, presumably because corn "requires" the use of more pesticides. This probably makes corn oil's toxicity greater than it would be otherwise. but even the pure, organically grown material is toxic, because of its unsaturation."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about lard.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women with breast cancer have very high levels of agricultural pesticides in their breasts [See Science News, 1992, 1994]."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about lard.

**RAY PEAT:** "Israel had the world's highest incidence of breast cancer when they allowed the insecticide lindane to be used in dairies, and the cancer rate decreased immediately after the government prohibited its use. The United States has fairly good laws to control the use of cancer-causing agents in the food supply, but they are not vigorously enforced. [World Incid. of Cancer, 1992. ]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about lard.

**RAY PEAT:** "A small amount of these oils won't kill you. It is the proportion of them in your diet that matters. A little extra vitamin E (such as 100 units per day) will take care of an occasional American restaurant meal. Based on animal studies, it would take a teaspoonful per day of corn or soy oil added to a fat-free diet to significantly increase our risk of cancer. Unfortunately, it is impossible to devise a fat-free diet outside of a laboratory. Vegetables, grains, nuts, fish and meats all naturally contain large amounts of these oils, and the extra oil used in cooking becomes a more serious problem."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what to do to offset the harmful effects of polyunsaturated oils when eating out.

**RAY PEAT:** "It's a whole system of promotion, advertising, and profitability."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why unsaturated oils are so popular if they are dangerous.

**RAY PEAT:** "50 years ago, paints and varnishes were made of soy oil, safflower oil, and linseed (flax seed) oil. Then chemists learned how to make paint from petroleum, which was much cheaper. As a result, the huge seed oil industry found its crop increasingly hard to sell. Around the same time, farmers were experimenting with poisons to make their pigs get fatter with less food, and they discovered that corn and soy beans served the purpose, in a legal way. The crops that had been grown for the paint industry came to be used for animal food. Then these foods that made animals get fat cheaply came to be promoted as foods for humans, but they had to direct attention away from the fact that they are very fattening. The "cholesterol" focus was just one of the marketing tools used by the oil industry. Unfortunately it is the one that has lasted the longest, even after the unsaturated oils were proven to cause heart disease as well as cancer. [Study at L.A. Veterans Hospital, 1971.]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why unsaturated oils are so popular if they are dangerous.

**RAY PEAT:** "I use some of these oils (walnut oil is very nice, but safflower oil is cheaper) for oil painting, but I am careful to wash my hands thoroughly after I touch them, because they can be absorbed through the skin."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why unsaturated oils are so popular if they are dangerous.

**RAY PEAT:** "Iron is a potentially toxic heavy metal. In excess, it can cause cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why iron is considered a deadly substance.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1960s the World Health Organization found that when iron supplements were given to anemic people in Africa, there was a great increase in the death rate from infectious diseases, especially malaria. Around the same time, research began to show that the regulation of iron is a central function of the immune system, and that this seems to have evolved because iron is a basic requirement for the survival and growth of cells of all types, including bacteria, parasites, and cancer. The pioneer researcher in the role of iron in immunity believed that an excess of dietary iron contributed to the development of leukemia and lymphatic cancers."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about some studies regarding iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "For about 50 years, it has been known that blood transfusions damage immunity, and excess iron has been suspected to be one of the causes for this. People who regularly donate blood, on the other hand, have often been found to be healthier than non-donors, and healthier than they were before they began donating."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about some studies regarding iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just like lead, mercury, cadmium, nickel, manganese and other heavy metals, stored iron produces destructive free radicals. The harmful effects of iron-produced free radicals are practically indistinguishable from those caused by exposure to X-rays and gamma rays; both accelerate the accumulation of age-pigment and other signs of aging. Excess iron is a crucial element in the transformation of stress into tissue damage by free radicals."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about some studies regarding iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "In one of Hans Selye's pioneering studies, he found that he could experimentally produce a form of scleroderma (hardening of the skin) in animals by administering large doses of iron, followed by a minor stress. He could prevent the development of the condition by giving the animals large doses of vitamin E, suggesting that the condition was produced by iron's oxidative actions."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about some studies regarding iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many recent studies show that iron is involved in degenerative brain diseases, such as Parkinson's, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Huntington's chorea, and Alzheimer's disease. Iron is now believed to have a role in skin aging, atherosclerosis, and cataracts of the lenses of the eyes, largely through its formation of the "age pigment.""

**CONTEXT:** The question is about some studies regarding iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "During aging, our tissues tend to store an excess of iron. There is a remarkably close association between the amount of iron stored in our tissues and the risk of death from cancer, heart disease, or from all causes. This relationship between iron and death rate exists even during childhood, but the curve is downward until the age of 12, and then it rises steadily until death. The shape of this curve, representing the iron burden, is amazingly similar to the curves representing the rate of death in general, and the rate of death from cancer. There is no other relationship in biology that I know of that has this peculiar shape, with its minimum at the age of 12, and its maximum in old age at the time of death."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how excess iron accelerates the aging process.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the major lines of aging research, going back to the early part of this century, was based on the accumulation of a brown material in the tissues known as "age-pigment." The technical name for this material, "lipofuscin," means "fatty brown stuff." In the 1960s, the "free radical theory" of aging was introduced by Denham Harman, and this theory has converged with the age-pigment theory, since we now know that the age-pigment is an oxidized mass of unsaturated fat and iron, formed by uncontrolled free radicals. Until a few years ago, these ideas were accepted by only a few researchers, but now practically every doctor in the country accepts that free radicals are important in the aging process."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how excess iron accelerates the aging process.

**RAY PEAT:** "A nutrition researcher in San Diego suspected that the life-extending effects of calorie restriction might be the result of a decreased intake of toxins. He removed the toxic heavy metals from foods, and found that the animals which ate a normal amount of food lived as long as the semi-starved animals. Recently, the iron content of food has been identified as the major life-shortening factor, rather than the calories. [Choi and Yu, Age vol. 17, page 93, 1994]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how excess iron accelerates the aging process.

**RAY PEAT:** "Children's nutritional requirements are high, because they are growing, but there are indications that in the U.S. even children eat too much iron. Some researchers are concerned that the iron added to cereals is contributing to the incidence of leukemia and cancers of the lymphatic tissues in children. [Goodfield, 1984.] During the time of rapid growth, children are less likely than adults to store too much iron. At birth, they have a large amount of stored iron, and this decreases as they "grow into it." It is after puberty, when growth slows and the sex hormones are high, that the storage of iron increases. [B/ood, Sept., 1976.]"

**CONTEXT:** The question is about exactly how much iron we need to eat.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a study of the "malnourished" children of migrant fruit pickers in California, these children who were “seriously anemic" were actually more resistant to infectious diseases than were the "well nourished" middle class children in the same region."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about exactly how much iron we need to eat.

**RAY PEAT:** "If the normal amount of dietary iron causes an increased susceptibility to infections even in children, and if a subnormal amount of iron slows the aging process, I think we are going to have to reconsider our ideas of nutritional adequacy, to look at the long range effects of diet, as well as the immediate effects. My current studies have to do with analyzing our ability to handle stress safely, in relation to our diet. I believe our nutritional recommendations for iron have to be revised sharply downward."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about exactly how much iron we need to eat.

**RAY PEAT:** "That's a misunderstanding. Doctors generally don't realize that only a few milligrams of iron are lost each day in menstruation. The real issue is that you can hardly avoid getting iron, even when you try."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether women need extra iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Women absorb iron much more efficiently than men do. From a similar meal, women will normally absorb three times as much iron as men do. When pregnant, their higher estrogen levels cause them to absorb about nine times as much as men. Every time a woman menstruates, she loses a little iron, so that by the age of 50 she is likely to have less iron stored in her tissues than a man does at the same age, but by the age of 65 women generally have as much excess tron in their tissues as men do. (During those 15 years, women seem to store iron at a faster rate than men do, probably because they have more estrogen.) At this age their risk of dying from a heart attack is the same as that of men."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether women need extra iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some women who menstruate can donate blood regularly without showing any tendency to become anemic."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether women need extra iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since the custom of giving large iron supplements to pregnant women has been established, there has been an increase in jaundice of the newborn. It has been observed that women who didn't take iron supplements during pregnancy have healthy babies that don't develop jaundice. I have suggested that this could be because they haven't been poisoned by iron. Those supplements could also be a factor in the increased incidence of childhood cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether women need extra iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "In general, no."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether you need iron supplements if you are anemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many doctors think of anemia as necessarily indicating an iron deficiency, but that isn't correct. 100 years ago, it was customary to prescribe arsenic for anemia, and it worked to stimulate the formation of more red blood cells. The fact that arsenic, or iron, or other toxic material stimulates the formation of red blood cells doesn't indicate a "deficiency" of the toxin, but simply indicates that the body responds to a variety of harmful factors by speeding its production of blood cells. Even radiation can have this kind of stimulating effect, because growth is a natural reaction to injury. Between 1920 and 1950, it was common to think of "nutritional growth factors" as being the same as vitamins, but since then it has become common to use known toxins to stimulate the growth of farm animals, and as a result, it has been more difficult to define the essential nutrients. The optimal nutritional intake is now more often considered in terms of resistance to disease, longevity or rate of aging, and even mental ability."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether you need iron supplements if you are anemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "An excess of iron, by destroying vitamin E and oxidizing the unsaturated fats in red blood cells, can contribute to hemolytic anemia, in which red cells are so fragile that they break down too fast. In aging, red cells break down faster, increasing the tendency to become anemic, but additional iron tends to be more dangerous for older people."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether you need iron supplements if you are anemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Anemia in women is caused most often by a thyroid deficiency (as discussed in the chapter on thyroid), or by various nutritional deficiencies. Estrogen (even in animals that don't menstruate) causes dilution of the blood, so that it is normal for females to have lower hemoglobin than males."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether you need iron supplements if you are anemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Iron deficiency anemia does exist, in laboratory situations and in some cases of chronic bleeding, but I believe it should be the last-suspected cause of anemia, instead of the first. It should be considered as a possible cause of anemia only when very specific blood tests show an abnormally low degree of iron saturation of certain proteins. Usually, physicians consider the amount of hemoglobin or of red cells in the blood as the primary indicator of a need for iron, but that just isn't biologically reasonable."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what to do if your doctor tells you you're anemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "If a large amount of blood is lost in surgery, a temporary anemia might be produced, but even then it would be best to know whether the iron stores are really depleted before deciding whether an iron supplement would be reasonable. Liver (or even a water extract of wheat germ) can supply as much iron as would be given as a pill, and is safer."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what to do if your doctor tells you you're anemic.

**RAY PEAT:** "Flour, pasta, etc. almost always contain tron which has been artificially added as ferrous sulfate, because of a federal law. Meats, grains, eggs, and vegetables naturally contain large amounts of iron. A few years ago, someone demonstrated that they could pick up a certain breakfast cereal with a magnet, because of the added iron. Black olives contain iron, which is used as a coloring material. You should look for "ferrous" or "ferric" or "iron" on the label, and avoid foods with any added iron. Many labels list "reduced iron," meaning that iron is added in the ferrous form, which ts very reactive and easily absorbed."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what foods contain iron.

**RAY PEAT:** "Industrially processed grains have most of the nutrients, such as vitamin E, the B vitamins, manganese, magnesium, etc., removed to improve the products’ shelf life and efficiency of processing, and the government required that certain nutrients be added to them as a measure to protect the public's health, but the supplementation did not reflect the best science even when it was first made law, since food industry lobbyists managed to impose compromises that led to the use of the cheapest chemicals, rather than those that offered the greatest health benefits. For example, studies of processed animal food had demonstrated that the addition of iron (as the highly reactive form, ferrous sulfate, which happens to be cheap and easy to handle) created disease in animals, by destroying vitamins in the food. You should read the label of ingredients and avoid products that contain added iron, when possible."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why federal law requires the addition of iron to those foods.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yes, especially if the food is acidic, as many sauces are. The added iron will destroy vitamins in the food, besides being potentially toxic in itself."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about whether cooking in an iron frying pan puts iron into food.

**RAY PEAT:** "Aluminum and iron react similarly in cells and are suspected causes of Alzheimer's disease. The aluminum industry started propagandizing more than 50 years ago about the "safety" of aluminum utensils, claiming that practically none of the toxic metal gets into the food. Recent research showed that coffee percolated in an aluminum pot contained a large amount of dissolved aluminum, because of coffee's acidity."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about aluminum.

**RAY PEAT:** "Glass utensils are safe, and certain kinds of stainless steel are safe, because their iron is relatively insoluble. Teflon-coated pans are safe unless they are chipped."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what kinds of cooking pots or utensils are safe.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are two main types of stainless steel, magnetic and nonmagnetic. The nonmagnetic form has a very high nickel content, and nickel is allergenic and carcinogenic. It is much more toxic than iron or aluminum. You can use a little "refrigerator magnet" to test your pans. The magnet will stick firmly to the safer type of pan."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how to know which stainless steels are safe.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although several researchers have demonstrated that iron destroys vitamins, there is enough wishful thinking in industry, government, and the consuming public, that such mistakes can go on for generations before anyone can mobilize the resources to bring the truth to the public. Ten years ago, I thought it was a hopeful sign of increased awareness of iron's danger when the manufacturer of a new iron product mentioned in the Physician's Desk Reference that it hadn't yet been reported to cause cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about why there is iron in most multi-vitamin and mineral products.

**RAY PEAT:** "Iron destroys vitamin E, so vitamin E should be taken as a supplement. It shouldn't be taken at the same time as the iron-contaminated food, because iron reacts with it in the stomach. About 100 mg. per day is adequate, though our requirement increases with age, as our tissue iron stores increase. Coffee, when taken with food, strongly inhibits the absorption of iron, so I always try to drink coffee with meat. Decreasing your consumption of unsaturated fats makes the iron less harmful."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what to do to keep ingested iron from causing harm.

**RAY PEAT:** "Vitamin C stimulates the absorption of iron, so it might be a good idea to avoid drinking orange juice at the same meal with iron-rich foods. A deficiency of copper causes our tissues to retain an excess of iron, so foods such as shrimp and oysters which contain abundant copper should be used regularly."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about what to do to keep ingested iron from causing harm.

**RAY PEAT:** "Copper is the crucial element for producing the color in hair and skin, for maintaining the elasticity of skin and blood vessels, for protecting against certain types of free radical, and especially for allowing us to use oxygen properly for the production of biological energy. It is also necessary for the normal functioning of certain nerve cells (substantia nigra) whose degeneration is involved in Parkinson's disease. The shape and texture of hair, as well as its color, can change in a copper deficiency."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how copper helps us.

**RAY PEAT:** "Too much iron can block our absorption of copper, and too little copper makes us store too much iron. With aging, our tissues lose copper as they store excess iron. Because of those changes, we need more vitamin E as we age."

**CONTEXT:** The question is about how copper helps us.

**RAY PEAT:** "The unsaturated oils in some cooked foods become rancid in just a few hours, even at refrigerator temperatures, and are responsible for the stale taste of left-over foods. (Eating slightly stale food isn't particularly harmful, since the same oils, even when eaten absolutely fresh, will oxidize at a much higher rate once they are in the body, where they are heated and thoroughly mixed with an abundance of oxygen.) Coconut oil that has been kept at room temperature for a year has been tested for rancidity, and showed no evidence of it. Since we would expect the small percentage of unsaturated oils naturally contained in coconut oil to become rancid, it seems that the other (saturated) oils have an antioxidative effect: I suspect that the dilution keeps the unstable unsaturated fat molecules spatially separated from each other, so they can't interact in the destructive chain reactions that occur in other oils. To interrupt chain-reactions of oxidation is one of the functions of antioxidants, and it is possible that a sufficient quantity of coconut oil in the body has this function. It is well established that dietary coconut oil reduces our need for vitamin E, but I think its antioxidant role is more general than that, and that it has both direct and indirect antioxidant activities."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Coconut oil is unusually rich in short and medium chain fatty acids. Shorter chain length allows fatty acids to be metabolized without use of the carnitine transport system. Mildronate, which I discussed in an article on adaptogens, protects cells against stress partly by opposing the action of carnitine, and comparative studies showed that added carnitine had the opposite effect, promoting the oxidation of unsaturated fats during stress, and increasing oxidative damage to cells. I suspect that a degree of saturation of the oxidative apparatus by short-chain fatty acids has a similar effect--that is, that these very soluble and mobile short-chain saturated fats have priority for oxidation, because they don't require carnitine transport into the mitochondrion, and that this will tend to inhibit oxidation of the unstable, peroxidizable unsaturated fatty acids."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "When Albert Schweitzer operated his clinic in tropical Africa, he said it was many years before he saw any cases of cancer, and he believed that the appearance of cancer was caused by the change to the European type of diet. In the 1920s, German researchers showed that mice on a fat-free diet were practically free of cancer. Since then, many studies have demonstrated a very close association between consumption of unsaturated oils and the incidence of cancer."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Heart damage is easily produced in animals by feeding them linoleic acid; this “essential” fatty acid turned out to be the heart toxin in rape-seed oil. The addition of saturated fat to the experimental heart-toxic oil-rich diet protects against the damage to heart cells. Immunosuppression was observed in patients who were being "nourished" by intravenous emulsions of "essential fatty acids," and as a result coconut oi] is used as the basis for intravenous fat feeding, except in organ-transplant patients. For those patients. emulsions of unsaturated oils are used specifically for their immunosuppressive effects."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "General aging, and especially aging of the brain, is increasingly seen as being closely associated with lipid peroxidation."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several years ago I met an old couple, who were only a few years apart in age, but the wife looked many years younger than her doddering old husband. She was from the Philippines, and she remarked that she always had to cook two meals at the same time, because her husband couldn't adapt to her traditional food. Three times every day, she still prepared her food in coconut oil. Her apparent youth increased my interest in the effects of coconut oil."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1960s, Hartroft and Porta gave an elegant argument for decreasing the ratio of unsaturated oil to saturated oil in the diet (and thus in the tissues). They showed that the "age pigment" is produced in proportion to the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants, multiplied by the ratio of unsaturated oils to saturated oils. More recently, a variety of studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet light induces peroxidation in unsaturated fats, but not saturated fats, and that this occurs in the skin as well as /n vitro. Rabbit experiments, and studies of humans, showed that the amount of unsaturated oil in the diet strongly affects the rate at which aged, wrinkled skin develops. The unsaturated fat in the skin is a major target for the aging and carcinogenic effects of ultraviolet light, though not necessarily the only one."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1940s, farmers attempted to use cheap coconut oil for fattening their animals, but they found that it made them lean, active and hungry. For a few years, an antithyroid drug was found to make the livestock get fat while eating less food, but then it was found to be a strong carcinogen, and it also probably produced hypothyroidism in the people who ate the meat. By the late 1940s, it was found that the same antithyroid effect, causing animals to get fat without eating much food, could be achieved by using soy beans and corn as feed."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Later, an animal experiment fed diets that were low or high in total fat, and in different groups the fat was provided by pure coconut oil, Or a pure unsaturated oil, or by various mixtures of the two oils. At the end of their lives, the animals' obesity increased directly in proportion to the ratio of unsaturated oil to coconut oil in their diet, and was not related to the total amount of fat they had consumed. That is, animals which ate just a little pure unsaturated oil were fat, and animals which ate a lot of coconut oil were lean."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1930s, animals on a diet lacking the unsaturated fatty acids were found to be "hypermetabolic." Eating a "normal" diet, these animals were malnourished, and their skin condition was said to be caused by a "deticiency of essential fatty acids." But other researchers who were studying vitamin B, recognized the condition as a deficiency of that vitamin. They were able to cause the condition by feeding a fat-free diet, and to cure the condition by feeding a single B vitamin. The hypermetabolic animals simply needed a better diet than the "normal," fat-fed, cancer-prone animals did."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "G. W. Crile and his wife found that the metabolic rate of people in Yucatan, where coconut is a staple food, averaged 25% higher than that of people in the United States. In a hot climate, the adaptive tendency is to have a lower metabolic rate, so it is clear that some factor is more than offsetting this expected effect of high environmental temperatures.’ The people there are lean, and recently it has been observed that the women there have none of the symptoms we commonly associate with the menopause."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "By 1950, then, it was established that unsaturated fats suppress the metabolic rate, apparently creating hypothyroidism. Over the next few decades, the exact mechanisms of that metabolic damage were studied. Unsaturated fats damage the mitochondria, partly by suppressing the respiratory enzyme, and partly by causing generalized oxidative damage. The more unsaturated the oils are, the more specifically they suppress tissue response to thyroid hormone, and transport of the hormone on the thyroid transport protein."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Plants evolved a variety of toxins designed to protect themselves from "predators," such as grazing animals. Seeds contain a variety of toxins, that seem to be specific for mammalian enzymes, and the seed oils themselves function to block proteolytic digestive enzymes in the stomach. The thyroid hormone is formed in the gland by the action of a proteolytic enzyme, and the unsaturated oils also inhibit that enzyme. Similar proteolytic enzymes involved in clot removal and phagocytosis appear to be similarly inhibited by these oils."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just as metabolism is "activated" by consumption of coconut oil, which prevents the inhibiting effect of unsaturated oils, other inhibited processes, such as clot removal and phagocytosis, will probably tend to be restored by continuing use of coconut oil."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Brain tissue is very rich in complex forms of fats. The experiment (around 1978) in which pregnant mice were given diets containing either coconut oil or unsaturated oil showed that brain development was superior in the young mice whose mothers ate coconut oil. Because coconut oil supports thyroid function, and thyroid governs brain development, including myelination, the result might simply reflect the difference between normal and hypothyroid individuals. However, in 1980, experimenters demonstrated that young rats fed milk containing soy oil incorporated the oil directly into their brain cells, and had structurally abnormal brain cells as a result. Lipid peroxidation occurs during seizures, and antioxidants such as vitamin E have some anti-seizure activity. Currently, lipid peroxidation is being found to be involved in the nerve cell degeneration of Alzheimer's disease."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Various fractions of coconut oil are coming into use as "drugs," meaning that they are advertised as treatments for diseases. Butyric acid is used to treat cancer, lauric and myristic acids to treat virus infections, and mixtures of medium-chain fats are sold for weight loss. Purification undoubtedly increases certain effects, and results in profitable products, but in the absence of more precise knowledge, | think the whole natural product, used as a regular food, is the best way to protect health. The shorter-chain fatty acids have strong, unpleasant odors; for a couple of days after I ate a small amount of a medium-chain triglyceride mixture, my skin oil emitted a rank, goaty smell. Some people don't seem to have that reaction, and the benefits might outweigh the stink, but these things just haven't been in use long enough to know whether they are safe. We have to remember that the arguments made for aspartame, monosodium glutamate, aspartic acid, and tryptophan--that they are like the amino acids that make up natural proteins--are dangerously false. In the case of amino acids, balance is everything. Aspartic and glutamic acids promote seizures and cause brain damage, and are intimately involved in the process of stress-induced brain aging, and tryptophan by itself is carcinogenic."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Treating any complex natural product as the drug industry does, as a raw material to be fractionated in the search for "drug" products, is risky, because the relevant knowledge isn't sought in the search for an association between a single chemical and a single disease."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "While the toxic unsaturated paint-stock oils, especially safflower, soy, corn and linseed (flaxseed) oils, have been sold to the public precisely for their drug effects, all of their claimed benefits were false. When people become interested in coconut oil as a "health food," the huge seed-oil industry--operating through their shills--is likely to attack it as an “unproved drug."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "While components of coconut oil have been found to have remarkable physiological effects (as antihistamines, antiinfectives/antiseptics, promoters of immunity, glucocorticoid antagonist, nontoxic anticancer agents, for example), I think it is important to avoid making any such claims for the natural coconut oil, because it very easily could be banned from the import market as a "new drug" which isn't “approved by the FDA." We have already seen how money and propaganda from the soy oil industry eliminated long-established products from the U.S. market. I saw people lose weight stably when they had the habit of eating large amounts of tortilla chips fried in coconut oil, but those chips disappeared when their producers were pressured into switching to other oils, in spite of the short shelf life that resulted in the need to add large amounts of preservatives. Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, potato chip producers, and movie theater popcorn makers have experienced similar pressures."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "The cholesterol-lowering fiasco for a long time centered on the ability of unsaturated oils to slightly lower serum cholesterol. For years, the mechanism of that action wasn't known, which should have suggested caution. Now, it seems that the effect is just one more toxic action, in which the liver defensively retains its cholesterol, rather than releasing it into the blood. Large scale human studies have provided overwhelming evidence that whenever drugs, including the unsaturated oils, were used to lower serum cholesterol, mortality increased, from a variety of causes including accidents, but mainly from cancer. Since the 1930s, it has been clearly established that suppression of the thyroid raises serum cholesterol (while increasing mortality from infections, cancer, and heart disease), while restoring the thyroid hormone brings cholesterol down to normal. In this situation, however, thyroid isn't suppressing the synthesis of cholesterol, but rather is promoting its use to form hormones and bile salts. When the thyroid is functioning properly, the amount of cholesterol in the blood entering the ovary governs the amount of progesterone being produced by the ovary, and the same situation exists in all steroid-forming tissues, such as the adrenal glands and the brain. Progesterone and its precursor, pregnenolone, have a _ generalized protective function: antioxidant, anti-seizure, antitoxin, anti-spasm, anti-clot, anti-cancer, pro-memory, pro-myelination, pro-attention, etc. Any interference with the formation of cholesterol will interfere with all of these exceedingly important protective functions."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "As far as the evidence goes, it suggests that coconut oil, added regularly to a balanced diet, lowers cholesterol to normal by promoting its conversion into pregnenolone. (The coconut family contains steroids that resemble pregnenolone, but these are probably mostly removed when the fresh oil is washed with water to remove the enzymes which would digest the oil.) Coconut-eating cultures in the tropics have consistently lower cholesterol than people in the U.S. Everyone that I know who uses coconut oil regularly happens to have cholesterol levels of about 160, while eating mainly cholesterol rich foods (eggs, milk, cheese, meat, shellfish). I encourage people to eat sweet fruits, rather than starches, if they want to increase their production of cholesterol, since fructose has that effect."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many people see coconut oil in its hard, white state, and--as a result of their training watching television or going to medical school--associate it with the cholesterol-rich plaques in blood vessels. Those lesions in blood vessels are caused mostly by lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fats, and relate to stress, because adrenaline liberates fats from storage, and the lining of blood vessels is exposed to high concentrations of the blood-borne material. In the body, incidentally, the oil can't exist as a solid, since it liquefies at 76 degrees. (Incidentally, the viscosity of complex materials isn't a simple matter of averaging the viscosity of its component materials; cholesterol and saturated fats sometimes lower the viscosity of cell components.) Most of the images and metaphors relating to coconut oil and cholesterol that circulate in our culture are false and misleading. I offer a counter-image, which is metaphorical, but it is true in that it relates to lipid peroxidation, which is profoundly important in our bodies. After a bottle of safflower oil has been opened a few times, a few drops that get smeared onto the outside of the bottle begin to get very sticky, and hard to wash off. This property is why it is a valued base for paints and varnishes, but this varnish is chemically closely related to the age pigment that forms "liver spots" on the skin, and similar lesions in the brain, heart, blood vessels, lenses of the eyes, etc. The image of “hard, white saturated coconut oil" isn't relevant to the oil's biological action, but the image of "sticky varnish-like easily oxidized unsaturated seed oils" is highly relevant to their toxicity."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "The ability of some of the medium chain saturated fatty acids to inhibit the liver's formation of fat very likely synergizes with the pro-thyroid effect, in allowing energy to be used, rather than stored. When fat isn't formed from carbohydrate, the sugar is available for use, or for storage as glycogen. Therefore, shifting from unsaturated fats in foods to coconut oil involves several anti-stress processes, reducing our need for the adrenal hormones. Decreased blood sugar is a basic signal for the release of adrenal hormones. Unsaturated oil tends to lower the blood sugar in at least three basic ways. It damages mitochondria, causing respiration to be uncoupled from energy production, meaning that fuel is burned without useful effect. It suppresses the activity of the respiratory enzyme (directly, and through its anti-thyroid actions), decreasing the respiratory production of energy. And it tends to direct carbohydrate into fat production, making both stress and obesity more probable. For those of us who use coconut oil consistently, one of the most noticeable changes is the ability to go for several hours without eating, and to feel hungry without having symptoms of hypoglycemia."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "One of the stylish ways to promote the use of unsaturated oils is to refer to their presence in "cell membranes," and to claim that they are essential for maintaining "membrane fluidity." As I have mentioned above, it is the ability of the unsaturated fats, and their breakdown products, to interfere with enzymes and transport proteins, which accounts for many of their toxic effects, so they definitely don't just harmlessly form "membranes." They probably bind to all proteins, and disrupt some of them, but for some reason their affinity for proteolytic and respiration-related enzymes is particularly obvious. (I think the chemistry of this association is going to give us some important insights into the nature of organisms. Metchnikof's model that I have discussed elsewhere might give us a picture of how those factors relate in growth, physiology, and aging.) Unsaturated fats are slightly more water-soluble than fully saturated fats, and so they do have a greater tendency to concentrate at interfaces between water and fats or proteins, but there are relatively few places where these interfaces can be usefully and harmlessly occupied by unsaturated fats, and at a certain point, an excess becomes harmful. We don't want "membranes" forming where there shouldn't be membranes. The fluidity or viscosity of cell surfaces is an extremely complex subject, and the degree of viscosity has to be appropriate for the function of the cell. Interestingly, in some cells, such as the cells that line the air sacs of the lungs, cholesterol and one of the saturated fatty acids found in coconut oil can increase the fluidity of the cell surface."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "In many cases, stressful conditions create structural disorder in cells. These influences have been called "“chaotropic," or chaos-producing. In red blood cells, which have sometimes been wrongly described as “hemoglobin enclosed in a cell membrane," it has been known for a long time that lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fats weakens the cellular structure, causing the cells to be destroyed prematurely. Lipid peroxidation products are known to be "chaotropic," lowering the rigidity of regions of cells considered to be membranes. But the red blood cell is actually more like a sponge in structure, consisting of a "skeleton" of proteins, which (if not damaged by oxidation) can hold its shape, even when the hemoglobin has been removed. Oxidants damage the protein structure, and it is this structural damage which in turn increases the "fluidity" of the associated fats."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "So, it is probably true that in many cases the liquid unsaturated oils do increase "membrane fluidity," but it is now clear that in at least some of those cases the "fluidity" corresponds to the chaos of a damaged cell protein structure.

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although I had stopped using the unsaturated seed oils years ago, and supposed that I wasn't heavily saturated with toxic unsaturated fat, when I first used coconut oil I saw an immediate response, that convinced me my metabolism was chronically inhibited by something that was easily alleviated by "dilution" or molecular competition. I had put a tablespoonful of coconut oil on some rice I had for supper, and half an hour later while I was reading, I noticed I was breathing more deeply than normal. I saw that my skin was pink, and I found that my pulse was faster than normal--about 98, I think. After an hour or two, my pulse and breathing returned to normal. Every day for a couple of weeks I noticed the same response while I was digesting a small amount of coconut oil, but gradually it didn't happen any more, and I increased my daily consumption of the oil to about an ounce. I kept eating the same foods as before (including a quart of ice cream every day), except that I added about 200 or 250 calories per day as coconut oil. Apparently the metabolic surges that happened at first were an indication that my body was compensating for an anti-thyroid substance by producing more thyroid hormone; when the coconut oil relieved the inhibition, I experienced a moment of slight hyperthyroidism, but after a time the inhibitor became less effective, and my body adjusted by producing slightly less thyroid hormone. But over the next few months, I saw that my weight was slowly and consistently decreasing. It had been steady at 185 pounds for 25 years, but over a period of six months it dropped to about 175 pounds. I found that eating more coconut oil lowered my weight another few pounds, and eating less caused it to increase."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "The anti-obesity effect of coconut oil is clear in all of the animal studies, and in my friends who eat it regularly. It is now hard to get it in health food stores, since Hain stopped selling it. The Spectrum product looks and feels a little different to me, and I suppose the particular type of tree, region, and method of preparation can account for variations in the consistency and composition of the product. The unmodified natural oil is called "76 degree melt," since that is its natural melting temperature. One bottle from a health food store was labeled "natural coconut oil, 92% unsaturated oil," and it had the greasy consistency of old lard. I suspect that someone had confused palm oil (or something worse) with coconut oil, because it should be about 96% saturated fatty acids."

**CONTEXT:** The author is asked to write about coconut oil.

**RAY PEAT:** "Most diets are promoted for a single purpose, such as weight loss or heart protection, and usually they don't work even for a limited purpose. If a diet allows you to adapt to varied activities with a minimum of stress, it will help you to avoid many serious problems. Years ago, a retired dentist studied healthy people and their diets around the world, and found that many different diets supported good health, but when they began eating the "western" diet, based on grains, they quickly developed all the degenerative diseases."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are some simple biochemical reasons for avoiding grains and beans, that I have discussed in more detail elsewhere. Plants put their most effective poisons into their seeds to protect their progeny. These toxins block digestive enzymes, lowering the food value of the material, but they also poison many other physiological processes--hormone production, immunity, and brain development, for example."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "People who are accustomed to eating wheat shaped into dozens of foods that differ only in appearance and flavor sometimes say "there's nothing left to eat" if they eliminate grains, or stop relying on them for their main source of calories."

**RAY PEAT:** "If we restrict ourselves mainly to animal proteins and low-starch fruits, we avoid the nutrient-poor foods, and still have an almost infinite variety of very pleasant foods. These foods are generally so rich in nutrients that a person could choose just a few of them, and be assured of an abundance of vitamins, minerals, and proteins."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "Nutritional deficiency diseases probably wouldn't have been discovered if our diets hadn't been based on grains. The starches in grains aren't their only problem, but starch is uniquely suited to activate the formation of fat, and to stimulate appetite, especially an appetite for more carbohydrate, to restore the blood glucose that has been used up in making fat. Starch also has the ability to stimulate allergic responses, to plug small blood vessels and to accelerate aging (according to the work of G. Volkheimer, and others)."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "There is one form of grain that is relatively harmless because of the traditional method of processing it, and that is corn that has been made into tortillas or other native American foods, using alkali to detoxify it and make it more digestible. Pellagra was strongly associated with the use of ordinary corn, but not with the traditional preparations. Tortillas fried in coconut oil and salted make a pleasant snack which is less nutritious than potato chips, but less allergenic and more digestible."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "The sugars and minerals in fruits tend to stabilize the blood sugar, and when they are taken with protein foods, they allow the proteins to be used constructively, rather than being converted into energy. This combination minimizes the stress hormones, and promotes thyroid function, so that energy is available for use, rather than being stored as fat. For example, a glass of orange juice and an egg make a good breakfast, and cherries and cheese make a good snack. Chicken and watermelon, pineapple and ham, any combination of fruit and protein will make a balanced meal. Milk evolved as a complete food, according to this principle of combining sugar, protein, and minerals."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "People who drink a quart of milk and a quart of orange juice every day are much less likely to have a hormonal imbalance than people who eat the average "well balanced" diet containing mostly vegetables, grains, and legumes."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "One vegetable has a special place in a diet to balance the hormones, and that is the raw carrot. It is so nearly indigestible that, when it is well chewed or grated, it helps to stimulate the intestine and reduce the reabsorption of estrogen and the absorption of bacterial toxins. In these effects on the bowel, which improve hormonal balance, a carrot salad resembles antibiotic therapy, except that the carrot salad can be used every day for years without harmful side-effects. Many people find that daily use of the raw carrot eliminates their PMS, headaches, or allergies. The use of oil and vinegar as dressing intensifies the bowel-cleansing effect of the salad. Coconut oil is more germicidal and thyroid promoting than olive oil, but a mixture of coconut and olive oil improves the flavor. Lime juice, salt, cheese and meats can be used to vary the flavor."

**CONTEXT:** The discussion turns to a logical diet.

**RAY PEAT:** "Context is everything. The idea of balance--physiological, hormonal, or nutritional balance, for example--requires contextual thinking. Environmentalism is a form of contextual thinking. There are no closed systems, anywhere. Before the second world war, there were many influential people and institutions devoted to contextual thinking. With the rise of overwhelming corporate/state influence in the world, manipulative "public relations" has replaced critical thinking even, to a great extent, in the universities."

**CONTEXT:** The author offers concluding thoughts on context and critical thinking.

**RAY PEAT:** "The main channels of communication are controlled by a few monopolies, which combine financial, weapons, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and energy interests in ways that are creating an interlocking set of almost rational-seeming beliefs. To orient yourself within this system requires some attention and effort, but once you perceive that your health and life are in the balance, it is usually possible to find the motivation and the energy to persist in critical, evidence-based thinking."

**CONTEXT:** The author discusses the control of communication channels by monopolies and the importance of critical thinking.

**RAY PEAT:** "I have looked for the best workers in many scientific fields, and it seems that their discoveries fit into a meaningful picture of life. Warburg, Shute, Biskind, Lipschutz, Selye, Szent-Gyorgyi, Barnes, Ling, Meerson, and others have revolutionized biology and medicine, but their work has never supported the dominant corporate view, and so it has been actively suppressed by the forces that control science education."

**CONTEXT:** The author highlights the work of influential scientists whose discoveries have been suppressed due to not aligning with dominant corporate views.

**RAY PEAT:** "The therapeutic methods that have grown out of their discoveries are simple, basic, inexpensive, and extremely effective."

**CONTEXT:** The author emphasizes the effectiveness of therapeutic methods derived from suppressed scientific discoveries.

**RAY PEAT:** "The only formulation of progesterone that I approve is progesterone dissolved in vitamin E, and I hold the patent on that. It is useful when applied to the skin, but oral use is more economical. As this book explains, other solvents and additives can be harmful. Almond oil, avocado oil, safflower oil, etc., sensitize the skin to the aging effects of the sun, and are inappropriate for use on the skin or internally."

**CONTEXT:** The author clarifies his approved formulation of progesterone and warns against other solvents and additives.

**RAY PEAT:** "Diosgenin, sometimes called wild yam extract, is toxic."

**CONTEXT:** The author warns about the toxicity of diosgenin.
