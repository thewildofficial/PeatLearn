**RAY PEAT:** "The whole analytical and skeptical tradition of British philosophy has not been taken very seriously by the Slavic and Latin cultures, and Marxism has enabled the Russians further to disregard many of the formulations and proscriptions of Anglo-American thought. The idea of the image is the most important example of this dichotomy in the intellectual world, and is the crucial issue in brain research and all of its ramifications--including language, health, education, adaptation to new conditions, and the planning of work."
**CONTEXT:** The author is introducing the fundamental difference in approach between Western and Russian thought regarding the concept of "image" and its significance in understanding the brain and behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since the image is taken to be real, and is such an obvious part of our ordinary existence, for the Soviet brain researcher the question is not whether images exist, but how they exist and what their relation is to sense, reflexes, learning, movement, and meaning. 'Imageless thought' is typically dismissed as a foreign mistake, along with Freudian concepts such as unconscious motivation. American Behaviorists reject consideration of mental images as 'mentalistic' and therefore unscientific, and many neo-Kantians or Cartesians--for example Noam Chomsky--prefer their mentalistic formulations to be composed of rules or other non-image units which are not directly accessible to consciousness. The most technical Soviet studies therefore often have a common sense, 'man in the street' quality about them, and this probably accounts for some of the American disregard of them, since they seem to violate some of the 'basic' (Western) scientific principles."
**CONTEXT:** This passage elaborates on the Soviet perspective, contrasting it with Western approaches that either dismiss or abstract away the concept of mental imagery.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the West, studies of the brain and behavior tend to focus on 'motor,' or efferent systems, since the essence of their activity--i.e., movement--is objectively observable. A typical American formulation is that there are 'motor programs' which govern behavior, and that these are somehow coordinated with sensory, associative, or cognitive systems. In this theory, it is possible to put an electrode into the 'motor region' of the brain, and to electrically activate a 'motor program,' so that, for example, a rooster with 'emit' aggressive behavior. Soviet biologists tend to interpret this kind of experiment differently, because they view the sensory, or afferent systems, as being the most important aspect of the nervous system, and as constituting the essential organizing process of the brain. It has been emphasized that most of the fibers extending from the central nervous system are sensory, and the cortex is thought of as an afferent system, after Pavlov."
**CONTEXT:** The author highlights the divergence in focus between Western and Soviet neuroscience, with the West prioritizing motor output and the East emphasizing sensory input as the primary driver of brain function.

**RAY PEAT:** "When we see the rooster 'emitting' aggressive behavior, we should notice that his behavior is still co-ordinated, with reference to the ground, posture, and surroundings. If there were such a thing as a pure motor system, it would seem that we should be able to get the animal to 'emit' a series of movements which would be independent of circumstances such as his initial position or posture. The 'motor program' being activated in this experiment is therefore not a pure or independent motor program. How can we be sure that this is a motor center, and not just a pain 'center' that convinces the rooster he is being attacked? How can we be sure that we are not stimulating a memory, or causing the rooster to hallucinate that he is being attacked? We could account for the same behavior by interpreting the experiment as an interference with the rooster's experience, rather than with a hypothetical 'motor program.' In the Russian view, with its emphasis on 'afferentation,' this would be the preferred interpretation, since there would be no question of the 'purity' or isolation of a part of behavior, and therefore no need to account for the existence of coordination which contradicts the supposed isolation. In the West, 'experience' is not considered to be a quantifiable, proper matter for science to deal with, and so by default the behavior is interpreted as being essentially 'motor' controlled."
**CONTEXT:** This passage critiques the Western reductionist view of motor control, arguing that sensory input and subjective experience are crucial for understanding coordinated behavior, a perspective more aligned with the Russian approach.

**RAY PEAT:** "A related idea is that there is no merely passive 'receptor' system, but rather an active analyzer system, incorporating effector links. The very concept of behavior implies coordination or orientation. The fragmented or isolated movements that are favored for study in the West, because of their purity or simplicity, have been denounced as 'the nearly artifactual' results of vivisection, in the Soviet literature."
**CONTEXT:** The author further contrasts the Western focus on isolated movements with the Soviet emphasis on integrated, behaviorally relevant processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Coordination implies three kinds of image, and apparently involves the interaction of three general parts of the nervous system. An image of the space in which the behavior is to take place is necessary, and the occipital-parietal area of the brain is the part of the brain most directly involved in this. An awareness of the position of the limbs and the general attitude of the body is also necessary and the posterior region of the hemispheres is related to this function. The sequencing, goal-direction, and meaning which are necessary for behavior to exist, are largely functions of the frontal part of the brain. This sequencing process, for example, makes it possible to perceive rhythms, or temporal patterns, but this process is also fundamental to all behavior or perception which persists or develops meaningfully through time."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the Soviet model of coordinated behavior, emphasizing the role of multiple integrated "images" (spatial, proprioceptive, and intentional) processed by different brain regions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The organism then has a model, or image, of the space in which it will act, of its body's relation to this space, and of its intended behavior or its goal. It is this intention image which very clearly distinguishes the Soviet approach from the ordinary reflex theory in England and the US. Anokhin has condemned the ordinary theory of the 'reflex arc' as an 'outstanding failure,' which 'shows the dualism of its creator' (Descartes), and 'distracts from a materialist solution to the problem of purposiveness.'"
**CONTEXT:** The author highlights the Soviet concept of the "intention image" or "acceptor of action" as a key departure from Western reflex theory, emphasizing its role in goal-directed behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "This intention image is the means for regulating behavior--for 'collating the actual and the intended'--and is sometimes called the 'acceptor of action.' That is, the action is refined, until the perceived result of the action corresponds accurately to the guiding image of the desired situation. Besides its usefulness in explaining the regulation of motor behavior, the mental image is also used to explain the feedback control of sense organs. The Soviet view of the function of the mental image in perception resembles some of the interpretations of Gestalt psychology, but the approach is fundamentally Marxist, in emphasizing the objectivity of the image, rather than Kantian, in looking for subjective or arbitrary tendencies or limitations in image formation. The Soviet theorist often emphasizes that we can always escape from old perceptual habits and mistaken hypotheses by having new experiences, and that the source of the organizing process is in the object, in its 'objectness,' and not in any formal tendency of the perceptual apparatus itself."
**CONTEXT:** This passage further details the function of the "intention image" and contrasts the Soviet emphasis on objective reality as the source of perception with Kantian and Gestalt perspectives.

**RAY PEAT:** "This difference between Gestalt and Dialectical theories of perception is very important in the practice and planning of science. A current idea in the west (consider the theories of Monod and Stent) is that basic scientific knowledge has gone nearly as far as it can go, so that no more radical discoveries should be expected or sought. This reasoning is partly based on the Gestalt or Neo-Kantian idea that our 'cognitive apparatus' has severe limitations on the kind of things it can know. The dialectical Soviet view is that radical change in fundamental science will always remain possible, and that the material world itself if undergoing essential, basic changes. In planning, this means that basic or general science will continue to be funded at least as well as it is at present. While a Western attitude has been 'analyze now, synthesize in future generations,' the dialectic attitude suggests that 'we need a Whole now, to achieve a better Whole in the future.'"
**CONTEXT:** The author contrasts the Western view of scientific progress as nearing completion with the Soviet dialectical perspective of continuous, fundamental change and the need for holistic understanding.

**RAY PEAT:** "If image and meaning are given priority over movement and form in describing the functioning of the brain, then science would seem to sanction the transformation of labor into perception. This is, in fact, an explicit trend and policy in the USSR. Recognizing that perception requires interaction with the object, we might say that 'consciousness is action.' Again, it is a belief of this sort that is responsible for the pervasive interaction of politics, culture, work, and science in Soviet life."
**CONTEXT:** This connects the Soviet emphasis on image and meaning to a broader societal philosophy where perception and action are intertwined, influencing the integration of various aspects of life.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian position is committed to the objective existence of generality: For the 'Dialectic' to operate in matter, without an overseeing God, the meaningful units (such as thesis and antithesis, and the social classes, etc.) must exist intrinsically in matter, which is just to say that generality has objective existence. The Marxian theory of perception appropriately incorporates the generalization function at a very early level of brain function, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. To the extent that the regulatory mental image doesn't constantly arouse the full orienting reflex because of slight disparities between intention and achievement or observation, it is generalized. A general class of achievement, or object or situation, will satisfy; further refinement may be undertaken, but only for a particular reason. The organism otherwise would become immersed in constant refinement of behavior. Since the orienting reflex becomes stronger at higher evolutionary levels, we can think of evolution as being away from facile generalization, and toward a more detailed understanding of matter. At these more refined levels, mistakes are more possible if sensory contact isn't maintained. This point relates to the Marxian belief that valid knowledge derives from practice and workability (Engels), and also to the Marxian idea that cultural forms and beliefs represent a superstructure, rationalizing power relationships or modes of production. If knowledge is derived deductively, rather than from practical experience, it is likely to be empty and mistaken, rather than a true refinement of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This passage delves into the Marxist underpinnings of the Soviet approach, emphasizing the objective existence of generality and the role of practice in knowledge acquisition, contrasting it with deductive reasoning.

**RAY PEAT:** "The common Marxian and Soviet view, that generality is an intrinsic part of perception, provides no basis for the belief (so common in western countries) that the progress of knowledge toward higher generality requires the fortuitous occurrence of 'geniuses.' Creativity is treated as an essential human trait, part of the human need for self-realization through productive work. Social support, including education, is considered to be the factor which causes great differences in creativity and intelligence, and not genetics. A genetic theory of intelligence is considered to be a mere rationalization for racist practices. Visual imagery is considered to be the basis of creative intelligence, and as such is studied with the intention of finding principles that can be used in education. Emotions (e.g., as measured by the galvanic skin response) are also considered to be an important component of inventive behavior, and are viewed as part of the image-forming process."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet perspective on creativity and intelligence, emphasizing environmental and social factors over genetics, and linking visual imagery and emotions to inventive behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "What sort of person, or culture, is it that sees 'exploration' as the strongest and most basic reflex of the organism? It obviously can't be one that fears new knowledge, and it presumably would be one that values science, progress, and freedom to grow. Starting from any holistic position, it doesn't seem peculiar to view curiosity, an instinct for exploration, or a desire to perceive, as the fundamental tendency of an organism. However, the western traditions in psychology and biology are not holistic, and the tendency toward integration of knowledge, as far as it exists, proceeds by correlations of accumulated facts, level by level, as if science were blind to wholes. Both the Marxian and the Russian traditions in science have largely ignored the distinction made elsewhere between psychology and biology, so that biological thinking is informed by the awareness of human needs and possibilities, and psychology is not thought of as being in any sense un-biological. The Marxian attitude is to work from wholes, and from futures or purposes, as interpretive frameworks, toward the so-called concrete facts and experiments. The Soviet concept of the orienting, or exploratory, reflex is the most important single holistic 'informing principle' in biology and psychology. It comes close to being the definition of an organism. It is not only important in this logical or philosophical sense, but it is frequently described as 'having an intensity greater than any other activity of the organism.' It dominates not only because it is holistic, but because it can be very strong, in the simplest physiological sense. There is nothing tenuous in this kind of holism."
**CONTEXT:** This passage introduces the Soviet concept of the "orienting reflex" as a fundamental, holistic principle of biological and psychological functioning, contrasting it with the fragmented approach of Western science.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov described this reflex as the 'what is it?' reflex. With more detailed knowledge of the brain, the reticular activating system of the brain stem has come to be considered as the most important location of the integrating and exciting processes in the orienting reflex: For example, aminazine, a chemical which selectively inhibits the reticular formation will block the reflex. But it is distinctly a reflex of the whole animal: Cortex, hypothalamus, sense organs, motor and autonomic processes are integral parts of it. It is the thing that makes learning possible, and every part of the organism participates in an appropriate way. Many western researchers have claimed that conditioning doesn't always involve the cortex, or that individual reflexes such as the heart reflex are separable things--'when you call the dog, first comes the pulse, then comes the dog.' These points are denied by all the leading Soviet workers, and considered to be mistakes of methodology or interpretation."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the physiological basis of the orienting reflex and reiterates the Soviet rejection of reductionist views that isolate specific reflexes from the whole organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The image, as already discussed in the preceding chapter, is the central part of the orienting reflex. An unfamiliar sound, for example, will arouse the animal so that all of its senses bear on the thing producing the sound, so that it can construct an image or 'reflection' of the thing in its consciousness; if the object (or required behavior) is familiar, the animal will be able to match its image with what it is perceiving so that recognition of the thing or execution of the action is immediate. The animal knows what to do with the object, and doesn't have to concern itself with investigation of it. A familiar environment frees the energies for other purposes, which (especially in apes and humans) may be a search for unfamiliar things. Some experiments with children suggest that an image emerges early in learning, and that it controls the subsequent functioning of the motor system, which is gradually 'assimilated,' and developed into a habit."
**CONTEXT:** This connects the orienting reflex to the formation and use of mental images, emphasizing their role in learning and adaptation.

**RAY PEAT:** "As familiarity and experience increase, the world becomes ampler for the organism, its range increases. This is exactly the opposite of a view that says that the animal, with each increment of learned behavior, becomes more specialized and limited. Learning is not a closing, but an opening of possibilities. The 'motor' theory, which neglects the fact that the organism is always oriented with regard to its environment, must see every learned precision as a restriction of the organism's freedom. In the West, we are constantly told that 'We must give up some freedom to attain mastery of' some behavior or technology which is desirable. On the social scale, we hear that specialists must not venture beyond their 'area of competence,' and that political specialists know what is best for society. American Behaviorism is a fine ideology for a society that wants to combine authoritarian government with a system of specialized training for specialized jobs, because it claims that finely controlled behavior must be specialized and exists as a constraint on behavior. The error, of course, is that they ignore the fact that there can be no behavior without orientation, and general understanding of the environment (the relevant world) is part of fine control of behavior."
**CONTEXT:** This passage critiques the Western behavioral view of learning as restrictive, contrasting it with the Soviet perspective of learning as an expansion of possibilities and a deepening of understanding, which is essential for true control.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers is one part of the idea of specific, energized attention; the sensory analyzer includes the sense organ, such as the eye or the vestibular apparatus, and related parts of the brain. It is emphasized that sensing is an active, intelligent process, in which features of the world are analyzed, selected, and linked with the organism."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's concept of "sensory analyzers" as active, intelligent systems that process sensory information and integrate it with the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "We hear most about the simple associative learning of Pavlov's dogs, but Pavlov went from the study of simple association to the investigation of learned sequences, or Dynamic Stereotypes. To understand a thing, its properties, besides being singly 'linked' with the organism by the sensory analyzers, must be linked together with each other, until they can be grasped simultaneously. This simultaneity is called 'objectness.'"
**CONTEXT:** The author highlights Pavlov's progression from simple association to the concept of "dynamic stereotypes" and "objectness," which involves the simultaneous integration of multiple properties into a unified perception.

**RAY PEAT:** "This composed simultaneity is an image of a thing or a process in the world. A goal of the organism is held in mind as such a simultaneity, and is the organism's criterion for completion or correctness of action. Anokhin pointed out that the 'stimulus-response' 'reflex arc' was incomplete without such a model of the appropriate reaction, and he called this model 'the acceptor of action.' These mental images, acceptors of action, are both models of intention, and models of what is known; novelty exists whenever the acceptor of action lacks any feature of the perceived environment. Intentional actions mobilize the organism's energy and focus it toward completion."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the concept of the "acceptor of action" as a mental model that guides behavior and allows for the processing of novelty, linking it to intentionality and goal-directed action.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian position is committed to the objective existence of generality: For the 'Dialectic' to operate in matter, without an overseeing God, the meaningful units (such as thesis and antithesis, and the social classes, etc.) must exist intrinsically in matter, which is just to say that generality has objective existence. The Marxian theory of perception appropriately incorporates the generalization function at a very early level of brain function, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. To the extent that the regulatory mental image doesn't constantly arouse the full orienting reflex because of slight disparities between intention and achievement or observation, it is generalized. A general class of achievement, or object or situation, will satisfy; further refinement may be undertaken, but only for a particular reason.

Since the orienting reflex becomes stronger at higher evolutionary levels, we can think of evolution as being away from facile generalization, and toward a more detailed understanding of matter. At these more refined levels, mistakes are more possible if sensory contact isn't maintained.

If knowledge is derived deductively, rather than from practical experience, it is likely to be empty and mistaken, rather than a true refinement of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This passage delves into the Marxist underpinnings of the Soviet approach, emphasizing the objective existence of generality and the role of practice in knowledge acquisition, contrasting it with deductive reasoning.

**RAY PEAT:** "The common Marxian and Soviet view, that generality is an intrinsic part of perception, provides no basis for the belief (so common in western countries) that the progress of knowledge toward higher generality requires the fortuitous occurrence of 'geniuses.'

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet perspective on creativity and intelligence, emphasizing environmental and social factors over genetics, and linking visual imagery and emotions to inventive behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov was the son of a priest, and studied at a seminary school, so he was thoroughly saturated with the Greek-derived ideas of the Eastern Church. For Pavlov, the world's essential property is that it is full of potential, and that we will know more in the future than we do at present. This centrality of time permeates the tradition of Pavlov. If time is real and the world is the source of knowledge, then science is seen as a basic life function, in which the brain is the organ for knowing the world and maintaining an equilibrium with it. The essential feature of the conditional reflex, as understood by Pavlov, was its temporariness; if it is a recognition of a temporary conjunction of events in the world, intelligence requires that it not persist longer than the condition in the environment does. But when learning has to do with the way the world actually works, one insight is enough to fix the knowledge forever; Pavlov said that when a cat learns how to open the latch to its cage, such learning has taken place, and the cat is doing something equivalent to science. (He also believed that such permanent, scientific learning was eventually incorporated into heredity as the instincts.)"
**CONTEXT:** This passage emphasizes Pavlov's philosophical orientation, rooted in his religious background and his view of the world as dynamic and knowable through time, influencing his understanding of conditional reflexes as temporary, adaptive learning.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the West, our idea of the 'conditioned reflex' has been exactly the opposite: we have emphasized its difference from insight-learning by ascribing to it a kind of brainless sluggishness, in which the role of time is reversed--it is slow to form, and slow to decay, but sure to decay, without regard to whether it is insightful or merely arbitrary."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the Western interpretation of conditioned reflexes as rigid and slow to decay with Pavlov's original concept of them as temporary and adaptive.

**RAY PEAT:** "Besides giving us a mistaken interpretation of Pavlov's work with the conditional reflex, the tradition started by J.B.Watson and continued by B. F. Skinner helped to make psychology remote from physiology as well as from morality. Skinner felt that his work had moved us 'beyond freedom and dignity,' and he saw the brain as such a neutral ground, or blank slate, that he said that the maternal contribution to the developing fetus is 'nothing but her genes.' To distinguish psychology from biology, he eliminated physiology from biology, leaving nothing but a timeless and rigid genetic determinism below his malleable 'environmentalism.'"
**CONTEXT:** The author criticizes Watson and Skinner for distorting Pavlov's work and for creating a psychology that is detached from physiology and morality, emphasizing a deterministic view of genetics and environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov recognized that there must be attention before learning could take place, and that the availability of brain energy was specific, and appeared according to the needs of the organism, and was provided by the hereditary instincts. Thus, when an animal attends to a new thing or situation, or when it explores, it is using a specific brain energy: He spoke of an instinct for exploration, for science ('a truth tropism'), for liberty, and dignity. The integrity of the organism requires opportunity for exploration, for freedom, etc., and Pavlov pointed out that psychiatry must treat mental patients with proper concern for their needs and rights. (The California researchers who found that rats' brains grow when their environment is enriched, and that the effects increase with subsequent generations, probably didn't know that they were validating two of Pavlov's basic doctrines.)"
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's emphasis on attention, brain energy, and innate instincts for exploration, freedom, and dignity as crucial for learning and well-being, and notes how later research validated these concepts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov was clear in saying that his purpose was eventually to explain how human consciousness works, so--even though he began his studies with the 'eating reflex' because 'nutrition is the most essential link between the organism and its environment'--it is natural that his group would look for ways to study questions such as the 'biology of intentions,' the perception of novelty, orientation, exploration, etc. Their major achievements can be seen as growing from Pavlov's observation that there is a specificity of attention deriving from a specific energizing of the brain."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's ultimate goal of understanding consciousness and how his research on basic reflexes evolved to explore more complex phenomena like intention and novelty, all stemming from the concept of specific brain energy and attention.

**RAY PEAT:** "The cortex is the mediator between inside and out. For an abstract person, like Descartes or Sartre or the average American scientist/salesman, all of reality is like a skin between the world and the self, leaving a vacuum for self and for world, except as there is arbitrary interaction in this abstract reality-skin. These are 'cortical' people in the sense that their interacting self has very little to do with their body's highly determinate needs; they are the people that Pavlov called 'intellectuals,' dominated by the 'second signalling system,' language. According to Pavlov, they aren't quite at home in the world."
**CONTEXT:** This passage contrasts the "cortical" or "intellectual" type, characterized by detachment and reliance on language, with a more integrated individual, suggesting the former are not fully grounded in their bodily reality.

**RAY PEAT:** "The type of person who grasms the world clearly and strongly, that Pavlov called the 'artistic' type, dominated by the 'first signalling system,' perception, isn't necessarily over-concrete, as Pavlov seemed to imply. The person who uses his body in an integrated way, investing his imagination in important aspects of the real world, can deal with all of the complex and general aspects of society and history, but does it with a sense of purpose, rather than with the Sartrean sense of arbitrary choice. (Sartre's description of the 'nausea' associated with this perception gives us a clear sense of the absence of orientation, physically resembling sea-sickness, in the extremely detached form of perception.)"
**CONTEXT:** This refines Pavlov's "artistic" type, arguing that a strong connection to perception and imagination, integrated with the body, leads to purposeful engagement with the world, unlike the detached, arbitrary experience described by Sartre.

**RAY PEAT:** "The body and the 'older' parts of the brain give precise shape to one's life, and the cortex helps to expand the possibilities that are open to that life. Apparently, as Pavlov said, the cortex can inhibit the lower parts of the brain, so that the body's own life doesn't enter the life of thought and communication. But the cortex is activated by processes in lower or older parts of the brain, so that it functions with the greatest energy and intensity when it is openly collaborating with the instincts."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the interplay between the older brain structures and the cortex, where the latter can both inhibit and be activated by the former, with optimal function occurring through collaboration with instincts.

**RAY PEAT:** "For centuries in western countries there has been an awareness of two very different kinds of sexuality. Sometimes these have been identified as 'sensual copulation' and 'Courtly Love,' or as irresponsible and dutiful sexual relations. This double attitude has occasionally been criticized, but it continues in the present culture to serve as the frame for much of the thinking and talking and political activity related to sex."
**CONTEXT:** The author points out a historical dichotomy in Western views of sexuality, which continues to shape contemporary attitudes.

**RAY PEAT:** "William Blake was one of the first people who clearly described a kind of being which is whole, or at least trying to be whole in opposition to the culture of doubleness. 'Thou hast a lap full of seed, And this is a fine country. Why dost thou not cast thy seed And live in it merrily? Shall I cast it on the sand And turn it into fruitful land? For on no other ground Can I sow my seed Without tearing up Some stinking weed.' 'Sand' apparently refers to a barren emotional state, which is an alternative to a distorted and complex growth of the emotions. Blake often referred to biblical ideas, but filled with reality and imagination things which had been only the moralistic thoughts of tribal priests--so this verse might relate to the injunction to 'spill your seed on a woman's belly rather than on the ground,' or something of the sort. Masturbation then would be one meaning of sand--and since in masturbation the energy flow is only in one direction, without exchange and complexification, the idea extends to include this kind of low-energy release in normal copulation. The 'stinking weed' is a negation (not a 'contrary') of this: A moralistic denial of sex for pleasure. (And of course the thicket of emotional and ideological problems which accompany that attitude.) So Blake presents this unpleasant choice, with an indication that there is something better, a 'fruitful land.' His whole work contains the belief that sexual energy must be expressed in imaginative fullness, with regard to all of human existence."
**CONTEXT:** This passage uses William Blake's poetry to illustrate the concept of a "whole" being, contrasting it with a culture of "doubleness" and exploring the idea of sexual energy being expressed with imaginative fullness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Wilhelm Reich, who broke away from the psychoanalytic movement because of his marxian beliefs and his 'sex-politics,' tried to analyze sexual repression in a biological way. His analysis was the same as Blake's: Both of the culture's sexual alternatives are the result of 'armoring,' or rigidifying, of the organism. He said that 'four-lettering' is not the same as making love, but that it is accepted by the repressive society because it is passive, and less dangerous than full sexuality."
**CONTEXT:** This connects Reich's biological analysis of sexual repression to Blake's ideas, highlighting the concept of "armoring" and the societal acceptance of less potent forms of sexuality.

**RAY PEAT:** "For several decades in the U.S. and Europe there has been a lot of interest in 'relaxation therapy,' 'positive thinking,' and other ways of avoiding 'tension.' Zen and various anti-sexual religions have more recently been grafted onto our own anti-sexual Christian culture. 'If there is no adequate way to discharge tension, then don't allow the tension to develop,' is their principle."
**CONTEXT:** The author points out a trend in Western culture towards avoiding tension, linking it to various therapies and anti-sexual philosophies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stated in terms of the brain's cortex and the older 'activating' system of the brain stem, this doctrine would be: 'Let the mind/cortex deal with reality, and the body/reflexes will take care of sex.' Too often, what this means is that the cortex and language just have the function of being a short-circuit between bodies. Apparently this is what Blake meant when he said 'Never seek to tell thy love Love that never told can be; For the gentle wind does move Silently, invisibly.'"
**CONTEXT:** This translates the tension-avoidance doctrine into a brain-based model, suggesting a disconnect between the cortex and bodily functions, and referencing Blake to illustrate this disconnect.

**RAY PEAT:** "The mechanical aspects of sexual excitation--genital friction, etc.--are the usual subject of the 'neurophysiology of sex.' Presumably, sensory nerves in the genitals contribute to increased tension in the autonomic nervous system, including the nerves of the pelvic ganglion. Whatever brain-like quality these visceral ganglia may have, they are still deeply integrated with the central nervous system and the cortex. One general kind of integration is the 'setting' of the level at which reflex activity will occur. This control is probably exerted by a balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and by the rate of stimulation, and by chemical influences. The dreaming (rapid eye movement) phase of sleep is apparently a time of great trophic influences of the brain on the body, and it is likely that similar activation of the imagination during the waking state also has an activating and trophic influence on the various tissues. The setting of reflexes and thresholds must be a complex process, relating to the whole life of the organism. If the local sexual autonomic nerves are isolated from the stabilizing influences of the brain, the orgasm reflex can probably occur almost without sensation--a 'genital' or 'pelvic orgasm' may be little more than a mild peristaltic movement of the tubular acts as a 'capacitor' or reservoir by preserving tension until the entire personality experiences 'resolution' and satisfaction, then the tension can spread throughout the autonomic nervous system, and produce an intensely pleasurable discharge throughout the body, possibly involving some 'pleasure center' in the brain."
**CONTEXT:** This delves into the neurophysiology of sexual excitation, emphasizing the integration of autonomic and central nervous systems, the role of trophic influences, and the concept of reflex setting.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another way of thinking of tension, besides 'reflex setting' and ganglion stabilizing, but describing the same process, is this: The autonomic system tends to maintain balance between its two sides, sympathetic and parasympathetic; if one side is stimulated so its activity increases, the other side increases its tone, to maintain an approximate functional balance in the innervated system. (The quickness and appropriateness of emotional response probably relates partly to the residual 'tone' of the autonomic system. This is a factor in 'types' of nervous system.) The image would be that of alternately lengthening the legs of stilts--if they are in balance, you can go very high. Some Reichians think of this process as a basis for pathology, not health. But as long as the tension is responsive, and the organism can achieve resolution and discharge, it is obviously not pathological."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the concept of autonomic balance and its role in emotional response and sexual tension, framing it as a dynamic process rather than a pathology.

**RAY PEAT:** "The balance isn't invisible and exact--physiological changes occur in the process. The 'Effect of Person,' which exists not only in people and dogs as a slowing of heart rate (bradycardia), but even in lower organisms as an electrophysiological response, is such a physiological change toward parasympathetic arousal, and during orgasm the bradycardia suddenly becomes extreme--the rhythm changes so suddenly that the heart seems to have stopped. The explanation for this continuity, from 'Effect of Person' to orgasm, seems to be that excitement and desire exist as a tension of approximated balance, and that with resolution, the 'expectancy' tension of the sympathetic system falls away, leaving parasympathetic dominance."
**CONTEXT:** This connects the "Effect of Person" to orgasm through the lens of autonomic balance, highlighting the shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance.

**RAY PEAT:** "The para-sympathetic dominance is very similar to the vegetative state of sleep. Cortical resolution, with inhibition replacing excitation, is probably another aspect of this process. Two things are implied by this analysis: That we can by-pass the cortex if we can't stand the tension (two ways are common in our dichotomous culture--'let's get married,' and 'let's fuck'), and that if we choose the way of tension we find that our character, our whole way of being in the world, is involved in the way we accumulate and distribute and discharge tension. We find that we will take in perceptions and attitudes from the one we are loving, exchanging perspectives and worlds and bodies. As the personality experiences resolution, we find that our world changes. (Loving intensely is thus a form of objective scientific research--getting new knowledge about the world.) Once we see the interaction of tension and growth, desire and discovery, we realize that sex and imagination are deeply involved in what we can be--that our human existence is expandable and shrinkable."
**CONTEXT:** This passage draws parallels between parasympathetic dominance, sleep, and the process of loving, suggesting that embracing tension and engaging in loving interaction leads to personal transformation and expanded possibilities.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just as the brain stimulates and maintains the other tissues, and each hemisphere has a trophic, stimulating effect on the other, the older, instinctive systems of the brain activate the cortex, and exert a trophic, growth-promoting influence on it. Wild animals have larger brains than caged ones, which implies that life and freedom are brain stimulants. Problems are opportunities. People can be the richest kind of opportunity, the most stimulating kind of problem. To do this they have to arouse tension. (Blake said 'opposition is true friendship.') This is not to advocate competition. Competition tries to eliminate the problem by defeating an opponent, and can exist only in the armored character, which allows energy to flow only in one direction, and which can't tolerate tension."
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the importance of stimulation, freedom, and even "opposition" (in the sense of challenge) for brain growth and development, contrasting this with a rigid, "armored" character that avoids tension.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov emphasized that the cortex always participates in awareness and behavior, so that the various biological activities of the organism will be oriented with relation to the world; according to his perspective, Reich's 'armored' character would probably be considered a variety of hysteria, with cortical weakness, especially weakness of the inhibitory-trophic processes. Muscular tension, for example, increases when the cortex is removed. Where many Reichians consider tension of muscles to be an active inhibition of natural energy flow, the problem might be a failure of brain activity to actively relax them, as in the 'rapid eye movement' phase of sleep. This relaxation probably results from processes that occur in both the waking and the sleeping cortex."
**CONTEXT:** This applies Pavlov's principles to Reich's concept of "armoring," suggesting that muscular tension in such individuals may stem from cortical weakness and a failure of inhibitory-trophic processes, rather than an active inhibition of energy flow.

**RAY PEAT:** "In spite of the emphasis on the cortex, sub-cortical structures are recognized by the Russians to have many generalized functions (besides serving to activate the cortex, produce dreams, etc.) The autonomic system, for example, is believed to be largely responsible for trophic, regenerative processes. Immunological memory is a particularly interesting case, in which all levels of evolution seem to coexist and collaborate. Even plants can be hypersensitized, and have antibody-like substances (hemaglutinins, etc.), as do various primitive animals which have no white blood cells or lymphocytes, and this same kind of tissue sensitivity seems to coexist in higher animals with the specialized immune systems. The cellular immune response can be modified through the nervous system, and the conditioned reflexes can be formed for specific antibody responses. I. P. Ashmarin (Zh. Evol. Biokhimii i Fiziologii, No. 3, pp. 2170224, 1973) has suggested that neurological memory is built on immunological memory, which is built on hereditary memory. These other levels of memory, control, responsiveness, have to be kept in mind while considering the cortex: The cortex participates in all of these processes, but each level has its own life and contributes to the other levels. The coordination of these levels is health."
**CONTEXT:** This broadens the discussion to include subcortical structures and their roles in trophic processes and immunological memory, suggesting a layered system of memory and control that the cortex integrates.

**RAY PEAT:** "American Behaviorism has given to the phrase 'conditioned reflex' a connotation of 'involuntary, unconscious behavior which is built up by repetition.' In Pavlov's use of the phrase, though, there was no such implication. In his usage, this brain function can be instantaneous and insightful. His purpose was to explain the way we are. Too many American Behaviorists deliberately leave an unexplained residue (creativity, single-trial learning, sudden insight, Gestalt formation, etc.) which has to be filled by dualistic constructions, magical processes, or Kantian limitations to allowable, possible, knowledge. Pavlov (February 6, 1935) discussed this aspect of Sherrington: 'Sherrington himself investigated the reflex activity of the spinal cord, but he is decidedly against attributing this activity to the higher parts, to the brain; in the latter case this structure becomes in their eyes hypothetical. This is animist reasoning. Sherrington has built a nest of animism. This is proved by the fact that he doubts whether the mind has any relation to the nervous system. Hence the mind is something beyond and above the nervous system, something that can be detached from the nervous activity altogether. I can understand the influence usually exerted by a teacher on his pupils. But must all the pupils necessarily be animists if their teacher is an animist? Is there really such intellectual serfdom among Englishmen?'"
**CONTEXT:** This passage directly confronts the misinterpretation of Pavlov's "conditioned reflex" in American Behaviorism and quotes Pavlov's critique of Sherrington's dualistic view of mind and nervous system.

**RAY PEAT:** "A typical Anglo-American follower of Sherrington is G. Hoyle; he illustrates the persistence of this dualism. While pithing a croaking, struggling frog in a neurophysiology lab, he said 'we can't know that a frog experiences pain, because he can't speak to us.' And, having the illusion that I was a psychology major, he repeatedly asked whether I was going to study 'the nervous system, or the mind?'"
**CONTEXT:** This provides a contemporary example of the persistent dualistic thinking in Western science, as exemplified by a neurophysiology professor's question.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov spoke of a 'Reflex of Purpose' and a 'Reflex of Freedom.' He was aware of the political significance of psychological theories. He claimed we have a real, biological need to be free and purposive. This is utterly opposed to arguments such as Skinner's in Beyond Freedom and Dignity. Skinner's claim that we have no instinctive desires is needed to justify the friendly fascism that he advocated. (Usually, the people who argue that we have no good instinctive urges--such as sex--are the same people who argue that aggression is innate: Our culture still teaches about sexless Eden and Original Sin.)"
**CONTEXT:** This connects Pavlov's concepts of "Reflex of Purpose" and "Reflex of Freedom" to political implications, contrasting them with Skinner's views and cultural narratives about sex and aggression.

**RAY PEAT:** "Part of the world of stimuli is internal, within the body, even within the nervous system (spontaneous activity of neurons). Considering the cortex as the mediator between inside and out, we see the internal energies and forms expanding outward, through the brain and through the eyes and other senses, and interacting with the forms and processes of the world."
**CONTEXT:** This describes the cortex as a mediator, integrating internal bodily states and spontaneous neural activity with external environmental stimuli.

**RAY PEAT:** "This general scheme was proposed in the 18th century by Blake, who was the first person to really incorporate biology into a vision of the world. There was much more biological information available in the 18th century than we usually realize, since people like Swedenborg, Buffon, Lamarck, and Erasmus Darwin, whose ideas were suppressed by their contemporary bigots, are still unfairly treated by our contemporary bigots, who have falsified our historical picture of 18th century biology. Blake described several degrees of consciousness, which we can now see were degrees of cortical isolation from or integration with the rest of the body--ways of being which admit energy and desire to varying degrees."
**CONTEXT:** This links Blake's 18th-century work to a holistic, biologically informed worldview, suggesting that his ideas about degrees of consciousness relate to the integration or isolation of the cortex from the body.

**RAY PEAT:** "'Single vision' was his term for the abstracted science of the Newtonians, who said that only extension and mass were real, classifying everything else as 'secondary qualities.' 'In a year of dearth,' Blake said, referring to this mental poverty, 'bring out weight, measure, and number.' Time and space are reduced to series of 'infinitesimals,' to facilitate calculation."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Blake's concept of "single vision" as a reductionist, materialistic approach to science, exemplified by Newtonian physics.

**RAY PEAT:** "'Ordinary practical consciousness,' in which colors are experienced, but only passively or for utility, he called twofold vision. Dream vision, in which the intrinsic beauty of being is enjoyed as images are constructed, was threefold vision. But one's own responsibility for being and imagining and knowing is not recognized in this state, so it is somewhat delusive--typically, this state evaporates as we try to participate actively in it ('The Crystal Cabinet,' for example). In fourfold vision, the person recognizes his own active perceptual process, and also sees this active perceptual 'humanness' as an objective property of the world. The split between subjective and objective doesn't exist; there is a kind of full resonance between self and world."
**CONTEXT:** This outlines Blake's progression of vision, from "single" to "fourfold," culminating in a state of resonance between self and world, where subjective and objective are unified.

**RAY PEAT:** "The self is a time-spanner, unifying past, present, and future. Blake affirmed that, while there is a 'limit to contraction, there is no limit to expansion.' Analysis is limited, energetic life is unlimited. In this view, sexual love is an ultimate affirmation of self, other, and world."
**CONTEXT:** This passage emphasizes Blake's concept of the self as a temporal unifier and the unlimited potential of energetic life, positioning sexual love as a profound affirmation of existence.

**RAY PEAT:** "Everything possible to be believed Is an image of truth. W. Blake"
**CONTEXT:** This quote from William Blake is presented as a guiding principle for understanding the relationship between belief, imagery, and truth.

**RAY PEAT:** "Until our most exciting discoveries can be fully integrated and taken as a part of our background, we can't advance beyond them. They have to alter our perspectives by taking their place in our cultural framework."
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the importance of integrating new knowledge into our existing cultural framework to facilitate further progress.

**RAY PEAT:** "At the present primitive-tyrannical state of mass communication, this emotional-energetic aspect of discovery would limit us to only a little progress in a lifetime, if we had only the large culture of civilization. The sexual pair, and other personal groupings, are where culture and discovery really exist."
**CONTEXT:** This suggests that genuine cultural and scientific discovery thrives in intimate personal relationships rather than in mass communication.

**RAY PEAT:** "If our brain is really sexual in its optimal functioning, then we should work out the implications of this: That knowing is for others. If everything is known by forming a dominant for it (personal gesture, object gesture, etc.), then knowing is for the world, knowledge is responsibility."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes a connection between optimal brain function, sexuality, and the idea that knowledge is inherently social and carries responsibility.

**RAY PEAT:** "When an individual enters a group with a loving expectancy, the nature of the group is changed, expanded. The world known by each person is extended. (It's analogous to adding a section to the perimeter of a circle: The angle of the curve is opened with each addition.) Any little perception that is given is likely to come back better. When another person understands your perception, its truth is evaluated. ('Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believed.')"
**CONTEXT:** This describes the transformative power of positive social interaction, where a loving attitude expands individual and group understanding, and truth is validated through mutual comprehension.

**RAY PEAT:** "When a person uses my perception, they are thinking with my mind, and this allows me to advance, energizes my advance. Their new and appropriate way of using it expands my perceptions and my possibilities. Does it feel like this to others when I feel myself 'thinking with their mind'?"
**CONTEXT:** This explores the reciprocal nature of intellectual growth through shared perception and thinking, highlighting how engaging with another's perspective can foster personal advancement.

**RAY PEAT:** "The belief that reality is a closed system goes with the belief that we can advance only by hindering someone else. Just as 'entropy increases in a closed system,' such an ethic tends to spread shrinking withdrawal and hostility. Doing something from a social motivation seems to detract from its intrinsic goodness, according to this view. Doubt, quantifiable knowledge, knowing as discrimination rather than as synthesis, are functions of a shrinking self, absorbing energy. But the expansive pursuit of knowledge is one of the strongest social bonds, because we perceive others as vital parts of our selves."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts a closed, competitive worldview with an expansive, collaborative pursuit of knowledge, linking the latter to social bonding and a sense of interconnectedness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Metabolic energy can illuminate patterns in the world, generalities. These new perceptions will liberate metabolic energy when taken up by another person, so that communication is energizing."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes a bioenergetic link between perception, communication, and metabolic energy, suggesting that shared understanding can be energizing.

**RAY PEAT:** "Inhibition has a bad name in America. The common understanding of the term grows out of popular Freudianism: e.g., libidinous urges must (or must not) be inhibited--that is, energies are rigidly instinctual, and can only be deformed by operating within a social framework. In Russian thinking, however, inhibition has both a general organismic meaning, and a cellular meaning, which have nothing to do with the popular meaning of the word. In Anglo-American neurology, cellular inhibition is generally believed to be a matter of specialized inhibitory nerves and inhibitory substances, while in the Russian tradition the tendency is to think of it in a more generalized way, as something that can be applied to any cell, nervous or otherwise. This difference leads to some therapeutic and preventive approaches in Russia that seem unscientific in the West."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces the concept of inhibition, contrasting the popular Freudian interpretation with the broader Russian understanding, which encompasses both organismic and cellular levels and is seen as more generalized and less tied to moralistic control.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sechenov, the 'father of Russian physiology,' was the first to observe nerve cell inhibition: he found that a frog's spinal reflexes, such as kicking, could be suppressed by intense stimulation of the sensory nerves. Vedensky then found that an individual nerve became inhibited if stimulation were too intense or too frequent, and that this was not mere fatigue, since it could begin functioning immediately under weaker stimulation. Pavlov found many conditions in which a particular behavior could be inhibited, and also noticed that the entire nervous system could go into an inhibited state. He discovered that inhibition is not an inactive state, but that the cell is cut off from stimuli, and undergoes a process of restoration. During excitation, there is a build-up of ammonia, lactic acid, and inorganic phosphate within and around the nerve cell, as well as a depletion of energy reserve and even a change in the condition of the cell proteins themselves. (E.g., Berestovskiy, G.N., et al., 'Study of the cumulative structural changes in a nerve fiber during rhythmic stimulation using optical techniques,' Tsitologiya 14(12), 1461-67, 1972.) Pavlov suggested that psychosis may be a state in which the nervous system goes into partial inhibition to restore itself, and prevent complete exhaustion and death. Recently in England and the United States, R. D. Laing has proposed the same idea: that insanity is potentially a recuperative process, if we don't punish patients with our treatments. An obvious approach to treatment--from the Russian point of view--is to help the patient regain his nervous 'energy potential.' Nutrition, rest, and even direct supplementation of the high energy substances are possible approaches. Certain kinds of weak stimulation can also be used to reinforce the inhibition and promote sleep."
**CONTEXT:** This traces the historical development of the concept of inhibition in Russian physiology, from Sechenov to Pavlov, highlighting its role in restoration and its potential connection to psychosis, and suggesting therapeutic approaches focused on restoring nervous energy.

**RAY PEAT:** "This use of weak stimulation to promote inhibition is particularly interesting, and related studies are being done by a few people in the West. Recalling the idea that an organism 'selects an environment' to which it can respond during its evolutionary development in the world, we can see that there will be an infinity of events both 'above' and 'below' the part of the environment used by the organism, and that just as the organism uses inhibition to protect itself from excessively strong stimuli which would destroy it, it can use inhibition to avoid the endless fatigue of being alert to irrelevant and 'small' stimuli. Normally, this inhibition seems to be very flexible: we can learn to concentrate on different kinds of things, and we can shift our attention and instantaneously change our pattern of inhibitions. Some psychoses apparently involve a failure of this kind of inhibition, and it has been suggested that abnormal behavior may be an indirect way of defending oneself against excessive stimulation (e.g., Hoffer). This need for selectivity is apparently what accounts for the development of a system in which weak stimulation promotes inhibition. The kind of inhibition produced by weak stimuli is very different from that produced by excessive excitation: it represents a state of heightened (rather than impaired) readiness."
**CONTEXT:** This explores the function of inhibition in selective attention and protection from overstimulation, suggesting that weak stimulation can promote a state of heightened readiness, and that failures in this system may underlie some psychoses.

**RAY PEAT:** "We can think of two zones of inhibition, separated by a state of activity: The 'lower' zone somewhat resembles lower forms of life, and borders on death (the 'parabiotic' state), while the higher zone of inhibition is a highly structured state with higher energy reserves even than the active state--it is a state of 'high readiness.' (There may be another active state between 'lower inhibition' and death, since exhausted and unconscious people and animals frequently regain consciousness briefly just before dying.)"
**CONTEXT:** This describes two distinct zones of inhibition: a lower, potentially life-threatening state, and a higher, more structured state of readiness and high energy reserves.

**RAY PEAT:** "The various states of the nerve cell can be appropriately thought of as different degrees of 'tightness' of the protein gel structure of the cell substance. Mild mechanical or chemical stimulation (e.g., small doses of caffeine) will inhibit the nerve tissue, and in doing so will make the cells impermeable to penetration by foreign substances such as dyes, and will improve their resistance to oxygen deprivation. On the other hand, excessive stimulation increases their permeability to dyes. The so-called 'blood-brain barrier' is an illustration of this resistance to foreign materials by cells in their normal 'tight' condition."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes a biophysical model where nerve cell states are related to the "tightness" of their protein gel structure, with mild stimulation promoting inhibition and resistance, while excessive stimulation leads to increased permeability.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sleep, by restoring the 'high energy' state of readiness, affects all the tissues of the body through the effects of the nervous system. Many people who have migraine headaches, for example, have discovered that just a few moments of sleep--just drifting into the dreamy forgetful state--can interrupt the regular progression of symptoms, if it comes before the pain is so intense that it make sleep impossible. Some women have discovered that a short nap can interrupt their monthly cramps. Since the 'cause' of menstruation is the disappearance of progesterone while estrogen is still at a high level, these cramps can probably be attributed to estrogen's promotion of an excited state in the cells of the uterus, equivalent to the epileptic seizures that can be produced by higher quantities in the brain. Exactly how sleep and its state of primary inhibition can manage to offset the uncontrolled activity of cramping muscles isn't clear: It might be a direct inhibitory effect of nerves, or an indirect effect such as an increased concentration of blood sugar."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the restorative power of sleep, linking it to the "high energy" state of readiness and its potential to alleviate symptoms like migraine and menstrual cramps, possibly through direct neural inhibition or indirect metabolic effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "The fact that women have migraine much more often than men, and that it is usually related to the menstrual cycle, suggests that an estrogen imbalance may be involved some way in migraine, which makes the effect of sleep on both cramps and migraine especially interesting. Migraine is often considered to be an uncontrolled dilation of blood vessels in the head (very much like hemorrhoids except for the location) possibly resulting from depletion of a substance which constricts vessels. Blood sugar also seems to be low in migraine, so that some people find that eating a large amount of ice cream can interrupt the symptoms. This observation might be what we need to understand the role of sleep in health. We all know how hard it is to sleep when we are hungry (low blood sugar), and how sleepy we sometimes get after a big meal. Low sugar levels in the blood can literally starve some cells into malfunctioning: This is how insulin shock causes convulsions and hallucinations. The hallucinations that occur in cancer may also indicate cell starvation. (Shapot, et al., have demonstrated that cancer always disturbs sugar metabolism.) Usually, a cell emergency will cause surrounding blood vessels to dilate, to allow more blood to be delivered to meet its needs. The adaptive release of transmitter substances is probably part of this process, and increased production of carbon dioxide and lactic acid will cause the vessels to dilate locally. Additionally, mere exhaustion from sugar-starvation is a factor in causing the blood vessel muscles to go slack and cause localized symptoms. How would estrogen be involved in this kind of process? Something I noticed in my work with hamsters may be relevant: Estrogen in excess causes wastage of both oxygen and sugar. If sleep inhibition can merely restore enough stability somewhere in the body that the wastage becomes manageable, adequate cell nutrition would again become possible. Since 'migrainoid' people typically have very high levels of brain electrical activity, the brain itself might be a significant energy drain. (It has been estimated that the brain uses 25% of the body's energy, and it is almost completely dependent on glucose for its energy.) 'Plugging' this drain could cause a sudden rise in blood sugar and other nutrients, allowing the exhausted cells to recover their energy and their stability. A state of 'high readiness' seems to be an efficient state, in its use of oxygen and food."
**CONTEXT:** This passage explores the potential link between estrogen, blood sugar, brain energy, and migraine, suggesting that sleep's inhibitory effects might help manage energy wastage and restore cellular function, particularly in the brain.

**RAY PEAT:** "Disturbed intestinal absorption of sugar might also be a factor in this energy problem. And reflexive distribution of tension in the autonomic nervous system is definitely involved. The entire nervous system is 'meaningfully' interrelated, so that, for example, stretching of (or pressure on) the rectum will decrease diuresis (urine formation) causing the organism to retain water (N. A. Miasoyedova), and intestinal muscle tone will change, blood pressure will be altered, etc. If the stimulation of an organ (for example, the rectum) is extreme, relative to the resistance of the organism, a pathological condition may appear, such as a disturbance of heart rhythm. Even epileptiform convulsions can be induced by such stimulation--for example, irritation of nerves in the lungs is a factor in the convulsions produced by breathing excessively high concentrations of oxygen (Chernigovskiy, Interoceptors, 1967). This shouldn't be surprising, since it used to be common knowledge that intestinal worms cause dogs to have fits, and caused children to cough--but since penicillin became more popular than worm-medicine, many people seem to have forgotten their folk-wisdom. Even something as simple as inflating a balloon in the stomach can cause changes in the cellular composition of the blood. Obviously, toxic or allergenic materials in the digestive tract will have similar effects. 'Allergenic' means anything which irritates by way of the immune system, and will vary according to the excitability of the individual. Excitation is increased when blood sugar is low, and when this state was induced by insulin, it was found that a slight stimulation of the intestine provoked strong, disorganized motor activity in the animal, including asthma-like reactions. Other studies show the same association of blood sugar with allergic reactions."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the interconnectedness of the nervous system and the digestive tract, suggesting that issues in one area can impact the other, and that factors like blood sugar levels and intestinal irritation can influence overall physiological and psychological states.

**RAY PEAT:** "The old tradition of Russian medicine, 'nervism,' which reminded physicians that the brain must always be considered to have a role in sickness and recovery, has been enriched by the work of Pavlov and his successors. The tradition's most valuable lesson for American medicine might be its optimism, based on the idea of plasticity, and especially its recognition that cells (especially nerve cells) which have stopped functioning might just be in the low-energy state of protective inhibition ('parabiosis'), and able to recover when their energy is restored. Rest, nutrition, and appropriate stimulation are at the center of scientific medicine."
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the "nervism" tradition in Russian medicine, which posits the brain's central role in all illness and recovery, and highlights the optimistic view of neural plasticity and the potential for recovery through rest, nutrition, and stimulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Extracts of glands and other tissues have been used for generations to treat nervous diseases (e.g., Filatov, 1945). Thyroid, with or without gonadal extracts, has been widely used to treat nervous and mental disease. L. V. Polezhaev (Loss and Restoration of Regenerative capacity in Tissues and Organs of Animals, Harvard Univ. Press, 1972) has remarked that some of these treatments for neuropsychic diseases also promote regeneration, growth, and multiplication of nerve cells. Filatov, Polezhaev and others have clearly demonstrated regeneration of nerve tissue in the brain, cerebral cortex, and optic nerve."
**CONTEXT:** This discusses the historical use of tissue extracts, particularly thyroid and gonadal extracts, in treating nervous and mental diseases, and highlights research demonstrating the regeneration of nerve tissue.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think it was around 1950 that I first read of Polezhaev's work with stimulated regeneration. Ever since then I have not only admired the scientific intelligence of his work, but I have followed with dismay the way most scientists ignore, suppress, or ridicule his important basic discoveries. Regeneration relates so closely to aging research, it seems to trigger the same anxious and hysterical response. Apparently, in repressing the fear of death, many people develop a displaced fear of the possibility of solving the riddle of aging and death. When work of this nature becomes acceptable to our culture, I predict that its history will be reinvented, and its nature somehow transformed so as to isolate its fearsome origins, and keep them repressed."
**CONTEXT:** The author expresses dismay at the suppression of research on nerve regeneration, linking it to a cultural fear of aging and death, and predicting a future reinterpretation of such work.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ultimately, therapy for the mind implies therapy for the body and the world."
**CONTEXT:** This concluding statement emphasizes the holistic nature of healing, asserting that mental well-being is inseparable from the health of the body and the surrounding world.

**RAY PEAT:** "The downfall of Gurwitsch and his mitogenetic rays seems to have been a result largely of his proposal for overcoming the criticism that such weak rays couldn't penetrate so far through living tissue: What he suggested was strange sounding to people who knew a little physics. He proposed that the radiation was comparable to a chain reaction, in which the products of the first reaction initiate a second, etc., except that all the reactions and their products are the same. An adequate unit of radiation striking a cell may either cause that cell to divide, or enable the cell to release a radiation or both. What otherwise would be a barrier to the radiation may, by resonance, emit a 'secondary radiation.' The properties of the secondary radiation are essentially those of the primary radiation. 'In this way the original stimulus from the external source can be propagated through the interior of the culture or tissue.' (Crile's discussion of the rays.) '...it was found that the radiation emanating from the root tip originated in the onion sole. The transmission of these rays lengthwise through the root apparently did not impair their power to stimulate cell division, even beyond the tip of the root.' But 'the root in cross section was only slightly transparent to the radiation.' In the early 1930s the Gurvitsches (A & L) studied the spectrum emitted by nerves and by chemical solutions subjected to mitogenetic rays from an external source:"
**CONTEXT:** This passage introduces the concept of mitogenetic rays and Gurwitsch's theory of their propagation through living tissue via a chain reaction or resonance, highlighting the initial skepticism due to its unconventional nature.

**RAY PEAT:** "Substances which, in undergoing decomposition by fermentation or hydrolysis, emit at that moment a radiation of a definite spectrum, respond to irradiation by an identical spectrum, by emitting the same spectrum, as a secondary radiation. In case of irradiation with a different spectrum, the secondary radiation is absent or at any rate very weak. This fact, unexpected enough by itself, becomes more difficult to interpret if one considers the results of monochromatic irradiation. It is not merely the band in question which reappears in the secondary spectrum, but the latter in its entirety, in infraction of Stoke's law. If we take, for example, the band 2170-2180 A of the glycolytic spectrum as irradiator for a solution of glucose, the secondary spectrum emitted by the latter contains also the shortest band (1900-1920) belonging to the glycolytic spectrum. (From L'analyse Mitogenetique Spectrale, Paris, Hermann, 1934.)"
**CONTEXT:** This details the Gurvitsches' findings on spectral analysis of secondary radiation, noting its unexpected adherence to the original spectrum and violation of Stoke's law, suggesting a resonance phenomenon.

**RAY PEAT:** "O. Glasser and M. Schott conclude that the behavior is 'paradoxical' and the theories are 'difficult to accept.' Others proposed a diffusible substance that would account for the induction of mitosis, but this conflicted with Gurwitsch's original observation, as well as later experiments; He noticed that the mitoses appearing around a wound in the cornea could be blocked on one side in a way that resembled a 'shadow'--the borders were straight, which would not be the case if molecular diffusion were the inducer. This was what led him to postulate mitogenetic radiation. Later, a cellophane membrane was used to separate the source and the receiver, but opponents showed that the film was permeable to gases. So Gurwitsch used a quartz sheet for the separation, since this would allow u.v. radiation to pass, but his opponents continued to insist that even the quartz must be permeable to a chemical inducer."
**CONTEXT:** This outlines the criticisms and experimental challenges faced by Gurwitsch's theory, particularly the resistance to accepting radiation as a mechanism over diffusion.

**RAY PEAT:** "In a symposium (Naval Research Lab, Washington, D.C., Oct., 1973) A. L. Schawlow (Stanford) predicted that laser light will be used to control chemical reactions by tuning in on the energy levels of particular molecular bonds. If Gurwitsch had used these terms to describe his phenomenon, it could have been more easily accepted as a kind of catalysis, releasing chemical energy (or biological energy), rather than as a kind of fluorescence which would violate Stoke's law. (Even conventional theorists recognize cases in which thermal energy can contribute slightly to the excitation process of photoluminescence. Schawlow also commented that 'anything will lase if you hit it hard enough,' and demonstrated with a picture of lasing jello. Lasing gelatin may be more than a joke. The unique photoelectric properties of protein are recognized in the use of gelatin in photographic emulsions. Szent-Gyorgyi has written a few books arguing that the properties of life depend on the electronic or photoelectric properties of the protein-water gel. Fluorescence and resonance have been proposed as a possible basis for nerve function. The fact that water is ordered in cells, and appears to be arranged longitudinally in nerves would seem appropriate if the gel structure is involved in the longitudinal conductivity of nerves. The observation that the gross conductivity of the brain is decreased by exhaustion (Crile, p. 200) and that the brain's electrical gradient is lower in fatigue led me to consider an electronic approach to consciousness, which relates the 'Hopkins-Szent-Gyorgyi-Racker electron pool' to the states of consciousness, as well as to mitosis."
**CONTEXT:** This connects Gurwitsch's work to modern laser technology and the photoelectric properties of proteins, suggesting that his phenomena could be understood as resonance or catalysis, and introduces Szent-Gyorgyi's ideas on the role of electrons in life processes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Crile's observation that exhaustion, conductivity and tissue fluorescence are related suggests that Pavlov's idea of 'transmarginal inhibition' resulting from over-stimulation, and being involved in psychosis, could be another aspect of the same cellular event. It is now known that this kind of inhibition involves high levels of ammonia and other metabolites in nerve cells, a low level of energy-rich substances, and changes in proteins resembling denaturation. Niacin's role in schizophrenia (Hoffer and Osmond) might result from its involvement in reducing glutathione, which is in equilibrium with the 'loose' electrons of cell proteins."
**CONTEXT:** This links Crile's observations on tissue fluorescence to Pavlov's concept of "transmarginal inhibition" and its potential role in psychosis, suggesting a common cellular mechanism involving energy levels and protein states, with niacin playing a role in regulating electron availability.

**RAY PEAT:** "The existence of long-range order in water has opened up a new way of viewing effects of 'low energy' light on chemical reactions: Solvent modifies reactions, solvent has memory, solvent can respond to energies too low for the reacting molecule itself to respond to. The long-range 'domains' in the solvent system can act as a sort of antenna, absorbing energy that isn't strong enough to directly act on chemical bonds. Also, the existence of laser technology is forcing people to recognize a little more complexity in physical-chemical processes: Stokes' law and the conservation of energy aren't being threatened if we suggest a laser powered by metabolic electrons."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the significance of water's structure and its ability to act as an antenna for low-energy light, suggesting a new paradigm for understanding chemical reactions and the potential for metabolic electrons to power processes like lasing.

**RAY PEAT:** "When two subjects such as the brain and magnetism--both still very open to speculation--are combined into a new field of research, we can expect the subject to be both imaginative and controversial. Fundamentally new processes, materials, and interactions can be expected to separate the past-centered from the future-centered scientists, provoking bitter disputes. In such circumstances, it is probably best to begin with an aspect of the subject that has at least some acceptance in the West, and to work from there toward the more general picture held by Soviet investigators of the effects of magnetism on the brain."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces the topic of brain and magnetism, acknowledging its speculative nature and the potential for conflict between different scientific perspectives, advocating for a gradual approach starting with accepted Western ideas.

**RAY PEAT:** "It is universally accepted that water has structure, that it is not an 'ideal liquid,' and that this structure is responsible for some of the peculiar properties of water. But this structure is usually thought to be only on the level of 'flickering clusters,' lasting about a millionth of a millionth of a second, and involving only a small group of molecules in each cluster. In 1926, Shereshevsky (an American) discovered that water and other liquids in small glass tubes behaved as if their structure had increased, that is, their vapor pressure became much lower than normal so that the liquid would condense in the tube at pressures that should cause it to evaporate. In Russia, Boris V. Deryaguin was demonstrating that even flat glass surfaces alter the behavior of water at a considerable distance from the glass. (It showed structural elasticity at distances under 900 Angstrom units.) After many years of experience in the study of water, Deryaguin discovered another important phenomenon: water could 'remember' having been in the frozen state for as long as a day after being melted (it had different properties between vibrating glass plates)."
**CONTEXT:** This establishes the scientific basis for water's structure and its unusual properties, citing early research by Shereshevsky and Deryaguin that demonstrated long-range structural effects and memory in water.

**RAY PEAT:** "Several years ago in an industrial process which involved 'floating' ore with magnets to refine it, the water which had been magnetically treated was found to be more capable than ordinary water of holding in solution the minerals which are deposited as 'scale' inside water tanks and pipes. This led to many investigations of the properties of magnetized water, and to reports that its density, surface tension, and possibly its refractive index are higher than ordinary water's. It is interesting that in the 19th century, the Baron Charles von Reichenbach claimed that magnetically treated water had biologically detectable properties, as did water containing ice. Reichenbach believed that there was a common ('Odic') energy underlying the function of crystals, magnets, electricity, life, etc. Popular culture in the United States has been assimilating some of these ideas recently. The results of Soviet science parallel those ideas in many ways."
**CONTEXT:** This connects industrial observations of magnetically treated water to historical claims by Reichenbach about "Odic" energy, suggesting a parallel between these ideas and current Soviet scientific findings.

**RAY PEAT:** "There has been speculation lately regarding a possibly new state of water discovered by Deryaguin. The material forms when water condenses at low pressure in capillary tubes. It resembles a dense, syrupy glass, suggesting that its structure is molecular, probably the result of additional substances dissolved from the glass tubes. It shouldn't be confused with 'magnetized water.' (Deryaguin's group has recently discovered another phenomenon of condensation at low pressures, in which carbon vapor grows into diamond crystals.)"
**CONTEXT:** This distinguishes Deryaguin's findings on condensed water from magnetized water and introduces his discovery of carbon vapor forming diamond crystals, highlighting the complexity of water's behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "One response to these observations might be 'if we don't even understand water very well, we might as well disregard it and study biochemistry as if water were just a solvent, just a convenient medium in which the crucial chemical reactions take place.' Another way of responding is to say 'the more complex water is, the more chances we have to find a really adequate description of what an organism is and why water behaves as it does in the living material.' The difference is whether we treat strangeness as a threat, or as an opportunity. Unfortunately, many biochemists feel threatened by the assertion that 'there is no biochemistry distinct from biophysics,' and that particles can't properly be considered in isolation from their environment."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts two approaches to understanding water's complexity: one that dismisses it as a threat to established biochemistry, and another that embraces it as an opportunity for a more complete understanding of life.

**RAY PEAT:** "Starting--as many Soviet scientists do--with the recognition that both water and organisms are sensitive to magnetic fields, many questions present themselves. What will treated water do to various organisms and tissues? Which organisms and tissues are most sensitive to magnetism? What does temperature do to the magnetic sensitivity of a tissue? Does an alternating field have a special effect? How did the earth's magnetic field affect evolution? Does the geological record of periodic changes in the earth's magnetic field have something to do with the sudden appearance of new phyla of plants and animals? Can we be aware of changes in magnetic fields? Do animals orient themselves by the magnetic field? Can magnetism be used in medicine? Some of these questions have been partly answered, and others are just now starting to be investigated."
**CONTEXT:** This outlines the key research questions arising from the sensitivity of water and organisms to magnetic fields, reflecting a broad investigative approach.

**RAY PEAT:** "Yuri Kholodov has found that higher organisms tend to be more sensitive to magnetism than lower ones, and that he most sensitive tissue is nervous tissue, especially the brain and the glial cells, which are thought to be involved particularly in memory processes, and to provide some kind of metabolic support for the neurons. He found that the glial cells enlarge under the influence of magnetic stimulation. Recently, another magnetobiologist has found that the testes are also exceptionally sensitive to magnetism. Ordinarily, we don't think of testicular tissue as being uniquely 'structured' in the sense that nerve and muscle are. However, in higher animals the testicles are carried in a scrotum, which keeps them slightly cooler than the rest of the body. At normal body temperature, the testes are unable to function properly; neither hormonal nor sperm-forming processes are normal at the higher temperature. Besides slowing the rate of chemical reactions slightly, this small amount of cooling would tend to increase the structuring of cell water. So the two peculiar tissues, testis and brain, apparently have unusual structural requirements for functioning normally, and they are the two tissues most sensitive to magnetism."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Kholodov's findings on the sensitivity of nervous tissue and glial cells to magnetism, and connects this to the testes' sensitivity, suggesting that both tissues have unique structural requirements that are influenced by magnetic fields and temperature.

**RAY PEAT:** "To emphasize the importance of cell structure in magnetic sensitivity is not to imply that electronic or free radical processes may not be crucial factors in that sensitivity--magnetic fields do cause measurable changes in electronic processes such as oxidation. Rather, what is being suggested is that there is a reciprocal relation between structure and these electronic processes, and between both of these and the magnetic environment."
**CONTEXT:** This clarifies that the emphasis on cell structure does not negate the role of electronic processes, but rather suggests a reciprocal relationship between structure, electronic activity, and the magnetic environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "Many fish, which aren't normally considered to be 'electrical,' generate a very weak electromagnetic field around themselves, and are able to use this field to detect even small objects in the water around them. How they sense the changes in the field isn't known. Similarly, sharks can detect incredibly weak fields, such as those created by a minnow buried under sand, even at considerable distances. (It is apparently the electrical field of a wound which attracts them, rather than just the smell of blood.)"
**CONTEXT:** This provides examples of animals using electromagnetic fields for detection, illustrating the biological relevance of these fields beyond direct electrical stimulation.

**RAY PEAT:** "In Mexico and Central America, where earthquakes are common, it has been recognized that animals can in some way sense a coming earthquake. It has been suggested that they are detecting alterations in the electrical or magnetic conditions of the earth which precede the shaking. In Mexico, 'everyone knows' that thunder and lightning (or colored flashes of light) precede or accompany earthquakes, and similar but earlier disturbances might be what animals sense. For years, Soviet geologists have been studying the ability of dogs to 'smell' minerals. Some of them believe that the dogs are actually detecting some electromagnetic property of the material, since they can find ore which is covered by several meters of other minerals. Dogs have been trained to recognize the 'smell' of a gold ring, and are then able to pick out samples of ore which contain even small amounts of gold."
**CONTEXT:** This presents evidence of animals sensing geophysical changes, suggesting a sensitivity to electromagnetic phenomena preceding earthquakes and in mineral detection.

**RAY PEAT:** "The same increase in the efficiency of energy production which Verzhbinskaya (see chapter on the orienting reflex) found to occur in the brain in evolution and in the state of mental alertness, has also been found to occur in many tissues under the influence of a magnetic field. Of course, high efficiency energy production will have survival value in many ways, but if the metabolic gradient is the key to cephalization, and if the brain is the most sensitive to this kind of stimulation, it is clear that magnetism will be an environmental support (or a 'selective pressure') for bigger and better brains."
**CONTEXT:** This links magnetic fields to increased energy production efficiency in the brain and other tissues, proposing magnetism as a factor in cephalization and brain evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** "This observation might also suggest a new approach to the fact that the appearance of new phyla coincides with the appearance of a new geological magnetic polarity (found in rocks from deep borings), after a short period (a few thousand years) in which the polarity disappeared from the geological record. The standard view has been that, since the magnetic field protects the earth from intense radiation, these periods without magnetism allowed mutations to occur as a result of radiation. However, the new phyla that appeared were of a higher complexity than those which preceded them, meaning they contained more information, and we know that radiation produces mutations by the destruction of information. (But the idea that the magnetic field protects the earth from radiation is itself questionable.) If magnetism stabilizes the higher functions and structures of the brain, then we have at least the beginnings of a sensible interpretation of the fact that the earth's magnetism has some correspondence to major evolutionary advances."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes an alternative explanation for the correlation between geological magnetic polarity shifts and evolutionary advances, suggesting that magnetism's stabilizing effect on the brain, rather than radiation protection, is the key factor.

**RAY PEAT:** "There is a very practical problem that grows out of the interaction of brain and geological and solar magnetism, namely, the fact that solar 'magnetic storms,' or sunspots, are followed by magnetic disturbances on the earth, which result in high rates of nervous and emotional diseases, accidents, suicides, strokes, and heart attacks. At present, all that can be done on a mass scale in the Soviet Union is to have nationwide medical and safety alerts in the days following sudden bursts of solar activity. Experimentally, however, special isolation chambers are being used to protect patients from these magnetic storms. (It's important to remember that their scientific culture, which is so advanced in many ways, exists in a culture that is still economically backward, making the application of scientific discoveries especially difficult. Besides the slow bureaucratic processes, most physicians don't have the resources to apply modern knowledge.)"
**CONTEXT:** This addresses the practical implications of solar magnetic storms on human health, noting Soviet efforts to mitigate these effects and the challenges of implementing scientific discoveries in economically less developed contexts.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since it is a fundamental principle of Russian medicine that the brain must be considered as a possible factor in all diseases and recovery processes, the magnetic environment is also being considered as a general factor in health. Its action on the brain is very important, but its direct effect on other tissues, such as white blood cells and the liver, etc., is also being studied. It is known that the weak fields of interplanetary space can cause reduced phagocytic activity of white blood cells, but it isn't known yet how much this effect is mediated by the brain."
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the Russian medical principle of considering the brain in all diseases and recovery, extending this to the magnetic environment's influence on overall health, including its effects on immune cells.

**RAY PEAT:** "Western scientists--basing their opinions on studies done in the 1940s in which animals exposed to radio waves showed no gross tissue changes when they were sliced up--said it was foolish to worry about possible harm from the 'very low energy' waves of radio, television, and microwave ovens (except when tissue was actually cooked), since there was 'no known mechanism' by which they could act on living tissue. The energy was not sufficient to cause a nerve to 'fire,' they argued, and so it could not possibly act on the brain. Meanwhile, since the Russians tended to think of nerves as complexes of water, macromolecules, and adsorbed small molecules rather than as 'bags full of chemicals,' they looked for more subtle effect, and found them. For example, they found that microwaves could relieve epilepsy in animals. As usual, the response in the U.S. was that they couldn't have achieved such a result, because it wasn't possible. As a result of such studies workers are protected from all kinds of electromagnetic waves, not just from high energy x-rays and nuclear radiation. Incidentally, a similar policy exists in regard to sound, since equally 'impossible' effects of sound on body chemicals and structures have been observed. Long-range ordering of water and solutes is the mechanism which makes these effects possible, but such order doesn't exist as far as most American scientists are concerned. (The reasons given for dismissing evidence of such order are ultimately so flimsy that, to an independent observer, the motivations seem palpably extra-scientific. Because of the dependent nature of the science student, observers are seldom able to be independent.)"
**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the Western scientific dismissal of low-energy electromagnetic wave effects due to a lack of understanding of subtle mechanisms, contrasting it with the Russian approach that considers water structure and finds such effects, leading to protective measures.

**RAY PEAT:** "The same increase in the efficiency of energy production which Verzhbinskaya (see chapter on the orienting reflex) found to occur in the brain in evolution and in the state of mental alertness, has also been found to occur in many tissues under the influence of a magnetic field. Of course, high efficiency energy production will have survival value in many ways, but if the metabolic gradient is the key to cephalization, and if the brain is the most sensitive to this kind of stimulation, it is clear that magnetism will be an environmental support (or a 'selective pressure') for bigger and better brains."
**CONTEXT:** This links magnetic fields to increased energy production efficiency in the brain and other tissues, proposing magnetism as a factor in cephalization and brain evolution.

**RAY PEAT:** "The brain is so important in the aging process, magnetic stimulation might lengthen life by intensifying brain function, causing sounder sleep, and improving repair processes. Light therapy is probably very important for sustaining and restoring optimum brain function, and I plan to write about current Soviet research in photobiology in the future."
**CONTEXT:** This suggests that magnetic stimulation could have anti-aging effects by enhancing brain function, sleep, and repair, and notes the potential importance of light therapy.

**RAY PEAT:** "If even pure water is capable of magnetic and structural 'memory,' then the more complex, stable, and variable structures composed of water and biological materials would seem to be an ideal basis for the rich storages of consciousness. Soviet nerve biologists are investigating these subtle inner changes of nerve cells. In the new science that is emerging, everything is taking on an integral kind of meaning, and things become easier to understand as they become more complex."
**CONTEXT:** This posits that the complex structures of biological materials, including water, serve as the basis for consciousness, and that understanding these subtle changes in nerve cells is key to a new, integrated science.

**RAY PEAT:** "Someone noticed that when a person enters a room where a dog is hooked up to recording devices, the dog's pulse and respiration become slower and deeper. People respond the same way to the approach of another person. This response is called 'Effect of Person.' The changes are similar to some of those occurring in sexual excitement."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces the concept of the "Effect of Person," describing the physiological changes observed in dogs and humans in response to another's presence, linking it to parasympathetic activation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Slowing of the heart beat is produced by acetylcholine, which is release by the parasympathetic division of the nervous system. Reich and others have described parasympathetic function as being 'expansive,' in contrast to the 'shrinking' function of the sympathetic nerves, as in fear. Both of these functions are meaningfully related to the central nervous system, the cerebral cortex, and to the perception of outside events."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the physiological basis of the "Effect of Person," linking parasympathetic activity (mediated by acetylcholine) to an "expansive" state and contrasting it with the "shrinking" sympathetic response.

**RAY PEAT:** "To understand the Effect of Person, and sexual excitement, and love, we need some better perspectives on the meaning of nerve functions and on the nature of their integration with each other and with the experienced world. To get these new perspectives, we will have to work with both our perceptions of ourselves and our 'objective' observations."
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the need for a holistic approach, integrating subjective experience and objective observation, to understand complex phenomena like love and the "Effect of Person."

**RAY PEAT:** "In the feeling of love, our inner body-space seems to expand, and we seem to be filled with the other. At the same time, we see the world with the perspective of the other, as if the world were enclosed in the other: And within it opens into a World And a little lovely Moony Night. Another England there I saw.... Another Maiden like herself, Translucent, lovely, shining clear, Threefold each in the other clos'd--O, what a pleasant trembling fear! O, what a smile! a threefold Smile Fill'd me, that like a flame I burn'd; I bent to Kiss the lovely Maid, And found a Threefold Kiss return'd."
**CONTEXT:** This passage uses poetic language to describe the subjective experience of love, emphasizing the expansion of inner space, the integration of another's perspective, and a sense of profound connection.

**RAY PEAT:** "In this process, the body's pace changes as the feeling of space is altered. The cerebral hemispheres are important for the perception of space, and they also are involved in 'setting the reflexes,' probably largely by stabilizing individual nerve cells at a certain energy level, raising the 'thresholds,' for example, by raising the ATP level. Each hemisphere has a trophic influence on the other, involving a similar raising of the energy level. Sleep (via GABA) also tends to raise the energy level. (Chemicals which elevate GABA -- hydroxylamine, piracetam, for example--improve learning; piracetam is known to increase bilateral balance of the hemispheres.)"
**CONTEXT:** This connects the subjective experience of love to physiological processes, highlighting the role of cerebral hemispheres in space perception and reflex regulation, and the influence of ATP, GABA, and hormones on energy levels and hemispheric balance.

**RAY PEAT:** "Lowering the energy charge (exhaustion, some psychoses) apparently causes a perception of shrunken space; if we could relate energy charge to the two aspects--shrinking and expanding--of the autonomic nervous system, we would have a simple way to understand their effects. Since high activity of ATPase could lower the energy charge, chemicals altering this enzyme might have these general effects on perception and function. (ATPase seems to increase in the 'melted' state.) Adrenaline--the chemical characteristic of sympathetic activity--decreases the activity of ATPase. This is one way of looking at the connection between the sensation of space and the shift of physiological pace."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes a link between energy charge, autonomic nervous system states, and the perception of space, suggesting that ATPase activity and adrenaline levels play a role in this relationship.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another way of looking at the same interaction of space and pace: Big things always seem to have a more leisurely pace than little things--stars and atoms, elephants and mice. It may be that perception of space and regulation of motor rhythms are part of a single process. Bashkova and Zakharyants described a boy's symptoms following an attack of malaria that illustrate the connection of pace and space: Objects began to seem much smaller in size. The patient's perception of speed was no longer correct: Everything seemed to him to be taking place faster (people, for example, did not walk, but ran). For this reason he too began to do everything very quickly. After treatment with quinine, these aberrations disappeared. (Pages 173-174, Space and Time Perception by the Cosmonaut, Leonov and Lebedev.)"
**CONTEXT:** This uses the analogy of size and pace to illustrate the connection between space perception and motor rhythms, citing a case study of malaria-induced perceptual distortions.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the anxious sympathetic state, nerve threshold would be lowered, and reflexes would be triggered more easily: This would increase the pace of activity, but since the energy charge wouldn't return to the highest level, the action would be smaller. This would presumably apply not only to heart-beat and respiration, but to other reflex actions such as orgasm."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how an anxious sympathetic state, characterized by lowered nerve thresholds and easier reflexes, can lead to increased activity but smaller actions due to insufficient energy charge, potentially affecting processes like orgasm.

**RAY PEAT:** "The thyroid hormone keeps the cellular energy high, the adrenaline low, and reflexes strong. It undoubtedly has an important effect on both perception and responses. In the high energy, expansive state, with thresholds raised, a strong stimulus could evoke a strong response. Things are bigger, possibilities are greater."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the role of thyroid hormone in maintaining high cellular energy, low adrenaline, and strong reflexes, contributing to an expansive state of perception and increased possibilities.

**RAY PEAT:** "The events following orgasm--fusion of worlds and sleep in particular--are where 'Effect of Person' or the first stage of love becomes transformed."
**CONTEXT:** This suggests that the post-orgasmic state, characterized by a merging of perspectives and sleep, represents a transformation of the initial stages of love and the "Effect of Person."

**RAY PEAT:** "In mutually stimulating interaction, the hemispheres of the brain seem to be generating perception of space (and continuity through time) at the same time that they are 'setting reflex thresholds,' creating the conditions for integrating emotions with the world."
**CONTEXT:** This describes the brain's hemispheres as working together to generate spatial perception, temporal continuity, and the integration of emotions with the external world by setting reflex thresholds.

**RAY PEAT:** "Enlargement of perceived space corresponds to dominance of the parasympathetic part of the vegetative nervous system (among other things)."
**CONTEXT:** This links the subjective experience of expanded perceived space to the physiological dominance of the parasympathetic nervous system.

**RAY PEAT:** "Both loving and sleeping produce this 'expanded,' parasympathetic dominance. In loving, in any mutually affirming human interaction, there is an interaction of perspectives on the world. In each brain, the interaction of two hemispheric perspectives helps to generate and amplify our consciousness of the world. In the loving interaction of perspectives, a similar generation and amplification of consciousness can occur."
**CONTEXT:** This draws a parallel between loving interactions and sleep in inducing parasympathetic dominance and expanding consciousness through the interaction of hemispheric perspectives.

**RAY PEAT:** "As we feel that we are being affirmed and loved by another, we feel that the other person is expanding us, and filling us; our body shifts toward parasympathetic dominance, skin gets pink, eye-lids and gaze may drop--Marcel Proust described the feeling: ... filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not within me, it was me. I had ceased to feel myself mediocre, contingent, mortal..."
**CONTEXT:** This uses Proust's description to illustrate the subjective experience of being affirmed and loved, linking it to physiological changes and a transcendence of self-limitations.

**RAY PEAT:** "At the same time, we begin to see the world with their perspective. This centering on the other person probably happens to some degree every time we understand something new presented by another person--the process of forming a dominant, in Ukhtomskii's language. If our brain 'forms a dominant for' the other person, that person has really come into us, and we can see the world from their perspective."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how understanding another person involves forming a "dominant" for them, integrating their perspective and allowing us to see the world through their eyes.

**RAY PEAT:** "Structurally, this process could be practically the same as that of using the two cerebral hemispheres to intensify awareness. We would have two perspectives on the world, and we would try to synthesize them into one world. Difference is potential, and would 'rouze our faculties to act,' increasing energy level, or tension. Every 'message' is a problem, leading us toward resolution."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes a structural similarity between integrating hemispheric perspectives and integrating interpersonal perspectives, both leading to increased awareness, energy, and a drive towards resolution.

**RAY PEAT:** "The sudden turning of perception at orgasm seems to involve a transformation of both people, each achieving a synthesis of the two dominants. In 'The Crystal Cabinet' Blake described another less satisfactory kind of outcome: 'I strove to sieze the inmost Form With ardor fierce & hands of flame, But burst the Crystal Cabinet, And like a Weeping Babe became-- A weeping Babe upon the wild, And Weeping Woman pale reclin'd, And in the outward air again I fill'd with woes the passing Wind.' In this case he came out where he had been 'caught' in the first place, 'upon the wild.' He had been 'lock'd up,' and felt a 'pleasant trembling fear.' I think he meant this as a caution against a certain kind of love-making, in which you end the same as you began, only worse. What fails to happen is the transformation from one world to another--I think because of the attitude of trying to 'seize the inmost Form,' being locked up, etc."
**CONTEXT:** This uses Blake's "The Crystal Cabinet" to illustrate a failed transformation during lovemaking, where the attempt to seize rather than integrate leads to a return to the original state, only worse.

**RAY PEAT:** "Every real action causes a certain amount of growth. Being filled by another person can be thought of as 'contracting with yourself for a large amount of growth. If we are afraid to become someone new, instead of making the transformation we have to fall back to the old self and the old world; we fall slack. Crying involves a strong parasympathetic reaction, and is a way of discharging the expectant expansiveness, but is also an expression of the loss, of the shrunken possibility. (Blake's analysis of consciousness involved distinctions that haven't yet been fully developed in the scientific work of the Pavlov tradition. The Crystal Cabinet doesn't explore the solution to the problem, which Blake believed involved the active creative Fourfold consciousness.)"
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes that genuine action leads to growth, and that fear of transformation can result in a regression to the old self, with crying being a physiological response to loss and shrunken possibility.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although the orgasm involves some kind of turning of perception (and sometimes brings an urge to start playing or making something) it usually turns to dreamy sleepiness. A pattern of cortical excitation tends to become inhibited, according to Pavlov. In sleep, tension is low and parasympathetic dominance is strong. The pattern of the dominants, and of the resolution would remain in the cortex, probably relating to dream activity, possibly with an inverted or 'halo' relation to the original form of the perspective-dominant. The resolution and transformation would continue to develop during sleep."
**CONTEXT:** This describes the post-orgasmic state as often leading to sleep, where cortical excitation is inhibited and parasympathetic dominance prevails, allowing for continued processing and transformation of experiences during dreams.

**RAY PEAT:** "Healthy children always wake up with an eagerness to get back to the world--the world seems new and fresh. Salvador Dali has studied sleep and dreams more than most people, and has some useful insights: Men have attempted to interpret dreams, and even to guide them, but never yet have men attempted to use sleep to guide and to control artistic creation which is to be executed in a waking state. .. you guide yourself hypnotically toward the concentrated objective of synthesis... Every enforced inactivity, before the impatience to act, becomes accumulated into creative force which, so to speak, is purified, directed. The essences separate into their hierarchies, and sleep, oriented in the direction of the realization of desire, ferments, sparkles, miraculously resolves itself and selects. What you prevent yourself from doing and force yourself not to do, the dream will do with all the lucidity of desire and without any of the blindnesses consubstantial with your champing gluttony.... But in order to enable your dream to work in peace you must cretinize yourself by the 'hypnotic doubt' of your sensations, and the infantile game of discrediting the evidence of your senses by means of the three sea-perch eyes suffices, even for the most adult spirits, to encourage it to seek the most natural paths to an effective oniric solution. (50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship.)"
**CONTEXT:** This incorporates Salvador Dali's insights on using sleep for creative control, emphasizing the accumulation of creative force during inactivity and the dream's ability to achieve synthesis and resolve desires, suggesting a method of "cretinizing" oneself to facilitate this process.

**RAY PEAT:** "What Dali has perfected as a practical technique for achieving a new synthesis is probably a basic natural function of the sleeping brain: To transform multiple perspectives into a single new perspective. Dali says that Plato described the last sleep of dawn as 'the sleep of truth.' Good sleep does promote true perception."
**CONTEXT:** This interprets Dali's technique as a natural function of the sleeping brain for synthesizing perspectives and suggests that good sleep leads to true perception.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think this is an important part of what happens to the person following orgasm: The old self, the old world are transformed by interaction with the loved person. The assimilation is probably completed and stabilized by sleep."
**CONTEXT:** This posits that orgasm, through interaction with a loved one, initiates a transformation of the self and world, which is then consolidated and stabilized by sleep.

**RAY PEAT:** "Sleep and an active learning state are both fostered by elevated levels of GABA, the nerve-quieting substance, and the functionally related hormones, progesterone and thyroid."
**CONTEXT:** This identifies GABA, progesterone, and thyroid hormone as key factors that promote both sleep and active learning states.

**RAY PEAT:** "Where do you draw the line between living and dead, between conscious and unconscious? Much of Western Christian thought has been concerned with this question--'was Jesus a man or a god?' 'What distinguishes man from the animals?' etc. The tendency has been to draw the dividing line higher and higher: First, the human soul separates us from the beasts; then, our reason; next, language, use of tools, etc.; next, grammatical use of language; finally, some people are even refining the sense of 'grammatical use of language,' so that chimpanzees won't share our humanness when they create original sentences."
**CONTEXT:** This critiques the Western tendency to draw increasingly fine distinctions between humans and other life forms, or between different levels of human consciousness, often based on abstract criteria.

**RAY PEAT:** "Another, 'underground,' line of thinking has existed in the West: Paracelsus, Behmen, Blake and G. W. Crile. These people have seen sympathies among the substances, a common life in the diversities of nature. Feeling themselves to be fully alive, they see all the material world as being alive in its own way, and knowable because of its inner similarity to human life."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces an alternative Western tradition, exemplified by figures like Blake and Crile, that perceives a common life force and interconnectedness throughout nature, viewing the material world as alive and knowable through inner similarity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Those who have asserted that nature is only mathematical, that the material world is empty and dead, eventually come to the 'Behaviorist' conclusion that people, who are just part of the natural material world, are also empty and dead. They (e.g., Monod or Stent) assert that our historical, cultural and mental (or rather, 'mental') life must become empty and dead. A similar doctrine was promoted by kings and priests in the 18th century, to suppress the aspirations of the people."
**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the reductionist view of nature as purely mathematical and dead, arguing that it leads to a similar view of humans and their mental lives, and draws a parallel to historical attempts to suppress popular aspirations.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 19th century Russia, materialist thinking had a tendency--probably from the influence of Aristotle--to see matter as being full of possibility, to be intrinsically creative. The plant physiologist, Kliment Timiryazev, could ask the question: Does a plant possess consciousness? Let us answer this question by posing another: Do all animals possess it? If we accept that all animals have it, why should we deny it to plants? And if we deny it to the simplest animal, where, at what rung of the organic ladder, does this threshold of consciousness lie? Where is the line drawn beyond which object becomes subject?"
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Russian materialist tradition, influenced by Aristotle, which viewed matter as inherently creative and full of possibility, exemplified by Timiryazev's questioning of consciousness in plants and animals.

**RAY PEAT:** "Out of this materialist philosophy of life and matter came the great Russian discoveries of the 20th c.: Oparin's coacervate theory of the origin of life; Deryaginin's work on long-range structures of water; the 'sorption theory' of Vvedensky, Nasonov, Troshin and others, in which cell structure and physiology are unified; and the Pavlovians' work in the nature of consciousness and the brain."
**CONTEXT:** This lists key Russian scientific discoveries that emerged from their materialist philosophy, emphasizing the interconnectedness of life, water structure, cell physiology, and consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** "These two philosophies are ultimately a metaphysics of fullness and a metaphysics of emptiness, respectively. (Or we can call them assumptions about the nature of particular things, to emphasize their potential, or not.) We can think of these different attitudes as differences in brain function. We normally have, throughout the day and the night, regular cycles of alternating dreaminess and 'motor' activity. These cycles usually last about 90 minutes each. We can think of the active part of the cycle as being a focus of excitation, as described by Pavlov, which is surrounded and defined by areas of inhibition. Discrimination is achieved by this process of selective suppression. The focus of excitation and discrimination exists in the brain as an actual center, analogous to the 'centers' or 'analyzers' for various abilities, which become more sharply refined in evolution."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts two fundamental philosophies as "metaphysics of fullness" versus "emptiness," linking them to differences in brain function, specifically the cycles of excitation and inhibition that underlie discrimination and the development of specialized brain centers.

**RAY PEAT:** "With prolonged discriminative learning, Pavlov noticed that the point of excitation becomes fatigued, and shifts to inhibition--this can lead to a hypnotic state, or to normal sleep. This center of inhibition then, according to a law described by Pavlov, becomes surrounded by excitation in a reversal of the previous pattern. Since the discriminative inhibition was structured by the learning experience, the excitation which replaces it must have a similar structure. This seems to explain the indirect way in which dreams relate to the preceding experiences. What was purposefully ignored is now attended to; awareness becomes expansive, and works over the background material, unifying it, strengthening the focus which was established in the preceding phase. Distant and seemingly trivial aspects of the background can now be re-evaluated, and put into a new structure, which may reveal the importance of certain images. Each image, of course, is itself a center of excitation, a 'dominant,' and as such exists in our memory as an organizing influence. Working from a certain strong center--the core of the dream--we approach and test other image centers for their relevance. Thus, the insight with which we began to dream may be small compared to the discovery that is established during dreaming. This is a kind of recruitment--of image, of dominant, of excitation, of information."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's observations on the shift from excitation to inhibition during learning and its relation to sleep and dreams, describing how dreams process background material and integrate new information through a process of "recruitment."

**RAY PEAT:** "The incorporation of another person, the formation of a dominant for that person, forms a very strong center for this kind of recruitment. When resolution between self and other is achieved, as in sexual orgasm, the delivery of information can be great. We have another kind of gesture, the other person's dominant, with which to scan our own background of experience--so that the achievement of understanding of 'what the other person is' is a real expansion of our own world of possibilities, throwing the light of dream energy into the little-used corners of our life experience."
**CONTEXT:** This connects the process of forming a "dominant" for another person to the recruitment of information during dreams, suggesting that interpersonal understanding, especially through orgasm, expands possibilities and illuminates neglected aspects of life.

**RAY PEAT:** "We can think of the active focus as the peak of a mountain, resting on the background of a dark landscape. A symbol, such as a word, can represent a complex image or concept by becoming attached to this peak. If we do our philosophizing only in this active mode, it is possible to just skim over these mountain peaks, ignoring the dark landscape below, taking the symbols and thinking we have everything. Of course, the geography of the peaks is dependent on the whole. But this mode of thought, seeing symbols as the only reality, can lead to the metaphysics of empty matter, mathematical nature."
**CONTEXT:** This uses a mountain analogy to contrast two modes of thought: the active, symbolic mode that skims over the surface, and a deeper, more integrated mode that considers the whole landscape, warning against the "metaphysics of empty matter" that arises from the former.

**RAY PEAT:** "If we do our thinking in the other mode, in which the active focus becomes inhibited, and exists as the dark pit of a valley, then what we see is the unifying landscape, and we have suppressed the verbal and symbolic flags that were associated with the peaks. Thought then becomes expansive, and synthesizes rather than analyzes. This dreamy mode of thought always tends toward discovery and newness, while the symbolic mode is limited to deduction and sameness."
**CONTEXT:** This further elaborates on the contrast between symbolic (analytical) and dreamy (synthesizing) modes of thought, highlighting the expansive and discovery-oriented nature of the latter.

**RAY PEAT:** "These differences of thought are differences in brain function: some people are literally trapped in the verbal-symbolic mode, and their science must conform to their life. If their inner world is only words and emptiness, then it is reasonable that nature for them should be empty and dead. Western science (in its dominant Cartesian form) has based itself on this hollow metaphysics. Fortunately, the Russian tradition, a kind of spontaneous materialism, has produced a different and livelier kind of science. But if Western scientists find the Russian conception of matter threatening, what must they think of the Russian physiology which criticizes their entire worldview as a brain dysfunction?"
**CONTEXT:** This directly links differences in thought modes to brain function and criticizes Western science's Cartesian basis as a "hollow metaphysics," contrasting it with the more "lively" Russian approach and its potential critique of Western worldviews as brain dysfunction.

**RAY PEAT:** "We can think of psychopathology in terms of energy being given to the perceived structure of self in the world. Generality and intensity are eupsychic, verbalism and vagueness are at the pathological extreme."
**CONTEXT:** This defines psychopathology in terms of energy distribution within the self-world structure, identifying generality and intensity as positive (eupsychic) and verbalism and vagueness as pathological.

**RAY PEAT:** "How is it that effectiveness and control lead to an alert, energetic, efficient state, and a sense of having no control leads to depression, a neuro-inhibitory state?"
**CONTEXT:** This poses a question about the relationship between perceived control, energy levels, and mental states, linking effectiveness and control to alertness and efficiency, and lack of control to depression and neuro-inhibition.

**RAY PEAT:** "When we assert that consciousness is a hologram of body/world we mean that our meanings are like windows, and that the whole is present in, represented in, any part. When we suggest that the hologram has a finer texture than Pribram's model, based on synaptic interference, could give, and suggest that the gel structure of the brain tissue is the location of the hologram, we are suggesting that all of our meanings are present in systems that relate directly to metabolism."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes a holographic model of consciousness, where meanings are interconnected and related to metabolism through the brain's gel structure, suggesting a finer texture than synaptic interference models.

**RAY PEAT:** "If we think of consciousness as a flow of electrons scanning through a structured, conductive gel, we can see that the flow could be both focused and energized by events in the gel."
**CONTEXT:** This offers an electronic model of consciousness, envisioning it as electrons scanning through a structured gel, energized and focused by events within that gel.

**RAY PEAT:** "If generalization is insight into the relationships among many particular experiences, this kind of insight will be facilitated by the kind of energetic imagination that allows many experiences to be held in relationship and compared. We can think of a generalization as a kind of 'tube' through which we perceive related experiences, and through which we project ourselves when acting intelligently, or making a discovery: This new thing, previously not done, is possible because it relates meaningfully to other events."
**CONTEXT:** This defines generalization as insight into relationships, facilitated by energetic imagination and structured as a "tube" for perceiving and projecting oneself intelligently, enabling discovery.

**RAY PEAT:** "Generality is like a lever: An intelligent action is one that has the desired consequences, and we hope a little action will go a long way. Failure to understand when acting means that the consequences won't occur where we expect them to, so it's as if all the lever is on our side of the fulcrum, reaching nowhere, doing nothing. The lever image can be changed to a telescope, looking through it both ways: When we have great insight and effect, we and world seem to be expanded; when we achieve no effect, we feel diminished."
**CONTEXT:** This uses the analogies of a lever and a telescope to illustrate the power of generality and insight, emphasizing how effective action leads to expansion, while failure diminishes the self and the world.

**RAY PEAT:** "Internally, the highly structured micro-world is doing the same thing. In alertness, animals use oxygen more efficiently to produce energy (Palladin, 1964), which facilitates uptake of potassium, indicating an increase of order in the micro-structure. Conductivity is higher between front and back of the head when a person is alert or dreaming. Brain amines seem to support these ordered states--clarity of waking experience, as well as soundness of sleep, require sufficient amines. In rats that are made hypoxic, activity of monoamine oxidase decreases and respiratory effectiveness apparently increases adaptively (Khvatova, Rubanova, and Zhilina, Voprosy Meditsinskoy Khimii 19(1), 3-5, 1973. Administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors improves resistance of mice to hypoxia (Piskarev, et al., Farmakologiy i Toksikologiya 36(1), 48-54, 1973). Adaptation to high elevation not only increases the number of mitochondria (giving a better oxidative capacity), but it can also produce improvement in bronchitis, bronchial asthma, Basedow's disease (obviously oxygen related), schizophrenia, and manic-depressive psychosis (Mirrakhimov, Klinicheskaya Meditsina 50(12), 104-109, 1972)."
**CONTEXT:** This passage links internal micro-world structure, alertness, energy production, and brain amines to ordered states, citing research on hypoxia, monoamine oxidase, and high-altitude adaptation, suggesting these factors influence various physiological and psychological conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Contrast--not only the temporal contrast of sleep-waking--is very important for the quality of our experience. In the 'fizzly' dream state of exhaustion/depression, black can't be experienced, because of diffuse background activity. The same amount of energy or activity could produce more intense and pleasant experience if it could be properly distributed according to meaning patterns. An interesting analytic point is that this fizzly state is a meaning; the world is flattened and garbled, and we are disturbingly committed to that kind of world, even though we may know it isn't right--it feels terrible, but the meaning is right there. In this sense, the 'normal' person is committed to this world, because its meaning is intrinsic, and he probably has never experienced a more intense consciousness. I want to emphasize that the experience is always meaning, and that we mean garbled if that's what we experience, in the sense that Merleau-Ponty said that we 'are doomed to meaning.'"
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the importance of contrast for experience quality, describing the "fizzly" state of exhaustion/depression as a flattened, garbled meaning that one can be committed to, even if unpleasant, highlighting that experience is always meaningful.

**RAY PEAT:** "The hologram idea implies that the fine structure is meaningfully ordered with regard to the represented world: This is its window-like quality. Its degree of order will correspond to the order which it images, and this order will increase with generality, and decrease with compartmentalization or so-called concretization (actually, what is most general is most concrete). Energy flow and intensity will change as the nature of the field changes. Both energy production and energy flow become more efficient with insight/control. Convoluted flow, like lobotomy, cuts off the perspective, verbalizes and concretizes, but stays open to energy, in a fizzly, soggy way."
**CONTEXT:** This applies the hologram concept to consciousness, suggesting that meaningful order in fine structure corresponds to the represented world, and that generality increases order, while compartmentalization decreases it, impacting energy flow and efficiency. It also contrasts this with lobotomy's disruptive effect.

**RAY PEAT:** "Both metabolic and social events (and development, which is both social and metabolic) can influence the wholeness and intensity with which we interact with the world, and can promote an energy-wasting state, or a condition of growth towards greater wholeness and intensity."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the influence of both metabolic and social factors on our interaction with the world, determining whether we enter an energy-wasting state or a condition of growth and wholeness.

**RAY PEAT:** "We have a body gradient which becomes more intense with alert consciousness and with higher evolutionary levels. The body has its completion in the environment that it chooses or creates to live in."
**CONTEXT:** This describes a body gradient that intensifies with alertness and evolution, suggesting that the body finds completion in its chosen or created environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "A high consciousness, supported by, and probably constituting, a high body gradient, relates more flexibly to its environment, and so has a different environment, a 'faster' one. That is, a flexible instrument has a higher 'resolving' power for time. This is clearly the case for complex sound perception, particularly language (e.g., see Pribram, Plan etc.). In my experience, it's also true for visual patterns that exist only as a development through time--the pattern is visible only when a certain span of time can be held as 'present.' Twinkling lights, and the little splashes of raindrops hitting the ground are situations where meaningful (wind) patterns can be seen in what 'momentarily' seem to be random events."
**CONTEXT:** This links high consciousness and body gradients to flexible environmental interaction and enhanced temporal resolution, particularly in language and time-dependent visual patterns.

**RAY PEAT:** "An inner stiffness slows down the way consciousness resonates with the world, and so results in a kind of skimming of slow patterns from the world."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts flexibility with inner stiffness, suggesting that the latter hinders consciousness's resonance with the world, leading to a superficial perception of slow patterns.

**RAY PEAT:** "When we think of 'resolving' or discriminating as an actual material resonance process, in which living material resonates in forms corresponding to forms in the world, we have a concept in which the body-mind problem disappears."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes that viewing resolution and discrimination as material resonance processes, where living matter resonates with the external world, can resolve the mind-body problem.

**RAY PEAT:** "Phenomenologists, like Merleau-Ponty, have wrestled with the dualistic interpretive system of our culture, and have made real progress in moving those old categories toward a new, synthetic or unifying understanding, but as long as the old cultural forms persist, the problem is going to reappear. Even in Merleau-Ponty's later work (Visible & Invisible) the holding together he achieved in his more biological writings is only weakly present in an idea like 'chiasm.'"
**CONTEXT:** This acknowledges Merleau-Ponty's efforts to bridge dualistic thinking but suggests that cultural persistence of old forms hinders a complete resolution, even in his later work.

**RAY PEAT:** "In science, the concept of resonance has existed for a long time, though it apparently has never been well generalized. Energy, structure, and interaction are essential parts of its definition. Sonic and electronic resonances are increasingly recognized as being biologically important. The Gestalt idea of spatial representation of images within the brain is gaining strength with the realization that the brain is hologram-like. The vibratory theory of smell and the 'fluorescence' theory of vision reveal another aspect of the idea of consciousness as resonance. The hologram model helps us to visualize a many-leveled energy interaction of organism and environment, a resonance. The mind-body problem is thus a scientific problem, and the paradigm is already available in the physical concept of resonance."
**CONTEXT:** This advocates for the generalization of resonance as a unifying concept in science, linking it to energy, structure, interaction, and biological processes like hearing, vision, and consciousness, suggesting it can resolve the mind-body problem.

**RAY PEAT:** "The scientists who refuse to touch the problem are bowing to the old cultural interpretive system. Western philosophy has been duped for centuries by the foolish question of subjective illusion and delusion. The 'public knowledge' reaction to this idealistic trick (to say that private knowledge is impossible) has thrown out superior perceptions along with the delusions. The common knowledge of what is delusive, the existence of an ordinary language category, 'illusion,' shows how unnecessary it has been for philosophers to struggle with the idea. History is full of cases of superb perception (e.g., Helmholtz's description of controllable left or right eye function) which were ruled out because they weren't common in some sense. The ridiculous extreme of this sort of thing is the aging neurology professor who says that the upper limit of human hearing is 14,000 cycles per second, because he tested it himself."
**CONTEXT:** This criticizes scientists who avoid the mind-body problem due to cultural biases and the historical focus on subjective illusion, arguing that this has led to the dismissal of valuable perceptions and that a more objective approach to consciousness is needed.

**RAY PEAT:** "When we can accept consciousness as a material and objective thing, then we can see new meaning in Mach's 'there is no illusion.' Certain illusions are diagnostic: 'The world is always dark,' for example, diagnoses blindness."
**CONTEXT:** This advocates for accepting consciousness as material and objective, drawing on Mach's idea of "no illusion" and suggesting that certain "illusions" can be diagnostic of underlying conditions.

**RAY PEAT:** "More importantly, we will have achieved a basis for a better science, in which high generality and high flexibility perceptions are no longer rejected as 'merely subjective.' They may be diagnostic of a sick paranoia, or they may be diagnostic of a superior perceptual functioning which is strictly empirical."
**CONTEXT:** This argues that accepting consciousness as material and objective allows for the validation of highly general and flexible perceptions, which can be diagnostic of either pathology or superior perceptual functioning.

**RAY PEAT:** "Recognizing material, objective consciousness forces us to realize that generality is full and experiential, and that generality exists objectively, to be discovered. It empties of meaning the philosophies of abstraction, the idea that 'nature is mathematical,' and all of the traditional cultural dualities--even the matter-energy distinction is demystified."
**CONTEXT:** This asserts that recognizing consciousness as material and objective leads to a fuller understanding of generality, dissolving abstract philosophies and cultural dualities, including the matter-energy distinction.

**RAY PEAT:** "The scientists of empire are announcing the end of science and art, and of all cultural progress. Their argument is simple: The knowable world is finite, and our knowledge of it grows at an increasing rate. The end must come soon. Some of them say that physics and chemistry are already finished, and that biology will be completed when a few puzzles are solved in genetics--and the general form of these solutions is already known."
**CONTEXT:** This critiques the "end of science" narrative propagated by "scientists of empire," attributing it to a belief in a finite knowable world and the perceived completion of scientific fields like physics and chemistry.

**RAY PEAT:** "For German idealists--like Hegel or Hitler--'our world, our own time' tends to be seen as 'the last stage in History.' The Golden Age, or the 1000 year Reich, is always just now arriving. At the end of the last century, many physicists were certain that their science was complete, except for a few details."
**CONTEXT:** This links the "end of science" narrative to German idealism and its historical tendency to view the present as the culmination of progress, citing examples from Hegel, Hitler, and physicists of the past.

**RAY PEAT:** "Idealists see 'pure knowledge' as the source of technology, and so technology must come to an end too, a little later than science."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the idealist view that technology, derived from "pure knowledge," must also reach an end as science does.

**RAY PEAT:** "Materialists are more likely to see our time as being near the beginning, not the end. For example, Marx (who borrowed so much from Hegel) said that 'real history' couldn't begin until capitalism has been overcome."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the materialist perspective, which sees current times as a beginning rather than an end, citing Marx's view of history's true commencement after capitalism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think this observation is more tautology than perception. The term 'materialism' describes the attitude that likes to begin with 'the matter at hand,' 'idealism' describes an approach that emphasizes the importance of established ideas. One's place in the world obviously influences judgments as to where truth and value can be found."
**CONTEXT:** This offers a critical perspective on the materialism vs. idealism dichotomy, suggesting it's more about attitude and worldview than objective perception, and that one's position influences their judgment of truth and value.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ever since Heraclitus, materialists have emphasized change, while idealists emphasize stasis. 'Pure knowledge' is a source of technology, but technology is also a basis for the development of new formalized knowledge. The steam engine was already in common use when Carnot and Joule formulated its basic theory."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the historical emphasis on change by materialists (Heraclitus) and stasis by idealists, and notes that technology often precedes its theoretical understanding.

**RAY PEAT:** "What the idealists are saying is that their science is nearly complete, and there is no other science. What they imply is that there can never be technologies which conflict with their laws. In the Golden Age, science must achieve certainty, otherwise it wouldn't be perfect. Hegel's version of this was: '...the laws of real Freedom--demand the subjugation of mere contingent Will.'"
**CONTEXT:** This further elaborates on the idealist stance, emphasizing their belief in the completeness and certainty of their science and its laws, and quoting Hegel to illustrate the subjugation of individual will to perceived universal laws.

**RAY PEAT:** "German idealism has been influential in western science for most of the 20th century, but now scientists in capitalist countries are letting it guide them into cultural fascism."
**CONTEXT:** This directly links the influence of German idealism in Western science to the rise of cultural fascism.

**RAY PEAT:** "Geneticists have been the worst offenders. Genetics is popular among bourgeois racists and elitists, and many geneticists have eagerly formulated genetic theories of intelligence on the flimsiest evidence. But seemingly decent 'liberal' geneticists are pushing the idealist doctrine about the end of science. The reason for this must be that genetics has so little real subject matter that theoretical formalisms can generate the desired conclusions with little interference from the material world. There is a collection of papers by the great founders of genetics, which is about all that contemporary geneticists know about the history of genetics. Looking at the data published there, and interpreting it with different assumptions, one can see the breath-taking mystical guidance those men must have had--it wasn't even necessary for them to try to dispose of alternate interpretations, their faith was so great or their vision so narrow. (Nuclear physicists and mathematicians sometimes become geneticists without bothering to study organisms. The engineering approach of molecular biologists can get results of a sort, but the worrisome thing is that some of them don't appreciate the differences between bacteria and people. If a mechanic tried to sell a farmer a 'new carburetor for his horse,' the farmer wouldn't buy it, but we often buy similarly irrational 'solutions' to our problems.)"
**CONTEXT:** This strongly criticizes geneticists for their role in promoting racist theories of intelligence and the "end of science" doctrine, attributing this to a lack of empirical grounding and a reliance on theoretical formalisms, and uses analogies to highlight the disconnect from biological reality.

**RAY PEAT:** "That narrow vision serves the geneticists as well in political matters as in academic work. They can reach very definite conclusions about the future of science and society without having to study other theories of history and human nature than the one they can derive from their philosophy of science."
**CONTEXT:** This points out how the narrow vision of geneticists extends to political matters, allowing them to make definitive pronouncements on society without considering alternative perspectives on history and human nature.

**RAY PEAT:** "In one of these books in which scientists reveal the implications of their philosophy (The Corning of the Golden Age), Gunther Stent said 'My general argument will follow more or less Hegelian (or, for all I know, Marxist) lines.' He proudly admits that he has no understanding of Marxism at all. The real importance of his argument is that it is a central core, the armature, of the dominant segment of Western European and American science."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Gunther Stent's admission of ignorance regarding Marxism while claiming Hegelian influence, identifying his argument as central to dominant Western scientific thought.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stent believes that the 'will to power' is what creates progress, by being sublimated into creativity. 'natural selection favored those proto-human genes which produce a brain in which the will to power concept is innately latent.' He continues: This argument bears some considerable affinity to Noam Chomsky's theory of the origin of linguistic capacity. For, Chomsky proposes that the structure of the human brain embodies within it a 'universal' grammar on the basis of which the 'particular' grammars of all natural languages have been generated.... From this point of view, the acquisition of language is the product of an interaction between received particular ideas and an innate general logical system. Here we have touched on a special feature of human evolution. In having fostered the cultivation of such attributes as curiosity, ambition and imagination, the will to power provided man with the psychological wherewithal to gain ascendancy over his fellow creatures."
**CONTEXT:** This presents Stent's views on the "will to power" as the driver of progress and creativity, linking it to Chomsky's theory of innate linguistic capacity and suggesting this evolutionary feature grants humans ascendancy.

**RAY PEAT:** "The conclusion of Stent's book is reminiscent of (Harvard psychology professor) Hermstein's argument that class distinctions based on genetic differences of intelligence are going to be intensified with time. He discusses the outcome of the will to power: ...the distribution of its intensity among individuals will have been drastically altered. At one end of this distribution will be a minority of the people whose work will keep intact the technology that sustains the multitude at a high standard of living. In the middle of the distribution will be found a type, largely unemployed...whose prototype is the beatnik. At the other end of the spectrum will be a type largely unemployable.... His prototype is the hippie. Stent compares these classes with Huxley's Alpha, Beta, and Gamma classes in Brave New World, which of course were maintained by special genetic techniques."
**CONTEXT:** This connects Stent's ideas to Herrnstein's arguments about genetically determined intelligence and class stratification, drawing parallels to Huxley's dystopian social structure.

**RAY PEAT:** "Not all American scientists are so ignorant and presumptuous: I remember hearing a physiologist express dismay when he heard the 'science is finished' line. Physiology is less formalistic science than genetics--could this be because the idealists haven't worked in it? Many geneticists are thinking of applying their talents to brain physiology when they have brought genetics to a close. Stent assumes there are no important physiological problems left outside the brain."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the dominant idealist view with the perspective of a dismayed physiologist, suggesting that less formalistic sciences like physiology might be less susceptible to idealism and that geneticists are encroaching on brain physiology with potentially flawed assumptions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stent's present profound understanding of the brain includes ideas like these: a genetically determined wiring diagram; mental limits expressed as the number of nerve cells; the brain was not selected for handling deeper problems such as the nature of matter or of cosmos; epistemological aspects place consciousness beyond the realm of scientific research; it can never be explained."
**CONTEXT:** This lists Stent's key ideas about the brain, which are characterized by genetic determinism, reductionism, and a denial of consciousness's scientific explainability.

**RAY PEAT:** "With the U.S. government cutting science funds, the idealistic nonsense of these influential scientists is especially destructive. Because their line coincides with that of the ruling group, they can probably count on good funding when they move into other fields."
**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the destructive impact of idealistic scientific pronouncements, especially in the context of reduced science funding, and suggests that these scientists will likely receive funding due to their alignment with ruling groups.

**RAY PEAT:** "When that happens, what will happen to more materialistic or objective lines of research, such as those that have found that early experience shapes brain development, or that freedom literally makes the brain grow?"
**CONTEXT:** This raises concern about the fate of materialistic and objective research, such as the impact of early experience and freedom on brain development, in the face of dominant idealistic trends.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think they will suffer the same distortion and suppression that some inheritance experiments have received from the idealistic and arbitrary geneticists. The inheritance of 'acquired' alterations in brain size, such as produced by Zamenhof (transgenerational effects of diet) must appear unnatural and perverse to the idealists."
**CONTEXT:** This predicts that objective research will face distortion and suppression, similar to inheritance experiments, due to idealistic biases against acquired traits and transgenerational effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "At a lecture, Professor Stent cited and praised as the basis for his projected work on brain function, two little-known papers in a German publication. These papers were created for the Nazi party as the explicit genetic rationale for killing inferior varieties of people. Stent didn't attempt to distance himself from their political implications."
**CONTEXT:** This reveals Professor Stent's reliance on Nazi-era genetic justifications for his work, highlighting a disturbing lack of critical distance from their political implications.

**RAY PEAT:** "If a new, freedom-tolerant culture ever comes into being, we can expect a new science and technology to appear, and even new brains allowed to develop in freedom, adequate to 'deeper problems' like the nature of matter and of cosmos."
**CONTEXT:** This expresses hope for a future culture that fosters freedom and tolerance, leading to new science, technology, and brain development capable of addressing fundamental questions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Soviet theoretical physicist, Kirill Stanyukovich, has used formal information theory to argue against the idea of a 'heat death' of the universe, and related anti-materialistic, pessimistic and skeptical ideas. He sees the possibility, the necessity, of endless 'upward' evolution of the universe: It is impossible for all processes to be reversible. In the long run changes in quantity must lead to changes in kind and a transition to a new state. Man is still very young. His recorded history spans less than ten thousand years from the most ancient civilizations. Less than fifty years have passed since there emerged on earth a social system throwing open boundless opportunities for man's creative powers, once shackled with social chains."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces Soviet physicist Kirill Stanyukovich's argument against the "heat death" of the universe, proposing endless upward evolution and highlighting humanity's potential for creative power within a liberating social system.

**RAY PEAT:** "This optimistic view is an official part of Marxist doctrine, but I think much of it derives from a cultural optimism that has been recurrent in Russian history. Marxism without the rich Russian culture can be a relatively sterile branch of Hegelian philosophy, or a relatively abstract economic theory. Marxism on a foundation of Aristotelian attitudes is less abstract than a marxism that is grafted onto Cartesian and Hegelian ideas. Optimistically, I think this minor aspect of western culture, the belief in an intellectually richer future, can be recovered and expanded into a humane and scientific culture."
**CONTEXT:** This connects Soviet optimism to Russian cultural history and Aristotelian influences, suggesting that a synthesis of Marxism with these elements can lead to a more humane and scientific culture, contrasting it with sterile or abstract interpretations.

**RAY PEAT:** "I have tried to show how another culture's knowledge can give us insight into our own, and it happens that science and personality are two of the areas in which our culture needs some new understanding. Our mass media, including the schools, have discouraged the critical attitude of wondering why a particular person says a certain thing, and they have actively suppressed the idea that our science and psychology could be tainted by hidden political or financial motives. When a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee expresses an opinion on new sources of energy (e.g., 'wind power is for the birds'), we could better evaluate that opinion if we knew he worked as a consultant for General Atomic and Avco. Other 'scientific opinions' should also be treated with suspicion, but sometimes the hidden motives will be extremely hard to discover. 'Culture' might be defined as a system of hidden motives, and in this case the only way to criticize it will be by getting outside it. Each culture will have special blindnesses and also some areas with great amplitude and richness of vision. Our job, in our own culture, is to open whatever is closed, to generate possibilities by working on what has been neglected."
**CONTEXT:** This concludes by emphasizing the value of cross-cultural insights, particularly for understanding science and personality, and calls for critical awareness of hidden motives in culture and media, advocating for openness and exploration of neglected areas.

**RAY PEAT:** "Two of our Anglo-American culture-problems--the subject-object dualism and the meaning of time--are given new dimensions by seeing how differently the Russians think about consciousness. If we can learn to be curious about disturbing facts--such as a visual after-image of motion--we can let these simple but peculiar events guide us into new patterns of meaning, new ways of being. For example, by continuing to pay attention to a motion after-image, we are not only learning to see a brain process in itself, but we are forcing ourselves to think of the brain as an energy storage system. Our culture has given us nothing useful to do with the perception, so we learn to ignore it. A culture which centers on time and motion, and which describes consciousness as a reflection of the world will more likely find something to do with that sort of perception."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights how Russian perspectives on consciousness offer new dimensions to understanding subject-object dualism and time, and how paying attention to phenomena like motion after-images can lead to new insights about the brain as an energy system, contrasting this with Western cultural neglect of such perceptions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Understanding ourselves in the light of Pavlov's tradition can be liberating and simplifying, while revealing an unsuspected richness and complexity in psychology and biology. Just seeing that there are observable brain processes that are similar in everything we do--sex, education, research, work, conversation--gives us a sense of orientation towards other beings that could hardly be achieved otherwise."
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the liberating and simplifying power of Pavlov's tradition, revealing the complexity of psychology and biology, and suggesting that understanding common brain processes across various activities provides a crucial orientation towards others.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Soviet cultures can give us some new questions, and we need new questions in psychology and in other sciences. But beyond learning what they know, we have the more general job of trying to make our culture more humane, trying to discover all the systems of hidden motives. Robert Creegan, referring to such hidden motives in our culture, said: Either we shall have more generous order, wisdom-imbued and boldly marshaling all the sciences for healing and for constructing, or we shall have planned disorder, cunningly rationalized, and marshaling deteriorating science, to break personalities and to enslave, or to obliterate, thoughtful peoples."
**CONTEXT:** This concludes by stating that Soviet culture offers valuable new questions for psychology and science, and that the broader task is to create a more humane culture by uncovering hidden motives, quoting Robert Creegan on the choice between generous order and planned disorder.
