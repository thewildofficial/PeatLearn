**RAY PEAT:** "The whole analytical and skeptical tradition of British philosophy has not been taken very seriously by the Slavic and Latin cultures, and Marxism has enabled the Russians further to disregard many of the formulations and proscriptions of Anglo-American thought. The idea of the image is the most important example of this dichotomy in the intellectual world, and is the crucial issue in brain research and all of its ramifications--including language, health, education, adaptation to new conditions, and the planning of work."
**CONTEXT:** The author is introducing the fundamental differences in intellectual traditions between the West and Russia, highlighting the concept of "image" as a key area of divergence in understanding the brain and its functions.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since the image is taken to be real, and is such an obvious part of our ordinary existence, for the Soviet brain researcher the question is not whether images exist, but how they exist and what their relation is to sense, reflexes, learning, movement, and meaning. 'Imageless thought' is typically dismissed as a foreign mistake, along with Freudian concepts such as unconscious motivation. American Behaviorists reject consideration of mental images as 'mentalistic' and therefore unscientific, and many neo-Kantians or Cartesians--for example Noam Chomsky--prefer their mentalistic formulations to be composed of rules or other non-image units which are not directly accessible to consciousness. The most technical Soviet studies therefore often have a common sense, 'man in the street' quality about them, and this probably accounts for some of the American disregard of them, since they seem to violate some of the 'basic' (Western) scientific principles."
**CONTEXT:** This passage contrasts the Soviet approach to mental imagery, which accepts its reality and focuses on its mechanisms, with Western approaches that dismiss it as unscientific or mentalistic.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the West, studies of the brain and behavior tend to focus on 'motor,' or efferent systems, since the essence of their activity--i.e., movement--is objectively observable. A typical American formulation is that there are 'motor programs' which govern behavior, and that these are somehow coordinated with sensory, associative, or cognitive systems. In this theory, it is possible to put an electrode into the 'motor region' of the brain, and to electrically activate a 'motor program,' so that, for example, a rooster with 'emit' aggressive behavior. Soviet biologists tend to interpret this kind of experiment differently, because they view the sensory, or afferent systems, as being the most important aspect of the nervous system, and as constituting the essential organizing process of the brain. It has been emphasized that most of the fibers extending from the central nervous system are sensory, and the cortex is thought of as an afferent system, after Pavlov."
**CONTEXT:** The author is explaining the differing emphasis in Western versus Soviet brain research, with the West focusing on motor output and "motor programs," while the Soviet approach prioritizes sensory input and afferent systems, viewing the cortex as primarily an afferent system.

**RAY PEAT:** "A related idea is that there is no merely passive 'receptor' system, but rather an active analyzer system, incorporating effector links. The very concept of behavior implies coordination or orientation. The fragmented or isolated movements that are favored for study in the West, because of their purity or simplicity, have been denounced as 'the nearly artifactual' results of vivisection, in the Soviet literature."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet view of sensory systems as active analyzers, contrasting it with the Western focus on passive receptors and fragmented motor movements, which they consider artifactual.

**RAY PEAT:** "Coordination implies three kinds of image, and apparently involves the interaction of three general parts of the nervous system. An image of the space in which the behavior is to take place is necessary, and the occipital-parietal area of the brain is the part of the brain most directly involved in this. An awareness of the position of the limbs and the general attitude of the body is also necessary and the posterior region of the hemispheres is related to this function. The sequencing, goal-direction, and meaning which are necessary for behavior to exist, are largely functions of the frontal part of the brain. This sequencing process, for example, makes it possible to perceive rhythms, or temporal patterns, but this process is also fundamental to all behavior or perception which persists or develops meaningfully through time."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the Soviet model of coordinated behavior, emphasizing the role of three types of mental images (space, body awareness, sequencing) and their corresponding brain regions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The organism then has a model, or image, of the space in which it will act, of its body's relation to this space, and of its intended behavior or its goal. It is this intention image which very clearly distinguishes the Soviet approach from the ordinary reflex theory in England and the US. Anokhin has condemned the ordinary theory of the 'reflex arc' as an 'outstanding failure,' which 'shows the dualism of its creator' (Descartes), and 'distracts from a materialist solution to the problem of purposiveness.'"
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the Soviet concept of the "intention image" or "acceptor of action" as a key departure from Western reflex arc theory, highlighting its role in goal-directed behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "This intention image is the means for regulating behavior--for 'collating the actual and the intended'--and is sometimes called the 'acceptor of action.' That is, the action is refined, until the perceived result of the action corresponds accurately to the guiding image of the desired situation. Besides its usefulness in explaining the regulation of motor behavior, the mental image is also used to explain the feedback control of sense organs. The Soviet view of the function of the mental image in perception resembles some of the interpretations of Gestalt psychology, but the approach is fundamentally Marxist, in emphasizing the objectivity of the image, rather than Kantian, in looking for subjective or arbitrary tendencies or limitations in image formation. The Soviet theorist often emphasizes that we can always escape from old perceptual habits and mistaken hypotheses by having new experiences, and that the source of the organizing process is in the object, in its 'objectness,' and not in any formal tendency of the perceptual apparatus itself."
**CONTEXT:** This further elaborates on the "intention image" or "acceptor of action," explaining its role in regulating behavior and its fundamental difference from Western approaches, particularly its emphasis on the objectivity of the image derived from the object itself.

**RAY PEAT:** "If image and meaning are given priority over movement and form in describing the functioning of the brain, then science would seem to sanction the transformation of labor into perception. This is, in fact, an explicit trend and policy in the USSR. Recognizing that perception requires interaction with the object, we might say that 'consciousness is action.' Again, it is a belief of this sort that is responsible for the pervasive interaction of politics, culture, work, and science in Soviet life."
**CONTEXT:** This connects the Soviet emphasis on image and meaning to a broader cultural and political philosophy where perception is seen as action, leading to an integration of various aspects of life.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian position is committed to the objective existence of generality: For the 'Dialectic' to operate in matter, without an overseeing God, the meaningful units (such as thesis and antithesis, and the social classes, etc.) must exist intrinsically in matter, which is just to say that generality has objective existence. The Marxian theory of perception appropriately incorporates the generalization function at a very early level of brain function, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. To the extent that the regulatory mental image doesn't constantly arouse the full orienting reflex because of slight disparities between intention and achievement or observation, it is generalized. A general class of achievement, or object or situation, will satisfy; further refinement may be undertaken, but only for a particular reason. The organism otherwise would become immersed in constant refinement of behavior. Since the orienting reflex becomes stronger at higher evolutionary levels, we can think of evolution as being away from facile generalization, and toward a more detailed understanding of matter. At these more refined levels, mistakes are more possible if sensory contact isn't maintained. This point relates to the Marxian belief that valid knowledge derives from practice and workability (Engels), and also to the Marxian idea that cultural forms and beliefs represent a superstructure, rationalizing power relationships or modes of production. If knowledge is derived deductively, rather than from practical experience, it is likely to be empty and mistaken, rather than a true refinement of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This delves into the Marxist philosophical underpinnings of the Soviet approach, emphasizing the objective existence of generality and its role in perception and knowledge acquisition, contrasting it with deductive or purely formalistic approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "The common Marxian theory of scientific discovery (and of education) is identical in form to the Marxian theory of brain function--in both, there is an emphasis on purpose, deep reorganization, and complex perceptual interaction with the material. In the west, scientific discovery is likely to be explained by reference to logical processes (deduction, induction) or by the idea of a 'lucky' choice of a good hypothesis, with none of these relating very deeply to theories of brain function, except that the 'computer' theory of brain function is popular, i.e., the brain is seen as a logic machine. In the west, the difference between human beings and animals is usually described as the absence of certain 'programs' in the animals' logic machine. The Marxian orientation more typically is concerned with the common or universal characteristics of organisms, and then accepts as special anything that goes beyond the general rule."
**CONTEXT:** This draws a parallel between the Marxist understanding of scientific discovery and brain function, both emphasizing purpose, reorganization, and interaction with the material world, contrasting it with Western views that focus on logic, luck, or the brain as a computer.

**RAY PEAT:** "The image of space, and spatial relationships, must be subject to the mental 'sequencer,' if the organism is to move through space with awareness. The mental construction of an object, a 'meaningful configuration,' described above, applies to the organism's understanding of all aspects of reality. A process that begins as a sequential scanning is able to achieve a stable simultaneity, an 'objectness,' a spatial quality. The stored features are related in a certain way so that they can be checked against the real object, and this image thus achieves a spatial quality so it can be used in later, or 'higher order,' sequencings."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how the mental "sequencer" processes spatial information, creating stable "objectness" and enabling meaningful interaction with the environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian and Soviet view, that generality is an intrinsic part of perception, provides no basis for the belief (so common in western countries) that the progress of knowledge toward higher generality requires the fortuitous occurrence of 'geniuses.' Creativity is treated as an essential human trait, part of the human need for self-realization through productive work. Social support, including education, is considered to be the factor which causes great differences in creativity and intelligence, and not genetics. A genetic theory of intelligence is considered to be a mere rationalization for racist practices. Visual imagery is considered to be the basis of creative intelligence, and as such is studied with the intention of finding principles that can be used in education. Emotions (e.g., as measured by the galvanic skin response) are also considered to be an important component of inventive behavior, and are viewed as part of the image-forming process."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet view that creativity and intelligence are fostered by social support and education, not genetics, and that visual imagery and emotions play a crucial role in inventive behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers is one part of the idea of specific, energized attention; the sensory analyzer includes the sense organ, such as the eye or the vestibular apparatus, and related parts of the brain. It is emphasized that sensing is an active, intelligent process, in which features of the world are analyzed, selected, and linked with the organism."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers as active, intelligent processes that link sensory input with the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "We hear most about the simple associative learning of Pavlov's dogs, but Pavlov went from the study of simple association to the investigation of learned sequences, or Dynamic Stereotypes. To understand a thing, its properties, besides being singly 'linked' with the organism by the sensory analyzers, must be linked together with each other, until they can be grasped simultaneously. This simultaneity is called 'objectness.'"
**CONTEXT:** This points out that Pavlov's work extended beyond simple association to "dynamic stereotypes," where linked properties create a simultaneous understanding of an object, termed "objectness."

**RAY PEAT:** "A goal of the organism is held in mind as such a simultaneity, and is the organism's criterion for completion or correctness of action. Anokhin pointed out that the 'stimulus-response' 'reflex arc' was incomplete without such a model of the appropriate reaction, and he called this model 'the acceptor of action.' These mental images, acceptors of action, are both models of intention, and models of what is known; novelty exists whenever the acceptor of action lacks any feature of the perceived environment. Intentional actions mobilize the organism's energy and focus it toward completion."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces Anokhin's concept of the "acceptor of action," a mental model of the intended outcome that guides and refines behavior, highlighting its role in intentional action and novelty detection.

**RAY PEAT:** "In exploration, it is novelty which excites the brain and mobilizes the organism for further investigation. The exercise of the exploratory reflex seems to make more energy available. As long as the world remains a source of new knowledge, the brain will react to novelty with a continued increase of exploratory energy."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how novelty stimulates the brain and mobilizes the organism through the exploratory reflex, leading to increased energy and further investigation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov opposed the 'biologizers' who wished to ignore the importance of human history and culture in the development of our capacities--people who attempt to draw political conclusions from what they claim are human instincts of aggression, territoriality, etc. Pavlov called the first levels of constructions, closely tied to the sensory analyzers, the 'first signal system.' Language and the complex systems of meaning that make up culture (which are possible because of the unique development of our frontal lobes), Pavlov referred to as the 'second signal system.' Science requires that we account for consciousness in biological terms as far as is possible, but consciousness also includes historical and cultural influences, and our biological conceptions must be adequate to account for the existence of all those things which are simply historical--so many of which are arbitrary, and therefore temporary, and to be grown out of."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's distinction between the "first signal system" (sensory perception) and the "second signal system" (language and culture), emphasizing the importance of historical and cultural influences on consciousness and the need for biological conceptions to account for them.

**RAY PEAT:** "Some psychologists have argued, that psychological 'conditioning' can be used to 'brain-wash' people into accepting an authoritarian system. I think it is important to remember that Pavlov understood the conditional reflex to be an intelligent brain process which allows the organism to adapt itself to the world, but also allows it to modify the world to suit its needs for freedom, dignity, morality, and mental exploration."
**CONTEXT:** This reframes Pavlov's concept of the conditional reflex not as a tool for manipulation, but as an intelligent process that enables adaptation and the pursuit of freedom, dignity, morality, and exploration.

**RAY PEAT:** "Is there a function which is being 'simplified' by increasing two-sidedness, as increasing cephalization (head dominance) makes possible increased differentiation and control and subtle coordination with the environment? According to B.G. Ananyev and others, two-sidedness of the brain is involved in our time and space perception and regulation: Perception and control are a unitary process, but the unity is based on the interaction of two halves. Depth perception, for example, is the creation of a perspective by the interaction of two or more slightly different images which separately reveal no perspective."
**CONTEXT:** This explores the evolutionary significance of brain bilaterality, linking it to time and space perception and the creation of perspective through the interaction of two brain halves.

**RAY PEAT:** "If we use only one eye, we can construct a perspective, but in this case we are more dependent on movement, and the combination of images collected over a period of time. (Incidentally, the recognition that stereoscopic perception is a central process which can be independent of external, binocular triangulation, is a revolutionary insight which will tend to purge away mechanistic and Cartesian ideas of consciousness.)"
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the role of movement and temporal integration in single-eye perspective, and highlights stereoscopic perception as a key insight that challenges mechanistic views of consciousness.

**RAY PEAT:** "Separate control of the two sides of the body would seem to require separation of the imaging control system--and as we have a doubleness, a perspective, 'within' the body, we must (as world and body-control are integrated) have a similar doubleness, perspective, within the world. Rhythmic alternation or wave-like motion won't do for animals that manifoldly manipulate the world, changing it. Besides using the two-sided system to control our body in space, we use it to construct a perception of time. If we could only record the perspectives delivered to our brains by movement, it seems likely that we would be locked into a relatively rigid view of space. Because we incorporate a generator of perspectives within our two-sided nervous system, we experience a relative fluidity of time images, and this time-imagination makes our attitude toward space more flexible."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how the brain's bilateral structure creates an internal "doubleness" or perspective that is crucial for both spatial and temporal perception, allowing for flexibility and interaction with the world.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Russian insight is that evolution is a perceptual dynamic, ever becoming more flexible, able to insinuate itself. The basic adaptiveness is perception and response--a beak, a claw, a gut, a feather, pigment, foot, any biological form, is useless without perception, especially subtlety of perception, adequacy. Capacity for response (selection of environment) is perception. Selection of an environment can then create a basis for physical selection. Perception is prior to 'natural selection,' On this basis, we can accept our internal doubleness, our stereoscopic consciousness, as being a highly appropriate way of approaching the world, of getting objective knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This presents the Russian view of evolution as a perceptual dynamic, where perception is primary and drives adaptation, supporting the idea that our internal "doubleness" is a key to objective knowledge.

**RAY PEAT:** "The great majority of our nerves are visual and sensory. Motoric subtlety is achieved by the 'afferent' or sensory nature of our cerebral cortical function, that is, by modulating simple motor output according to fine timing (and spacing) of the imaging cortex. Both timing and spacing (depth creation) are made possible by internal doubleness--perspective creates space (using either time or two perceptual channels), and mental-motoric insinuation, pacing or timing rhythms, create the experiences we have of time. We span a broad present when we have complex rhythms that carry us deeply into a meaningful space. Mechanical rhythms would seemingly disregard the depths of space, and near or far, now and then, wouldn't be so strongly differentiated. With complex and subtle rhythms that can differentiate the present acutely from other times, the uniqueness and fullness of present is perceived as part of the fullness of time, so that we exist in a depth of time as we respond to the depth of space. Our doubleness is a time sense, just as it is a space sense. Space and time are reflected in us."
**CONTEXT:** This elaborates on how sensory input, particularly visual, and the brain's internal "doubleness" contribute to the perception of time and space, creating a rich and nuanced experience of reality.

**RAY PEAT:** "The cortex is the mediator between inside and out. For an abstract person, like Descartes or Sartre or the average American scientist/salesman, all of reality is like a skin between the world and the self, leaving a vacuum for self and for world, except as there is arbitrary interaction in this abstract reality-skin. These are 'cortical' people in the sense that their interacting self has very little to do with their body's highly determinate needs; they are the people that Pavlov called 'intellectuals,' dominated by the 'second signalling system,' language. According to Pavlov, they aren't quite at home in the world."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the integrated, embodied experience of the "artistic" type (dominated by perception) with the detached, abstract experience of the "intellectual" type (dominated by language), as described by Pavlov.

**RAY PEAT:** "The body and the 'older' parts of the brain give precise shape to one's life, and the cortex helps to expand the possibilities that are open to that life. Apparently, as Pavlov said, the cortex can inhibit the lower parts of the brain, so that the body's own life doesn't enter the life of thought and communication. But the cortex is activated by processes in lower or older parts of the brain, so that it functions with the greatest energy and intensity when it is openly collaborating with the instincts."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the interplay between the older brain structures and the cortex, where the older structures activate the cortex, and the cortex, in turn, can modulate or inhibit the body's impulses, ideally working in collaboration.

**RAY PEAT:** "For centuries in western countries there has been an awareness of two very different kinds of sexuality. Sometimes these have been identified as 'sensual copulation' and 'Courtly Love,' or as irresponsible and dutiful sexual relations. This double attitude has occasionally been criticized, but it continues in the present culture to serve as the frame for much of the thinking and talking and political activity related to sex."
**CONTEXT:** This points out the historical dualistic view of sexuality in Western culture, often framed as a conflict between sensual and courtly or dutiful approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "William Blake was one of the first people who clearly described a kind of being which is whole, or at least trying to be whole in opposition to the culture of doubleness."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces William Blake as an early proponent of a holistic view of being, contrasting with the cultural tendency towards duality.

**RAY PEAT:** "'Sand' apparently refers to a barren emotional state, which is an alternative to a distorted and complex growth of the emotions. Blake often referred to biblical ideas, but filled with reality and imagination things which had been only the moralistic thoughts of tribal priests--so this verse might relate to the injunction to 'spill your seed on a woman's belly rather than on the ground,' or something of the sort. Masturbation then would be one meaning of sand--and since in masturbation the energy flow is only in one direction, without exchange and complexification, the idea extends to include this kind of low-energy release in normal copulation. The 'stinking weed' is a negation (not a 'contrary') of this: A moralistic denial of sex for pleasure. (And of course the thicket of emotional and ideological problems which accompany that attitude.) So Blake presents this unpleasant choice, with an indication that there is something better, a 'fruitful land.'"
**CONTEXT:** This interprets Blake's poetry in terms of sexual energy, suggesting "sand" represents barren emotional states or low-energy sexual release, and the "stinking weed" represents moralistic denial, with a "fruitful land" symbolizing a more integrated and generative sexuality.

**RAY PEAT:** "Wilhelm Reich, who broke away from the psychoanalytic movement because of his marxian beliefs and his 'sex-politics,' tried to analyze sexual repression in a biological way. His analysis was the same as Blake's: Both of the culture's sexual alternatives are the result of 'armoring,' or rigidifying, of the organism. He said that 'four-lettering' is not the same as making love, but that it is accepted by the repressive society because it is passive, and less dangerous than full sexuality."
**CONTEXT:** This connects Wilhelm Reich's biological analysis of sexual repression to Blake's ideas, both attributing it to "armoring" and contrasting passive sexuality with genuine lovemaking.

**RAY PEAT:** "The mechanical aspects of sexual excitation--genital friction, etc.--are the usual subject of the 'neurophysiology of sex.' Presumably, sensory nerves in the genitals contribute to increased tension in the autonomic nervous system, including the nerves of the pelvic ganglion. Whatever brain-like quality these visceral ganglia may have, they are still deeply integrated with the central nervous system and the cortex. One general kind of integration is the 'setting' of the level at which reflex activity will occur. This control is probably exerted by a balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and by the rate of stimulation, and by chemical influences."
**CONTEXT:** This discusses the neurophysiology of sexual excitation, emphasizing the integration of autonomic and central nervous systems and the role of neural balance and chemical influences in regulating reflex activity.

**RAY PEAT:** "The 'setting' of reflexes and thresholds must be a complex process, relating to the whole life of the organism. If the local sexual autonomic nerves are isolated from the stabilizing influences of the brain, the orgasm reflex can probably occur almost without sensation--a 'genital' or 'pelvic orgasm' may be little more than a mild peristaltic movement of the tubular organs. If the brain's cortex, by stabilizing the autonomic nervous system, allows the tension to build up, and the autonomic nervous system then acts as a 'capacitor' or reservoir by preserving tension until the entire personality experiences 'resolution' and satisfaction, then the tension can spread throughout the autonomic nervous system, and produce an intensely pleasurable discharge throughout the body, possibly involving some 'pleasure center' in the brain."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how the brain's influence, particularly the cortex, is crucial for a full and pleasurable orgasmic experience, by regulating tension and allowing for a widespread discharge of energy.

**RAY PEAT:** "The balance isn't invisible and exact--physiological changes occur in the process. The 'Effect of Person,' which exists not only in people and dogs as a slowing of heart rate (bradycardia), but even in lower organisms as an electrophysiological response, is such a physiological change toward parasympathetic arousal, and during orgasm the bradycardia suddenly becomes extreme--the rhythm changes so suddenly that the heart seems to have stopped. The explanation for this continuity, from 'Effect of Person' to orgasm, seems to be that excitement and desire exist as a tension of approximated balance, and that with resolution, the 'expectancy' tension of the sympathetic system falls away, leaving parasympathetic dominance."
**CONTEXT:** This connects the "Effect of Person" (parasympathetic arousal) to orgasm, explaining it as a progression of balanced tension leading to parasympathetic dominance and a sudden, extreme slowing of the heart.

**RAY PEAT:** "The para-sympathetic dominance is very similar to the vegetative state of sleep. Cortical resolution, with inhibition replacing excitation, is probably another aspect of this process. Two things are implied by this analysis: That we can by-pass the cortex if we can't stand the tension (two ways are common in our dichotomous culture--'let's get married,' and 'let's fuck'), and that if we choose the way of tension we find that our character, our whole way of being in the world, is involved in the way we accumulate and distribute and discharge tension. We find that we will take in perceptions and attitudes from the one we are loving, exchanging perspectives and worlds and bodies. As the personality experiences resolution, we find that our world changes. (Loving intensely is thus a form of objective scientific research--getting new knowledge about the world.)"
**CONTEXT:** This suggests that parasympathetic dominance, similar to sleep, is involved in resolution and transformation, and that choosing to engage with tension in lovemaking leads to personal growth and a changed perception of the world.

**RAY PEAT:** "Just as the brain stimulates and maintains the other tissues, and each hemisphere has a trophic, stimulating effect on the other, the older, instinctive systems of the brain activate the cortex, and exert a trophic, growth-promoting influence on it. Wild animals have larger brains than caged ones, which implies that life and freedom are brain stimulants. Problems are opportunities. People can be the richest kind of opportunity, the most stimulating kind of problem. To do this they have to arouse tension. (Blake said 'opposition is true friendship.') This is not to advocate competition. Competition tries to eliminate the problem by defeating an opponent, and can exist only in the armored character, which allows energy to flow only in one direction, and which can't tolerate tension."
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes that life, freedom, and even "opposition" (in the sense of stimulating challenges) are crucial for brain growth and function, contrasting this with competition which arises from a rigid, "armored" character.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov emphasized that the cortex always participates in awareness and behavior, so that the various biological activities of the organism will be oriented with relation to the world; according to his perspective, Reich's 'armored' character would probably be considered a variety of hysteria, with cortical weakness, especially weakness of the inhibitory-trophic processes. Muscular tension, for example, increases when the cortex is removed. Where many Reichians consider tension of muscles to be an active inhibition of natural energy flow, the problem might be a failure of brain activity to actively relax them, as in the 'rapid eye movement' phase of sleep. This relaxation probably results from processes that occur in both the waking and the sleeping cortex."
**CONTEXT:** This interprets Reich's concept of "armoring" through a Pavlovian lens, suggesting it represents cortical weakness and a failure of inhibitory-trophic processes, which can be counteracted by brain activity that promotes relaxation.

**RAY PEAT:** "American Behaviorism has given to the phrase 'conditioned reflex' a connotation of 'involuntary, unconscious behavior which is built up by repetition.' In Pavlov's use of the phrase, though, there was no such implication. In his usage, this brain function can be instantaneous and insightful. His purpose was to explain the way we are. Too many American Behaviorists deliberately leave an unexplained residue (creativity, single-trial learning, sudden insight, Gestalt formation, etc.) which has to be filled by dualistic constructions, magical processes, or Kantian limitations to allowable, possible, knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This critiques the American Behaviorist interpretation of "conditioned reflex" as purely repetitive and unconscious, contrasting it with Pavlov's view of it as an intelligent, potentially instantaneous process that explains the totality of being.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov spoke of a 'Reflex of Purpose' and a 'Reflex of Freedom.' He was aware of the political significance of psychological theories. He claimed we have a real, biological need to be free and purposive. This is utterly opposed to arguments such as Skinner's in Beyond Freedom and Dignity. Skinner's claim that we have no instinctive desires is needed to justify the friendly fascism that he advocated. (Usually, the people who argue that we have no good instinctive urges--such as sex--are the same people who argue that aggression is innate: Our culture still teaches about sexless Eden and Original Sin.)"
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's belief in innate needs for freedom and purpose, directly contrasting it with Skinner's views and the cultural narratives that suppress natural desires.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 'fizzly' dream state of exhaustion/depression, black can't be experienced, because of diffuse background activity. The same amount of energy or activity could produce more intense and pleasant experience if it could be properly distributed according to meaning patterns. An interesting analytic point is that this fizzly state is a meaning; the world is flattened and garbled, and we are disturbingly committed to that kind of world, even though we may know it isn't right--it feels terrible, but the meaning is right there. In this sense, the 'normal' person is committed to this world, because its meaning is intrinsic, and he probably has never experienced a more intense consciousness. I want to emphasize that the experience is always meaning, and that we mean garbled if that's what we experience, in the sense that Merleau-Ponty said that we 'are doomed to meaning.'"
**CONTEXT:** This describes the state of exhaustion and depression as a "fizzly" experience where energy is poorly distributed, leading to a flattened and garbled perception of reality, which is still perceived as meaningful, albeit negatively.

**RAY PEAT:** "The hologram idea implies that the fine structure is meaningfully ordered with regard to the represented world: This is its window-like quality. Its degree of order will correspond to the order which it images, and this order will increase with generality, and decrease with compartmentalization or so-called concretization (actually, what is most general is most concrete). Energy flow and intensity will change as the nature of the field changes. Both energy production and energy flow become more efficient with insight/control. Convoluted flow, like lobotomy, cuts off the perspective, verbalizes and concretizes, but stays open to energy, in a fizzly, soggy way."
**CONTEXT:** This applies the hologram concept to consciousness, suggesting that order, generality, and energy flow are interconnected, and that processes like lobotomy disrupt this by cutting off perspective and leading to a "fizzly" state.

**RAY PEAT:** "When we think of 'resolving' or discriminating as an actual material resonance process, in which living material resonates in forms corresponding to forms in the world, we have a concept in which the body-mind problem disappears."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes that viewing discrimination and resolution as material resonance processes dissolves the mind-body dualism.

**RAY PEAT:** "The scientists of empire are announcing the end of science and art, and of all cultural progress. Their argument is simple: The knowable world is finite, and our knowledge of it grows at an increasing rate. The end must come soon. Some of them say that physics and chemistry are already finished, and that biology will be completed when a few puzzles are solved in genetics--and the general form of these solutions is already known."
**CONTEXT:** This critiques the "end of science" narrative propagated by certain scientists, framing it as an idealistic perspective that limits the potential for future discovery.

**RAY PEAT:** "Idealists see 'pure knowledge' as the source of technology, and so technology must come to an end too, a little later than science. Materialists are more likely to see our time as being near the beginning, not the end. For example, Marx (who borrowed so much from Hegel) said that 'real history' couldn't begin until capitalism has been overcome."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the idealist view of a finite, ending science and technology with the materialist perspective of ongoing progress and the potential for new beginnings.

**RAY PEAT:** "I think this observation is more tautology than perception. The term 'materialism' describes the attitude that likes to begin with 'the matter at hand,' 'idealism' describes an approach that emphasizes the importance of established ideas. One's place in the world obviously influences judgments as to where truth and value can be found."
**CONTEXT:** This defines materialism and idealism in terms of their starting points – "the matter at hand" versus "established ideas" – and suggests that one's worldview shapes their perception of truth and value.

**RAY PEAT:** "Ever since Heraclitus, materialists have emphasized change, while idealists emphasize stasis. 'Pure knowledge' is a source of technology, but technology is also a basis for the development of new formalized knowledge. The steam engine was already in common use when Carnot and Joule formulated its basic theory."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the historical materialist emphasis on change versus the idealist emphasis on stasis, and notes that technological development can precede theoretical understanding.

**RAY PEAT:** "Geneticists have been the worst offenders. Genetics is popular among bourgeois racists and elitists, and many geneticists have eagerly formulated genetic theories of intelligence on the flimsiest evidence. But seemingly decent 'liberal' geneticists are pushing the idealist doctrine about the end of science. The reason for this must be that genetics has so little real subject matter that theoretical formalisms can generate the desired conclusions with little interference from the material world. There is a collection of papers by the great founders of genetics, which is about all that contemporary geneticists know about the history of genetics. Looking at the data published there, and interpreting it with different assumptions, one can see the breath-taking mystical guidance those men must have had--it wasn't even necessary for them to try to dispose of alternate interpretations, their faith was so great or their vision so narrow."
**CONTEXT:** This criticizes certain geneticists for their embrace of racial theories and the "end of science" doctrine, attributing it to a lack of engagement with material reality and a reliance on theoretical formalisms.

**RAY PEAT:** "Stent believes that the 'will to power' is what creates progress, by being sublimated into creativity. 'natural selection favored those proto-human genes which produce a brain in which the will to power concept is innately latent.'"
**CONTEXT:** This summarizes Gunther Stent's view that the "will to power," channeled into creativity, drives progress, and that this is rooted in innate genetic predispositions in the human brain.

**RAY PEAT:** "The conclusion of Stent's book is reminiscent of (Harvard psychology professor) Hermstein's argument that class distinctions based on genetic differences of intelligence are going to be intensified with time. He discusses the outcome of the will to power: ...the distribution of its intensity among individuals will have been drastically altered. At one end of this distribution will be a minority of the people whose work will keep intact the technology that sustains the multitude at a high standard of living. In the middle of the distribution will be found a type, largely unemployed...whose prototype is the beatnik. At the other end of the spectrum will be a type largely unemployable.... His prototype is the hippie. Stent compares these classes with Huxley's Alpha, Beta, and Gamma classes in Brave New World, which of course were maintained by special genetic techniques."
**CONTEXT:** This draws a parallel between Stent's and Hermstein's arguments about genetically determined intelligence leading to social stratification, reminiscent of Huxley's dystopian vision.

**RAY PEAT:** "If a new, freedom-tolerant culture ever comes into being, we can expect a new science and technology to appear, and even new brains allowed to develop in freedom, adequate to 'deeper problems' like the nature of matter and of cosmos."
**CONTEXT:** This expresses a hopeful outlook that a culture valuing freedom will foster new scientific and technological advancements, including the development of brains capable of addressing fundamental questions.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Soviet theoretical physicist, Kirill Stanyukovich, has used formal information theory to argue against the idea of a 'heat death' of the universe, and related anti-materialistic, pessimistic and skeptical ideas. He sees the possibility, the necessity, of endless 'upward' evolution of the universe:"
**CONTEXT:** This introduces the Soviet physicist Kirill Stanyukovich's argument against cosmic pessimism, proposing endless upward evolution based on information theory.

**RAY PEAT:** "Man is still very young. His recorded history spans less than ten thousand years from the most ancient civilizations. Less than fifty years have passed since there emerged on earth a social system throwing open boundless opportunities for man's creative powers, once shackled with social chains."
**CONTEXT:** This quote from Stanyukovich emphasizes humanity's youth and the potential for creative liberation offered by a new social system.

**RAY PEAT:** "This optimistic view is an official part of Marxist doctrine, but I think much of it derives from a cultural optimism that has been recurrent in Russian history. Marxism without the rich Russian culture can be a relatively sterile branch of Hegelian philosophy, or a relatively abstract economic theory. Marxism on a foundation of Aristotelian attitudes is less abstract than a marxism that is grafted onto Cartesian and Hegelian ideas. Optimistically, I think this minor aspect of western culture, the belief in an intellectually richer future, can be recovered and expanded into a humane and scientific culture."
**CONTEXT:** This connects Russian cultural optimism to Marxist doctrine, suggesting that a synthesis of Marxism with Aristotelian thought, rather than Cartesian or Hegelian, leads to a more robust and less abstract worldview, and expresses hope for a similar integration in Western culture.

**RAY PEAT:** "I have tried to show how another culture's knowledge can give us insight into our own, and it happens that science and personality are two of the areas in which our culture needs some new understanding. Our mass media, including the schools, have discouraged the critical attitude of wondering why a particular person says a certain thing, and they have actively suppressed the idea that our science and psychology could be tainted by hidden political or financial motives. When a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee expresses an opinion on new sources of energy (e.g., 'wind power is for the birds'), we could better evaluate that opinion if we knew he worked as a consultant for General Atomic and Avco. Other 'scientific opinions' should also be treated with suspicion, but sometimes the hidden motives will be extremely hard to discover. 'Culture' might be defined as a system of hidden motives, and in this case the only way to criticize it will be by getting outside it. Each culture will have special blindnesses and also some areas with great amplitude and richness of vision. Our job, in our own culture, is to open whatever is closed, to generate possibilities by working on what has been neglected."
**CONTEXT:** This advocates for a critical examination of one's own culture, particularly in science and psychology, by recognizing hidden motives and biases, and suggests that understanding other cultures can provide valuable insights for self-improvement.

**RAY PEAT:** "Two of our Anglo-American culture-problems--the subject-object dualism and the meaning of time--are given new dimensions by seeing how differently the Russians think about consciousness. If we can learn to be curious about disturbing facts--such as a visual after-image of motion--we can let these simple but peculiar events guide us into new patterns of meaning, new ways of being. For example, by continuing to pay attention to a motion after-image, we are not only learning to see a brain process in itself, but we are forcing ourselves to think of the brain as an energy storage system. Our culture has given us nothing useful to do with the perception, so we learn to ignore it. A culture which centers on time and motion, and which describes consciousness as a reflection of the world will more likely find something to do with that sort of perception."
**CONTEXT:** This suggests that by examining seemingly minor perceptual phenomena, like motion after-images, and understanding how other cultures integrate them, we can gain new perspectives on consciousness, time, and the brain as an energy system.

**RAY PEAT:** "Understanding ourselves in the light of Pavlov's tradition can be liberating and simplifying, while revealing an unsuspected richness and complexity in psychology and biology. Just seeing that there are observable brain processes that are similar in everything we do--sex, education, research, work, conversation--gives us a sense of orientation towards other beings that could hardly be achieved otherwise."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the liberating and simplifying power of Pavlov's tradition, revealing the underlying brain processes common to all human activities and fostering a sense of orientation towards others.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Soviet cultures can give us some new questions, and we need new questions in psychology and in other sciences. But beyond learning what they know, we have the more general job of trying to make our culture more humane, trying to discover all the systems of hidden motives. Robert Creegan, referring to such hidden motives in our culture, said: Either we shall have more generous order, wisdom-imbued and boldly marshaling all the sciences for healing and for constructing, or we shall have planned disorder, cunningly rationalized, and marshaling deteriorating science, to break personalities and to enslave, or to obliterate, thoughtful peoples."
**CONTEXT:** This concludes by emphasizing the need for new questions in science and the importance of making culture more humane by uncovering hidden motives, quoting Robert Creeley on the choice between generative and destructive societal paths.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov described this reflex as the 'what is it?' reflex. With more detailed knowledge of the brain, the reticular activating system of the brain stem has come to be considered as the most important location of the integrating and exciting processes in the orienting reflex: For example, aminazine, a chemical which selectively inhibits the reticular formation will block the reflex. But it is distinctly a reflex of the whole animal: Cortex, hypothalamus, sense organs, motor and autonomic processes are integral parts of it. It is the thing that makes learning possible, and every part of the organism participates in an appropriate way. Many western researchers have claimed that conditioning doesn't always involve the cortex, or that individual reflexes such as the heart reflex are separable things--"when you call the dog, first comes the pulse, then comes the dog." These points are denied by all the leading Soviet workers, and considered to be mistakes of methodology or interpretation."
**CONTEXT:** This explains the orienting reflex as a fundamental "what is it?" response, involving the entire organism and the reticular activating system, and contrasts the Soviet holistic view with Western reductionist claims about isolated reflexes.

**RAY PEAT:** "The image, as already discussed in the preceding chapter, is the central part of the orienting reflex. An unfamiliar sound, for example, will arouse the animal so that all of its senses bear on the thing producing the sound, so that it can construct an image or 'reflection' of the thing in its consciousness; if the object (or required behavior) is familiar, the animal will be able to match its image with what it is perceiving so that recognition of the thing or execution of the action is immediate. The animal knows what to do with the object, and doesn't have to concern itself with investigation of it. A familiar environment frees the energies for other purposes, which (especially in apes and humans) may be a search for unfamiliar things."
**CONTEXT:** This reiterates the central role of the mental image in the orienting reflex, explaining how it allows for recognition of familiar stimuli and frees energy for exploring novelty.

**RAY PEAT:** "As familiarity and experience increase, the world becomes ampler for the organism, its range increases. This is exactly the opposite of a view that says that the animal, with each increment of learned behavior, becomes more specialized and limited. Learning is not a closing, but an opening of possibilities. The 'motor' theory, which neglects the fact that the organism is always oriented with regard to its environment, must see every learned precision as a restriction of the organism's freedom. In the West, we are constantly told that 'We must give up some freedom to attain mastery of' some behavior or technology which is desirable. On the social scale, we hear that specialists must not venture beyond their 'area of competence,' and that political specialists know what is best for society. American Behaviorism is a fine ideology for a society that wants to combine authoritarian government with a system of specialized training for specialized jobs, because it claims that finely controlled behavior must be specialized and exists as a constraint on behavior. The error, of course, is that they ignore the fact that there can be no behavior without orientation, and general understanding of the environment (the relevant world) is part of fine control of behavior."
**CONTEXT:** This argues that learning, through the orienting reflex, expands possibilities rather than limiting them, contrasting this with Western views that equate mastery with restricted freedom and the ideology of American Behaviorism.

**RAY PEAT:** "There may be very simple anatomical or physiological reasons for the fact that a discrepancy between the mental image and the environmental stimulus leads to such an intense reflex, such an energetic mobilization of the entire organism to deal with the novelty. This question is right at the border of present knowledge and speculation. It is reasonable to look for the most intimate connection possible, between energy production (metabolism) and energy use (experience, in its broadest sense). It is now common to look for metabolic disturbances in connection with perceptual/behavioral problems. In some sense, we can think of the image-discrepancy as being represented on the tissue level as a disturbed resonance, a structural distortion--the physical details of this are highly speculative, but the Marxian viewpoint expects a higher holism to exist, even beyond the level which sees an organism as 'a desire to explore.'"
**CONTEXT:** This speculates on the physiological basis of the orienting reflex's intensity, linking it to metabolism, energy production, and potential tissue-level disruptions, while referencing the Marxian expectation of higher holism.

**RAY PEAT:** "If we think of the organism as an energy system, holding its world-image in consciousness, it's reasonable to guess that a unified, generalized picture of the world will take less energy to support than will a jumbled, chaotic collection of images--and certainly the recall of the appropriate image to interpret a stimulus will be easier if the world-image is highly organized. A higher degree of holism would be the existence of a tendency toward completeness, as part of the exploratory reflex--a desire for a view, not just for isolated or random images. This is usually assumed in the discussions of the orienting reflex, but to make it explicit makes it easier to see how the orienting reflex relates to other kinds of behavior, such as eating, sex, and defence."
**CONTEXT:** This proposes that a unified and organized world-image requires less energy and facilitates the orienting reflex, linking holism to a desire for completeness and its relevance to other fundamental behaviors.

**RAY PEAT:** "The 'exclusion principle' means that every holistic activity tends to be the only one present at a given time. He suggests that this mechanism has evolved simultaneously with the organism's complexification which increases the number of its systems' functions."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Anokhin's "exclusion principle" as a mechanism for prioritizing holistic activities, which evolves with increasing organismic complexity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Anokhin stresses that afferent feedback is an intrinsic part of every holistic activity, that it has the status of the 'fourth link in the reflex.' This means that 'it is impossible to isolate the afferent feedback from the total action which begins with the reflex arc and ends with the afferent feedback.' 'The orienting reaction cannot be terminated in its process,' since 'such interruption would automatically yield information regarding what is going on outside of the organism.'"
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Anokhin's view of afferent feedback as an integral part of the reflex, essential for the continuous process of the orienting reaction and information gathering.

**RAY PEAT:** "The exclusion principle can be elaborated a little farther. If the orienting reflex is very strong, it will inhibit all other present acts. But it can also be assimilated by the ongoing activity of the organism, so that the excitation from the orienting-exploratory reaction summates with the activity that is dominant at that time. There will be just one activity, but its intensity will increase. Under other conditions, there can be a transformation, so that the reaction to novelty brings out a concealed 'dominant,' and suppresses the activity that was present. The defensive reaction is the one that most frequently assimilates to itself the excitation of the orienting reflex. This transformability of the orienting-exploratory reflex into a defensive reaction has a parallel in early development. Early painful experiences, 'during the period of formation,' can lead 'to a prolonged pathological reinforcement of some reactions and the weakening of others which exerts an influence on the whole life that follows' (Obraztzova, et al.). In puppies, early trauma leads to behavior dominated by the passive-defensive reflex, and suppression of the exploratory reflex in particular. It is assumed that something equivalent can occur in humans."
**CONTEXT:** This details how the orienting reflex can either enhance existing activities or transform into a defensive reaction, particularly if early trauma leads to a dominance of defensive reflexes and suppression of exploration.

**RAY PEAT:** "In English, the word 'condition' has two groups of meanings. One group clusters around the idea of 'stipulation,' as in 'he accepts the proposal with certain conditions,' and another cluster has to do with something closer to a thing's state of being, as in 'the car (or athlete) is in good condition.' Our English word derives from Latin for 'speaking together,' and in Russian there is a word, uslovni, with a similar origin relating to speech and stipulation. However, Russian has also adopted the Latin-based word, konditsiya, with its meaning limited to our 'state of being' cluster, making it impossible to confuse the two meanings: Air-conditioning and athletic conditioning use the Latin-derived word, while contractual and linguistic conditions use the Slavic word. In Pavlov's work, the 'conditional reflex' was understood as the 'stipulated or agreed-upon (uslovni) reflex,' but this essential point has been almost entirely lost in a false translation. Watson presented himself as a student of the famous Pavlov, and argued for an unconscious psychology, with the result that our culture has lost the meaning of the century's greatest work in psychology and brain physiology."
**CONTEXT:** This clarifies the crucial distinction between the Russian "uslovni" (conditional, stipulated) and "konditsiya" (state of being), explaining how the mistranslation of Pavlov's "conditional reflex" by Watson led to a misunderstanding of its meaning.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov was the son of a priest, and studied at a seminary school, so he was thoroughly saturated with the Greek-derived ideas of the Eastern Church. For Pavlov, the world's essential property is that it is full of potential, and that we will know more in the future than we do at present. This centrality of time permeates the tradition of Pavlov. If time is real and the world is the source of knowledge, then science is seen as a basic life function, in which the brain is the organ for knowing the world and maintaining an equilibrium with it. The essential feature of the conditional reflex, as understood by Pavlov, was its temporariness; if it is a recognition of a temporary conjunction of events in the world, intelligence requires that it not persist longer than the condition in the environment does. But when learning has to do with the way the world actually works, one insight is enough to fix the knowledge forever; Pavlov said that when a cat learns how to open the latch to its cage, such learning has taken place, and the cat is doing something equivalent to science. (He also believed that such permanent, scientific learning was eventually incorporated into heredity as the instincts.)"
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's philosophical background and his view of the conditional reflex as a temporary, intelligent adaptation to the world, emphasizing the role of time and the potential for learning to become instinctual.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the West, our idea of the 'conditioned reflex' has been exactly the opposite: we have emphasized its difference from insight-learning by ascribing to it a kind of brainless sluggishness, in which the role of time is reversed--it is slow to form, and slow to decay, but sure to decay, without regard to whether it is insightful or merely arbitrary."
**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the Western interpretation of the conditioned reflex as slow, sluggish, and arbitrary with Pavlov's more nuanced understanding.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov recognized that there must be attention before learning could take place, and that the availability of brain energy was specific, and appeared according to the needs of the organism, and was provided by the hereditary instincts. Thus, when an animal attends to a new thing or situation, or when it explores, it is using a specific brain energy: He spoke of an instinct for exploration, for science ('a truth tropism'), for liberty, and dignity. The integrity of the organism requires opportunity for exploration, for freedom, etc., and Pavlov pointed out that psychiatry must treat mental patients with proper concern for their needs and rights. (The California researchers who found that rats' brains grow when their environment is enriched, and that the effects increase with subsequent generations, probably didn't know that they were validating two of Pavlov's basic doctrines.)"
**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes Pavlov's recognition of attention, specific brain energy, and innate instincts for exploration, science, liberty, and dignity as fundamental to learning and organismic integrity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers is one part of the idea of specific, energized attention; the sensory analyzer includes the sense organ, such as the eye or the vestibular apparatus, and related parts of the brain. It is emphasized that sensing is an active, intelligent process, in which features of the world are analyzed, selected, and linked with the organism."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers as active, intelligent processes that link sensory input with the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "We hear most about the simple associative learning of Pavlov's dogs, but Pavlov went from the study of simple association to the investigation of learned sequences, or Dynamic Stereotypes. To understand a thing, its properties, besides being singly 'linked' with the organism by the sensory analyzers, must be linked together with each other, until they can be grasped simultaneously. This simultaneity is called 'objectness.'"
**CONTEXT:** This points out that Pavlov's work extended beyond simple association to "dynamic stereotypes," where linked properties create a simultaneous understanding of an object, termed "objectness."

**RAY PEAT:** "A goal of the organism is held in mind as such a simultaneity, and is the organism's criterion for completion or correctness of action. Anokhin pointed out that the 'stimulus-response' 'reflex arc' was incomplete without such a model of the appropriate reaction, and he called this model 'the acceptor of action.' These mental images, acceptors of action, are both models of intention, and models of what is known; novelty exists whenever the acceptor of action lacks any feature of the perceived environment. Intentional actions mobilize the organism's energy and focus it toward completion."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces Anokhin's concept of the "acceptor of action," a mental model of the intended outcome that guides and refines behavior, highlighting its role in intentional action and novelty detection.

**RAY PEAT:** "In exploration, it is novelty which excites the brain and mobilizes the organism for further investigation. The exercise of the exploratory reflex seems to make more energy available. As long as the world remains a source of new knowledge, the brain will react to novelty with a continued increase of exploratory energy."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how novelty stimulates the brain and mobilizes the organism through the exploratory reflex, leading to increased energy and further investigation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov opposed the 'biologizers' who wished to ignore the importance of human history and culture in the development of our capacities--people who attempt to draw political conclusions from what they claim are human instincts of aggression, territoriality, etc. Pavlov called the first levels of constructions, closely tied to the sensory analyzers, the 'first signal system.' Language and the complex systems of meaning that make up culture (which are possible because of the unique development of our frontal lobes), Pavlov referred to as the 'second signal system.' Science requires that we account for consciousness in biological terms as far as is possible, but consciousness also includes historical and cultural influences, and our biological conceptions must be adequate to account for the existence of all those things which are simply historical--so many of which are arbitrary, and therefore temporary, and to be grown out of."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's distinction between the "first signal system" (sensory perception) and the "second signal system" (language and culture), emphasizing the importance of historical and cultural influences on consciousness and the need for biological conceptions to account for them.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian position is committed to the objective existence of generality: For the 'Dialectic' to operate in matter, without an overseeing God, the meaningful units (such as thesis and antithesis, and the social classes, etc.) must exist intrinsically in matter, which is just to say that generality has objective existence. The Marxian theory of perception appropriately incorporates the generalization function at a very early level of brain function, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. To the extent that the regulatory mental image doesn't constantly arouse the full orienting reflex because of slight disparities between intention and achievement or observation, it is generalized. A general class of achievement, or object or situation, will satisfy; further refinement may be undertaken, but only for a particular reason. The organism otherwise would become immersed in constant refinement of behavior. Since the orienting reflex becomes stronger at higher evolutionary levels, we can think of evolution as being away from facile generalization, and toward a more detailed understanding of matter. At these more refined levels, mistakes are more possible if sensory contact isn't maintained. This point relates to the Marxian belief that valid knowledge derives from practice and workability (Engels), and also to the Marxian idea that cultural forms and beliefs represent a superstructure, rationalizing power relationships or modes of production. If knowledge is derived deductively, rather than from practical experience, it is likely to be empty and mistaken, rather than a true refinement of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This delves into the Marxist philosophical underpinnings of the Soviet approach, emphasizing the objective existence of generality and its role in perception and knowledge acquisition, contrasting it with deductive or purely formalistic approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "The image of space, and spatial relationships, must be subject to the mental 'sequencer,' if the organism is to move through space with awareness. The mental construction of an object, a 'meaningful configuration,' described above, applies to the organism's understanding of all aspects of reality. A process that begins as a sequential scanning is able to achieve a stable simultaneity, an 'objectness,' a spatial quality. The stored features are related in a certain way so that they can be checked against the real object, and this image thus achieves a spatial quality so it can be used in later, or 'higher order,' sequencings."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how the mental "sequencer" processes spatial information, creating stable "objectness" and enabling meaningful interaction with the environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian and Soviet view, that generality is an intrinsic part of perception, provides no basis for the belief (so common in western countries) that the progress of knowledge toward higher generality requires the fortuitous occurrence of 'geniuses.' Creativity is treated as an essential human trait, part of the human need for self-realization through productive work. Social support, including education, is considered to be the factor which causes great differences in creativity and intelligence, and not genetics. A genetic theory of intelligence is considered to be a mere rationalization for racist practices. Visual imagery is considered to be the basis of creative intelligence, and as such is studied with the intention of finding principles that can be used in education. Emotions (e.g., as measured by the galvanic skin response) are also considered to be an important component of inventive behavior, and are viewed as part of the image-forming process."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet view that creativity and intelligence are fostered by social support and education, not genetics, and that visual imagery and emotions play a crucial role in inventive behavior.

Science requires that we account for consciousness in biological terms as far as is possible, but consciousness also includes historical and cultural influences, and our biological conceptions must be adequate to account for the existence of all those things which are simply historical--so many of which are arbitrary, and therefore temporary, and to be grown out of."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's distinction between the "first signal system" (sensory perception) and the "second signal system" (language and culture), emphasizing the importance of historical and cultural influences on consciousness and the need for biological conceptions to account for them.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian position is committed to the objective existence of generality: For the 'Dialectic' to operate in matter, without an overseeing God, the meaningful units (such as thesis and antithesis, and the social classes, etc.) must exist intrinsically in matter, which is just to say that generality has objective existence. The Marxian theory of perception appropriately incorporates the generalization function at a very early level of brain function, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. To the extent that the regulatory mental image doesn't constantly arouse the full orienting reflex because of slight disparities between intention and achievement or observation, it is generalized. A general class of achievement, or object or situation, will satisfy; further refinement may be undertaken, but only for a particular reason. The organism otherwise would become immersed in constant refinement of behavior. Since the orienting reflex becomes stronger at higher evolutionary levels, we can think of evolution as being away from facile generalization, and toward a more detailed understanding of matter. At these more refined levels, mistakes are more possible if sensory contact isn't maintained. This point relates to the Marxian belief that valid knowledge derives from practice and workability (Engels), and also to the Marxian idea that cultural forms and beliefs represent a superstructure, rationalizing power relationships or modes of production. If knowledge is derived deductively, rather than from practical experience, it is likely to be empty and mistaken, rather than a true refinement of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This delves into the Marxist philosophical underpinnings of the Soviet approach, emphasizing the objective existence of generality and its role in perception and knowledge acquisition, contrasting it with deductive or purely formalistic approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "The image of space, and spatial relationships, must be subject to the mental 'sequencer,' if the organism is to move through space with awareness. The mental construction of an object, a 'meaningful configuration,' described above, applies to the organism's understanding of all aspects of reality. A process that begins as a sequential scanning is able to achieve a stable simultaneity, an 'objectness,' a spatial quality. The stored features are related in a certain way so that they can be checked against the real object, and this image thus achieves a spatial quality so it can be used in later, or 'higher order,' sequencings."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how the mental "sequencer" processes spatial information, creating stable "objectness" and enabling meaningful interaction with the environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian and Soviet view, that generality is an intrinsic part of perception, provides no basis for the belief (so common in western countries) that the progress of knowledge toward higher generality requires the fortuitous occurrence of 'geniuses.' Creativity is treated as an essential human trait, part of the human need for self-realization through productive work. Social support, including education, is considered to be the factor which causes great differences in creativity and intelligence, and not genetics. A genetic theory of intelligence is considered to be a mere rationalization for racist practices. Visual imagery is considered to be the basis of creative intelligence, and as such is studied with the intention of finding principles that can be used in education. Emotions (e.g., as measured by the galvanic skin response) are also considered to be an important component of inventive behavior, and are viewed as part of the image-forming process."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet view that creativity and intelligence are fostered by social support and education, not genetics, and that visual imagery and emotions play a crucial role in inventive behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers is one part of the idea of specific, energized attention; the sensory analyzer includes the sense organ, such as the eye or the vestibular apparatus, and related parts of the brain. It is emphasized that sensing is an active, intelligent process, in which features of the world are analyzed, selected, and linked with the organism."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers as active, intelligent processes that link sensory input with the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "We hear most about the simple associative learning of Pavlov's dogs, but Pavlov went from the study of simple association to the investigation of learned sequences, or Dynamic Stereotypes. To understand a thing, its properties, besides being singly 'linked' with the organism by the sensory analyzers, must be linked together with each other, until they can be grasped simultaneously. This simultaneity is called 'objectness.'"
**CONTEXT:** This points out that Pavlov's work extended beyond simple association to "dynamic stereotypes," where linked properties create a simultaneous understanding of an object, termed "objectness."

**RAY PEAT:** "A goal of the organism is held in mind as such a simultaneity, and is the organism's criterion for completion or correctness of action. Anokhin pointed out that the 'stimulus-response' 'reflex arc' was incomplete without such a model of the appropriate reaction, and he called this model 'the acceptor of action.' These mental images, acceptors of action, are both models of intention, and models of what is known; novelty exists whenever the acceptor of action lacks any feature of the perceived environment. Intentional actions mobilize the organism's energy and focus it toward completion."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces Anokhin's concept of the "acceptor of action," a mental model of the intended outcome that guides and refines behavior, highlighting its role in intentional action and novelty detection.

**RAY PEAT:** "In exploration, it is novelty which excites the brain and mobilizes the organism for further investigation. The exercise of the exploratory reflex seems to make more energy available.

If knowledge is derived deductively, rather than from practical experience, it is likely to be empty and mistaken, rather than a true refinement of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This delves into the Marxist philosophical underpinnings of the Soviet approach, emphasizing the objective existence of generality and its role in perception and knowledge acquisition, contrasting it with deductive or purely formalistic approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "The image of space, and spatial relationships, must be subject to the mental 'sequencer,' if the organism is to move through space with awareness. The mental construction of an object, a 'meaningful configuration,' described above, applies to the organism's understanding of all aspects of reality. A process that begins as a sequential scanning is able to achieve a stable simultaneity, an 'objectness,' a spatial quality. The stored features are related in a certain way so that they can be checked against the real object, and this image thus achieves a spatial quality so it can be used in later, or 'higher order,' sequencings."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how the mental "sequencer" processes spatial information, creating stable "objectness" and enabling meaningful interaction with the environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian and Soviet view, that generality is an intrinsic part of perception, provides no basis for the belief (so common in western countries) that the progress of knowledge toward higher generality requires the fortuitous occurrence of 'geniuses.' Creativity is treated as an essential human trait, part of the human need for self-realization through productive work. Social support, including education, is considered to be the factor which causes great differences in creativity and intelligence, and not genetics. A genetic theory of intelligence is considered to be a mere rationalization for racist practices. Visual imagery is considered to be the basis of creative intelligence, and as such is studied with the intention of finding principles that can be used in education. Emotions (e.g., as measured by the galvanic skin response) are also considered to be an important component of inventive behavior, and are viewed as part of the image-forming process."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet view that creativity and intelligence are fostered by social support and education, not genetics, and that visual imagery and emotions play a crucial role in inventive behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers is one part of the idea of specific, energized attention; the sensory analyzer includes the sense organ, such as the eye or the vestibular apparatus, and related parts of the brain. It is emphasized that sensing is an active, intelligent process, in which features of the world are analyzed, selected, and linked with the organism."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers as active, intelligent processes that link sensory input with the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "We hear most about the simple associative learning of Pavlov's dogs, but Pavlov went from the study of simple association to the investigation of learned sequences, or Dynamic Stereotypes. To understand a thing, its properties, besides being singly 'linked' with the organism by the sensory analyzers, must be linked together with each other, until they can be grasped simultaneously. This simultaneity is called 'objectness.'"
**CONTEXT:** This points out that Pavlov's work extended beyond simple association to "dynamic stereotypes," where linked properties create a simultaneous understanding of an object, termed "objectness."

**RAY PEAT:** "A goal of the organism is held in mind as such a simultaneity, and is the organism's criterion for completion or correctness of action. Anokhin pointed out that the 'stimulus-response' 'reflex arc' was incomplete without such a model of the appropriate reaction, and he called this model 'the acceptor of action.' These mental images, acceptors of action, are both models of intention, and models of what is known; novelty exists whenever the acceptor of action lacks any feature of the perceived environment. Intentional actions mobilize the organism's energy and focus it toward completion."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces Anokhin's concept of the "acceptor of action," a mental model of the intended outcome that guides and refines behavior, highlighting its role in intentional action and novelty detection.

**RAY PEAT:** "In exploration, it is novelty which excites the brain and mobilizes the organism for further investigation. The exercise of the exploratory reflex seems to make more energy available. As long as the world remains a source of new knowledge, the brain will react to novelty with a continued increase of exploratory energy."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how novelty stimulates the brain and mobilizes the organism through the exploratory reflex, leading to increased energy and further investigation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov opposed the 'biologizers' who wished to ignore the importance of human history and culture in the development of our capacities--people who attempt to draw political conclusions from what they claim are human instincts of aggression, territoriality, etc. Pavlov called the first levels of constructions, closely tied to the sensory analyzers, the 'first signal system.' Language and the complex systems of meaning that make up culture (which are possible because of the unique development of our frontal lobes), Pavlov referred to as the 'second signal system.' Science requires that we account for consciousness in biological terms as far as is possible, but consciousness also includes historical and cultural influences, and our biological conceptions must be adequate to account for the existence of all those things which are simply historical--so many of which are arbitrary, and therefore temporary, and to be grown out of."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's distinction between the "first signal system" (sensory perception) and the "second signal system" (language and culture), emphasizing the importance of historical and cultural influences on consciousness and the need for biological conceptions to account for them.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian position is committed to the objective existence of generality: For the 'Dialectic' to operate in matter, without an overseeing God, the meaningful units (such as thesis and antithesis, and the social classes, etc.) must exist intrinsically in matter, which is just to say that generality has objective existence. The Marxian theory of perception appropriately incorporates the generalization function at a very early level of brain function, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. To the extent that the regulatory mental image doesn't constantly arouse the full orienting reflex because of slight disparities between intention and achievement or observation, it is generalized. A general class of achievement, or object or situation, will satisfy; further refinement may be undertaken, but only for a particular reason. The organism otherwise would become immersed in constant refinement of behavior. Since the orienting reflex becomes stronger at higher evolutionary levels, we can think of evolution as being away from facile generalization, and toward a more detailed understanding of matter. At these more refined levels, mistakes are more possible if sensory contact isn't maintained. This point relates to the Marxian belief that valid knowledge derives from practice and workability (Engels), and also to the Marxian idea that cultural forms and beliefs represent a superstructure, rationalizing power relationships or modes of production.

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet view that creativity and intelligence are fostered by social support and education, not genetics, and that visual imagery and emotions play a crucial role in inventive behavior.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers is one part of the idea of specific, energized attention; the sensory analyzer includes the sense organ, such as the eye or the vestibular apparatus, and related parts of the brain. It is emphasized that sensing is an active, intelligent process, in which features of the world are analyzed, selected, and linked with the organism."
**CONTEXT:** This explains Pavlov's concept of sensory analyzers as active, intelligent processes that link sensory input with the organism.

**RAY PEAT:** "We hear most about the simple associative learning of Pavlov's dogs, but Pavlov went from the study of simple association to the investigation of learned sequences, or Dynamic Stereotypes. To understand a thing, its properties, besides being singly 'linked' with the organism by the sensory analyzers, must be linked together with each other, until they can be grasped simultaneously. This simultaneity is called 'objectness.'"
**CONTEXT:** This points out that Pavlov's work extended beyond simple association to "dynamic stereotypes," where linked properties create a simultaneous understanding of an object, termed "objectness."

**RAY PEAT:** "A goal of the organism is held in mind as such a simultaneity, and is the organism's criterion for completion or correctness of action. Anokhin pointed out that the 'stimulus-response' 'reflex arc' was incomplete without such a model of the appropriate reaction, and he called this model 'the acceptor of action.' These mental images, acceptors of action, are both models of intention, and models of what is known; novelty exists whenever the acceptor of action lacks any feature of the perceived environment. Intentional actions mobilize the organism's energy and focus it toward completion."
**CONTEXT:** This introduces Anokhin's concept of the "acceptor of action," a mental model of the intended outcome that guides and refines behavior, highlighting its role in intentional action and novelty detection.

**RAY PEAT:** "In exploration, it is novelty which excites the brain and mobilizes the organism for further investigation. The exercise of the exploratory reflex seems to make more energy available. As long as the world remains a source of new knowledge, the brain will react to novelty with a continued increase of exploratory energy."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how novelty stimulates the brain and mobilizes the organism through the exploratory reflex, leading to increased energy and further investigation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Pavlov opposed the 'biologizers' who wished to ignore the importance of human history and culture in the development of our capacities--people who attempt to draw political conclusions from what they claim are human instincts of aggression, territoriality, etc. Pavlov called the first levels of constructions, closely tied to the sensory analyzers, the 'first signal system.' Language and the complex systems of meaning that make up culture (which are possible because of the unique development of our frontal lobes), Pavlov referred to as the 'second signal system.' Science requires that we account for consciousness in biological terms as far as is possible, but consciousness also includes historical and cultural influences, and our biological conceptions must be adequate to account for the existence of all those things which are simply historical--so many of which are arbitrary, and therefore temporary, and to be grown out of."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights Pavlov's distinction between the "first signal system" (sensory perception) and the "second signal system" (language and culture), emphasizing the importance of historical and cultural influences on consciousness and the need for biological conceptions to account for them.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian position is committed to the objective existence of generality: For the 'Dialectic' to operate in matter, without an overseeing God, the meaningful units (such as thesis and antithesis, and the social classes, etc.) must exist intrinsically in matter, which is just to say that generality has objective existence. The Marxian theory of perception appropriately incorporates the generalization function at a very early level of brain function, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. To the extent that the regulatory mental image doesn't constantly arouse the full orienting reflex because of slight disparities between intention and achievement or observation, it is generalized. A general class of achievement, or object or situation, will satisfy; further refinement may be undertaken, but only for a particular reason. The organism otherwise would become immersed in constant refinement of behavior. Since the orienting reflex becomes stronger at higher evolutionary levels, we can think of evolution as being away from facile generalization, and toward a more detailed understanding of matter. At these more refined levels, mistakes are more possible if sensory contact isn't maintained. This point relates to the Marxian belief that valid knowledge derives from practice and workability (Engels), and also to the Marxian idea that cultural forms and beliefs represent a superstructure, rationalizing power relationships or modes of production. If knowledge is derived deductively, rather than from practical experience, it is likely to be empty and mistaken, rather than a true refinement of knowledge."
**CONTEXT:** This delves into the Marxist philosophical underpinnings of the Soviet approach, emphasizing the objective existence of generality and its role in perception and knowledge acquisition, contrasting it with deductive or purely formalistic approaches.

**RAY PEAT:** "The image of space, and spatial relationships, must be subject to the mental 'sequencer,' if the organism is to move through space with awareness. The mental construction of an object, a 'meaningful configuration,' described above, applies to the organism's understanding of all aspects of reality. A process that begins as a sequential scanning is able to achieve a stable simultaneity, an 'objectness,' a spatial quality. The stored features are related in a certain way so that they can be checked against the real object, and this image thus achieves a spatial quality so it can be used in later, or 'higher order,' sequencings."
**CONTEXT:** This explains how the mental "sequencer" processes spatial information, creating stable "objectness" and enabling meaningful interaction with the environment.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Marxian and Soviet view, that generality is an intrinsic part of perception, provides no basis for the belief (so common in western countries) that the progress of knowledge toward higher generality requires the fortuitous occurrence of 'geniuses.' Creativity is treated as an essential human trait, part of the human need for self-realization through productive work. Social support, including education, is considered to be the factor which causes great differences in creativity and intelligence, and not genetics. A genetic theory of intelligence is considered to be a mere rationalization for racist practices. Visual imagery is considered to be the basis of creative intelligence, and as such is studied with the intention of finding principles that can be used in education. Emotions (e.g., as measured by the galvanic skin response) are also considered to be an important component of inventive behavior, and are viewed as part of the image-forming process."
**CONTEXT:** This highlights the Soviet view that creativity and intelligence are fostered by social support and education, not genetics, and that visual imagery and emotions play a crucial role in inventive behavior.
