**RAY PEAT:** The idea that syphilis is a cause of AIDS, or at least a major contributing factor, is supported by several observations. Jean McKenna's work suggests that the AIDS-associated virus, HIV, might be a byproduct of the disease rather than its cause, and that it likely only infects those who are already immunosuppressed. McKenna found that many HIV-positive individuals, particularly those with ARC and AIDS, had a history of syphilis but tested negative on FTA (fluorescent treponemal antibody) tests, suggesting a possible masking or alteration of the spirochete.

The German physicians K. Dierig and U. Waldthaler treated patients with symptoms consistent with AIDS with high doses of penicillin, similar to syphilis treatment. These patients became clinically asymptomatic, and later tested positive for HIV. This suggests that a robust treatment for syphilis, which may differ from standard US protocols, could be effective. The standard US treatment of a single penicillin injection may not penetrate the brain, and some countries treat syphilis for a year.

Salvatore Catapano's work with typhoid vaccine to stimulate immunity before treating AIDS patients with penicillin also points to the importance of immune stimulation and the potential role of syphilis. He believes that "syphilis" infections can occur without a visible spirochete, possibly due to a virus-like variant. This idea has historical precedent, with suggestions that syphilis infections could be caused by something other than a spirochete.

The association between syphilis and opportunistic infections seen in AIDS patients is well-documented. Syphilis, especially in its latent and tertiary stages, can suppress the immune system.

The discussion of amantadine's antiviral action is relevant. Amantadine, a derivative of adamantane, shares structural similarities with camphor. Camphor has a history of use as a germ-killer and was effective during the 1918 influenza epidemic. Its similarity to camphor likely informed its use against influenza. Camphoric acid, an oxidized form of camphor, was tested against syphilis and found to be effective, alongside penicillin and salvarsan. Camphoric acid was also used to carry bismuth, another effective syphilis treatment.

My own interest in camphoric acid stems from its potential to transport copper into the brain and be absorbed via the lymphatic system, bypassing the liver and allowing for higher doses without liver damage. I observed a beneficial effect on my tongue's coating, suggesting an interaction with oral microorganisms.

Spirochetal diseases like "trench mouth" (Treponema Vincenti) and Weil's disease have been associated with immune deficiencies and specific symptoms. Pinta, another spirochetal disease, involves skin depigmentation. Early observations linked abnormalities in pigmentation, teeth, hair, and blood vessels, previously attributed to syphilis, to copper deficiency.

The observation that women, particularly during pregnancy, are resistant to syphilis is significant. Pregnancy appears to suppress syphilitic lesions, and this protection can last for years, possibly a lifetime. This suggests a substance produced during pregnancy, absent in males and non-pregnant women, is antagonistic to spirochetes. This substance might originate from the corpus luteum, other endocrine organs, the placenta, or the fetus.

Camphor, progesterone, nutritional supplements, and artificial fever have fewer side effects than penicillin and warrant wider testing. GABA analogs are also non-toxic and inexpensive, but their low cost can be a disadvantage in the pharmaceutical industry.

The balance of iron and copper is closely linked to immunity. An elevated iron/copper ratio, as seen in hemosiderosis, might correlate with disease virulence. Kaposi's sarcoma tumors are often pigmented with hemosiderin. The suppressive effect of iron on the immune system is often overlooked due to the societal belief that iron is beneficial.

Endogenous peptides, such as endorphins, play a role in immunity. However, opiates, like morphine and codeine, are potent immune suppressors and should be avoided in cases of immune deficiency.

The effectiveness of ozone therapy in hyperoxygenating blood and destroying viruses on contact is a significant finding. Ozone inactivates lipid-envelope viruses by oxidizing their outer shell, without harming blood cells. This process is fundamentally different from drug-based treatments that burden the liver and immune system. Ozone also increases blood oxygenation, which is beneficial given common issues with poor air quality and sluggish breathing. The treated blood, when returned to the patient, confers virucidal properties to the rest of the blood. Maintaining an oxygen-positive state through proper breathing, exercise, and diet is suggested to prevent disease recurrence.

The suppression of research into ozone therapy by the US media and medical establishment, while millions are spent on drug development like AZT, highlights a potential conflict of interest. AZT, which does not cure but only buys time, is significantly more expensive than ozone therapy. The FDA's approval of Medizone Co.'s ozone blood treatment tests and their patent for inactivating lipid-envelope viruses in blood indicate a recognition of its potential.

The association between anesthesia and the elimination of viral infections is also noteworthy. Natural anesthetic systems like GABA, endorphins, and steroids (especially progesterone) may be interconnected and possess antiviral properties. GABA analogs, in particular, have demonstrated antiviral action.

The role of copper in protecting against iron toxicity is important. Serum copper levels rise during pregnancy, partly due to progesterone, and copper offers protection against iron toxicity.

The potential for copper to be used in treating viral infections, particularly lipid-coated viruses, is suggested by early research. The similarity between adamantane and camphor, and camphor's historical use as an antiseptic and antiviral agent, points to a potential pathway for developing effective treatments.

The concept of "artificial fever" as a therapeutic modality, alongside camphor, progesterone, and nutritional supplements, is also mentioned as having fewer side effects than penicillin and deserving wider investigation.

The importance of the iron/copper ratio in immunity and its potential relevance to diseases like AIDS, especially in populations with higher iron absorption, is a critical area for further study. The suppressive effect of iron on the immune system is a well-established but often ignored fact.

The mention of endorphins in the context of infection resistance is important, but it's crucial to distinguish between different types of endorphins and their effects on the immune system. Opiates, which are powerful immune suppressors, should be avoided in immunocompromised individuals.
