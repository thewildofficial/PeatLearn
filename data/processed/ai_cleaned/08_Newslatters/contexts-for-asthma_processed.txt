**RAY PEAT:** Asthma in children involves many of the biological processes that cause disability and degeneration in the process of aging, and since the incidence of asthma in children is increasing, it has serious implications for the whole population. Increased exposure to estrogen (including prenatal exposure), increased consumption of unsaturated vegetable oils, use of food or drug additives including guar gum, carob, carrageenan, and sulfites, and the use of adrenergic (“beta-agonist”) inhalant drugs have coincided with the increased death rates from asthma. Estrogen and unsaturated fats are clearly involved in producing the symptoms of asthma. Living at high altitude decreases asthma prevalence and mortality. Exercise increases the incidence of asthma. These facts provide insight into the biochemical events of asthma. The inflammatory-excitatory processes of asthma are parallel to those of depression, diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, arthritis, migraine, MS, SLE, multiple organ failure, aging, and death. Protecting cellular energy and stability can prevent or alleviate asthma. Thyroid, progesterone, and carbon dioxide are therapeutically useful, but reducing exposure to polyunsaturated oils and estrogens should be the basic approach. Medical theories of asthma give a better insight into the nature of medicine than into the nature of the asthmatic condition. Evasion and misdirection were woven into the culture of pharmacology by the competition to sell products. The objective result has been something approaching genocide. The U.S. government has served as the agent of the drug industry, by outlawing generic remedies whenever a corporation sought to fill that niche with its newly patented substance. This practice is so fundamental that, when inquiry is made about getting FDA approval for a substance, the response is that you must first have a patent on the substance. On its face, this indicates that the agency is in a conspiracy against the public health, to permit only proprietary remedies to be used legally. “Medical empiricism” traditionally referred to the use of remedies that worked, without trying to build a speculative or theoretical explanation for the way they worked or for the physiological nature of disease. “Scientific medicine” decided to call that approach quackery, and to build a theory of disease that would explain how remedies worked. As it worked out, this meant that certain kinds of remedy were “validated” by certain types of theory. Commercial and cultural interests therefore fostered and promoted the theories that they found most profitable. Impressively “scientific” words were invoked to justify procedures that otherwise would have been considered barbaric. As microscopic technique developed, “humoral” theories of disease were replaced by cellular theories, and the cellular theories came to encompass the “genetic” theories of disease. The specific, concrete nature of the “gene” concept became part of the “allopathic” tradition of medicine, in which a specific drug was appropriate for, “indicated” for, a specific symptom or disease. The holistic ideas associated with the homeopathic tradition disappeared from organized medicine in the United States. A fragmented and compartmentalized “health science” has been the result. In the 17th century the term diathesis (constitutional predisposition) was coined to “explain” disease, and the term was replaced in the 20th century by the phrase “genetic cause.” Medical writers (and medical editors) are similar to politicians and college sophomores in their habitual use of the classical logical fallacies. When students use defective reasoning, the presumption is that they are confused, but when politicians and physicians argue fallaciously, the interpretation must include other possibilities. If a certain theoretical explanation has become unnecessary and impossible, then a growing advocacy of that theory strongly implicates ulterior motives, and suggests corrupt influences. Although there were individuals who believed that asthma was a “psychosomatic” disease or the result of an infection, the official medical position has been that it is a diathesis, a congenital disposition, a “genetic disease” (e.g., Castro, et al., 2001; Ishikawa and Tsujimoto, 2001). A genetic theory of disease is ideal for the drug business, since incurability guarantees continuing sales. Fads in asthma theory coincide with the availability of products. The defective genes have at various times been thought to produce excessive activity in the parasympathetic nervous system, or incontinent mast cells that leak histamine, or enzyme defects that produce too much Slow-Reactive-Substance or leukotriene, or weak adrenal glands, or genetic imbalances that affect the immune system in relatively simple or in more complex ways. Sudden increases in asthma mortality in the 1960s and 1970s in various countries corresponded to increased use of certain synthetic adrenergic drugs (instead of adrenaline), called bronchodilators, as inhalants. The concept that they were “beta-agonists” was used to rationalize their use, even after animal experiments showed that they caused serious heart damage, and other harmful effects. When the medical model of asthma shifted its emphasis from “smooth muscle spasm” to “inflammation,” a shift that in the U.S. dates from a series of publications in the 1980s (Ackerman, 1989), there was the usual sense of accomplishment, as authors and medical professors spread the word about the latest inhaled steroid products, replacing the “synthetic adrenaline” inhalants that had been increasingly used during the years that asthma mortality had been rising so rapidly. That this change of medication was thirty years tardy wasn’t mentioned. (G. Rona’s group began publishing warnings in the early 1960s about the heart and vascular damage caused by adrenergic drugs such as isoproteronol.) Even as new medications came into use, there wasn’t much change in medical knowledge about asthma. And even though there is evidence that oral glucocorticoids drastically reduce death from acute asthma (Abramson, et al, 2001), and that inhaled glucocorticoids have serious systemic side effects, the drug industry created another set of mystifications, claiming that inhaling certain synthetic steroids would act selectively upon the bronchial tubes and lungs. As far as I can tell, the only significant event that caused the change of emphasis in the medical model of asthma from “bronchial contraction” to “bronchial inflammation” was the promotion of steroids to replace the “bronchodilators.” The description of the disease seems to change according to the drug that’s being marketed. Decades ago, the public accepted the medical doctrine that asthma, and allergies in general, were caused by genetic defects. With the tremendous increase in the death rate from asthma in recent decades (coinciding with similar increases in other supposedly “genetic” diseases), many people are de-emphasizing that theory, because an impossibly high rate of mutation would have been needed to create those “new genetic defects.” However, few people are looking for a radically new theory of asthma. Asthma would be a good place to make a fresh start in understanding chronic disease, and the first step has to be to abandon the unfounded and corrupt theory of genetic causation, and to begin the construction of a functional, environmental theory of its cause. If asthma can be understood functionally, there is a good chance that it can be prevented or cured. Elite athletes are generally considered to have “good genes,” and exercise is commonly said to promote good health, so a new orientation is needed to accommodate the fact that “elite” athletes, winter or summer athletes, including participants in the Olympics, have a high incidence of asthma--roughly three times higher than the general population. It turns out that exercise induces the signs and symptoms of asthma, not only in “asthmatics,” but in normal people too. Anaerobic exercise (getting out of breath) increases the release of, or activity of, a large variety of inflammatory mediators, beginning with lactic acid and interleukin-6 released from the exercised muscle itself, and including factors released from various cells in the blood, and hormones including estrogen, prolactin and sometimes TSH. Figures from Mexico show that, in the states with high altitude, the prevalence of asthma is about ten times lower than the states that are close to sea level. Mountain therapy has been used for a long time to treat asthma and other chronic diseases, especially in Russia. In the United States, many publications have confirmed that high altitude alleviates asthma, but it is called “antigen avoidance therapy,” despite evidence that shows improvement at high altitude even in the presence of the usual antigens, such as skin mites. All of the main mediators of inflammation decrease with increasing altitude. The incidence of asthma in girls surpasses that in boys around puberty, and it is common for asthma to be worse premenstrually. The use of oral contraceptives often makes asthma worse. During pregnancy, asthma sometimes gets worse, sometimes better. At menopause, asthma is likely to get worse, and to appear in women who didn’t previously suffer from asthma. The use of estrogen at menopause increases the incidence of asthma. Progesterone, and related hormones, alleviate asthma, and this probably accounts for the variable effects of pregnancy on asthma, since pregnancy can improve the ratio of progesterone to estrogen, but often, with poor nutrition, estrogen dominance is exacerbated by pregnancy. Estrogen exposure early in life can cause asthma later. The common use of DES during pregnancy in the 1950s was one of the factors that caused the increase of asthma in children in the 1960s. Estrogen increases most of the mediators of inflammation, which are generally inhibited by progesterone. Estrogen also shifts many processes toward excitation, and it’s often hard to distinguish the mediators of inflammation from the mediators of excitation. Free polyunsaturated fatty acids, for example, which are increased under the influence of estrogen (or exercise, diabetes, nighttime, aging, histamine, parasympathetic dominance, etc.), produce both inflammation and excitation. Associated with the processes of inflammation and excitation is the tendency of estrogen and other inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide and serotonin, to impair mitochondrial respiration. This effect on the cells’ energy production is probably responsible for many of the things that occur in asthma, such as edema and smooth muscle contraction. Acute or chronic interference with mitochondrial respiration can produce a tremendous variety of symptoms, depending on the location, and the degree of the energy deprivation. Exercise, probably acting through some of the same mediators, also impairs mitochondrial respiration. These factors that impair respiration tend to shift mitochondrial metabolism away from the oxidation of glucose and the production of carbon dioxide, to the oxidation of fats and the production of lactic acid. The clear distinction between inflammation and excitation (and excitotoxicity) is largely an artifact of the drug industry’s influence on medical theory. The “spasmolytic” drugs that are intended to prevent contraction of the bronchioles can cause histamine release as well as increasing cortisol production, and they increase the level of free fatty acids as well as raising the blood sugar. Simply shifting the cells’ energy production away from the oxidation of glucose can produce excitability, inflammation, increased leakiness of blood vessels, changes in mucus, discharge of histamine and serotonin, hormonal changes, etc. The doctrine of “preventing excessive weight gain” in pregnancy that dominated obstetrics-gynecology in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s probably contributed to the increased prevalence of asthma in the ‘sixties and ‘seventies, because protein deficiency creates an inflammatory state, and a state of estrogen dominance. (Measurement of inflammatory proteins in the blood has been proposed as a way to confirm protein deficiency.) One of the major “acute phase proteins,” C-reactive protein, is defensive against bacteria and parasites, but it is suspected to contribute to tissue degeneration. When its presence is the result of exercise, estrogen, or malnutrition, then its association with asthma is likely to be causal, rather than coincidental. Some of the “acute phase proteins” in the blood, that are associated with inflammation, rise progressively with aging, and are induced by estrogen. One of these stress-related proteins, serum amyloid P-component, is called the “female protein” in hamsters. This type of protein is implicated in atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart attacks, and kidney disease. The respiratory system is so intimately related to the circulatory system and other systems that the traditional classification of diseases can be misleading. Ordinarily, asthma is distinguished from bronchitis, emphysema, “Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome” or “shock lung,” pulmonary edema, surfactant deficiency, etc., as if each problem were clearly distinguishable by its intrinsic properties. Actually, there is considerable overlap, and the diagnostic distinction can depend on the patient’s history and situation, rather than on the actual pathology. Even “High Altitude Pulmonary Edema” has important similarities to “bronchial asthma.” Even though breathing might be the immediate focus of attention, there is no health problem which isn’t systemic. The old medical use of cathartics for asthma, epilepsy, headaches, arthritis, cancer, etc., was often based on good observation. Before medicine became “scientific,” many cases of asthma and epilepsy were successfully treated with vermifuges, but now the role of parasites in these conditions is rarely considered. The specific location of symptoms--bronchial asthma, migraine, hemorrhoids, sneezing, etc.--brought on by an allergen, such as worms or certain foods or constipation or intestinal gas, is influenced by nervous reflexes. Reflexes are exaggerated by stresses such as hypoglycemia or alkalosis. Experimenters, for example, found that inflating a balloon in the intestine of an anesthesized animal wouldn’t produce any observable reactions when the blood sugar was normal, but when the blood sugar was lowered, bronchospasms or other localized reflexive reactions would be produced. The allergic reaction produced by any substance is intensified by hypoglycemia, and weakened by elevated blood sugar. Decreasing or increasing sodium has a similar, but weaker, effect. (G. Jasmin, 1968) Knowing something about the situation that preceded a breathing difficulty can be useful, especially as a guide to eliminating environmental problems, but the fact that so many conditions involve the same physiological/pathological components means that a few therapies can be rationally used for many “different diseases.” For example, caffeine, thyroid, carbon dioxide, progesterone, and several other anti-serotonin drugs (e.g., tianeptine and ketanserin) can be therapeutic for asthma, even when the specific causes aren’t known. Buteyko’s recognition of the importance of carbon dioxide (and the avoidance of hyperventilation) in the prevention of asthma is validated by the fact that high altitude normally alleviates asthma, that carbon dioxide inhalation at high altitude relieves altitude sickness (indicating that altitude sickness, like asthma, is the result of relative hyperventilation), and that acetazolamide, which increases carbon dioxide retention and is used to prevent or treat high altitude sickness, also alleviates asthma. Practically everything which is stressful will shift metabolism away from the adequate production of carbon dioxide. The use of oxygen supplementation to treat asthma or other respiratory difficulty without also supplementing carbon dioxide is unphysiological and dangerous. In the 19th century in the U.S., cocaine was officially recognized as a therapy for asthma, and in South America coca is the traditional remedy for altitude sickness, but there has been very little scientific investigation of the therapeutic use of cocaine. It increases progesterone production and probably has antihistamine action. Atropine, which is very similar in chemical structure to cocaine, was a standard drug for asthma until the synthetic antihistamines and bronchodilators displaced it. Although it’s known mainly as an “anticholinergic,” atropine can protect against the excessive liberation of free fatty acids that interferes with the use of glucose. Camphor, amantadine, procaine and other soothing anticholinergics or antihistamines had a similar fate, as far as asthma therapy is concerned. The antihistamine Benadryl is usually helpful in asthma and other inflammatory or spasmodic conditions. Eucalyptus oil, containing cineole or eucalyptol, is a traditional remedy for asthma, that inhibits the products of unsaturated fatty acid metabolism and the cytokines most associated with asthma symptoms. The uncontrolled release of many inflammatory and excitatory substances can be prevented by good nutrition, emphasizing adequate protein and magnesium intake, and the use of sugars and saturated fats, rather than starches and unsaturated fats. Vitamin E protects against the inflammatory actions of the unsaturated fats. The short-chain saturated fatty acids of coconut oil have been reported to have antihistamine actions. The selection of proteins should minimize the amino acids tryptophan (which is the precursor of serotonin) and cysteine (which, like tryptophan, suppresses thyroid function), by including gelatin and fruits. Gelatin is 22% glycine, which protects the lungs and other organs against toxins and inflammatory agents, and many fruits are also “deficient” in tryptophan and cysteine. The overlapping effects of estrogen, polyunsaturated fats, exercise, serotonin, histamine, lactic acid, nighttime, and hyperventilation, tend to be cumulative and self-stimulating. Degenerative changes in tissues are accelerated by all of these stress mediators. When these factors aren’t corrected, the standard officially recognized treatments for asthma--despite the acute relief they can provide--will probably increase long-range morbidity and mortality. For short-term relief, combinations of safer materials can probably be found that will give the same immediate results, while helping to correct the underlying problems.
