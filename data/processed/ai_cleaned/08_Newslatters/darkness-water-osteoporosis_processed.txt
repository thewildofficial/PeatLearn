**RAY PEAT:** Around 1973, there was an interesting observation, in which eyes that had been burned by ultraviolet rays were treated with red or infrared light, and the pain was relieved. Since I had been interested in solvated electrons, I wondered if this medical observation might involve a mechanism similar to the “bleaching” of trapped electrons in crystals or glass which has been colored by exposure to x rays or gamma rays. Szent-Gyorgyi used to demonstrate that structured materials, e.g., ice, can stabilize excited states of electrons. He was curious about the existence of pigments inside organisms, and suggested that they related to metabolic electrons, since he assumed that external light didn’t reach these tissues.

**CONTEXT:** What was your initial thought process regarding the effect of light on biological tissues, particularly in relation to electron behavior?

**RAY PEAT:** In December, I drove in sunny weather all the way to Houston, and thought about light. Having read that the leaves of deciduous trees go into a negative protein balance (work by K. Thimann, U.C, Santa Cruz), as they age in the short days of autumn, I realized that the mechanisms of aging that I have discussed in other newsletters could be general for all living things. Knowing that plants have "photo-respiration,” that is, the respiratory production of usable energy during stimulation by light, I wondered if animals might have something similar, accounting for winter sickness, dark-stress, and aging itself.

**CONTEXT:** How did your observations of plant physiology lead you to consider similar mechanisms in animals, particularly concerning aging and seasonal changes?

**RAY PEAT:** Knowing that photosynthesis uses orange-red light (though other plant processes are stimulated by other colors), I wondered if that frequency also stimulated photo-respiration. Anyone who has held their hand over a bright light knows that red light does penetrate tissue. Pineal researchers planted a photoelectric cell in a sheep's brain, near the pineal gland, to see whether significant amounts of light reached that organ directly, and the device clearly indicated when the animal moved from shade to sunlight. So, when I got home I was thinking about how to design an experiment to test the direct effect of red light on tissue respiration, especially in the brain.

**CONTEXT:** What was the experimental approach you considered to test the direct effect of red light on tissue respiration?

**RAY PEAT:** I had been home for a couple of days, when a journal arrived in the mail, describing exactly the sort of experiment I needed to test the idea. Rats had a bright red laser beam shined on their heads for 15 minutes, and then the respiratory enzymes of the Krebs cycle was studied. The changes were consistent with enhanced respiration. (A. T. Pikulev, et al., Radiobiology 24(1):29-34, 1984.) (The red laser has been used for more than ten years to promote healing — references will be provided on request.)

**CONTEXT:** What specific research validated your hypothesis about red light's effect on respiration?

**RAY PEAT:** So my present thought is that darkness does in some way “poison” respiration, and that light enhances it, possibly by the indirect mechanism of disposing of electrons that have leaked out of the usable-energy pathway.

**CONTEXT:** What is your current understanding of the relationship between darkness, light, and cellular respiration?

**RAY PEAT:** When respiration is blocked, tissue takes up water. A simple illustration of this is the cornea — when contact lenses were very impermeable to oxygen, they caused severe corneal swelling. I think estrogen works by the same mechanism (and this explains why so many toxic substances are “estrogenic”). There was a doctrine that cells can move water only by moving sodium, so medical textbooks say that estrogen causes sodium retention; but it occurred to someone to actually measure the effects of estrogen on sodium and water, and they found that estrogen causes the fluids to become hypotonic, with a lower than normal sodium concentration.

**CONTEXT:** How does blocked respiration relate to water uptake in tissues, and what is the proposed mechanism involving estrogen?

**RAY PEAT:** Estrogen (like darkness and stress) promotes prolactin secretion. A previous newsletter discussed the experiments in which sodium suppressed prolactin secretion, while taking water without sodium stimulated it. So it seems likely that hypotonic (or sodium deficient) tissue fluids might be a common factor in the various situations which increase prolactin secretion.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between estrogen, darkness, stress, and prolactin secretion, and how do sodium and water balance play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** In the salmon which swim up the Columbia river to spawn, the fresh water, which is very sodium deficient compared to the ocean, does stimulate the secretion of prolactin, and the prolactin is involved in their adaptation to the fresh water. The adaptation is very costly, though, because these fish undergo very rapid aging. Their bones are transformed in ways very similar to the bones of other animals in extreme old age; for example, the back humps and the jaw juts forward. (Since the fish vertebrae don’t bear weight as those of a biped do, we shouldn't attribute the bending of the human spine in old age to compression.)

**CONTEXT:** How does the adaptation of salmon to freshwater environments, driven by prolactin, illustrate accelerated aging and skeletal changes?

**RAY PEAT:** Some recent studies have investigated prolactin’s involvement in calcium disposition, and its contribution to osteoporosis (J. A. Schlechte, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 56:1120-1123, 1983; growth hormone is closely associated with prolactin, and I mentioned in Nutrition for Women that there was some basis for thinking that estrogen might make osteoporosis worse, acting through the growth hormone. The editor of the Yearbook of Endocrinology (1984, 273) says “Consider, if hyperprolactinemia leads to osteoporosis, and the administration of estrogens to postmenopausal women leads to hyperprolactinemia...")

**CONTEXT:** What is the established link between prolactin, growth hormone, estrogen, and osteoporosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Since it is established that excess prolactin does contribute to osteoporosis in humans, it seems reasonable to suppose that the dramatic increase in prolactin secretion when these animals enter fresh water would be the cause for the equally dramatic skeletal changes in the fish.

**CONTEXT:** How does the understanding of prolactin's role in human osteoporosis inform the interpretation of skeletal changes in salmon?

**RAY PEAT:** It is already known that excess calcium damages respiration and that calcium is associated with structural disruption of the mitochondria, and that tissues tend to calcify in aging. Inside cells, calcification begins in the mitochondria; outside cells, for example in blood vessel walls, the “ground substance” (a fine-textured component of connective tissue) can become calcified.

**CONTEXT:** What are the known detrimental effects of excess calcium on cellular respiration and tissue structure, particularly in aging?

**RAY PEAT:** I think rational therapy for osteoporosis would include thyroid, Vitamin A, bright light, and either pregnenolone or a mixture of progesterone and DHEA, with a diet rich in protein and all the salts: calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium.

**CONTEXT:** What are your recommended therapeutic interventions for osteoporosis?

**RAY PEAT:** Hypotonic fluids are disruptive to life processes and structures. Even tissues which are not very cellular, such as cornea, joint cartilage, and the various “basement membranes” (which are rich in ground substance) can be damaged.

**CONTEXT:** What are the consequences of hypotonic fluids on various tissues, including those with less cellularity?

**RAY PEAT:** I suspect that we — fish and humans — have a simple way to protect ourselves from “hypotonicity,” that is, from a deficiency of salts in our fluids. (There have been various observations in which one salt can substitute for another, at least to the extent of preventing an immediate disaster.) We carry with us a huge reservoir of minerals, our skeleton. In osmotic stress, it is better to lose bone material (and teeth) than to experience hypotonic disruption.

**CONTEXT:** How does the skeleton serve as a protective mechanism against hypotonicity?

**RAY PEAT:** Undoubtedly the liberated calcium participates in adaptation in ways besides preventing swelling of the connective tissues, but I plan to examine the metabolic effects of calcium in future newsletters. (The bones also provide a large reservoir of sodium.)

**CONTEXT:** What is the potential role of liberated calcium in adaptation beyond preventing tissue swelling?

**RAY PEAT:** Both prolactin and cortisone are secreted during stress (darkness), and both mobilize calcium. If calcium is so harmful to our energy producing system, why do the stress hormones dose us with it? I think this is largely explained by the generality of hypotonicity in stress and by the convenience of the skeleton as a mineral reservoir. Selye illuminated estrogen by comparing it with the initial shock phase of the stress reaction (before adaptation begins), but the value is probably in the inadequacy of energy to meet a challenge, and when energy is deficient, water is taken up (And some water is produced when oxygen is electronically reduced: this “respiration” is the other essential element involved in energy production — even “age pigment” can convert oxygen into water).

**CONTEXT:** Why do stress hormones like prolactin and cortisone, which mobilize calcium, also contribute to its harmful effects on energy production, and how does this relate to stress, hypotonicity, and energy deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** Selye found that various stresses caused connective tissue disease, such as scleroderma and arthritis. He didn't explain the mechanism. I think it is significant that women are much more susceptible to many connective tissue diseases than are men. For example, a recent Arthritis Foundation advertisement says that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from arthritis. Fibrositis, myositis, etc., are common in women. (I think the studies of adhesions being prevented by progesterone provide a good model for understanding connective tissue disease, and allergies or ‘auto-immune’ diseases; see Maurer and Bonaventura, Fertility and Sterility 39(4), p. 485, April 1983.) When cartilage is soaked in distilled water (or hypotonic body fluids) it swells with tremendous pressure. The microscopic mesh of this connective tissue is rich in negatively ionized groups, which attract neutralizing positive ions, such as potassium and sodium. As the neutralizing ions are leached away, the negative ions repel each other causing swelling and attracting more water. As positively charged calcium ions are made available from the bones, the swelling is blocked. Continued for a long time, this seems likely to lead to conditions such as arteriosclerosis and scleroderma.

**CONTEXT:** How do stress-induced connective tissue diseases like scleroderma and arthritis relate to hypotonicity, ion balance, and the role of calcium, particularly in women?

**RAY PEAT:** Structural disruption of the mitochondria, as well as uncoupling phosphorylation from respiration, can be caused by cortisone. So it is interesting to see seasonal changes in the structure of the mitochondria, which are consistent with the ideas I have been talking about, that winter (and light deficiency in general) is what ages and kills us.

**CONTEXT:** How does cortisone affect mitochondrial function, and what do seasonal changes in mitochondria suggest about the impact of winter and light deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** Winter stress, elevating cortisone, could also be the reason for the non-adaptive depression of thyroid function in the winter. Many people have noticed an association between stress and periodontal disease. Gum disease is common in hypothyroidism, and bone loss is an important part of the periodontal disease. This same endocrine pattern, and not “post-menopausal estrogen deficiency,” is the most likely explanation for osteoporosis in aging women.

**CONTEXT:** What is the proposed link between winter stress, elevated cortisone, suppressed thyroid function, and the development of periodontal disease and osteoporosis in aging women?

**RAY PEAT:** When I was working on my hamster thesis, about 1971, I noticed an article which reported that aging women’s urine revealed an increased ratio of estrogen to the 17-keto steroids. I think it was that article that started me thinking of aging generally in terms of a deficiency of anti-estrogens including things such as DHEA.

**CONTEXT:** What observation during your hamster thesis work led you to consider aging in terms of anti-estrogen deficiency, specifically involving DHEA?

**RAY PEAT:** DHEA has been studied in relation to osteoporosis. I. Hollo, et al. in Acta. Med. Acad. Sci. Hung. (Hungary) 35(1-53-59, 1975) reported that administration of norandrosterone decanoate or dehydroepiandrosterone to patients with menopausal osteoporosis resulted in normalization of the postload hypercalcemia. Calcium tolerance of menopausal patients without osteoporosis was not affected by dehydroepiandrosterone. S. Brody, et al., in Maturitas (Netherlands) 4(2) 113-122, 1982, found significant positive correlations “between basal levels of DHAS and the DHA response to ACTH respectively, and trabecular bone mineral content of the distal forearm.”

**CONTEXT:** What research findings support the role of DHEA in managing osteoporosis and improving calcium metabolism?

**RAY PEAT:** I think rational therapy for osteoporosis would include thyroid, vitamin A, bright light, and either pregnenolone or a mixture of progesterone and DHEA, with a diet rich in protein and all the salts: calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. A bias toward magnesium, rather than calcium, would protect against many conditions that occur in aging and stress.

**CONTEXT:** What is your comprehensive approach to osteoporosis therapy, including hormonal support, nutritional considerations, and mineral balance?
