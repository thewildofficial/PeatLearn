This is a general principle for the brain and other tissues: the high energy state is relaxed. Epilepsy is an example of a very low energy state of brain cells. Insomnia is a low energy state, and is usually cured by the right dose of thyroid hormone, with adequate glucose and other nutrients. Insomnia is extremely common in aging people, and is the main problem at menopause. Inflammation is another example of a low energy state. Specific patterns of symptoms can be produced by reflexes, and these reflexes can be stuck in place by an energy deficiency. Focussed activity and an alert readiness to respond are prevented by a low energy state, which can cause us to get stuck in inappropriate activity, ranging from worry to "auto-immune" conditions. The inhibited state of nerves has not been a popular field for research in our culture, but the knowledge gradually accumulates. Another type of inhibition has been described recently, in "Acetylcholine hyperpolarizes central neurones by acting on an M1 muscarinic receptor," by Egan and North, in Nature 319, 403-407, January 30, 1986.

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between energy levels and physiological states like relaxation, epilepsy, insomnia, and inflammation?

**RAY PEAT:** A red hot object radiates lower energy, longer waves than a very hot star does and a warm person radiates slightly longer, lower energy waves than does the red hot object. The peak of our radiant emission is long infra-red, and we are fairly transparent to that wave-length, so we are black body emitters, regardless of our skin color. It has been calculated that 70% of our metabolic energy is spent as radiation. If we are surrounded by large amounts of mass at our own temperature, we will absorb about as much as we lose. Several years ago, lab rats were kept at a constant temperature, with constant 12 hour light periods, were found to experience a decline in thyroid function during the winter. I had noticed a similar effect in hamsters, atrophy of the thymus gland in the late autumn. Since long-wave infra-red and longer wavelength microwaves can penetrate walls to some extent, it could be that the absence of that kind of radiation during the winter is the stressor which causes these changes, and the mitochondrial damage which occurs in the winter. It could be that some of the therapeutic effects of natural hot springs are caused by gently appropriate radiation from the large masses of hot earth in the vicinity. I think these longer waves might also have an anti-free radical effect, possibly by acting on solvated electrons.

**CONTEXT:** How does our body's radiation relate to metabolic energy, and what environmental factors might influence thyroid function and mitochondrial health?

**RAY PEAT:** A study in Israel, where there has been no publicity about a connection between caffeine and breast disease, found that using caffeine or avoiding it had no effect on breast disease. A letter in JAMA (Feb. 14, 1986, vol. 253(6), page 748) says "most reports show no significant correlation between fibro-cystic disease and methylxanthine intake." He says "there was considerable evidence to suggest that caffeine has antineoplastic effects." He also says that "caffeine intake had a significant association with tumor differentiation.... Since poor tumor differentiation is linked with decreased survival, the question is raised whether caffeine may have had a beneficial effect in these women." All of the experiments in cell culture similarly suggest that caffeine might be beneficial.

**CONTEXT:** What is the current scientific understanding regarding the link between caffeine consumption and breast disease, specifically fibro-cystic disease and tumor differentiation?

**RAY PEAT:** Several years ago a "mutation" was discovered in a regional primate center which was said to be equivalent to human cystic fibrosis. A researcher there couldn't believe that an identical mutation could have appeared at the same time in five or six apes; he believed that their symptoms resulted from poisoning from the large amounts of unsaturated vegetable oil they were being fed. He was fired immediately; the new "gene" would have brought in large amounts of research money. A recent study of young adults with cystic fibrosis found that they had low serum levels of both selenium and vitamin E. This seems to support the ex-scientist's theory. (Lancet 2:862-863, 1985.)

**CONTEXT:** What is a potential alternative explanation for the observed "mutation" linked to cystic fibrosis in primates, and what nutrient deficiencies have been noted in young adults with cystic fibrosis?

**RAY PEAT:** As sulfite is removed from foods, pressure will increase for wider use of radiation to extend shelf life of many foods. Proponents are saying that some public education will be necessary, because radiation causes instantaneous changes which modify flavor and texture of foods, making people think they are not fresh; people must be informed, they say, to realize that the spoiled taste and consistency actually means greater freshness, since their shelf life has been extended by many weeks. Radiation, of course, stimulates oxidation of fats, among other changes (called "unique radiolytic products," URP), and rancid fat is toxic and carcinogenic.

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of using food irradiation for shelf-life extension, and what are the potential health risks associated with this process?
