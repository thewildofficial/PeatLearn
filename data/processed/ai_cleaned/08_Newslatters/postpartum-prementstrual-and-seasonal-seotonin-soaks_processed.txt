**RAY PEAT:** "The stress of winter: Postpartum, premenstrual, and “Winter sickness” occurs when there isn’t enough seasonal serotonin soaks: Hints daylight to allow us to recover from nocturnal stress. The stress related hormones rise at night, and winter nights are long. The inadequate light produces thyroid and progesterone deficiencies. A progesterone or thyroid deficiency, or estrogen having the: that hac id : and polyunsaturated fat excess, causes serotonin to increase. Cold, dark, and even minor stresses cause increased serotonin. The amino acid tryptophan can be metabolized into serotonin, which can be converted into melatonin. More than twenty years ago, tryptophan was being promoted as a sedative, even though it was known to be the only amino acid that is carcinogenic. In excess, it suppresses the function of the thyroid gland. A protein deficiency releases tryptophan from muscles. A “serotonin deficiency” was often said to cause depression. Hydroxy tryptophan (5-HTP) is sold as a serotonin precursor that is supposed to improve mood. Many kinds of stress cause serotonin’s activity to increase. Melatonin has been sold as a sleeping pill, longevity pill, and anticancer agent. Its body is stimulated by stress and darkness. Light, especially red light, penetrates into the body, and suppresses free radical activity and activates the crucial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, which is activated by thyroid, and which is inactivated by polyunsaturated fats. Serotonin released from platelets causes blood clotting and vascular spasms, and stimulates cell division. It and histamine are mediators of inflammation. Serotonin triggers the release of the stress hormones, ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin. People often gain weight during the winter; in the far north, blood tryptophan is elevated in the winter; depressed women have increased melatonin, alcohol lowers melatonin; alcohol consumption is increased by darkness. The use of antiserotonin drugs in alleviating stroke, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, depression, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus (SLE), fibrosis, wheezing, and migraine suggests the importance of hyperserotonemia in causing disease."

**CONTEXT:** What are the primary issues related to winter stress and the role of serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** "When I read, in the early 1950s, about the cyclical peaks of mortality in the early morning hours and winter months, that had been evident in actuarial tables for a long time, it wasn’t hard to accept that light was good for us, and that darkness was harmful. “Chronobiology,” the awareness that biological responses are dependent on the time of day, was firmly established by the 1950s."

**CONTEXT:** What early observations led to the understanding of light's biological impact?

**RAY PEAT:** "Beginning in the 1950s, when I would spend the summers working in the woods, I noticed effects of sunlight that I didn’t understand, such as the worsening of acne in proportion to the amount of sun exposure, as well as during times of stress. In 1965, I noticed that even incandescent light exposure during the night could immediately provoke my acne, so I realized that ultraviolet irritation wasn’t the essential factor. First I thought the consumption of vitamin A might be responsible, since taking additional vitamin A would control my acne, but then I realized that an extended photoperiod stimulated the sex hormones, and that this increased demands for vitamin A."

**CONTEXT:** What personal observations contributed to the understanding of light's hormonal effects?

**RAY PEAT:** "When I moved to the northern US from Mexico in 1965, I began noticing other interesting hormonal and nutritional effects relating to the seasons. In the winter of 1966-67 I began referring to “winter sickness” as the consequence of the hormonal changes produced by a lack of light exposure. Women who moved from a sunny climate to cloudy Eugene, and who often lived in gloomy basement apartments while they were at the university, described premenstrual depression and other symptoms that they had never experienced before. Many serious diseases had their onset during these times of light deprivation and hormonal upset."

**CONTEXT:** How did seasonal changes and light deprivation affect women's health in Eugene?

**RAY PEAT:** "I submitted some of my observations on winter sickness to various journals, and didn’t get any responses from most of the editors, except for occasional sarcastic remarks about how ridiculous it is to suggest that light would have biological or psychological effects on humans. Since 1966 I had been including a discussion of light’s effects in my classes on nutrition and hormones and aging, and in the early seventies I began travelling around to talk to health-food, alternative medicine, and church groups, and to talk on occasional radio and television programs, where I would emphasize the importance of good light along with good nutrition. I found that the general public, and especially so-called “conservative” people, were remarkably receptive to ideas of interactions between organism and environment, and between mood and chemistry. I think their receptiveness had to do with the attitude called “paranoia,” an attitude that has its positive features, as Salvador Dali observed. Professional people, especially journal editors, on the other hand, seemed to suffer from a mental rigidity that was the polar opposite of paranoia, a belief that nothing was happening outside of the set of beliefs residing in their own minds. This is a psychiatric condition that can be called “editor-ness,” or simply “professionalism.”"

**CONTEXT:** What was the professional and public reception to early ideas about light therapy?

**RAY PEAT:** "Although no journal or magazine had responded favorably to my articles on winter sickness and light therapy, some of those editors later began publishing similar observations by themselves or others, and by 1985 “Seasonal Affective Disorder” was becoming something like a “movement,” with people arguing about the proper use of “light panels” and phase-shifting of melatonin, and even direct supplementation of melatonin. When its factors are reduced to a minimum, usually two, a new thought can sometimes penetrate into the professional mentality, though they are likely to get one or both of those factors wrong, as often as not. The use of bright light to treat depression should have made people realize that a melatonin excess contributed to depression, but that simple idea has been generally evaded. The reluctance to see any connection between mood and hormones, or between light and health, probably resulted from an education in which there was already an explanation for everything. Now that medicine accepts a role for light and hormones in mood and behavior, it is within a culture dominated by Estrogen Replacement Therapy and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, such as Prozac. When there is a product for everything, explanations are degraded, and professionalism reaches a new low. The use of Prozac and similar drugs to treat PMS is an example of how product-professionalism works. (Its action in PMS is probably the result of increasing a brain steroid, compensating for a progesterone deficiency, exactly contrary to the doctrine that it acts by increasing serotonin availability.)"

**CONTEXT:** How did the concept of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) evolve, and what is the critique of modern pharmaceutical approaches?

**RAY PEAT:** "People who believe that there is a “biological clock” in the brain think that light signals entering through the eye provide the cues that set the clock, and that the brain then organizes the behavior that’s appropriate for the season and time of day. But pigeons wearing opaque hoods can sense environmental light if the rest of their body is uncovered. The same sort of bodily sensitivity to light was demonstrated by shining light onto the back of a person’s knee. Instead of a “clock” that consists of some procedure for counting enzyme reactions or DNA oscillations or something of the sort, for which there is not even a clear theory, I think the evidence supports the idea that physiological states reflect the organism’s relation to the environment, and that, in the absence of the necessary amount of light and heat from the environment, energy stores in the form of glycogen become depleted, creating hunger and a variety of stress reactions. It takes some time to deplete glycogen stores, and it takes time to assimilate food, and so hunger and satiation tend to be cyclic, but it isn’t productive to call these processes “a biological clock”."

**CONTEXT:** What is the alternative to the "biological clock" theory for explaining seasonal rhythms?

**RAY PEAT:** "Our biological rhythms, approximately 24 hours, do have a learned component, but Frank A. Brown’s experiments in the 1960s made it clear that there are important rhythmic environmental influences other than the cycle of light and dark. Brown’s biological experiments were complemented by Alexandre Rothen’s physical experiments which made it clear that the diurnal cycles aren’t just light cues. In the university’s hamster house where I worked, the cycles of light and dark were automatically controlled, air temperature was kept constant, and there were no windows, but in the winter the hamsters’ thymus glands practically disappeared, and then in the summer they were restored. The infrared and microwave radiation of the environment, that can penetrate walls, must be constant to avoid biological stress."

**CONTEXT:** What environmental factors beyond light influence biological rhythms?

**RAY PEAT:** "Winter, at least in some species, causes serotonin to increase. (Philo and Reiter, 1980) In the winter, and in the morning, intraocular pressure (IOP) increases (Qureshi, et al., 1999), and drugs that antagonize serotonin reduce IOP. Women have higher IOP than men, and estrogen is associated with increased IOP, while progesterone is associated with decreased IOP. Serotonin is a mediator of stress, transduces an infinite range of harmful influences into a stereotyped response, mobilizing the adaptive antistress systems. The difference seems to be that passivity allows a generalized catabolism, while an active response strengthens the functional system that is being challenged. Winter depression is associated with increased serotonin. There is no question about serotonin’s being a mediator of depression, except for the stereotype that got its start in the 1960s that wants to see it as a sedative euphoriant, a deficiency of which produces many psychological problems. The tryptophan and melatonin industries were built up around this serotonin myth. Aging and the degenerative diseases involve combinations of metabolic depression and inflammation. Anti-serotonin agents are coming to be recognized as treatments for a wide variety of degenerative diseases."

**CONTEXT:** How does winter affect serotonin levels, and what is the role of serotonin in depression and aging?

**RAY PEAT:** "Minks that have mated in the winter don’t implant the fertilized ovum in the uterus until the spring equinox, when progesterone rises suddenly, and allows both the uterus and the embryo to begin the process of pregnancy and gestation. Progesterone provides the oxygen needed for the successful implantation of the embryo, while estrogen and serotonin lower the intrauterine oxygen. Under good conditions, the (premenstrual) luteal phase of the monthly cycle resembles pregnancy, as a period of progesterone dominance, in which the abundance of progesterone causes cells to decrease their estrogen content. The luteal phase is actually the first stage of pregnancy, and if there is implantation of an embryo all of the processes that begin at ovulation progress continuously until childbirth occurs. When there is no implantation, the luteal phase progesterone dominance is terminated, allowing estrogen to enter tissues and producing menstruation. The sudden decrease of progesterone production before menstruation is similar to the decrease of hormone production just before childbirth. The same conditions that produce the premenstrual syndrome, if they aren’t corrected by the placenta’s massive production of progesterone, will produce preeclampsia, toxemia of pregnancy, eclampsia, and postpartum depression. They are also related to the problems that become so common at menopause. Whenever the production of progesterone falls, tissues are susceptible to estrogen."

**CONTEXT:** What is the role of progesterone in pregnancy and how does its deficiency relate to various health issues?

**RAY PEAT:** "There are several common causes of a progesterone deficiency. Deficiencies of thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol are often responsible for a progesterone deficiency. Inadequate light exposure can cause it. Excess polyunsaturated fats, interfering with gonads and thyroid, can cause it. And excess serotonin can cause it."

**CONTEXT:** What are the common causes of progesterone deficiency?

**RAY PEAT:** "“Serotonin is a precursor of melatonin, which tends to be produced at night. Because of the books published during the intensive marketing campaign for melatonin, many people are familiar with the work of Maestroni and Pierpaoli, who reported that treatment with melatonin, or with the transplantation of pineal glands from young animals, would extend the life span of mice and prevent cancer. Melatonin is often called the “pineal hormone,” though there are other hormones in the pineal, and many other tissues can produce melatonin. Mice and rats are nocturnal animals, so they are notoriously inappropriate for evaluating the nocturnal hormones as they might relate to humans and other animals that are active in the daytime. Although melatonin sometimes antagonizes serotonin in a protective way, in itself it can lower body temperature and alertness, suppressing thyroid and progesterone. (Sirotkin, 1997) Women who are depressed have been found to have higher daytime melatonin levels. (Danilenko, et al., 1994) While the popular books have given the impression that there is no question about the protective nature of melatonin, it turns out that in only five out of 36 strains of inbred mice can melatonin be demonstrated in the pineal gland. The C3H/He strain, in which mammary cancer kills practically all the females, is one of these. When they are given melatonin the development of tumors is accelerated. When their pineal gland is removed, their life span is extended."

**CONTEXT:** What is the relationship between serotonin, melatonin, and cancer, and what are the limitations of animal studies?

**RAY PEAT:** "Estrogen and stress increase free fatty acids, and unsaturated free fatty acids cause serotonin release; serotonin, at least under some circumstances, can be lipolytic, increasing the free circulating fatty acids. Darkness creates stress, by free radical inactivation of the respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, and light restores the activity of that enzyme, and probably also has a variety of anti-free-radical actions. Free fatty acids rise in the darkness, intensifying free radical production and suppressing respiration. Progesterone synthesis is suppressed by darkness. The serotonin liberated by the fatty acids suppresses progesterone by inhibiting the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) which stimulates progesterone synthesis, and also seems to act directly on the ovary to suppress progesterone secretion (Wilson, et al., 1975). While estrogen increases serotonin’s actions, progesterone antagonizes them."

**CONTEXT:** How do estrogen, stress, darkness, and serotonin interact to affect fatty acids, respiration, and progesterone synthesis?

**RAY PEAT:** "Serotonin depletes glycogen stores, much the way estrogen and histamine do. This can cause hyperglycemia. Thyroid, carbon dioxide, and caffeine, which inhibit serotonin release, all tend to protect glycogen stores. Under the influence of carbon dioxide, noradrenaline can still liberate glucose from glycogen, but serotonin’s effect is inhibited by carbon dioxide. Serotonin interferes with slow-wave sleep, creating a situation resembling that of depression or old age. Brain glycogen is depleted in old age, and this depletion contributes to inefficient brain metabolism. Serotonin’s stimulation of ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal cortex, and its direct stimulation of cortisone production by the adrenals, is probably involved in the chronic excess of cortisone seen in depression and old age, which contributes to insulin resistance and diabetes, and to the atrophy of all tissues including the brain. (People who are studying chronic inflammatory processes are gathering data that will be meaningful for understanding depression and aging, but it seems that psychiatrists don’t know about their work.)"

**CONTEXT:** How does serotonin affect glycogen stores, sleep, and the stress response, and what are the implications for aging and diabetes?

**RAY PEAT:** "Anti-serotonin drugs such as bromocriptine have been found to correct diabetes, apparently because serotonin interferes with the use of sugar, acting on cells’ metabolism to decrease its use, and preventing the secretion of insulin. Bromocriptine’s correction of obesity also seems to be the result of its correction of glucose metabolism. In the 1970s, it was established that darkness increases the appetite for alcohol. More recently (Lin and Hubbard, 1995) it has been found that the antiserotonin drugs prevent the dark-induced appetite for alcohol. Alcohol is probably a self-medication to alleviate serotonin-related depression. Alcohol, like progesterone, is neuroprotective in brain trauma. Alcohol increases formation of the sedative neurosteroid (“THP”) derived from progesterone (VanDoren, et al., 2000), and alcohol increases brain circulation, countering serotonin’s effect. Progesterone withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal are so closely related that one can alleviate the symptoms of the other. Isolation might be another factor contributing to depression and alcoholism, since it decreases the formation of the protective neurosteroid."

**CONTEXT:** How do anti-serotonin drugs affect diabetes and obesity, and what is the connection between darkness, alcohol, and serotonin?

**RAY PEAT:** "The “brain fog” that is often described in depressed people (and people with other serotonin syndromes, such as the fibromyalgia syndrome) is probably produced by a combination of factors, including hypothyroidism, low body temperature, and hyperserotonemia. The amnesia produced by shock was found to be prevented by antiserotonin drugs (Montanaro, et al., 1979). The same researchers suggested that the drugs had an “antipunishment” effect, in effect making the animals less fearful."

**CONTEXT:** What causes "brain fog" in depression, and how do antiserotonin drugs affect memory and fear?

**RAY PEAT:** "There is more confusion in the medical literature regarding the actions of serotonin than there is about practically any other subject. For example, there is clear evidence from both animal and human studies that serotonin, like estrogen, is associated with aggression, but the dominating stereotype is that serotonin is the agent of serenity and peace. In an epidemiological study (Moffitt, et al., 1998), a record of violence was clearly associated with above-average blood serotonin levels. Animal studies show that darkness stimulates both aggression and eating (Russell and Singer, 1983), and that serotonin increases, while antiserotonin drugs decrease, aggression (Carlini and Lindsey, 1983)."

**CONTEXT:** What is the prevailing misconception about serotonin's role in aggression, and what does the research indicate?

**RAY PEAT:** "When lysergic acid derivatives came onto the pharmaceutical market, the spirit of the times caused them to be described as dopamine agonists, rather than as serotonin antagonists, but the latter would be at least as descriptive of their effects. Bromocriptine fulfills many of the requirements of being a serotonin antagonist, for example by suppressing prolactin. As a class, the serotonin antagonists have a very interesting place in pharmaceutical medicine, because the broad spectrum of their therapeutic activity suggests the great variety of problems caused by excess serotonin. The documentation of extensive government-supported fraud in research on LSD and marijuana should make us question subsequent research that plows the same or similar furrows. My inclination is to believe that incompetence can’t account for the glaring errors in research on serotonin-related questions. Commercial commitments to particular theories of drug action have undoubtedly contributed to the crazy quality of the psychiatric serotonin literature. In the case of some antiserotonin drugs, there is commercial support for research, so they might come into general use in spite of the mythic stature of tryptophan/serotonin/melatonin."

**CONTEXT:** What is the historical context of drug classification related to serotonin, and what are the potential biases in psychiatric research?

**RAY PEAT:** "“Serotonin activity” may be judged by the response of prolactin to serotonin or to a drug that is thought to mimic serotonin, or by serotonin metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid, or by the total amount of serotonin in the blood, or by its efflux from platelets, or the ratio of its concentration in the plasma and in the platelets. It isn’t very clear whether serotonin’s concentration or its turnover rate is most important, and the number and sensitivity of the many “serotonin receptors” varies, and presumably changes the meaning of any given quantity of serotonin. When serotonin’s activity is judged indirectly, interpretation and subjectivity are involved. Even the “synaptic reuptake inhibitors,” such as fluoxetine, sometimes relieve symptoms that are believed to be caused by an excess of serotonin (C. Advokat and V. Kutlesic, 1995, Pharmacotherapy of the eating disorders: a commentary). But the actual injection of serotonin, or of serotonin antagonists that are known to approximately neutralize serotonin’s effects, and the examination of the basal concentrations of the hormones known to be regulated by serotonin, are much less likely to be distorted by arbitrary interpretations. When a “receptor” is first proposed or “discovered,” it is always “a protein,” though because of the idea of a barrier (semipermeable) membrane around cells, “membrane lipids” are sometimes invoked. But after a few years of research, the “receptor” becomes a more and more complex system of interacting molecules. The doctrine of the “receptor” is intended to explain why cells have a specific response to a specific substance. Gradually, a receptor becomes a “response element,” but the “element,” in its complexity, begins to shade off into the system “membrane/cytoplasm/nucleus,” which is to say, the cell. The cell is the response element. The “transmitter substance” interacts with various agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists and binding competitors to produce an effect that is a summation of influences. A single protein or protein system can serve as a “receptor” for antagonistic substances."

**CONTEXT:** What are the challenges in accurately measuring serotonin activity, and how is the concept of "receptors" evolving?

**RAY PEAT:** "Thyroid, protein, magnesium, thiamine, progesterone and light are natural factors that keep serotonin under control, and that don’t have the side effects of the synthetic antiserotonergic agents. Knowledge of serotonin’s harmful actions can guide our use of the natural protective factors. For example, whey protein contains much more tryptophan than whole milk or cheese does, and would tend to suppress the thyroid and activate the whole serotonin-stress system. Whey might be good food for fattening pigs, but its acceptance in the health food industry as a powdered protein supplement is just another example of the harmful effects of the serotonin mythology."

**CONTEXT:** What are the natural factors that control serotonin, and what are the potential issues with whey protein supplementation?
