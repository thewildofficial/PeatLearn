**RAY PEAT:** "The big moment in my life happened while I was giving a health lecture to nuclear engineers. In the middle of my talk it hit me! What the hell am I saying? If you don't know whether low doses are safe or not, going ahead is exactly wrong. At that moment, I changed my position entirely. There is no way I can justify my failure to help sound an alarm over these activities many years sooner than I did. I feel that at least several hundred scientists trained in the biomedical aspect of atomic energy--myself definitely included--are candidates for Nuremberg-type trials for crimes against humanity for our gross negligence and irresponsibility. Now that we know the hazard of low-dose radiation, the crime is not experimentation--it's murder.”

**CONTEXT:** This statement reflects a profound shift in understanding regarding the safety of low-dose radiation, stemming from a realization of past negligence and the potential for widespread harm.

**RAY PEAT:** "The people in the various professions who insist that 'small' amounts of radiation are perfectly safe, or beneficial, seldom say much about the mechanisms involved in the harm or benefit of radiation. They suggest that the ionizing radiation stimulates mechanisms that repair damaged genes, when it damages them, or that it 'stimulates the immune system.' The very old idea, developed more than 80 years ago, that radiation's biological effect is produced exclusively by causing genetic damage, continues to be central to their thinking. This view dominates the thinking of dentists and physicians, as well as those in the business of 'protecting public health.'"

**CONTEXT:** This highlights a critique of the prevailing scientific and medical dogma regarding radiation, emphasizing a lack of mechanistic understanding and a reliance on outdated theories of genetic damage.

**RAY PEAT:** "At the beginning of the 20th century (e.g. H.J. Muller, 1910, 1921) when nothing was known about the physical or chemical nature of 'the gene,' many biologists committed themselves to the belief that 'the gene is the basis of life.' When it was discovered that x-rays produced mutations it seemed obvious that it was because they changed the 'genes,' and later when genes came to be identified with DNA, it was believed that radiation had its biological effects because of its effects on DNA, which continued to be thought of as 'the basis of life.' The idea is that at the moment radiation is absorbed by a tissue, a DNA-gene is damaged, or not. Studies of DNA in isolation have contributed to some mistaken ideas about radiation safety, at one time the mere size of the DNA molecule was thought to determine an organism’s sensitivity to radiation. In living cells, according to the older explanation, if the amount of DNA damage isn’t too great, it will be repaired, and the radiation will have had no effect at all. A greater amount of DNA damage might be incorrectly repaired, producing a mutation, that could produce cancer, or, if the gonads were exposed to radiation, an inherited defect could be produced. Any damage would be instantaneous and local, and the repair would take place within minutes or hours, so by analyzing the DNA (usually just looking for structural changes in chromosomes), the degree of damage could be determined soon after the exposure."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the historical development of the "gene-centric" view of radiation damage, tracing its roots to early 20th-century biology and its persistence even after the identification of DNA.

**RAY PEAT:** "This localized, 'genetic' explanation for the harmful effects of radiation was the predominant ideology of Anglo-American biology. William Bateson, who promoted the genetic doctrine of Gregor Mendel, and his followers such as Charles Davenport, wanted to deny absolutely the possibility that environmental influences could influence traits such as intelligence; each trait was determined by a gene. At the same time, 1902-1914, Theodor Boveri was explaining the formation of cancer by radiation or chemical carcinogens in terms of an induced imbalance of chromosomes, produced by changes in the process of cell division. The sorting of chromosomes during cell division became unstable under the influence of various harmful factors. Boveri saw that disturbing the chromosomes of an embryo could cause cells to stray out of their normal developmental path, and reasoned that this is similar to what happens in cancer--a disorganization of cellular interactions. But William Bateson didn’t acknowledge that chromosomes carried genetic information until 1922, and his influence greatly retarded Anglo-American study of the biology of chromosomes, and of cancer."

**CONTEXT:** This elaborates on the ideological underpinnings of the "genetic" explanation, highlighting the influence of figures like Bateson and Davenport and contrasting it with Boveri's more nuanced understanding of chromosomal instability.

**RAY PEAT:** "This old idea (Boveri's) of genomic or chromosomal instability has become central to understanding the real effects of radiation on organisms. The fact that bacteria and other single-cell organisms contain DNA isn’t enough to allow them to be considered as models for understanding the biological effects of radiation, because the existence of more complex organisms depends on the coordination of cells, based on signals and perception of wholes. The nature and the quality of our development depends on the degree of our cells’ vigor and sensitivity in responding to, maintaining, and creating our long-range coherence. The sorting of chromosomes is one of the processes affected by the cells’ basic vitality."

**CONTEXT:** This emphasizes the importance of Boveri's concept of chromosomal instability and critiques the use of single-cell organisms as models for understanding radiation effects in complex multicellular organisms.

**RAY PEAT:** "On the intracellular level, organization and sensitivity depend first on the interactions of water, electrons, and proteins, supported by the modifying effects of carbon dioxide, sugars, fats, nucleic acids, salts, and other substances. The crucial regulatory processes occur within a narrow range of energy changes. Interacting cells communicate their needs by excitatory signals that mobilize other parts of the system to make adaptations. Excitatory signals imposed arbitrarily from the outside on the adapting organism can create a state of arousal without a defined purpose, meaning that in the absence of a goal that can be achieved, the excited state may expend resources that could have been used productively in other ways. Ionizing radiation is one source of such misleading excitatory signals, and even apart from its ionizing effects, it is likely to transmit enough extraneous excitation to the delicately balanced living state to change its organization and sensitivity."

**CONTEXT:** This delves into the fundamental cellular mechanisms of organization and sensitivity, emphasizing the role of energy interactions and the disruptive potential of arbitrary external excitatory signals like ionizing radiation.

**RAY PEAT:** "When a man receives ionizing radiation to the head (Tamminga, et al., 2008), his sperms are destabilized in such a way that they are able to carry the instability with them into the fertilized ovum and the developing offspring, increasing the risk of developing leukemia."

**CONTEXT:** This provides a specific example of how radiation can induce transgenerational effects, impacting reproductive cells and increasing the risk of disease in offspring.

**RAY PEAT:** "Leonell Strong, who had studied genetics with T.H. Morgan and began breeding a strain of cancer-prone mice in 1921 for use in cancer and genetic research, gradually began thinking in terms of environmentally induced genetic instability. Excessive estrogen, and changes in the metabolism of the liver were the two factors that he focused on. He found that if a pregnant cancer-prone mouse received injections of a liver extract, several generations of the descendants would be free of cancer. The genetic instability that caused them to reliably develop mammary cancer was an inherited metabolic condition which could be corrected by a metabolic treatment."

**CONTEXT:** This illustrates the concept of environmentally induced genetic instability and its potential for correction through metabolic interventions, referencing the work of Leonell Strong.

**RAY PEAT:** "It had been known for several decades that both estrogen and ionizing radiation produced cancer, when in 1971 Segaloff and Maxfield showed that they are synergistic. Irradiation produced cancer much more quickly when the rats had been treated with estrogen. In 1973, Segaloff treated 3 groups of rats, (1) with estrogen and radiation (800 R of X-rays to half of the body), or (2) with estrogen, radiation and progesterone, or (3) with just radiation and progesterone. As in the earlier experiment, many tumors quickly appeared on the side of the body that received the radiation in most of the animals of group 1, but in group 2 only one eighth as many tumors appeared in the animals that received progesterone. In the third group, no tumors appeared in the irradiated animals that received progesterone."

**CONTEXT:** This details the synergistic relationship between estrogen and ionizing radiation in cancer development and the protective effect of progesterone, citing the research of Segaloff and Maxfield.

**RAY PEAT:** "This protective action of progesterone against radiation implies that X-rays have 'estrogenic' effects on the body. This had previously been demonstrated very literally, when it was found that irradiating any part of the body of a female animal caused it to go into estrus, behaviorally as well as physiologically and biochemically. Toxic heavy metals can also sensitize animals to radiation (and some metals, such as cadmium, have estrogenic effects). Stress of any sort tends to increase the formation of estrogen, and estrogen activates many mediators of inflammation."

**CONTEXT:** This connects the protective effect of progesterone to the estrogenic nature of X-rays and highlights other factors, like heavy metals and stress, that can increase estrogen production and inflammation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Forty years ago, all carcinogens were dogmatically considered to be mutagens, but gradually the idea of 'non-genotoxic carcinogenesis' has been recognized, along with the idea of genetic instability. Estrogen is typical of this type of carcinogen. Heat exposure, 'serum starvation,' and the tumor microenvironment are examples of non-genotoxic factors that can induce the instability (Li, et al., 2001). If the local environment of the tumor is carcinogenic, the tumor could grow by 'induction' of defects in normal cells, rather than just by multiplication of its own cells. (I have proposed that carbon monoxide produced by a tumor could be a factor in the enlargement of the tumor, by induction of stress in surrounding cells.)"

**CONTEXT:** This introduces the concept of "non-genotoxic carcinogenesis" and its link to genetic instability, using estrogen as an example and suggesting that factors like heat, serum starvation, and the tumor microenvironment can induce this instability.

**RAY PEAT:** "When destabilizing factors are transmitted from cells that were damaged, for example by irradiation, to other cells that weren't exposed to the radiation, but which then undergo changes similar to those of the exposed cells, these changes are called 'bystander effects.' Besides being transmitted from one part of the body to another, for example from the head to the reproductive organs, these effects can even be transmitted from one animal to another, for example from fish exposed to radiation to other fish which enter water after the exposed fish have been in it (Mothersill, et al., 2007). Serotonin has been identified as one of the substances transmitting the effect (Poon, et al., 2007). In some situations, the transmitted factors include nitric oxide and 'persistent' free radicals (Harada, et al. 2008)."

**CONTEXT:** This defines and explains "bystander effects," illustrating how damage can be transmitted between cells and even organisms, and identifying potential signaling molecules involved.

**RAY PEAT:** "G. Csaba’s idea of hormonal imprinting is that a pattern is formed in the cytoplasm in response to the environment, and that this pattern can be passed from generation to generation if it is useful (Csaba, 1986). The persistent bystander and even transgenerational effects of radiation can be thought of as a kind of negative imprinting, a disruption of useful cytoplasmic patterning. The outcome of any cellular destabilization can be influenced by many things, even years or generations later. Even seemingly normal identical twins and cloned animals have recognizable differences, resulting from slight instabilities in the imprintable factors that regulate development (Dolinoy, et al., 2007, Weidman, et al., 2007; de Montera, et al., 2010; Wong, et al., 2010; Zwijnenburg, et al., 2010)."

**CONTEXT:** This introduces the concept of "hormonal imprinting" and relates it to the effects of radiation, suggesting that radiation can cause a negative form of imprinting, disrupting cellular patterns and leading to long-term consequences.

**RAY PEAT:** "Prenatal or neonatal exposure to extremely small amounts of the estrogenic substances used in plastics, nonylphenol and bisphenol-A, have been found to greatly increase adult sensitivity to estrogen (Wadia, et al., 2007; Soto, et al., 2008). The synergy of estrogen and ionizing radiation suggests that early exposure to either could increase adult sensitivity to both."

**CONTEXT:** This highlights the impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals like nonylphenol and bisphenol-A on estrogen sensitivity and suggests a potential synergy with ionizing radiation, particularly with early life exposures.

**RAY PEAT:** "The bystander effects include alterations in energy metabolism (Nugent, et al., 2010), movement, mitosis, and cellular orientation or perspective. Cells have different degrees of mobility, from muscle and bone cells to leukocytes, and the integrity of the organism depends on the appropriateness of their movements. Cells have to know where they are, and when, to coordinate their activities in space and time, knowing not only when to divide, but exactly how to orient the direction in which the division will occur."

**CONTEXT:** This details the specific cellular processes affected by bystander effects, including energy metabolism, cell movement, division, and orientation, emphasizing the importance of cellular coordination for organismal integrity.

**RAY PEAT:** "Although I consider every cell to be a potential stem cell, it’s helpful to consider the nature of the 'stem cell function' in a general sense. The cells in the basal layer of the skin or intestine, for example, are well known stem cells. With each division, one daughter cell stays in place as a stem cell, while the other migrates toward the surface, as a differentiating and functioning replacement cell. (In the brain, cells migrate from a zone around the ventricles into the brain.) This is an asymmetric division, which must be oriented exactly, so that the basal layer continues to contain stem cells, rather than differentiated cells. The extracellular matrix surrounding the 'stem' cells participates in the orientation of the asymmetrical division. Without proper orientation of the cell and its matrix, tissue renewal would fail."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the concept of stem cell function and asymmetric cell division, emphasizing the critical role of orientation and the extracellular matrix in maintaining tissue renewal.

**RAY PEAT:** "In the 1920s and 1930s, when the idea of developmental fields guided many areas of research, numerous biologists considered that electrical and electromagnetic fields interacted with chemical processes, permitting cells to sensitively regulate their size, shape, orientation, and interactions with their surroundings. W.F. Koch, Alexander Gurvich, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, and G.W. Crile did many experiments demonstrating the biological effects of electrons and photons, but in the spirit of reductionism corporate science bitterly rejected their work for several decades. A few groups have been bringing their ideas up to date, in ways that help to understand bystander effects, lingering inflammatory effects, imprinting, transgenerational effects, and that suggest new types of therapy."

**CONTEXT:** This revisits the historical context of research into developmental fields and the interaction of electrical/electromagnetic fields with cellular processes, highlighting the suppression of this work by reductionist science and its potential relevance to understanding radiation effects.

**RAY PEAT:** "Gurvich, and more recently many others including F.A. Popp, have demonstrated that normal cells emit weak photons in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. Popp's laboratory has demonstrated that DNA can 'store photons,' by forming stable excited electronic states between nucleotide bases. Excited states in proteins can be transmitted to other proteins (Lardinois, et al., 2003), and the water close to proteins can maintain the excited states of electrons produced by oxygen over long periods of time (Marchettini, et al., 2010; Voeikov, 2001, 2002, 2007: Voeikov & Malenkov, 1971, Voeikov, et al., 2003)."

**CONTEXT:** This introduces the concept of biophotons and the ability of biological molecules like DNA and proteins to store and transmit excited electronic states, emphasizing the role of water in maintaining these states.

**RAY PEAT:** "Enzymic reactions in normal metabolism can create a variety of excited electronic states which contribute to the store of photons and electrical fields. In plants, light creates an excited electronic state in chlorophyll, which is used metabolically, generating cellular fields similar to those in animals. The random processes of free radical oxidations in unstable lipids can also create excited states and photons, but they are distinct from those produced in normal metabolism. Deeply penetrating ionizing radiation is a unique source of random excitation of electrons, contributing to the burden of random stimulation."

**CONTEXT:** This contrasts the excited electronic states generated by normal metabolism with those produced by free radical oxidation and ionizing radiation, highlighting the latter as a source of "random stimulation."

**RAY PEAT:** "In the normal metabolic oxidation and reduction, orderly electrical fields are generated, and the polarity of these fields is closely related to the alignment of the parts of the cell that regulate movement and cell division. When an external electrical field is applied experimentally, the centrosome, Golgi body, microtubules and other parts of the cell align themselves with the field, the cytoplasm streams, and the cells migrate toward the external cathode. Injured cells behave like cathodes, producing the strongly negative 'injury potential.' Intensely stimulated cells produce a similar field, and it has been known for many years that brain cells will migrate toward an area of excitation. But disoriented cells don’t migrate appropriately."

**CONTEXT:** This explains the role of orderly electrical fields in normal cellular function, including movement and division, and how external fields can influence cellular organization. It also notes that injured or intensely stimulated cells produce similar fields.

**RAY PEAT:** "Since the normally oriented fields are maintained by metabolically excited electrons, and govern the quality of tissue renewal, the random electronic and light activity produced by lipid peroxidation and other toxic processes threaten the basic organization of the animal or plant. Vitamin C and the intrinsic 'antioxidants' protect against these electronic disturbances, and can reverse some of the bystander effects produced by radiation and other stresses."

**CONTEXT:** This links the maintenance of normal cellular organization to metabolically excited electrons and highlights how random electronic activity from lipid peroxidation and other toxins can disrupt this organization. It also points to Vitamin C and antioxidants as protective agents.

**RAY PEAT:** "Even ultraviolet light can produce electronic excitation and bystander effects that destabilize cells, but, unlike gamma rays and x-rays, ultraviolet light doesn’t penetrate deeply into the body. In visible light, it is only the red component that can pass deeply into the tissue, and it happens that red light is able to 'quench' many excited electrons, restoring them to their normal resting or ground state. In a solid material, such as a seed or hair or bone, excited electrons will persist for a long time (hours in the seed and hair, years in bone), but with a brief exposure to red light, they will return to their normal state."

**CONTEXT:** This discusses the effects of ultraviolet and red light on electronic excitation, noting that red light can "quench" excited electrons and restore them to a normal state, with implications for solid materials.

**RAY PEAT:** "This beneficial effect of the red component of sunlight helps to keep plants from being sunburned. If the red light is removed from sunlight, even the blue light by itself is quickly toxic to their mitochondria. During the night, animals’ respiratory enzymes lose some of their effectiveness, possibly from the effects of random lipid peroxidation, and red light restores their activity."

**CONTEXT:** This elaborates on the beneficial effects of red light, its role in protecting plants from sunburn, and its ability to restore the effectiveness of animal respiratory enzymes, potentially counteracting damage from lipid peroxidation.

**RAY PEAT:** "Heat stress and increased pH contribute to the generation of random electronic excitation, and light is protective in plants, partly by allowing carbon dioxide to be produced. In all cells, CO2 helps to control the general electronic state, lowering the pH and protecting the essential molecules from random excitations, oxidations, and reductions."

**CONTEXT:** This identifies heat stress and increased pH as contributors to random electronic excitation and highlights the protective role of light and carbon dioxide (CO2) in stabilizing cellular electronic states.

**RAY PEAT:** "Under natural conditions, cosmic rays are an important source of random electrical excitations. At high altitude, their high energy causes them to have a low 'linear energy transfer,' LET, affecting tissues only slightly as they pass through, and at sea level the secondary and tertiary rays produced from the collisions of primary cosmic rays with the atmosphere have a higher LET, which is probably responsible for the lower mortality from cancer and heart disease at high altitude. But the lower oxygen pressure at high altitude, and greater retention of carbon dioxide in the tissues, would also reduce the tissue damage from radiation."

**CONTEXT:** This discusses cosmic rays as a source of random electrical excitation and suggests that the lower mortality from cancer and heart disease at high altitudes might be due to a combination of factors, including the LET of cosmic rays, lower oxygen pressure, and increased CO2 retention.

**RAY PEAT:** "There are two species of bacteria that can withstand extremely large doses of ionizing radiation, and carbon dioxide seems to be the crucial factor in the ability of their proteins to function, even when their DNA has been fragmented by intense ionizing radiation."

**CONTEXT:** This points to carbon dioxide as a critical factor in the radiation resistance of certain bacteria, enabling their proteins to function even with fragmented DNA.

**RAY PEAT:** "The recognition of the coherence of the organism on the molecular and electronic level makes it clear why there can be no threshold of safety for ionizing radiation, but it also suggests new approaches to preventing and treating the developmental and degenerative diseases."

**CONTEXT:** This concludes that understanding the molecular and electronic coherence of organisms explains the absence of a safety threshold for ionizing radiation and opens avenues for new therapeutic strategies.

**RAY PEAT:** "Meanwhile, people in the US are being offered CAT scans to 'detect early signs of heart disease' in a test that 'takes only 20 to 30 minutes,' and for other trivial reasons, with the approval of state radiation regulators, and without interference from the FDA. Hundreds of people recently experienced loss of hair in a stripe around their head after having x-ray scans, when their doctors intentionally used high doses to get clearer images. Paralysis and dementia are likely to follow in a few years, but few doctors recognized their bizarre hair loss as an indication of radiation poisoning. Many hospitals use low voltage x-rays for mammograms, with high LET and increased carcinogenicity, to get better images."

**CONTEXT:** This criticizes the widespread and often unnecessary use of medical imaging technologies like CAT scans and mammograms, highlighting the potential for high doses of radiation and the lack of recognition of radiation-induced damage by medical professionals.

**RAY PEAT:** "In California, where hundreds of the destructive head scans were done, tort reform law means that noneconomic damages for medical malpractice are limited to $250,000, from which a successful litigant would have to pay the lawyer. Premature death or dementia would be likely to precede any legal victory."

**CONTEXT:** This points out the legal and financial barriers that prevent individuals from seeking recourse for medical malpractice involving radiation exposure, particularly in California.

**RAY PEAT:** "The culture that has made these bizarre medical radiation exposures possible is being sustained and expanded every time your dentist or physician explains the safety of 'digital x-rays,' or 'dual photon bone scans,' or mammograms."

**CONTEXT:** This attributes the continuation of harmful medical radiation practices to the uncritical acceptance and promotion of technologies like digital x-rays and mammograms by healthcare professionals.
