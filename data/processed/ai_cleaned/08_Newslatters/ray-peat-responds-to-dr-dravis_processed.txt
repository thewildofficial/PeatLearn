**RAY PEAT:** "Davis mentions that he looked in Medline for references to the animal studies I wrote about. Practicing physicians, who put in long hours with their patients, and who work in the context of an often authoritarian profession and an oppressive bureaucratic culture, need to find out in an efficient way what other physicians are doing, and they probably find Medline and Index Medicus very useful. But for a research scientist working in a college of natural sciences, in a university with a good library, there are more appropriate ways to search — especially since I emphasized that some of the work was done more than 50 years ago."

**CONTEXT:** A reader questioned the lack of references for claims made about coconut oil's anti-obesity and cholesterol-lowering effects, stating they found no such studies in Medline. Ray Peat responds to this criticism.

**RAY PEAT:** "I decided to take a random sampling of Medline’s information. (I noticed that the library’s machine advised that Medline not be used if you are looking for information on non-human animals). I looked at their entries for 1984, where I found F. Berschauer, et al., “Nutritional-physiological effects of dietary fats in rations for growing pigs. 4. Effects of sunflower oil and coconut oil on protein and fat retention, fatty acid pattern of back fat and blood parameters in piglets.” Arch. Tierernahr (East Germany) 34(1), 19-33, 1984. [Fat content in the coconut oil fed animals, after only 34 days, was 15.9%; in the control group, 18.6%; and in the sunflower oil fed animals, 21.1%.] So, I saw that Medline does include an animal-nutrition journal, and decided to check another year. J. Yazbech, et al., “Effects of essential fatty acid deficiency on brown adipose tissue activity in rats maintained at thermal neutrality.” Comp. Bioch. Physiol. A (England) 94(2), 273-276, 1989, suggested that the observed increase in resting metabolic rate produced by using coconut oil to create an essential fatty acid deficiency, is partly the result of increased heat production in the brown adipose tissue. The weight of that fat decreased by 28%, while its ability to produce heat increased 69%."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat provides specific examples of studies he found that support his claims about coconut oil's effects on animal metabolism and body fat, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on Medline with specific keywords.

**RAY PEAT:** "If Davis checked a data-base that was designed for animal research, he could find an abundance of publications relevant to the question of coconut oil’s effect on body fat. I don't know of any computerized data systems for biology that go back 60 years, but manual searching of the printed sources is only a little slower than the electronic method, and infinitely more precise. Over the years, I have noticed that science libraries seem to be off limits to most professors, so any information they can get from computers should be significant, but the reliance on computer-retrieved information puts an awful burden on the people who choose the keywords."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat elaborates on the challenges of information retrieval and the importance of comprehensive research methods beyond basic database searches, particularly for older scientific literature.

**RAY PEAT:** "The Townsend Letter, especially with your new title, is obviously a journal of viewpoint, and not of technical data. As such, much of its function is to clarify goals, orientations, and beliefs, and possibly to encourage people to have more imaginative, flexible, and critical attitudes toward medical ideas. When a publication purports to be objective and “scientific,” then there is a problem with unsupported assertions. If Davis had complained, for example, that an article in the July/August Scientific American Science and Medicine by D.V. Spicer and M.C. Pike was doctrinaire, ideological, and promotional, and failed to support most of its important assertions, I would think his letter was constructive. But I think he misunderstands the Townsend Letter’s reason for existence. Although it isn’t at all the sort of “alternative health” journal I have imagined publishing, its openness is important in this increasingly repressive medical-bureaucratic environment."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat discusses the nature and purpose of the Townsend Letter, differentiating it from purely technical journals and emphasizing the value of its open platform for diverse viewpoints, even if it means dealing with less rigorously referenced content at times.

**RAY PEAT:** "The refereed journals are not great critics of themselves. Some appalling things happen at the “great journals,” but the scientific-medical reader generally assumes that the editors fairly select representative experts to review the submitted work. Venality, bigotry and plagiarism are probably just as well represented in the main-line professional journals as in other parts of our society. The greatest abuses are possible when the referees are anonymous. A series of shocking experiences with journal referees over a period of 15 years led me to stop submitting my work to professional journals in the U.S. There are only a few small journals that I think are respectably free from the corrupting influence of corporate power."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat expresses skepticism about the objectivity of mainstream peer-reviewed journals, citing personal negative experiences with referees and the influence of corporate power, which led him to seek alternative publication venues.

**RAY PEAT:** "In 1981, I began a newsletter to keep my friends informed of my progress. Occasionally, these almost private communications get wider distribution, as when the Townsend Letter picks them up. I am glad to offer a few readers some background sources and occasionally some additional material I didn’t cite in the newsletter, but when someone is making their first approach to an area of research, I think the best method is to ask a science librarian to help them."

**CONTEXT:** Ray Peat explains the origin of his writings and his approach to sharing information, suggesting that for those new to a research area, direct engagement with a science librarian is the most effective starting point.
