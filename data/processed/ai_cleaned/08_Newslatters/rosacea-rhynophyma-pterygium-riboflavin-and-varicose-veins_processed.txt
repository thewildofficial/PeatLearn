**RAY PEAT:** The cause of rosacea is known to anyone who cares to know. Hot beverages, spicy foods, and alcohol can contribute to the enlargement of blood vessels in the face, a condition often associated with rosacea.

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying metabolic issue contributing to conditions like rosacea?

**RAY PEAT:** I inferred from the very vascularized nose of a neighbor that his tissues were experiencing relative hypoxia, and that his brain tissue might be suffering even more. Extensive new growth of blood vessels suggests a compensatory mechanism for oxygen delivery.

**CONTEXT:** Can you elaborate on the role of riboflavin in addressing this hypoxia and vascularization?

**RAY PEAT:** Riboflavin deficiency would waste glucose by blocking mitochondrial respiration. This leads to blood vessels dilating to deliver more blood to the tissues. When blood sugar falls at night, this can exacerbate the problem, potentially leading to issues like nosebleeds.

**CONTEXT:** You mentioned a case of a child with frequent nosebleeds and behavioral issues. How did riboflavin play a role?

**RAY PEAT:** I reasoned that a riboflavin deficiency would waste glucose by blocking mitochondrial respiration, and that blood vessels would dilate to deliver more blood to the tissues. Since blood sugar falls at night, I thought this could account for the regularity of his night-time nosebleeds. His frequent angry behavior seemed to be an exaggeration of the normal irritability of hungry children.

**CONTEXT:** You also observed a woman with chronically visible blood vessels in her eyes, a condition you linked to pterygium. What is the connection to riboflavin?

**RAY PEAT:** The cornea normally has a high concentration of riboflavin, but it is very susceptible to a deficiency of that vitamin. It receives its oxygen largely directly from the air, and partly from the ring of blood vessels at its edge. In her case, it seemed that the contact lenses, shutting off direct contact with the air, had led to an invasive growth of blood vessels to the edge of the cornea, probably partly because of a riboflavin deficiency. I think this would be called a pterygium, but I think the same kind of process would be called rosacea if it occurred on the nose or cheeks. Oxygen deficiency causes connective tissue cells to produce extra collagen. This would intensify the problem of delivering oxygen to the cells, tending to set up a vicious circle.

**CONTEXT:** What dosage of riboflavin did you recommend for these conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** I gave the woman and her son each 10 mg. of riboflavin one morning, and suggested using that amount for a few weeks. The boy's nose didn’t bleed that day or in the night, and as far as I know, it never bled again. He stopped having his fits of rage.

**CONTEXT:** You noted that even with riboflavin supplementation, enlarged and invasive blood vessels may not always disappear. What other factors can influence blood vessel tone and appearance?

**RAY PEAT:** I believe that the delicate red blood vessels that often first appear around the nostrils, and the larger red, purple and blue vessels that usually appear on the sides of the feet below the ankles, and more obvious varicose veins, can also result from loss of tone in the walls of the blood vessels, in addition to any overgrowth process that might be occurring, and that various problems related to stress and nutrition can be responsible. I have seen very distinct blood vessels disappear completely after using thyroid and oral DHEA. I think this is partly the result of restored muscle tone, as can sometimes be seen in the blood vessels of the hands shortly after taking progesterone.

**CONTEXT:** Can you explain the physiological basis for how thyroid and DHEA might improve blood vessel tone?

**RAY PEAT:** Many veins are very well-supplied with smooth muscle. When the physician scoffs at the idea that varicose veins could “recover,” it is because of the idea that “they occur when the valve fails." Since the valve is just a flap of tissue, it is hard to imagine how it could be restored. But if you realize that veins (especially the subcutaneous veins which become unsightly varicosities) are well-muscled, you can see that a loss of muscle tone will lead to swelling of the vein, and that a valve which could close a small channel, simply can't reach across the channel of a distended vein. That is, valve failure will necessarily follow loss of smooth muscle tone. If the tone is restored, the channel will return to its normal size, and the valve would have a chance to function again.

**CONTEXT:** What is your overall recommendation for preventing or reversing these degenerative vascular processes?

**RAY PEAT:** Although major structural restorations can occur in many tissues, even in middle-aged people, when conditions are favorable, it is much better to stop degenerative processes before they have gone very far, by optimizing all aspects of the environment, as far as this is possible.

**CONTEXT:** Are there any specific considerations regarding the source of riboflavin?

**RAY PEAT:** Synthetic riboflavin is allergenic, so natural sources are the safest.
