**RAY PEAT:** The cause of rosacea is known to anyone who cares to know. Hot beverages, spicy foods, and alcohol can contribute to the enlargement of blood vessels in the face.

**CONTEXT:** What is the underlying mechanism behind rosacea and similar conditions?

**RAY PEAT:** In 1964, I observed a neighbor whose nose was remarkably red. I inferred that his tissues were experiencing relative hypoxia, and that his brain tissue might be suffering even more due to extensive new blood vessel growth. I suggested riboflavin, and after receiving a B-complex injection, his nose was no longer red, and his memory improved. However, when the injections stopped, both problems returned. Later, his nose had enlarged and become lumpy (rhynophyma), an advanced form of rosacea.

**CONTEXT:** Can you provide a case study illustrating the role of riboflavin in vascular issues?

**RAY PEAT:** I knew a woman whose son had frequent nosebleeds, often at night, and violent rages after eating sugary foods. I reasoned that a riboflavin deficiency would waste glucose by blocking mitochondrial respiration, leading to blood vessel dilation to deliver more blood to tissues. As blood sugar falls at night, this could explain the nocturnal nosebleeds. His anger seemed an exaggeration of hunger-induced irritability. His mother had visible blood vessels in her eyes, yellowed and lumpy, suggesting enlarged, tortuous vessels.

**CONTEXT:** How does riboflavin deficiency relate to vascular changes in the eyes and nose?

**RAY PEAT:** The cornea normally has a high concentration of riboflavin and is susceptible to its deficiency. It receives oxygen from the air and the blood vessels at its edge. Contact lenses, by limiting air contact, likely led to invasive blood vessel growth at the cornea's edge, possibly exacerbated by a riboflavin deficiency. This process, if on the nose or cheeks, would be called rosacea; on the eye, it might be a pterygium. Oxygen deficiency causes connective tissue cells to produce extra collagen, creating a vicious cycle of impaired oxygen delivery. Even adequate blood nutrients wouldn't suffice once fibrous overgrowth begins.

**CONTEXT:** What was the outcome of riboflavin supplementation in these cases?

**RAY PEAT:** I gave the woman and her son 10 mg of riboflavin daily. The boy's nosebleeds stopped, and he no longer had fits of rage. His mother later became chronically insane, likely due to heavy smoking, poor diet, and hormonal imbalance causing severe energy deficiency in her brain. While the brain is generally resistant to fibrous tissue overproduction, degenerative brain diseases can involve glial cell overproduction, a stress reaction similar to rhynophyma and pterygium.

**CONTEXT:** Can enlarged and invasive blood vessels caused by riboflavin deficiency be fully reversed?

**RAY PEAT:** Although I've seen near-instantaneous effects from small doses of riboflavin, enlarged and invasive blood vessels caused by its deficiency may not disappear even with prolonged supplementation. Delicate red blood vessels around the nostrils, larger vessels on the feet, and varicose veins can also result from a loss of blood vessel wall tone, in addition to overgrowth. Stress and nutritional issues can contribute. I've observed distinct blood vessels disappear completely with thyroid and oral DHEA, likely due to restored muscle tone, similar to the effect of progesterone on hand blood vessels.

**CONTEXT:** What is the conventional understanding of blood vessel regulation, and how does it differ from your view?

**RAY PEAT:** Many believe only arteries and arterioles contain smooth muscle, due to an overemphasis on arteriolar contraction. I believe the conventional theory about arteriolar role in circulation is incorrect. The capillary wall and endothelial cells are often assumed to be non-contractile, and with passive veins, this leads to the impression that "peripheral resistance" is solely due to arteriolar tone.

**CONTEXT:** How does smooth muscle in veins relate to conditions like varicose veins?

**RAY PEAT:** Many veins are well-supplied with smooth muscle. The idea that varicose veins can "recover" is dismissed because of the belief that they occur when the valve fails. However, a valve is just a flap of tissue and cannot be restored if the vein channel is distended. If veins, especially subcutaneous ones that become varicose, have lost muscle tone, they will swell. A valve that could close a small channel cannot span a distended one. Valve failure is a consequence of lost smooth muscle tone. Restoring tone normalizes the channel size, allowing the valve to function again.

**CONTEXT:** What is the best approach to managing degenerative vascular processes?

**RAY PEAT:** While significant structural restoration can occur in many tissues, even in middle age, when conditions are favorable, it is far better to halt degenerative processes before they advance significantly. This is achieved by optimizing all aspects of the environment as much as possible.

**CONTEXT:** Are there any specific considerations regarding riboflavin supplementation?

**RAY PEAT:** Synthetic riboflavin is allergenic, so natural sources are the safest.
