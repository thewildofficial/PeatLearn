**RAY PEAT:** The idea that our diet should be supplemented with essential fatty acids is a flawed concept. Linoleic acid and related oils, in the amounts recommended by proponents like Udo Erasmus, are known to cause significant harm. These harms include impaired brain development and learning, damage to skin and bones, accelerated aging and age-pigment accumulation, damage to the circulatory system, increased cancer incidence, suppressed immunity, and endocrine dysfunction.

**CONTEXT:** The document discusses the promotion of linseed oil and the concept of essential fatty acids.

**RAY PEAT:** Research demonstrating the toxic effects of unsaturated oils dates back over 60 years. These substances inhibit numerous enzymes involved in digestion, immunity, clot removal, and thyroid function. They also disrupt mitochondrial energy production and interfere with cellular communication. These toxic effects are rarely discussed, and there is little funding for research in these areas. The marketing of these oils often distracts from their inherent toxicity.

**CONTEXT:** The document criticizes the marketing of linseed oil and the lack of discussion about its negative effects.

**RAY PEAT:** For nearly two decades, mainstream medicine has promoted unsaturated oils for "heart protection." However, some scientists, like Hans Selye, have consistently stated the contrary truth. Unfortunately, large commercial interests have influenced many in "alternative medicine" to adopt these false establishment narratives.

**CONTEXT:** The document contrasts mainstream medical advice with scientific findings regarding unsaturated oils.

**RAY PEAT:** The claim that cod liver oil can "grease arthritic joints" is a misconception. The modern food oil industry employs more sophisticated sales promoters. It is crucial for us to cultivate a more critical medical-scientific culture.

**CONTEXT:** The document critiques historical and contemporary marketing of oils for health benefits.
