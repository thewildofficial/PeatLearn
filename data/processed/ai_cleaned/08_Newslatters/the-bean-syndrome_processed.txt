**RAY PEAT:** The common bean contains phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), a lectin that can cause effects overlapping with viral infection and autoimmune disease. PHA can lead to the appearance of large mononuclear cells in the blood, suppression of DNA synthesis in thymic cells, mild leucopenia, and liver necrosis. Other legumes like lentils, broad beans, fenugreek, peas, chickpeas, lupinus, and soybeans also exhibit similar activity. Even a single exposure to these plant toxins can have effects lasting for two weeks.

**CONTEXT:** What are the effects of common bean toxins and other plant toxins on the body?

**RAY PEAT:** In aging, stress, and malnutrition, the intestinal barrier function is compromised. Deficiencies in Vitamin A and magnesium allow macromolecules to enter the bloodstream from the intestine.

**CONTEXT:** How does intestinal barrier function relate to aging, stress, and malnutrition?

**RAY PEAT:** Injury to the bowel can manifest as "flu-like" symptoms. There are observations that respiratory viruses can appear in the intestine before they are detected in the respiratory tract. Research suggests that in conditions like a cold, a specific type of contraction appears in the bowel. Codeine has been found to be effective in blocking these cold symptoms. Additionally, naloxone, a morphine antagonist, has shown the ability to restore normal responses in a stressed bowel. Chronic fatigue and "painful fatigue" states can sometimes follow infections like influenza.

**CONTEXT:** What is the connection between bowel injury, flu-like symptoms, and the use of codeine and naloxone?

**RAY PEAT:** Bacterial toxins, whether originating in the intestine or from food supplements, can be absorbed in larger quantities during periods of stress, malnutrition, and old age. Endotoxin, a type of bacterial toxin, suppresses mitochondrial respiration and can induce a shock-like physiological state, similar to that caused by endogenous hormones. Endotoxin may also play a role in the premenstrual syndrome and certain breast conditions.

**CONTEXT:** How do bacterial toxins affect mitochondrial respiration and hormonal states?

**RAY PEAT:** Mitochondrial damage, often seen in severe stress, is characterized by a depletion of antioxidant reserves and a reduced ability to convert cholesterol into protective steroid hormones. This mitochondrial damage is more prevalent in hypothyroidism, as thyroxine helps inhibit lipid peroxidation and counteracts adrenaline's effects, thus preventing or minimizing "catecholamine toxicity." Beans and lentils are potent anti-thyroid agents, which could explain the observed decrease in aerobic capacity and peak oxygen consumption in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) if it's linked to chronic legume consumption.

**CONTEXT:** What are the consequences of mitochondrial damage in severe stress, and how do beans and hypothyroidism relate to this?

**RAY PEAT:** Hypothyroidism impairs magnesium retention. A study showing that magnesium supplementation reduced pain, improved energy and emotional state, and increased intracellular magnesium in CFS patients suggests a potential role for hypothyroidism in CFS.

**CONTEXT:** How does hypothyroidism relate to magnesium levels and chronic fatigue syndrome?

**RAY PEAT:** A specific symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is post-exertional malaise, characterized by pain, weakness, and the worsening of other symptoms like fever and swollen lymph nodes. This can be explained by increased absorption of bowel toxins following relative ischemia (reduced blood flow) in the intestine during intense adrenergic stimulation.

**CONTEXT:** How can post-exertional malaise in CFS be explained by bowel toxin absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** When a person consumes an allergen, it can remain in the intestine. Exertion, emotional stress, hunger, or nighttime can lower blood sugar, triggering an adrenaline surge. Adrenaline reduces blood flow to the intestine, allowing allergens to be absorbed through the compromised tissues. If blood sugar remains low despite adrenaline, white blood cells release inflammatory substances like histamine. Adrenaline also stimulates glucocorticoid secretion, which can lead to night sweats and neurological symptoms. Glucocorticoids initially promote, then at high levels, destroy the body's detoxifying enzymes.

**CONTEXT:** What is the mechanism by which allergens are absorbed during stress and low blood sugar?

**RAY PEAT:** Certain conditions, such as bowel infections or an immature intestinal tract, can allow significant amounts of allergens to pass through the intestinal barriers. This is concerning, as some physicians and nutritionists advise feeding beans to infants at six months, and in some parts of Africa, babies are given "bean milk" from birth.

**CONTEXT:** What are the implications of intestinal immaturity and bowel infections regarding allergen absorption, especially in infant feeding practices?

**RAY PEAT:** The Epstein-Barr virus, often implicated in conditions like Burkitt's lymphoma and infectious mononucleosis, has also been proposed as a cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Research has noted a striking similarity between Burkitt cells and human lymphocytes stimulated by bean extract. This suggests a potential link between Burkitt's lymphoma and a bean-rich diet, although other factors are clearly involved, as not everyone who eats beans develops the disease. Intestinal parasites, common in tropical Africa, can cause bowel inflammation, leading to the absorption of large amounts of antigens.

**CONTEXT:** What is the observed similarity between Burkitt cells and bean-stimulated lymphocytes, and how do intestinal parasites relate to antigen absorption?

**RAY PEAT:** Since the bowel becomes inflamed during influenza, it is plausible that some of the symptoms associated with "the flu" are caused by the absorption of bowel toxins.

**CONTEXT:** How might influenza symptoms be related to absorbed bowel toxins?

**RAY PEAT:** The variations in post-influenza syndromes are likely influenced by the types of bacteria or foods present, either chronically or during periods of uncompensated stress or inflammatory disease. There is an argument that while rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis are caused by streptococcal antigens, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is likely caused by antigens from gram-positive lactobacilli, which are part of the normal gut flora. Migraine, SLE, CFS, thyroid issues, and certain types of porphyria are more common in women of reproductive age and are often worsened by premenstrual hormonal changes. It's suggested that women in this age group may harbor a specific vaginal flora, including large numbers of gram-positive lactobacilli, which could contribute to these conditions. My own experience showed that drinking a lactobacillus milk product consistently triggered migraine headaches, leading me to stop recommending yogurt and similar fermented foods, initially attributing it to lactic acid. While lactic acid can be a metabolic burden, especially with estrogen excess, the broader point about our immune response to systemic bacterial antigens is crucial.

**CONTEXT:** How do bacterial antigens, particularly from lactobacilli, relate to autoimmune conditions like SLE and premenstrual symptoms, and what is the significance of lactic acid in this context?

**RAY PEAT:** I have previously discussed the use of antibiotics, carrot fiber, and charcoal for relieving the premenstrual syndrome, and noted a study where charcoal supplementation extended lifespan. A farmer successfully improved the growth of runt pigs by adding charcoal to their diet, similar to how antibiotics are used in pig farming to promote growth and feed efficiency. Charcoal not only binds and removes toxins but also acts as a potent catalyst for the oxidative destruction of many toxic chemicals, effectively pre-empting the action of protective enzymes in the intestinal wall and liver.

**CONTEXT:** What are the benefits of charcoal in detoxification and growth promotion, and how does it compare to antibiotics?

**RAY PEAT:** Our natural defenses against environmental toxins include a protective mucus layer, IgA antibodies on membranes, the intestinal brush border for protein digestion, enzymes in the intestine and liver for detoxifying smaller molecules, and binding proteins like albumin and metallothionein. When toxins bypass these barriers, survival depends on adaptive factors such as catatoxic steroids and antioxidative systems. The monooxygenase system's enzymes metabolize both exogenous toxins and endogenous substances like steroids, prostaglandins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which influence allergic reactivity. An imbalance in this system can deplete protective steroids.

**CONTEXT:** What are the body's natural defenses against environmental toxins, and how can the monooxygenase system become imbalanced?

**RAY PEAT:** It has been proposed that allergic reactions themselves function as an immunological defense against toxins. However, when the intestine and liver are damaged, cholesterol production can decrease significantly, leading to insufficient levels for producing catatoxic and anti-inflammatory steroids. Many individuals experiencing allergic fatigue have dangerously low blood cholesterol levels, between 90 and 130 mg%. Consuming fruit, due to its fructose content, can help restore liver cholesterol synthesis.

**CONTEXT:** How does the body's cholesterol production relate to allergic fatigue and the synthesis of protective steroids?

**RAY PEAT:** Undercooked and raw plant materials are generally significant sources of toxins and allergens. Legumes have become more prominent in the American diet due to a shift in dietary ideology favoring "healthful" diets, often coupled with a compulsion for exercise and the use of trendy but toxic food supplements like tryptophan and iron. Ascorbic acid tablets can be contaminated with enough iron or other catalysts to produce toxic levels of free hydroxyl radicals. In vegetarian diets low in preformed Vitamin A (retinol), carotene can become toxic. The conversion of carotene to retinol requires vitamin B12 and adequate liver function, which in turn depends on thyroid function. Excessive carotene can be anti-thyroid and anti-steroidogenic. A deficiency in retinol can impair barrier functions, immune responses including antibody formation, and the synthesis of protective steroids.

**CONTEXT:** What are the risks associated with raw plant materials, legumes, and certain food supplements, particularly in the context of vegetarian diets and vitamin A?

**RAY PEAT:** Some women experiencing premenstrual fatigue find that the premenstrual phase lengthens over time, eventually leading to chronic fatigue. This is often one of the more easily corrected "PMS" issues. In older individuals with prolonged illness, fatigue problems tend to involve multiple bodily systems. The greater the amount of "toxic fat" stored in the body, the more caution is needed when increasing metabolic and physical activity. Utilizing more vitamin E, short-chain saturated fats, and other agents that inhibit lipid peroxidation is important.

**CONTEXT:** How does the duration and severity of fatigue relate to body fat and the need for specific nutrients and fats?

**RAY PEAT:** Sixty years ago, chronic fatigue was often diagnosed as "nervous breakdown," with recommendations for sanatorium stays and to "stop bothering the doctor." Sometimes, a change in activity, location, work, or social circle can be very beneficial. Dietary changes can have social and ideological implications and may be easier to implement during a vacation. However, sometimes the problem can be resolved simply by avoiding certain plant materials and food supplements, correcting hormonal imbalances, or modifying intestinal ecology.

**CONTEXT:** What were historical approaches to chronic fatigue, and what are the key areas for intervention in addressing it?
