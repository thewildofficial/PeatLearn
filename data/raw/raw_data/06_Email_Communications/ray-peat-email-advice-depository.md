Q: Do you think alkalized cocoa has any benefits over normal cocoa?  
A:The idea is to remove the fat so that it mixes easily with milk.  
  
Q:Someone told me you drink HFCS coke regularly? do you think it is not  
that harmful if someone is healthy?  
A:I prefer Mexican coke with real sugar (it tastes very different), but
metabolically there isn't much difference.  
  
Q: Does a protein deficiency lower liver detoxification due to increased  
muscle breakdown which inhibits thyroid via amino acids which lowers  
metabolic efficiency of liver?  
A:Yes, I think that's at least part of how it works.  
  
Q: Do you think any of the dessicated thyroid products are good?  
A:I haven't seen anything that compares well with the original Armour.  
  
Q: Do you think zinc oxide is the least harmful commercially available
sunscreen?  
A:Yes  
  
Q:In mitochondria and mortality you mention pyruvate having similar effects of
lactate. Isn't pyruvate necessary for oxidative metabolism? Is pyruvate only
bad when mitochrondia can't fully metabolize it?  
A:Yes  
  
Q: Do you think pure USP B vitamins, like [ niacinamide
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b3-niacinamide-powder-usp-grade/)
or [ b1 ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b1-powder-thiamine-hcl-
usp-grade/) , are safe?  
A:Because of individual sensitivities, each one should be tested carefully.
Allergic reactions sometimes show up within a few minutes of contacting your
mouth, other times it takes a couple of days to see a bad reaction. The worst
one is B2, folic acid is next for allergies. B1, [ pantothenic acid
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b5-pantothenic-acid-powder-usp-
grade/) , niacinamide and B6 are pretty safe.  
  
Q: Does T3 act like caffeine in the way if you don't eat enough sugar you can
get nervousness, heart skipping, headaches, etc?  
A:Not like caffeine, but if too much is taken suddenly, a person who has been
deficient in thyroid is likely to experience an excess of adrenaline. Since
the body normally produces about 4 mcg of T3 in an hour, taking 10 or 20 mcg
at once is unphysiological.  
  
Q:Is it ok to eat baking soda with protein meals or does it buffer stomach
acid?  
A:It slows digestion down for a few minutes.  
  
Q:When you say several effects of co2 shuts off glycolysis, do you mean
anaerobic glycolysis or all glycolysis, if all glycolysis how does glucose
enter mitochondria without breaking down to pyruvate?  
A:Meaning the entry of lactate into the blood stream inappropriately, which
would usually be called aerobic glycolysis, though you can't be sure how much
oxygen is getting to the cells when CO2 is deficient, since its absence causes
many problems in oxygen delivery and use.  
Q:So when CO2 isn't deficient glycolysis, meaning glucose to pyruvate, is
fine?  
A:Yes, as part of oxidative metabolism, it's better than burning too much fat.  
  
(asked him this question after paul jaminet claimed ray would agree with him
to use O6 oil to help eczema...)  
Q: Do you recommend someone try omega 6 supplementation from say safflower oil
in an extreme case on eczema? Or will the omega 6 appear to heal the eczema
because of lowered metabolism?  
A:Slowing metabolism and causing inflammation are its two basic functions.  
  
Q:My dad asked about what to do for his skin cancer  
A:Yes, avoidance of unsaturated fats is the most important thing.

Enhancement of transglutaminase activity and polyamine depletion in B16-F10  
melanoma cells by flavonoids naringenin and hesperitin correlate to reduction
of  
the in vivo metastatic potential.  
Lentini A, Forni C, Provenzano B, Beninati S.  
Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.  
The in vitro and in vivo effects of two flavonons, naringenin (NG) and
hesperitin  
(HP) on the proliferation rate of highly metastatic murine B16-F10 melanoma
cell  
were investigated. NG or HP treatment of melanoma cells produced a remarkable  
reduction of cell proliferation, paralleled with both the lowering of the  
intracellular levels of polyamine, spermidine and spermine and the enhancement
of  
transglutaminase (TGase, EC 2.3.2.13) activity. Orally administered NG or HP
in  
C57BL6/N mice inoculated with B16-F10 cells affected the pulmonary invasion of  
melanoma cells in an in vivo metastatic assay. The number of lung metastases  
detected by a computerized image analyzer was reduced, compared to untreated  
animals, by about 69% in NG-treated mice and by about 36% in HP-treated mice.  
Survival studies showed that 50% of the NG-treated animals died 38 +/- 3.1
days  
after tumor cell injection (control group: 18 +/- 1.5 days) and HP-treated
mice  
died 27 +/- 2.3 days after cell inoculation. Taken together, these findings  
provide further evidences for the potential anticancer properties of dietary  
flavonoids as chemopreventive agents against malignant melanoma.

Flavonoids inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in B16 melanoma 4A5 cells.

We investigated the growth inhibitory activity of several flavonoids,
including  
apigenin, luteolin, kaempherol, quercetin, butein, isoliquiritigenin,
naringenin,  
genistein, and daizein against B16 mouse melanoma 4A5 cells. Isoliquiritigenin  
and butein, belonging to the chalcone group, markedly suppressed the growth of  
B16 melanoma cells and induced cell death. The other flavonoids tested showed  
little growth inhibitory activity and scarcely caused cell death. In cells  
treated with isoliquiritigenin or butein, condensation of nuclei and  
fragmentation of nuclear DNA, which are typical phenomena of apoptosis, were  
observed by Hoechst 33258 staining and by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA.  
Flowcytometric analysis showed that isoliquiritigenin and butein increased the  
proportion of hypodiploid cells in the population of B16 melanoma cells. These  
results demonstrate that isoliquiritigenin and butein inhibit cell
proliferation  
and induce apoptosis in B16 melanoma cells. Extracellular glucose decreased
the  
proportion of hypodiploid cells that appeared as a result of isoliquiritigenin  
treatment. p53 was not detected in cells treated with either of these
chalcones,  
however, protein of the Bcl-2 family were detected. The level of expression of  
Bax in cells treated with either of these chalcones was markedly elevated and
the  
level of Bcl-XL decreased slightly. Isoliquiritigenin did not affect Bcl-2  
expression, but butein down-regulated Bcl-2 expression. From these results, it  
seems that the pathway by which the chalcones induce apoptosis may be
independent  
of p53 and dependent on proteins of the Bcl-2 family. It was supposed that  
isoliquiritigenin induces apoptosis in B16 cells by a mechanism involving  
inhibition of glucose transmembrane transport and promotion of Bax expression.
On  
the other hand, it was suggested that butein induces apoptosis via  
down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and promotion of Bax expression. This  
mechanism differs from the isoliquiritigenin induction pathway.

We have reported a high prevalence of hypothyroidism in the cutaneous melanoma  
population, suggesting that the pathologic hormonal environment of
hypothyroidism  
promotes melanoma growth. The objective of this study was to test the
hypothesis  
that TSH, which circulates at elevated levels in hypothyroid individuals,  
stimulates the growth of melanoma cells. Our results show that TSH receptors  
(TSHR) are expressed by virtually all cutaneous melanocytic lesions, including  
benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, and melanomas, with higher expression found in  
malignant and pre-malignant lesions. The finding of TSHR expression by human  
tumors is confirmed in cultured melanoma cells and melanocytes, in which TSHR  
expression is demonstrated by immunofluorescent staining, western blotting,
and  
reverse transcriptase-PCR. Melanoma TSHR are functional, as evidenced by the  
ability of TSH to induce the formation of cAMP and to activate the  
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Cultured melanoma cells, but
not  
melanocytes, are induced to proliferate at a physiologically relevant  
concentration of TSH. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that
TSH  
is a growth factor for human melanoma. Our findings have broad clinical  
implications for the prevention of melanoma and the management of established  
disease.

Inhibition of lung metastasis in mice induced by B16F10 melanoma cells by  
polyphenolic compounds.  
Menon LG, Kuttan R, Kuttan G.  
Amala Cancer Research Centre, Thrissur, Kerala, India.  
Several polyphenolic compounds were tested for the inhibition of lung
metastasis  
induced by B16F10 melanoma cells in mice. Oral administration of polyphenols
such  
as curcumin and catechin at concentrations of 200 nmol/kg body weight were
found  
to inhibit the lung metastasis maximally as seen by the reduction in the
number  
of lung tumor nodules (80%). Other polyphenols which inhibited the lung tumor  
nodule formation were rutin (71.2%), epicatechin (61%), naringin (27.2%) and  
naringenin (26.1%). The polyphenols which did not inhibit lung tumor nodule  
formation were quercetin, morin and ellagic acid. Consequent to the inhibition
of  
the lung tumor nodules, the life span of animals treated with polyphenols was  
also found to be increased. Curcumin (143.85%), catechin (80.81%) and rutin  
(63.59%) had maximal increase in life span. The results indicate a possible
use  
of these compounds in arresting the metastatic growth of tumor cells.

In the course of recent efforts to identify new potential antiproliferative  
active principles, Salvia leriifolia extracts and isolated constituents were  
evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of human cancer cell  
lines, including renal adenocarcinoma (ACHN), amelanotic melanoma (C32),  
colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), lung large cell carcinoma (COR-L23),  
malignant melanoma (A375), lung carcinoma (A549), and hepatocellular carcinoma  
(Huh-7D12) cells. The hexane and CH(2) Cl(2) extracts showed the strongest  
cytotoxic activity against the C32 cell line with IC(50) values of 11.2 and  
13.6 μg/ml, respectively, and the AcOEt extract was the most active extract  
against the COR-L23 cell line (IC(50) of 20.9 μg/ml). Buchariol, a
sesquiterpene  
obtained by biofractionation of the CH(2) Cl(2) extract, exhibited a higher  
activity than the positive control vinblastine against the C32 and A549 cell  
lines (IC(50) values of 2.1 and 12.6 μM, resp.). Interesting results were also  
obtained for naringenin, a flavonoid isolated from the AcOEt extract, which  
exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against the C32, LNCaP, and COR-L23 cell  
lines (IC(50) values of 2.2, 7.7, and 33.4 μM, resp.), compared to vinblastine  
(IC(50) values of 3.3, 32.2, 50.0 μM, resp.). None of the tested compounds  
affected the proliferation of skin fibroblasts (142BR), suggesting a selective  
activity against tumor cells.

Caffeine, a methyl xanthine derivative, was studied to assess the effect on  
B16F10 melanoma induced experimental metastasis. Caffeine was administered at
a  
dose of 100 and 50 mg/kg body weight by both routes, to tumour bearing
animals.  
Solid tumour reduction studies with Caffeine showed a significant reduction in  
tumour volume for 100 mg/kg dose by both oral and i.p. routes. The Caffeine  
treated metastatic tumour bearing animals significantly (p<0.001) inhibited
lung  
tumour nodules. Serum sialic acid levels and lung hydroxyproline contents in
the  
treated groups were significantly (p<0.001) low, when compared with the
untreated  
control animals. In the present study, our results suggest that Caffeine
inhibits  
solid tumour development and pulmonary experimental metastasis induced by
B16F10 melanoma cells, in murine model.

The toxicity of the five methylxanthine derivatives, caffeine, pentoxifylline,  
A802710, propentofylline and A802715, was determined against the two human  
melanoma lines, Be11 and MeWo, and against the two human squamous cell
carcinoma  
lines, 4197 and 4451, by vital dye staining assay. Pentoxifylline and A802710  
emerge as the least toxic showing TD(50) (toxic dose of 50%) levels of 3.0-4.0  
mM. Propentofylline and caffeine take an intermediate position. A802715 has a  
TD(50) of 0.9-1.1 mM and is the most toxic. Subtoxic concentrations
(<TD50)added  
after irradiation at maximum expression of the G2/M block show that  
pentoxifylline and A802710 effectively abrogate the G2/M block, whereas
A802715  
and propentofylline prolong the G2/M block or remain ineffective depending on
the  
p53 status of the cell line. In p53 wt cells BrdU incorporations show that the  
irradiation-induced suppression of S-phase entry is marginally enhanced by  
pentoxifylline but strongly enhanced by propentofylline and A802715. This
effect  
was not seen in p53 mutant cells. Since propentofylline and A802715 prolong
the  
G2/M block and effectively suppress BrdU incorporation these two drugs emerge
as  
antagonists to pentoxifylline, caffeine and A802710. Common structural
features  
of propentofylline and A802715 are a propyl substituent at the N7 position in  
contrast to pentoxifylline, caffeine and A802710 where the N7 substituent is a  
methyl group. The results document the effectiveness of four methylxanthines

Theophylline- and caffeine-treated B16-F10 cells exhibited low adhesion to  
laminin/ [ collagen ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-

assay. In contrast, theobromine appeared ineffective. When young adult C57BL/6  
mice were injected intravenously with theophylline-treated B16-F10 cells, the  
number of surface lung tumours was markedly reduced. Densitometric analyses  
performed on digitalized microscopic images of histological sections of lung
were  
used to estimate the frequency (number of lung foci; NLF) and the size
(average  
area of metastatic foci; AMF) of the resulting tumour foci. These parameters
were  
correlated to the proliferation (AMF) and invasion (NLF) of melanoma cells in  
vivo. The data showed a similar theophylline-induced decrease in the AMF and
NLF  
values (71%, P < 0.01). Caffeine treatment produced a more pronounced decrease
in  
the AMF (61%, P < 0.01) than in the NLF (25%, P < 0.01). To our knowledge,
this  
is the first demonstration that theophylline and caffeine possess the capacity
to  
inhibit not only cell proliferation, but also the metastatic behaviour of  
melanoma cancer cells.

Identification of arachidonic acid pathways required for the invasive and  
metastatic activity of malignant tumor cells.  
Reich R, Martin GR.  
Department of Pharmacology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.  
Metastasis is a complex process, almost a cascade, involving multiple steps
and  
activities. However, an important factor is that malignant cells are able to  
penetrate through the multiple basement membrane barriers surrounding tissues,  
blood vessels, nerves and muscle that would otherwise block their
dissemination.  
Penetration of malignant tumor cells through basement membrane is an active  
process requiring proteolysis. We report here that inhibitors of both the  
cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism
convert  
mouse melanoma and human fibrosarcoma cells to a non invasive state by
reducing  
the production of MMP-2, an enzyme required for the degradation of basement  
membranes. Specific metabolites of each pathway, i.e. PGF2 alpha and 5-HPETE,
are  
able to transcend the block and restore collagenase production, invasiveness
in  
vitro and metastatic activity in vivo. These studies indicate a key role for  
arachidonic acid metabolites in metastasis and suggest novel therapeutic  
approaches for inhibiting the spread of cancer.

Potentiation of lipid peroxidation in B16F10 and B16F1 melanoma cells by  
caffeine, a methylxanthine derivative: relationship to intracellular
glutathione.

Chemotherapy Division, Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre,
Mumbai,  
India.  
BACKGROUND: Caffeine has shown an inhibitory role in invasion and
proliferation  
in melanoma pulmonary metastasis as well as in high-grade tissue sarcoma.  
However, little is known about its mechanism and possible role in metastatic
cell  
lines.  
MATERIALS AND METHODS: B16F10 and B16F1 cell lines of high and low metastatic  
potential were treated with caffeine at different time intervals with
different  
doses. Reduced glutathione, glutathione S-transferase and lipid peroxides were  
estimated to evaluate the effect of caffeine.  
RESULTS: Caffeine treatment showed glutathione depletion and increased lipid  
peroxidation with higher glutathione S-transferase activity in both B16F10 and  
B16F1 cell lines. However the effect of caffeine was dependent on the time
factor  
as well as on the dose.  
CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine was an effective inhibitor of metastatic activity.  
Glutathione depletion in conjunction with increased lipid peroxidation was a  
potent indicator in the regulation of metastatic behavior of B16F10 and B16F1  
melanoma cell lines.

Caffeine inhibits UV-mediated NF-kappaB activation in A2058 melanoma cells: an  
ATM-PKCdelta-p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism.

Markham Street, Slot # 845, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.  
Mammalian ultraviolet (UV) radiation response is a gene induction cascade  
activated by several transcription factors, including NF-kappaB. Although  
NF-kappaB is induced by UV radiation, the signal transduction mechanism
remains  
relatively unclear. In the present study, we show that UV-induced NF-kappaB  
activation is mediated by the activation of Ataxia telangiecia mutated (ATM)
and  
protein kinase C (PKC). We also show that caffeine specifically inhibits  
UV-mediated NF-kappaB activation, but not TNFalpha-mediated NF-kappaB
activation.  
In addition, our study shows that ATM, but not ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) or  
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is involved in UV-induced NF-kappaB  
activation. Because SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor), or Calphostin C or
rottlerin  
(PKC inhibitors) was able to inhibit UV-mediated NF-kappaB activation, we  
evaluated whether caffeine could inhibit p38 MAPK or PKC activity. Caffeine or  
rottlerin inhibited UV-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but not  
anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, suggesting that p38 MAPK is  
downstream of PKC. Additionally, caffeine could effectively inhibit UV-induced  
increases in PKC activity. Taken together, our study demonstrates that
caffeine  
is a potent inhibitor of UV-induced NF-kappaB activation. Additionally, this  
inhibition occurs due to the inhibitory action of caffeine on ATM and PKC,  
resulting in the inhibition of p38 MAPK activation.

Early presence of activated ('exhausted') platelets in malignant tumors

A. Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, University of Milan,
Italy.  
To evaluate whether or not the finding of platelet activation in patients with  
tumors is related to the stage of malignancy, a study of biochemical markers  
indicative of the presence of circulating activated ('exhausted') platelets
was  
carried out in 95 untreated patients with breast adenocarcinoma or malignant  
melanoma, localized or spread to regional lymph nodes with no detectable
distant  
metastasis. These tumors were chosen as examples of tumors which can be  
accurately staged for localization or spread, and as examples of mucin-
secreting  
tumors (breast adenocarcinoma) or neuroectodermic tumors (malignant melanoma).  
Results were compared with those for 26 patients with benign breast disease,
23  
blood donors and 50 hospital workers. The most frequent abnormalities were low  
levels of intraplatelet ADP and 5-hydroxytryptamine and high ATP/ADP ratios.  
Although these abnormalities occurred with both types of tumor, they were more  
frequent and marked for melanomas and breast carcinomas spread to regional
lymph  
nodes. Our data indicate that the presence of exhausted platelets is an early  
finding in patients with malignant tumors.

Oral contraceptive use and risk of melanoma in premenopausal women.

Melanoma has been increasing in white populations. Incidence rates rise
steeply  
in women until about age 50, suggesting oestrogen as a possible risk factor.  
Oestrogens can increase melanocyte count and melanin content and cause  
hyperpigmentation of the skin. We examined prospectively the association
between  
oral contraceptive (OC) use and diagnoses of superficial spreading and nodular  
melanoma among 183,693 premenopausal white women in the Nurses' Health Study  
(NHS) and the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) cohorts. One hundred and forty
six  
cases were confirmed in NHS during follow-up from 1976 to 1994, and 106 cases  
were confirmed in NHS II from 1989 to 1995. Skin reaction to sun exposure,  
sunburn history, mole counts, hair colour, family history of melanoma, parity,  
height and body mass index were also assessed and included in logistic
regression  
models. A significant twofold increase in risk of melanoma (relative risk (RR)
=  
2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.4) was observed among current OC users  
compared to never users. Risk was further increased among current users with
10  
or more years of use (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-7.0). Risk did not appear elevated  
among past OC users, even among those with longer durations of use, and risk
did  
not decline linearly with time since last use. In conclusion, risk of  
premenopausal melanoma may be increased among women who are current OC users,  
particularly among those with longer durations of use. Further research is
needed  
to determine whether low-dose oestrogen pills in particular are associated
with  
an increase in risk and to describe possible interactions between OC use and
sun  
exposure or other risk factors for melanoma.

Aspirin, ibuprofen, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cancer  
prevention: a critical review of non-selective COX-2 blockade (review).

10th  
Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210-1240, USA. [ harris.44@osu.edu
](mailto:harris.44@osu.edu)  
We comprehensively reviewed the published scientific literature on non-
steroidal  
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cancer and evaluated results based upon  
epidemiologic criteria of judgment: consistency of results, strength of  
association, dose response, molecular specificity, and biological
plausibility.  
Sufficient data from 91 epidemiologic studies were available to examine the
dose  
response of relative risk and level of NSAID intake for ten human
malignancies.  
Dose response curves were fitted by exponential regression. Results showed a  
significant exponential decline in the risk with increasing intake of NSAIDs  
(primarily aspirin or ibuprofen) for 7-10 malignancies including the four
major  
types: colon, breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Daily intake of NSAIDs,  
primarily aspirin, produced risk reductions of 63% for colon, 39% for breast,  
36% for lung, and 39% for prostate cancer. Significant risk reductions were
also  
observed for esophageal (73%), stomach (62%), and ovarian cancer (47%). NSAID  
effects became apparent after five or more years of use and were stronger with  
longer duration. Observed protective effects were also consistently stronger
for  
gastrointestinal malignancies (esophagus, stomach, and colon). Results for  
pancreatic, urinary bladder, and renal cancer were inconsistent. Initial  
epidemiologic studies of malignant melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, and adult  
leukemia also found that NSAIDs are protective. A few studies suggest that  
ibuprofen has stronger anticancer effects than aspirin, particularly against  
breast and lung cancer. Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and
increased  
prostaglandin biosynthesis correlates with carcinogenesis and metastasis at
most  
anatomic sites. Preclinical investigations provide consistent evidence that
both  
selective and non-selective NSAIDs effectively inhibit chemically-induced  
carcinogenesis of epithelial tumors. This review provides compelling and  
converging evidence that regular intake of NSAIDs that non-selectively block  
COX-2 protects against the development of many types of cancer.

Peat ( Corn general / Q: Is GE corn that bad? ) : Barbara McClintock's work

their genes around, sort of equivalent to internal hybridization. When
something new is added to the genome, it changes the results of the
rearrangement, unpredictably. Since seeds always contain toxins, anyway, a new
allergen probably isn't too important, and the traditional alkali processing

Post 32 Title: Lucy · Feb 6, 2013 at 4:12 PM Author: Lucy Post Content:

This is my correspondence with Peat over the years... my comments are in <>.  
  
***  
  
Regarding intelligence and a big head---the brain is energetically a very
expensive organ in terms of its energy requirements, and the liver has to be
very efficient to meet its needs, so when there is a nutritional or hormonal
problem, the problems can be especially intense. Nutritional needs for sugar,
protein, vitamins, and minerals can be very high.  
  
Lugol's solution is sometimes helpful for an inflammation, but it's risky when
there might be a thyroid problem.  
  
Sometimes [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-
micronized-powder-usp/) can cause an underactive enlarged thyroid gland to
begin secreting, temporarily producing mild hypothyroidism while the gland
returns to a normal size. Supplemental progesterone can reduce excessive
cortisol production.  
  
<autism> I suspect that it's an adaptive reaction to prenatal exposure to
stress. The imbalances of endorphins, serotonin, catecholamines, and other
nerve-regulators that have been seen in autism sometimes can be produced in
adults by combined fatigue and poor nutrition, and when the liver's glycogen
is depleted, it can be hard to restore the balance. Prenatal influences of
different types could damage connectivity, which permitting cells to survive.
Normally, a large proportion of brain cells die before birth, because of
limited availability of glucose.  
  
<can progesterone turn into estrogen or cortisol, or otherwise cause negative
reactions?> Since progesterone helps the thyroid to secrete, and helps the
liver to regulate glucose and convert T4 to T3, women who are low in
progesterone usually have hypothyroid symptoms (because of insufficient T3),
including high cortisol, which promotes the synthesis of estrogen (in several
ways, but never from progesterone). Cortisol is made from progesterone, but
increasing the supply of progesterone reliably lowers cortisol synthesis,
acting on the brain, pituitary, and adrenal glands. Progesterone, by many
mechanisms, including its antagonism to cortisol, lowers the amount of
estrogen in cells (causing the estrogen-binding proteins to be degraded,
inhibiting the enzymes that release estrogen from the sulfates and
glucuronides, and activating the enzymes that detoxify estrogen). So I think
the symptoms of increased estrogen and cortisol are the result of either
extraneous ingredients in the creams, or from using it at the wrong time, for
example, too early, triggering premature ovulation. Supplementing a small
amount of T3, Cytomel or Cynomel, usually stops symptoms such as breast pain,
irritability, and restless energy, in less than an hour.  
  
PCOS can be produced in animals by removing the thyroid gland. The inability
of ovaries to make progesterone without thyroid causes the adrenals to be
overstimulated, and they are the source of increased [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) and
other androgens and estrogen.  
  
<various hormone tests> I don't think saliva hormone tests are reliable. They
are a convenient way to see whether the changes of cortisol during the day
follow the normal pattern, but for judging its adequacy in an absolute sense I
wouldn't pay any attention to them, since the saliva is subject to many
influences that don't have much to do with the blood and other fluids. The
hormones in the urine are mostly glucuronidated or sulfated, and so represent
liver metabolism more than hormonal effects. Total cortisol is good. Some
articles below discuss the problems with the "free hormone" hypothesis.  
  
Usually the low carbohydrate diets have a high ratio of phosphate to calcium,
and I suspect that your present diet does, too. If you powder some eggshells,
that's the best way to supplement it, but two quarts of milk per day would be
best, providing adequate protein and a safe ratio of P to Ca. Seafood,
especially oysters, shrimp, squid, etc., would provide the iodine and [
selenium ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/selenium-liquid/) you need for
good thyroid regulation. Increasing fruits in place of bread would increase
blood sugar stability, and would provide [ vitamin C
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) in a safer
form. Taking your temperature before and after breakfast helps to interpret
your circadian hormone cycle---hypothyroid people often have very high
adrenaline, cortisol, and other stress hormones during the night, causing the
temperature to be higher before breakfast than after. A daily raw carrot often
helps to balance progesterone, cortisol, and estrogen, by improving intestine-
liver functions.  
  
I think it's good to choose foods with a high ratio of calcium to phosphorous.
Supplementing calcium (and often vitamin D is needed too) is usually necessary
with the typical modern diet.  
  
<on my high metabolic rate - very high temps and pulse - which is a result of
low thyroid> About your high metabolic rate and high temperature: In my teens
and twenties, I needed about 8000 calories per day when I was physically
active, about 4000 to 5000 when I was sedentary, but after I took thyroid, I
needed only about half as many calories. Thyroid is the basic regulator of
blood glucose, and it causes it to be fully oxidized for energy, so that it
produces ATP efficiently, on relatively few calories. If blood glucose falls,
because it's being used very quickly, the body responds with stress hormones,
including glucagon, adrenalin, and cortisol. They cause fat and protein to be
burned for energy, while in hypothyroidism, glucose can still be used
inefficiently for glycolysis, producing lactic acid, displacing bicarbonate
and carbon dioxide. This causes mineral imbalances, with effects including
cramps and nerve-muscle tension, which produce heat and waste energy. When you
first start taking thyroid again, your tissues will need some extra magnesium,
during the time when the dose is increasing, and when the mineral balance is
restored your temperature and metabolic rate might decrease a little. Orange
juice, milk, and coffee are good for the main minerals, while salting your
food to taste.  
  
Supplementing thyroid can sometimes reduce the rate of metabolism, by allowing
cells to retain enough magnesium, which stabilizes ATP.  
  
<high stress hormones during the night> Blood sugar falls during the night,
causing inflammatory mediators and adrenalin, etc., to increase. Sleeping with
a wool cap and stockings can help. Having plenty of sugar just before bedtime,
or if you wake during the night, will usually alleviate the night-stress
problems.  
  
<Jefferies and Safe Uses of Cortisol> I don't think his arguments are correct.
The amounts he sometimes prescribed weren't always safe.  
  
<why do people have such different problems due to hypothyroidism?> I think
early life imprinting and habitual diet can cause such very different
reactions to a thyroid deficiency.  
  
<on SNPs that have been linked to autism, chronic fatigue etc. (Yasko)> Yes, a
few slow enzyme systems could make the system easier to disrupt.  
  
The trace impurities in synthetic ascorbic acid can increase free radical
production, and quite a few people have allergic reactions to it. The
situation isn't as clear with citric acid, but I think manufacturing
impurities could account for some of the effects I see. For many years, I have
been seeing more symptoms relieved by stopping all the chemical supplements,
than by using them.  
  
A sauna or hot bath, by increasing your metabolic rate, can quickly deplete
the glycogen in your liver, causing hypoglycemia. If you eat protein without
enough sugar or other carbohydrate it can cause hypoglycemia, too, so it's
important to have lots of orange juice and milk, for frequent snacks.  
  
<on supplementing T3 in large amounts like 100mcg> I have known people who
took that much, but when it's taken in small doses, 50 mcg will usually
normalize any hypothyroid metabolism. The body's total daily production of T3
is close to 100 mcg.  
  
<on studies like this: [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/988872
](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/988872) , suggesting that thyroid
supplementation could increase cancer risk> Two background facts are needed to
interpret the JAMA article. The first is that hypothyroidism is a major cause
of breast cancer, because of the chronic excess of estrogen and deficiency of
progesterone. The second is that US doctors don't correct hypothyroidism,
because they don't prescribe the active hormone T3, only the precursor T4,
which fails to be converted because hypothyroid women's livers aren't
efficient. T3 is needed for the storage of glycogen and the efficient use of
glucose, and glucose is needed to form T3. Therefore, women in the US who "are
treated for hypothyroidism" are still hypothyroid, and hypothyroid women are
much more likely to get cancer.  
  
All of the magnesium supplements that I have tried caused allergy symptoms and
bowel inflammation, but some people don't have a problem with magnesium
carbonate or magnesium glycinate. I think it's best to use the foods with high
magnesium content, and to start the thyroid slowly, allowing the tissues time
to absorb magnesium; the other minerals, Ca, Na, and K, have antistress
effects that spare magnesium.  
  
<on the ratio of T4 to T3, which is sometimes suggested to be wrong in [
natural desiccated thyroid ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-
thyroid-natural-desiccated-thyroid-ndt/) > Pigs' and cows' thyroids are very
similar to people's, with a ratio usually between 3:1 and 4:1. The blood serum
of hypothyroid people can have a ratio of 50:1 or 100:1, when the liver is
failing to convert thyroxin. Maybe the authors of the book are physicians,
educated by pharmaceutical advertisements.  
  
<is the lack of hormones like calcitonin, T2 etc. in synthetic T4/T3 combo a
problem?> The old Armour thyroid, made from beef and pork glands before 1990,
did contain other components that were probably valuable, but when T3 is
absorbed by mitochondria it's immediately changed into T2, so the synthetic
T3's effects can't be distinguished from those of a mixture of T3 and T2. The
company that now makes Armour thyroid started removing the calcitonin in the
1990s, to sell as a separate product.  
  
<treatments for vitiligo> I used a dilute copper solution to restore pigment
to my eyebrows and whiskers, but when the solution was too concentrated it
produced, within a few hours, a raised pigmented area, so I stopped using it
topically. Vitamin D and progesterone favor the survival of pigment cells. I
think a topical solution of [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) and caffeine
might be helpful, and is safe.  
  
<treatments for multiple sclerosis, combined with paranoia in menopause> For
multiple sclerosis, thyroid and progesterone are the most helpful things.
Sometimes a very low thyroid function is compensated by extreme nerve
excitation, leading to mania or paranoia. Their body temperature might be
extremely low, or sometimes the 24 hour cycle is reversed; if the temperature
decreases in the morning, that suggests that the stress hormones were very
high during the night.  
  
From a woman who had multiple sclerosis:  
  
"Since my first brain MRI just over 3 ½ years ago, my subsequent annual MRIs
have not shown any brain lesions and the lesions that had shown up previously
had healed over, so overall I have been doing very well. Last week, my Nuero
and I were going over my latest scans, which were looking great, and she says
that my brain volume looked very good and indeed there was very little white
space between my brain and skull. I reminded her that when I was first
diagnosed she had mentioned that I had some brain atrophy so we pulled up a
previous scan, although I do not know which year she pulled up, and there was
a clear difference between the two. There was more white space on the older
scan. She tried to explain that was probably due to a difference in MRI
techniques. I chose not argue, because what’s the point? Since last fall I
have been using coconut oil, nat. progesterone, pregnelone, daily aspirin and
more recently I have added Great Lakes Gelatin to my diet (not to mention all
of the stuff I now avoid in my diet as well)"  
  
<on LDN treatment> I think it's safe to take 5 or 10 mg of naltrexone daily
for a few days, but I don't think it should be used continuously; I have known
people who had good results, repeating the short courses two or three times in
a year.  
  
Estrogen can cause ovarian cysts to develop, and can contribute to the
development of skin tags and moles. Its effects on the urethra might help with
incontinence, but it can cause problems with the bladder muscle, and cystitis.  
  
<on piracetam> I have heard that the quality of the product from different
countries varies; I think they have preferred the one made in Belgium. It's
possible that it could help with adaptation to a thyroid supplement, but it's
important to use enough thyroid hormone to keep TSH low. Keeping the
cholesterol in the range of 160 to 220 helps with stress, too.  
  
<on severe headaches/migraines caused by supplements> Have you tried a large
oral dose of progesterone? A very large amount of sugar will usually relieve a
migraine; ice cream (about a quart) or milk shakes with some fat and protein
make it easier to assimilate the sugar without stomach upset. Caffeine
sometimes makes the aspirin and sugar more effective. Did any of the magnesium
chloride get on your lips? In my own migraine experience, I found that a very
small amount of either vitamin A or magnesium chloride could cause big
headaches for two or three days. If I had put vitamin A anywhere on my face or
arms, enough would touch my lips to cause the headache. It wasn't the vitamin
A or magnesium itself that did it, but some very powerful allergen in the
chemically manufactured products. It's possible that some such substance has
entered the T3 during its manufacture, so using a different brand might avoid
the effect. What brands of T3 and desiccated have you used? Is cyproheptadine
available where you are? It's probably the safest of the antiserotonin drugs;
here are some articles about it.  
  
Cyproheptadine might be helpful for reducing sensitivity to intestinal
irritants.  
  
<on anti-serotonin drugs> I have known a few people who had very good results
with tianeptine, and a couple who got side effects from it. I think any of the
antiserotonin drugs will eventually cause side effects, and should only be
used until a problem is corrected, for example when an enlarged pituitary is
normalized. I think the same effects can be produced with nutrition and
hormones, without the possible problems.  
  
<can anti-serotonin drugs permanently fix a problem, even if taken only for a
short while?> Yes, but it's important to keep adjusting thyroid and
progesterone according to temperature, pulse, etc.  
  
Thyroid is the best thing for controlling serotonin's effects. The drugs that
act on "receptors" act simultaneously on many things; one effect of some of
them is a selective "agonist" effect on the "receptor" which is involved in
negative feedback, turning off the cells that produce serotonin. Wikipedia is
a function of consensus; according to them, serotonin is a happy hormone, and
there are no conspiracies of government officials and bankers.  
  
<on [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-
powder/) > Where did you get the pregnenolone? It must be better quality than
most of it in the US now. Switzerland used to have the highest quality, that
we got through an Italian company, but US Customs stopped it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post 33 Title: j. · Feb 6, 2013 at 6:47 PM Author: j. Post Content:

Found this [ on the web ](http://onibasu.com/archives/cl/13173.html) . It's
about liver, milk, aluminium pans, and problems with pascalite.  
  
My question: We're finding more and more people who are casein  
intolerant and are unable to tolerate even raw grass fed fermented  
milk. Given the PUFA issues you've mentioned with eggs, if a person  
is unable to include milk in their diet and is minimizing their egg  
intake, will they get enough vitamin A & D from beef liver?  
  
Dr Peat: Yes, beef liver has so much of the oily vitamins that it  
just takes an occasional meal to meet those requirements generously.  
The charts have stopped giving its vitamin E content, and rarely  
mention vitamin K, but it's very good for those. Charts still don't  
reflect the intracellular (lipid soluble dehydro-) form of vitamin  
C, but liver is a good source of that too.  
  
I have been interested in the subject of "milk intolerance" for a  
long time, and have wondered why doctors in the US and England give  
it so much attention, while the people who drink the most milk, in  
the Samburu and Masai cultures, and the cultures of northern India,  
don't seem to have the problem. I doubt that this is a matter of  
genetic differences; for example this person: "I was recently  
diagnosed with lactose intolerance and so i had to eliminated milk  
and milk products from my diet. I live in the USA. However, on a  
recent trip to India, I had milk and all possible milk products  
there and it did not affect me at all! Has anyone else experienced  
this? Or does anyone have a possible explanation?"  
  
[ http://p080.ezboard.com/flima16189frm15 ... D=34.topic
](http://p080.ezboard.com/flima16189frm15.showMessage?topicID=34.topic)  
  
When a woman or a cow eats an allergen, such as peanuts or soybeans,  
the allergens appear in the milk. Weeds in the pasture are another  
potential source of tainted milk. In Africa and India, milk  
production per cow is much lower than in the US, because they seldom  
give them anything but grass, or in India, hay, probably some fruit.  
Although insecticides such as lindane are no longer used in US  
dairies, most of the milk in commerce has synthetic vitamins  
(dissolved in corn oil) emulsified into the product, which could  
account for many of the bad reactions.  
  
____________________  
My question: One of our WAPF researchers looked into the aluminum  
issue associated with bentonite and found that this form of aluminum  
is not bioavailable?that the issue is in "unbound" aluminum such as  
in cookware, drinking water, and antacids (see her comments below).  
We have also heard many healing stories associated with the intake  
of Pascalite clay ( [ http://www.pascalite.com ](http://www.pascalite.com) ),
a calcium bentonite. Do you  
have reason to believe that this should be avoided?  
  
Heidi's comments quoted from GFCFNN:  
"All clay has aluminum in it ... including your crockery and  
glassware. From my understanding of chemistry the clay doesn't `let  
go'of it's aluminum ion, it's very tightly bound in the center of  
some other atoms.  
  
"In fact, what happens is the clay molecule binds to OTHER stuff  
and takes it out of the gut. Clay is used ina lot of industrial  
processes where aluminum contamination would be a very bad thing. It  
is also present in just about every field that has plants growing in  
it: if it was absorbed a lot by the plants you would be eating a lot  
of aluminum in any case. Aluminum is very, very common ... the  
most abundant metal on earth.  
  
"Aluminum is a very active chemical, which is why when it is NOT  
bound to something it can bind to receptors in, say, your brain.  
Which might explain some of the issues with aluminum pans: they are  
pure aluminum which is never seen in nature and it's a LOT of work  
to extract aluminum from rock. (as opposed to, say mercury where  
you just need to heat the ore to get mercury, or iron or lead,  
which occurs in pure form in nature). A pure aluminum pan with acid  
creates free aluminum ions, which want to bond with something, so  
eating aluminum unbound ions isn't a good thing. But clay doesn't  
have unbound aluminum ions (nor does anything else in nature, AFAIK).  
Once it is bound up, aluminum doesn't want to release it's bonds,  
which is why sapphires are so hard (sapphires are also aluminum  
based).  
  
"That said, humans have been eating dirt/clay for eons, both on  
purpose and otherwise. One anomoly of our modern diet is that it is  
sooooo dirt free! In some other cultures there was so much dirt/sand  
in the food that their teeth got ground down. Other cultures dipped  
food in clay or baked and ate it. They cooked in clay pots too, and  
walked on clay roads barefoot, and ate plants growing in clay. So,  
my take is: don't worry about clay unless it has something else in  
it, like lead or arsenic maybe...  
  
"...Aluminum is ubiquitious in the food supply, but most sources of  
it are not bioavailable. A couple of sources ARE bioavailable and  
have caused problems. One I had never thought about much: water!  
Seems they use aluminum to treat city water and there is enough of  
it left in the water to cause problems (and it is bioavailable).  
  
"I didn't see ANY references to clay being a source of aluminum  
toxicity. Antacids and water supplies seem to be the main culprits:  
cookware if acidic foods are cooked in it. But urban water supplies  
seem to be the worst, which is news to me! Again the issue  
is "unbound" aluminum. Good rundowns:

"Drinking water exposure to aluminum and dementia (including AD) In  
four of five critically reviewed epidemiological studies, in which  
AD and (or) dementia was an outcome in relation to aluminum  
concentration in the municipal water supply, the overall OR and (or)  
dose-response gradient were statistically significant, but generally  
low (under 2.0). The studies inevitably underestimated any true  
aluminum exposure effect because of misclassification bias. All of  
the study designs had inherent weaknesses and the results could  
easily be produced by confounding factors. No good evidence for  
alternative hypotheses to explain the results exists. The  
epidemiological evidence indicates that a true association between  
drinking water aluminum concentrations and dementia (including AD)  
cannot be ruled out [ http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic113.htm

"Background: Aluminum is a trivalent cation found in its ionic form  
in most kinds of animal and plant tissues and in natural waters  
everywhere. It is the third most prevalent element and the most  
abundant metal in the earth's crust. Dietary aluminum is ubiquitous,  
but in such small quantities that it is not a significant source of  
concern in persons with normal elimination capacity. Urban water  
supplies may contain a greater concentration because water is usually  
treated with the element before becoming part of the supply.  
Subsequent purification processes that remove organic compounds take  
away many of the same compounds that bind the element in its free  
state, further increasing aluminum concentration.  
  
"All metals can cause disease through excess, deficiency, or  
imbalance. Malabsorption through diarrheal states can result in  
essential metal and trace element deficiencies. Toxic effects are  
dependent upon the amount of metal ingested, entry rate, tissue  
distribution, concentration achieved, and excretion rate. Mechanisms  
of toxicity include inhibition of enzyme activity and protein  
synthesis, alterations in nucleic acid function, and changes in cell  
membrane permeability.

Dr. Peat's response: "Medical" bentonite does often have other  
(toxic) stuff in it, but that wasn't my point. Its silica content is  
an important issue, because of its ability to induce inflammatory  
cytokines, causing systemic effects, but that wasn't my point,  
either. Beginning around 1940, I heard the pitch of the aluminum  
utensil salesmen, that metallic aluminum was instantly covered with  
an insoluble layer of oxide, that made it perfectly safe to cook in.  
By the time I was in high school and college, that commercial  
concept had become part of the standard curriculum. I see the idea  
of Unavailable Aluminum persists, though now it looks as though the  
health food industry has taken over its perpetuation. Coffee isn't  
nearly as acidic as the stomach, but percolating coffee in an  
aluminum pot solubulizes very toxic quantities of aluminum, despite  
the "protective" oxide layer, and despite the surface area which is  
so much smaller than that of the microscopic particles in clay.  
Since clay eating is usually considered to be an obsolete form of  
pica suffered by starving or malnourished people, the toxicity of  
bentonite hasn't been a big research topic for biologists, but the  
principles of inorganic chemistry apply to the stomach and  
intestine, as well as to geology and mineralogy. It does dissolve in  
hydrochloric acid, and then there are various chelating compounds  
produced by bacteria in the intestine, that help to solublize it.  
But the aluminum toxicity of clay wasn't my main point, either--I  
just picked two random Standard Process products, with bean juice  
and clay, to explain why I don't pay any attention to anything that  
their marketers might say. Advertising is a dangerous cultural toxin.

Abstract: The rate of acid dissolution in HCl is a common method for  
differentiating various phases of Fe in clay samples. A readily  
soluble Fe phase, denoted herein as the RS phase, is often observed  
in bentonite, but its identity has yet to be established. Seven  
Czech bentonites were studied by acid dissolution in 6 M HCl and by  
Mössbauer spectroscopy. A highly-soluble Fe phase was found in the  
<2-µm fractions of all seven Czech bentonites, ranging from 15 % to  
67 % of total Fe. In all seven samples, Mössbauer spectroscopy  
revealed a goethite phase; in six, the goethite phase correlated  
well with the amount of RS Fe. In the seventh sample, Hroznetin, Fe  
(II) identified by both chemical analysis (phenanthroline method)  
and Mössbauer spectroscopy was the main source of RS Fe.

My question (1st thread): Why would the test by Standard Process (a  
company independent of the manufacturer of Blue Ice) not be  
sufficient data to say that the Blue Ice CLO is safe?  
  
Dr. Peat: Their opinion about the safety of anything wouldn't be of  
interest to me, because I have seen their advertisements for years.  
(A couple of their product labels are quoted below. That sort of  
thing doesn't testify to their good judgment.)  
  
(Standard Process products:)  
Albaplex® The kidneys form urine from blood plasma. As blood passes  
through the kidney, water and waste substances are filtered through  
the capillary walls. Albaplex helps support proper kidney function.  
? Content - Product No. 40 Capsules 0900 150 Capsules 0925  
Suggested Use: Two capsules per meal, or as directed.  
Proprietary Blend: 940 mg Choline bitartrate, dried kidney (bean) juice, oat

Cholacol II®  
Cholacol II is a source of bentonite. Its adsorbent properties cause  
bentonite to function like a magnet, where waste materials adhere to  
its surface and are carried away for elimination. The bentonite in  
Cholacol II works to cleanse the intestinal tract via the adsorptive process.  
Suggested Use: Four tablets ? 15 minutes before each meal, or as directed.  
Proprietary Blend: 1,954 mg Bentonite (montmorillinite), collinsonia (root),
and purified bovine  
bile salts.  
My question: What did you have in mind here in terms of Standard Process's
poor judgment?  
  
Dr. Peat: Over the years, they have tried to give their customers  
the impression that their vitamins are different from other  
vitamins, that various "natural" products have certain special  
effects on the body, and generally little concern for the relevant  
facts. The examples I quoted are just two of many that are currently  
advertised, but they aren't unrepresentative of their past  
practices. The second ingredient in the kidney formula was  
really "kidney (bean) juice." It reminds me of "supporting the  
kidneys" by using a girdle. And bentonite, even if it came from a  
clean geological source, doesn't function like a magnet, it's  
aluminum silicate, and any that dissolves in the stomach or  
intestine is going to increase the body's aluminum burden.  
My question (2nd thread to original comment above): I'm not sure I  
understood what you meant in your comparison of grass fed beef liver  
and egg yolks to CLO. Do you mean because they're all high in  
natural A & D, you would assume the beef liver and egg yolk are  
safer until you see a study comparing their toxin levels with the  
toxin levels in CLO?  
  
Dr. Peat: That, and because they, like milk, provide useful amounts  
of all the essential nutrients, including vitamins K and E. Oily  
fish products tend to increase our need for vitamin E.  
My question (3rd thread from original comment above): You mentioned  
toxins in the livers of Japanese people. Are studies showing their  
toxin levels are proportionately higher than other populations?  
  
Dr. Peat: Not all studies show that they have uniquely high levels  
of contaminants, but there is general agreement that the level of  
contaminant corresponds to the amount of fish consumed, and their  
average consumption is high. The amount of fish in the Japanese diet  
has decreased in the last 35 years, because of their awareness of  
contamination, while fish intake in some other countries has  
increased.

Psychology Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202.  
Two hundred thirty-six children from two established cohorts at risk  
for exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and related  
contaminants were evaluated at age 4 years. Prenatal exposure (assessed by
cord serum  
PCB level) was associated with lower weight, an effect consistent with reports  
of growth retardation in laboratory rats and in children exposed at high  
levels in Taiwan and at general population levels in Japan. The highest
exposed  
children weighed 1.8 kg less on the average than the least exposed.
Contemporary body  
burden (assessed by 4-year serum PCB level) was associated with reduced  
activity based on composite ratings provided by the child's mother and two  
independent examiners. This effect, attributable to lactation exposure, was  
strongest among the offspring of women with above average milk PCB levels who
breast  
fed for at least 1 year. While the weight deficit is consistent with previous  
data linking developmental effects of low-dose human PCB exposures
specifically  
to the prenatal period, activity is the first domain found to be affected  
by lactation at contemporary levels of exposure.

Determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polybrominated

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been widely used as  
flame retardants in plastics and textile coatings, and these compounds have
been  
recognized as ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Furthermore, it is
considered  
a serious problem that polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans  
(PBDD/DFs), having toxicities similar to those of chlorinated dioxins, are  
generated by the manufacture of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) such as
PBDEs, and  
formed by the combustion of substances containing BFRs. Several congeners of  
PBDD/DFs and PBDEs have been detected in the adipose tissue of the Japanese.  
Although food is suspected as an exposure source, little information is
available  
regarding the levels of these brominated compounds in food, as compared with  
information regarding dioxin or polychlorinated biphenyls. It is necessary to  
investigate the levels of these brominated organic compounds in various foods  
and to estimate their influence in the case of human exposure. We developed  
an efficient method of analyzing PBDEs and PBDD/DFs contents in food  
samples using accelerated solvent extraction and determined the concentrations
in  
several marine products such as raw fish, processed foods, and seaweed  
purchased in Japan. A recovery test (n = 5) using the method and involving
dried  
fish showed acceptable recoveries of 57.7-78.5% (RSD 5.4-15.9%) for PBDEs and  
50.0-56.4% (RSD 1.5-7.9%) for PBDD/DFs. In the analysis of marine product  
samples, several congeners of PBDEs were detected in raw fish, processed fish,
and  
seaweed; the highest concentration of sigmaPBDEs was detected in yellowtail
(1161  
pg/g whole basis), followed by mackerel (553.5 pg/g whole basis). The most  
dominant congener present in these marine samples was 2,2',4,4'-tetraBDE  
(#47).

The major source of dioxin impurities in Japan in the past was agrochemical  
formulations; more recently, it has been exhaust from waste incinerators. To  
examine the environmental and genetic factors that influence blooddioxin  
concentration, we investigated the relationship among dioxin concentrations,  
dietary habits and cytochorome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) polymorphisms (MspI  
type and Ile-Val type) in Japanese fishermen and farmers, including also a  
group of office workers as controls. The mean dioxin concentrations in the  
fishermen, the farmers and the controls were 161369, 79079 and 100500 pg/g
fat,  
respectively.  
The elevated dioxin concentration with polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins,  
polychlorinated dibenzofurans and coplanar-PCBs found in the fishermen may be  
due to the frequent consumption of fish; no such relationship was found both
in  
the farmers and the controls. We found that the concentrations of congeners  
found as impurities in certain chemicals such as those previously used in  
agriculture showed no significant differences among the three groups; we  
consider it unlikely that the farmers would be directly exposed to dioxins
from  
such chemicals. Thus, it is probable that the primary route of dioxin exposure  
in the Japanese population is through the food chain via fish consumption,  
regardless of occupation. No meaningful relationship between blood dioxin  
concentration and CYP1A1 polymorphisms was found in this study, although there  
was a significant difference between the concentration of total non-ortho-PCBs  
in genotypes A and B. Further studies on more subjects, including those of  
genotype C, are needed to confirm the relationship between blood dioxin  
concentrations and MspI polymorphisms.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate background exposure levels and determinants of the  
individual variations in the exposure to dioxins in Japan.  
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 131 men and 122 women (aged  
20-76 years), who resided in five prefectures of Japan and had no occupational  
exposure to dioxins. Seven polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), ten  
polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDFs) and 12 polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs),  
which are assigned a toxicity equivalent factor, were determined in fasting  
blood. Biochemical analysis of plasma and a questionnaire survey on life-
style,  
including dietary habit, were also performed. Factors associated with the
levels  
of dioxin-related compounds in blood were evaluated by multiple linear
regression.  
RESULTS: The median of total toxicity equivalents (TEQs) in men and  
women was 17 and 16 pg TEQ/g lipid, respectively, with no genderdifference.  
After adjustment for age and other covariates, plasma concentrations of  
eicosapentaenoic acid, a biomarker of fish intake, were found to be positively  
associated with blood levels of total dioxin, PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs,all of  
which were expressed on a TEQ basis (P<0.01). The frequency of intake of
coastal  
fish, such as horse mackerel, mackerel and sardine, was also associated with  
TEQ-based concentrations of PCDFs (P=0.03) and PCBs (P=0.08). The  
intake of raw fish was positively related to total dioxins (P=0.06) and PCBs  
(P=0.03).  
CONCLUSIONS: The level of intake of marine fish, especially raw fish  
and coastal varieties, may be associated with increased blood levels of
dioxin-  
related compounds among the population. Despite high fish consumption in  
Japan, the body burden of dioxins in the population was not found to be higher
than  
that in western countries.

From 1998 to 2000, the dioxin levels were measured in the milk of 299 mothers  
who lived in Saitama prefecture, Japan. Factors that influenced the dioxin  
levels were investigated based on a questionnaire given to the milk donors at  
that time. It was found that the dioxin levels in the milk of the mothers who  
smoked were lower than those of non-smokers, and the dioxin levels were  
generally low in the mothers who were heavy smokers. The average dioxin levels  
in the milk of mothers who had been breast-fed were higher than those given  
formula, and there was a significant difference in the dioxin congeners. It
was  
also found that the dioxin levels in milk of the women who regularly consumed  
fish and shellfish were generally higher. There was a strong correlation
between  
summation operator TEQ and PCB126. The data suggested that PCB126  
could be a useful indicator for the simplified analysis of dioxin in human
milk.

[Annual daily intakes of Hg, PCB and arsenic from fish and shellfish and  
comparative survey of their residue levels in fish by body weight]  
[Article in Japanese]  
Ikarashi A, Sasaki K, Toyoda M, Saito Y.  
We have been surveying toxic substances in food and foodstuffs and carrying
out  
a total diet study on the intakes of various substances since 1979 in
cooperation with local public institutes in Japan. In this paper, we report
the daily intakes of mercury, PCB and arsenic from foods, and the relation
between the concentrations of these substance in fish and the fish body
weight. The intakes of mercury and arsenic were 6.9-11.0 micrograms/ man/day
and 120-230 micrograms/man/day, respectively. The intakes of these substances
remained on a stable level from 1979 to 1994. On the other hand, the intake of
PCB decreased from 3.1 micrograms/man/day in 1979 to 0.9 microgram/man/day in
1994. Most of  
the intakes of mercury, PCB and arsenic were derived from the diet group "fish
and shellfish". The level of mercury in fish increased with increasing fish
body weight. For PCB and arsenic, there was no correlation between these
concentrations in fish and the fish body weight, except that mackerel and
croaker show a higher concentration of PCB when they are small. Arsenic shows
almost a constant level in each fish regardless of their body weight.

Can epidemiological studies discern subtle neurological effects due to
perinatal exposure to PCBs?  
Seegal RF.  
Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research, New York State Department of  
Health, Albany 12201-0509, USA.  
What conclusions can be drawn concerning the potential neurological effects of  
perinatal exposure to either PCBs, or PCBs and other fish-borne contaminants?  
First, by their very nature epidemiological studies are limited in their
ability  
to detect subtle associations--including possible links between exposure to
low  
levels of environmental contaminants and disease. As stated by Dr. Schantz,
both  
Rogan and the Jacobsons report small changes in motor and cognitive  
behavior--typically less than one-half of a standard deviation--and only in
the  
most highly exposed children. Given these small changes in CNS function, the  
substantive criticisms of Paneth (including the Jacobsons' choice to employ a  
random, rather than matched, control sample and the related fact that  
fish-eating mothers differed from non-fish-eating mothers on several important  
characteristics) and similar "generic" concerns raised by Taubes, a critical  
reader must question both the validity of the findings from the Michigan study  
and the reasons for discrepancies in results between the Jacobson and Rogan  
studies. Are the differences in neurobehavioral effects reported by the  
Jacobsons and colleagues, and Rogan and colleagues, due to the presence of  
confounders, exposure to different neurotoxicants, or subtle differences in  
methodologies? At present it is not possible to answer these questions.  
Nevertheless, certain commonalities exist between the Rogan and Jacobson  
studies, and most recently, the study conducted by Daly and colleagues in New  
York. All of these studies report alterations in the Brazelton Neonatal  
Behavioral Assessment Scale, suggesting that exposure to environmental  
contaminants (including PCBs) may induce subtle, transient alterations in  
maturation of the human CNS. Secondly, because contaminated fish  
contain a large number of putative developmental neurotoxicants (e.g., methyl-  
mercury, p,p'-DDE, PCBs, and pesticides), I am pessimistic that additional
studies of  
human populations exposed to contaminated aquatic and marine fish and  
mammals will allow investigators to determine which contaminant(s) may be  
responsible for the observed association between fish consumption and
neurobehavioral  
deficits. For example, although PCB body burdens have been measured in the  
majority of the epidemiological studies, PCBs may simply reflect exposure to
other  
fish-borne contaminants. In light of the above statements, future
epidemiological studies  
should focus on highly exposed susceptible populations such as occupationally  
exposed workers or the aged. Results from these studies would provide
important  
information on the risk of perinatal or adult exposure to PCBs in susceptible  
populations, although generalization of results obtained in these populations
to  
the general population may be fraught with difficulties. Finally, because of
the  
limitations of epidemiological studies, particularly those studying fish-
eating  
populations, future risk assessments should depend more heavily on laboratory  
derived data, including studies in nonhuman primates exposed to
environmentally  
relevant mixtures and relevant doses of PCB congeners and other known or  
suspected neurotoxicants.

The contamination profiles of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) such as  
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), biphenyls (PBBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins  
(PBDDs), and dibenzofurans (PBDFs) were determined in the liver and egg of  
common cormorants from Japan. PBDEs and PBBs were detected in all the samples;  
especially the former were detected at elevated levels. PBDDs/PBDFs were also  
detected in cormorants, albeit the concentrations were lower than those of the  
PBBs. The total concentration of PBDEs ranged from 330 to 2600 in the liver
and  
from 600 to 3300 in the egg on a nanogram per gram of lipid basis.  
The concentration of PBBs was in the range from 3.0 to 33 (in the liver)  
and from 3.4 to 82 (in the egg) on a nanogram per gram of lipid basis. The  
2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) was the most predominant  
PBB congener in either organ, which corresponds to a major constituent of the
BFR  
FireMaster BP-6. Concentrations of PBDDs/ PBDFs in the liver (range from 21 to  
470) were slightly higher than in the egg (range from 31 to 160) on a picogram  
per gram of lipid basis. The results of this study imply that common
cormorants  
accumulate a high level of PBDEs and PBBs. Comparing the concentrations of  
brominated organic compounds with those of chlorinated analogues, good
relevance  
between PBBs and coplanar PCBs (r2 = 0.746 [liver] and 0.715 [egg]) was
elucidated.  
To our knowledge, the present study demonstrates the first report of PBDEs,  
PBBs, and PBDDs/PBDFs in the common cormorant from Japan.

The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs),
polychlorinated  
dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (non-ortho PCBs),
and  
mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (mono-ortho PCBs) in Japanese flounder  
(Paralichthys olivaceus, body length 10.4-36.6 cm) collected from Sendai Bay,  
Japan, were determined using high-resolution gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry. The relationship between the concentrations of these compounds
(dioxins) and the body length of the Japanese flounder was examined.  
The total PCDD and total PCDF concentrations did not correlate with body  
length (both r(2) < 0.1, both p > 0.05), whereas the total non-ortho PCB and
total  
mono-ortho PCB (coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls, Co-PCBs) concentrations
were  
significantly correlated (r(2)= 0.8, p < 0.05 and r(2)= 0.63, p < 0.05,  
respectively). The bioaccumulation properties of PCDD/Fs in Japanese  
flounder differed from those of Co-PCBs. Toxicity equivalency  
quotient (TEQ) values derived from the Co-PCBs made up 46.3%-63.7% of the
total TEQ value for all the dioxins. Although the concentrations of non-ortho
PCBs were lower than those  
of mono-ortho PCBs, the TEQ value for non-ortho PCBs was higher than that for
mono-ortho PCBs. The TEQ value for non-ortho PCBs increased more with
increasing body length  
than did the values for PCDDs, PCDFs, and mono-ortho PCBs. These  
results show that from the standpoint of risk management, non-ortho  
Co-PCBs are the most important of the dioxins in Japanese flounder.

More from onibasu.com, on PUFA essentiality:  
  
I took some of our discussion and asked ray directly to clarify some  
of this. Here is what he told me verbatim.  
I don't think I could have said "reduces the need for efa," because I  
don't know of any need; some people have probably paraphrased my argument.  
  
I think the issue is just one of propaganda analysis, because  
scientifically, no one ever refuted the refutation of essentiality  
which occurred when the "EFA deficiency syndrome" was cured with vitamin  
B6. The German demonstration that spontaneous cancer was eliminated on a fat  
free diet preceded the really awful, incompetent study that supposedly  
demonstrated the essentiality of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and in  
the 75 years since the German study a tremendous amount of information has  
accumulated showing both the toxicity and the non-essentiality of the  
polyunsaturated fatty acids. But there has been no financial support  
for publicizing the protective effect of not eating vegetable oils or fish  
oils. To the contrary, vast amounts of money are being spent in the  
promotion of the various polyunsaturated fats as foods.  
  
The animals that don't eat them do have increased nutritional needs  
for vitamins and minerals, because their metabolic rate is so much  
greater than the PUFA-replete animals whose cardiolipin has degenerated. The
recent  
Stanford study that shows a much greater longevity for old people who  
have a very high oxygen consumption capacity is consistent with the  
historical animal studies. PUFA-deprived animals have a very high oxygen  
consumption, and are resistant to practically all causes of death and disease,  
including trauma and poisoning.  
  
The editorial boards of many of the journals are packed with industry  
flacks who are apparently willing to publish any junk that helps to  
sell soy oil, canola, waste fish oil, or algal oils. And researchers have  
to get grants to stay in business.

Docosahexaenoic acid ingestion inhibits natural killer cell activity  
and production of inflammatory mediators in young healthy men.  
Kelley DS, Taylor PC, Nelson GJ, Schmidt PC, Ferretti A, Erickson KL,  
Yu R,bChandra RK, Mackey BE.  
USDA, ARS, Western Human Nutrition Research Center, Presidio of San  
Francisco, California 94129, USA. Dkelley  
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of feeding  
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as triacylglycerol on the fatty acid composition,  
eicosanoid production, and select activities of human peripheral blood  
mononuclear cells  
(PBMNC). A 120-d study with 11 healthy men was conducted at the  
Metabolic Research Unit of Western Human Nutrition Reach Center. Four subjects  
(control group) were fed the stabilization diet throughout the study; the  
remaining seven subjects were fed the basal diet for the first 30 d, followed
by 6 g  
DHA/d for the next 90 d. DHA replaced an equivalent amount of linoleic acid;  
the two diets were comparable in their total fat and all other nutrients. Both  
diets were supplemented with 20 mg D alpha-tocopherol acetate per day. PBMNC  
fatty acid composition and eicosanoid production were examined on day 30 and  
113; immune cell functions were tested on day 22, 30, 78, 85, 106, and 113.
DHA  
feeding increased its concentration from 2.3 to 7.4 wt% in the PBMNC total  
lipids, and decreased arachidonic acid concentration from 19.8 to 10.7 wt%. It  
also lowered prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production, in  
response to lipopolysaccharide, by 60-75%. Natural killer cell activity and in  
vitro secretion of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha were  
significantly reduced by DHA feeding. These parameters remained  
unchanged in the subjects fed the control diet. B-cell functions as reported
here and  
T-cell functions that we reported previously were not altered by DHA  
feeding. Our results show that inhibitory effects of DHA on immune cell
functions  
varied with the cell type, and that the inhibitory effects are not mediated  
through increased production of PGE2 and LTB4.

Escherichia coli produces linoleic acid during late stationary phase.

North Carolina 27710.  
Escherichia coli produces linoleic acid in the late stationary phase.  
This was the case whether the cultures were grown aerobically or anaerobically  
on a supplemented glucose-salts medium. The linoleic acid was detected by  
thin-layer chromatography and was measured as the methyl ester by gas  
chromatography. The linoleic acid methyl ester was identified by its mass
spectrum. Lipids  
extracted from late-stationary-phase cells generated thiobarbituric acid-  
reactive carbonyl products when incubated with a free radical initiator. In
contrast,  
extracts from log-phase or early-stationary-phase cells failed to do so, in  
accordance with the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid only in the  
stationary-phase cells.

Effect of dietary linoleate content on the metabolic response of rats  
to Escherichia coli endotoxin.  
Wan JM, Grimble RF.  
Dietary fat influences many aspects of immune function. Escherichia  
coli endotoxin is a potent stimulator of interleukin 1 production from  
macrophages.  
The present study examines the effect of feeding with fat diets rich  
(corn oil) and poor (coconut oil) in linoleate at high and low concentrations
on  
responses to endotoxin. Spleen phosphatidylcholine linoleate contents were  
higher in the corn oil than in the coconut oil group and arachidonate  
concentrations were highest in the group fed a high concentration of corn oil.
Coconut oil  
completely abolished the responses to endotoxin. The inhibitory  
effects of coconut oil could largely be due to reduced prostaglandin and  
leukotriene synthesis.

Toxicity of DMPS and DMSA  
  
Question: Does the body quickly or gradually get rid of DMPS or DMSA  
chelating agents? I have many people who nearly died when they took  
DMPS or DMSA. But, I should think that the body would eventually  
detox it. What do you think?  
  
Dr. Ray Peatâ??s comment:  
  
The idea of using it to remove metals is that it leaves the body  
rapidly. The damage produced by moving the metals around could be  
fairly permanent, but the chelator leaves very quickly. Environmental  
pollutants, food fats, and cosmetics are the things people should  
worry about accumulating in their tissues.

About the "meat cult", and why liver tastes so terrible.  
  
"In the US, there is a widespread meat cult, that insists meat  
should be stored for two weeks before it's sold; it's convenient for  
the corporations that want everything to have an indefinitely long  
shelf-life, but it's bad for the public health. 150 years ago, when  
refrigeration was rare, the 'high' flavor of meat was considered to  
be good, and people who were used to eating the half rotten stuff  
shaped the meat culture, and people looked for a 'scientific'  
rationale for keeping meat in storage until it lost its fresh taste.  
The rationale is that it becomes tender, as the enzymes cause the  
meat to digest itself. That process starts after the glucose and  
glycogen in the muscle have been depleted, and the [ collagen
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-beef-grass-fed/) and  
other proteins begin to be degraded. Besides losing the amino acid  
balance of fresh meat, the products include the cancer-promoting  
polyamines. Liver contains far more of the self-digesting enzymes  
than muscles do, and its glycogen is depleted in just a few hours.  
This is why liver in the US tastes so terrible. Since liver and eggs  
contain many of the same essential nutrients in high concentration,  
and eggs don't digest themselves, that's why I eat a few eggs in the  
US, despite their known high content of PUFA. When I can avoid the  
PUFA, I do; and in Mexico, liver and other meats aren't stored,  
except maybe in the supermarkets that serve foreigners."

Cortisol/Cortisone_ Dr. Ray Peat  
  
Question: Have very hypothyroid friend who says she has low cortisol  
because her pituitary doesn't work. She says the low cortisol was  
confirmed by saliva and blood tests.  
  
Ray Peat: Addison's disease, with adrenal cortex degeneration, can  
cause cortisol deficiency, in which case [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) would  
compensate, but doctors often tell people they "don't have enough  
cortisol" without proper confirmation.  
  
Question: Would [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) correct this?  
  
Peat: Pregnenolone should usually do it, but progesterone is more  
certain if the adrenals are really destroyed.  
  
Question: What do you think of using Cortef?  
  
Peat: I think William Jefferies' book created a lot of interest in  
that. Since ACTH can interfere with ovarian function, cortisol can  
sometimes help the ovaries to make progesterone, by suppressing ACTH.  
But I knew people who followed his prescription and got Cushing's  
symptoms. Pregnenolone is something that can always be used with  
thyroid, to guarantee an easy adrenal response.  
  
Cortisol vs Cortisone vs Cortef  
  
Cortisol works in the body although the body can convert cortisol to  
cortisone. Synthetic cortisol-like drugs, such as prednisone are more  
like cortisol. Also, hydrocortisone is a drug that acts like  
cortisol. The body makes 20 mg of cortisol daily. Taking 10 mg of  
prednisone is equivalent to about 50 mg of cortisol or 2.5 times the  
daily amount made in-vitro. Cortef is Hydrocortisone which acts like  
cortisol.  
  
Cortisol and weak adrenals  
  
Cortisol is a little more water soluble than progesterone, and a  
diurnal cycle can be seen in the saliva, but the absolute amounts  
aren't as meaningful as in the serum. Thyroid is needed for the  
adrenals to function  
well, and adequate cholesterol, as raw material. It's popular to talk  
about "weak adrenals," but the adrenal cortex regenerates very well.  
Animal experimenters can make animals that lack the adrenal medulla by  
scooping out everything inside the adrenal capsule, and the remaining  
cells quickly regenerate the steroid producing tissues, the cortex. So  
I think the "low adrenal" people are simply low thyroid, or deficient  
in cholesterol or nutrients.  
  
Question: If prednisone suppresses adrenal function, how does it  
cause diabetes? This guy's diabetes is out of control. He is  
spilling lots of sugar in his urine. So the cortisone isn't fixing  
him at all. Do you think it would be possible to get him off the  
cortisone, insulin and testosterone?  
  
Peat: The doses they prescribe as "replacement" are much more than  
the adrenals would produce, so they in themselves are diabetogenic.  
William Jefferies told people that, since the adrenals produce 20 mg  
of cortisol per day, they should take 30 or 40 mg, as a replacement  
dose, because only half of it is absorbed. They got fat faces quickly.  
Using pregnenolone, they were able to taper off the cortisol in a  
month or two.

Very curious to hear your thoughts on the use of synthetic T2 therapeutically.
I have read that it can be even more effective at raising the metabolic rate

The products I've seen are 150mcg per capsule, which seems quite high to me.

Background: I pace back and forth due to worry, nerve on my bottom of my foot
got swollen, PAIN. Dr. Peat recommended Benadryl cream - all pain went away,
was able to get some sleep. Pain came back, but less, just put more cream,
then it went. Finally all pain is gone. Foot is good. Told Dr. Peat I am
thinking about taking Cetirizine for overall health.

Context for his reply  
  
Childhood:  
  
1\. Chronic nosebleeds - around 10-12 yrs old had nose cauterized and this I
think stopped them.  
2\. Chronic sore throat - had pediatrician who was against removing tonsils so
was given antibiotics on a regular basis - it was always penicillin as I
recall.  
3\. Mother diagnosed in her 40s as hyperthyroid, was on radioactive iodine
ever since.  
  
Teen/Adult:  
  
4\. yo yo dieting from late teens/early adulthood onward. Weight up and down
and then ongoing weight gain around the late 30s. Tried every diet in
existence. Bought fully into false notion that sugar was the worst thing one
could eat. Did entire low carb gambit atkins/paleo/zone/protein power, plus
raw vegan, green smoothies, vegetarian, weight watchers, Nutrisystem, probably
many more. Could never successfully quit sugar.  
  
5\. Infertility, (unexplained in me, definite in partner) - took powerful
infertility drugs over the course of 4 years - about 6 treatments - had 2
miscarriages, 2 nothing and 2 children. Drugs taken were first, clomid and
then Fertinorm HP (urofollitropin).  
  
6\. In early 30s, diagnosed with major depression, SAD, dysthymia, post
traumatic stress disorder. Took SSRI meds (zoloft) for only a short time
thankfully. Also self medicated with 5HTP, tryptophan and St. John's Wort but
not long term nor to any significant degree.  
  
7\. Diagnosed and treated (laser surgery) for cervical dysplasia in late
20s/early 30s  
  
Current:  
  
8\. Extreme fatigue and brain fog (fog sometimes lifts, thankfully).
Depressed, lacking motivation and lethargic at times. But also periods of
motivation and activity.  
  
9\. Extreme, sudden onset insomnia in the last 2-3 weeks.  
  
10\. Perimenopausal. Menses had become extremely heavy. Began using Project E
only a few days before the last period and it was normal (even less that
normal) and of shorter duration. Big wow there.  
  
11\. Racing heartbeat at times. Pulse high (often over 100) and temps low,
usually in 96s/97s - been as low as 95s...only rarely in the 98s.  
  
12\. Severe neck pain - left side. Diagnosed with degenerated disc disease in
neck in 30s. Debilitating pain for years that went away suddenly but returned
in recent years. Severe nerve pain when pressing on left side of neck.  
  
13\. Overweight with weight gain increasing particularly as menopausal
symptoms increase.  
  
14\. Sudden and rapid deterioration of eyesight in last 2 months.  
  
15\. Severe skin itching

Here is a response I got when I asked Ray Peat about replacing root canals and
if x-rays should be avoided when getting root canals replaced :  
  
"There's normally no need to replace root canals, and x-rays aren't necessary
even when having a root canal done if the dentist is very competent. The
Japanese are probably more aware than Americans of the damage done by
diagnositic x-rays. Systemic toxic effects have been demonstrated from a
single set of dental x-rays.

[Factors impacting public acceptance of medical radiation exposure]  
[Article in Japanese]  
Tsuji S, Kanda R.  
Regulatory Sciences Research Group, Research Center for Radiation Protection,  
National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan.  
We undertook a survey to determine the public acceptance of medical radiation  
exposure throughout Japan, and 1,357 responses (67.9% response rate) were  
obtained using a two-stage systematic stratified random sampling method. The  
acceptance of exposure of children was generally similar to that of adults.
For  
each of the attributes, 45-60% of the participants were accepting of exposure
for  
cancer treatment and diagnosis, but only 30% were accepting of exposure for
X-ray  
diagnoses of bone fractures and dental caries. In general, the presence of a  
child did not markedly affect women's acceptance of exposure. Factor analyses  
identified 3 factors influencing the acceptance of child exposure: symptomatic  
diseases to determine treatment, the possibility of high-risk diseases (or
major  
organ diseases), and the association with cancer. Cluster analysis showed 4  
clusters: a positive group regarding children's exposure for the diagnosis of  
bone fractures and dental caries (12.9% of all participants), a positive group  
for major organ disease and cancer (15.5%), a negative group excluding cancer  
(55.2%), and a positive group for all cases (16.4%). The cluster distributions  
revealed that mothers with 10-to 18-year-old firstborn children showed a
tendency  
to accept the medical radiation exposure of their children in all cases.

The influence of different irradiation doses and desensitizer application on

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different
irradiation  
doses after desensitizer application on the onset of initial demineralization
of  
human dentin in situ. The root surfaces of 45 freshly extracted caries-free
human  
molars were cleaned, thereby removing the cementum. From each tooth two root  
dentin specimens were prepared. The specimens were distributed among the  
following experimental groups: 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5Gy. The irradiation dose was  
fractionally applied (0.5Gy/day). One dentin specimen of each group was
inserted  
into both buccal aspects of nine intraoral mandibular appliances. On one side
the  
specimens were additionally coated with the desensitizer Hyposen (H). On the  
other side, the specimens were left untreated (C). The appliances were worn by  
nine persons for five weeks day and night. During meals, the appliance was
stored  
in 10% sucrose solution. After the in situ period, slabs (150microm) were
ground  
and studied using a polarized light microscope. Concerning radiation dose,  
significant differences were observed between the control and 5Gy group
(p<0.05,  
Tukey s test). Pairwise comparison showed that lesion depths in groups treated  
with Hyposen were significantly decreased. Within the limitations of this
study  
it can be concluded that higher radiation doses seem to increase the caries  
susceptibility of dentin. The additional application of a desensitizer hampers  
the demineralization and might have a caries-protective effect on exposed  
irradiated root surfaces.

Effect of tumor therapeutic irradiation on the mechanical properties of teeth

[ wolfgang.fraenzel@physik.uni-halle.de ](mailto:wolfgang.fraenzel@physik.uni-

Tumor irradiation of the head-neck area is accompanied by the development of a  
so-called radiation caries in the treated patients. In spite of conservative  
therapeutic measures, the process results in tooth destruction. The present
study  
investigated the effects of irradiation on the demineralization and  
remineralization of the dental tissue. For this purpose, retained third molars  
were prepared and assigned either to a test group, which was exposed to  
fractional irradiation up to 60 Gy, or to a non-irradiated control group.  
Irradiated and non-irradiated teeth were then demineralized using acidic  
hydroxyl-cellulose gel; afterwards the teeth were remineralized using either  
Bifluorid12 or elmex gelee. The nanoindentation technique was used to measure
the  
mechanical properties, hardness and elasticity, of the teeth in each of the  
conditions. The values were compared to the non-irradiated control group.  
Irradiation decreased dramatically the mechanical parameters of enamel and  
dentine. In nonirradiated teeth, demineralization had nearly the same effects
of  
irradiation on the mechanical properties. In irradiated teeth, the effects of  
demineralization were negligible in comparison to non-irradiated teeth.  
Remineralization with Bifluorid12 or elmex gelee led to a partial improvement
of  
the mechanical properties of the teeth. The enamel was more positively
affected  
by remineralization than the dentine.

Patients with xerostomia are presenting dental practitioners with challenges
in

cases, extraction may be the best option, but for younger, dentate patients,
this  
may be inappropriate. This paper describes the management of a young partially  
dentate patient with severe xerostomia following irradiation of the salivary  
glands. Preventive and restorative management are discussed, together with  
treatment and healing of peri-radicular pathology. The case report
demonstrates  
that long-term stabilization and management of caries and peri-radicular
lesions  
are possible over a seven-year period for a patient with severe radiation

Radiation-related caries is a unique form of rampant decay and is a
complication  
of head and neck radiotherapy that frequently causes generalized dental  
destruction and impairs quality of life in cancer patients. The aim of this
study  
was to investigate the patterns of demineralization of caries in irradiated  
patients and to establish whether direct radiogenic damage to the dentition
might  
be important in the progression of radiation-related caries. Teeth from
patients  
who had concluded radiotherapy were examined histologically by polarized light  
microscopy, and the ultrastructure was examined by scanning backscattered  
electron microscopy. Cervical caries and incisal caries, a very unusual sort
of  
lesion, were widely detected. Additionally, diffuse brown discoloration of the  
smooth surface of enamel was frequently observed. Polarized light microscopy  
suggested that these areas were incipient caries. Evidence of normal
odontoblast  
function was observed in the detection of reactionary dentin and intratubular  
dentin deposition. In conclusion, radiation-related caries seems to have the
same  
morphological and demineralization pattern as ordinary caries, with the
presence  
of demineralized dentin, a translucent zone, dentin dead tracts, reactionary  
dentin and intratubular dentin deposition. Based on these findings, direct  
radiogenic destruction of the teeth seems to be not essential to the
microscopic  
progression of radiation-related caries. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel."  
  
And when I asked him about mercury leaching from root canals continuously and
replacing it with a metal / mercury-free alternative:  
  
"It depends on what the filling material was (my dentist used calcium oxide),
but the amount absorbed from amalgam fillings and food is probably much more
significant."

Here are some responses I have received from Ray Peat:  
  
**Regarding Acne:**  
Have you tried anything topical, such as sulfur, or an antibiotic such as
minocycline? 10% sulfur [ soap ](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-
category/homemade-soap/) leaves an antiseptic residue on the skin that can
prevent infection.  
  
I think it would be good to try the sulfur soap first.  
  
The simple ones are what I use; I haven't tried one with [ salicylic acid
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) .  
  
Is it okay to shower twice a day and use sulfur soap?  
The sulfur lingers on the skin for at least a day. It can leave you fairly
smelly.  
  
**Can flowers of sulfur taken internally help with acne? Would minocycline
also help?** Either of them can help, but with prolonged use the intestine can
develop sensitivity to the sulfur. causing irritation instead of stopping it.  
  
  
**Does masturbation or sex have positive or negative effects on the hormones
or stress?** Generally positive, but intense arousal can have unwanted
consequences, such as herpes virus outbreaks.  
  
**Regarding Light and Light proximity:**  
If it's comfortable it isn't harmful, but it's easy to get burned when they
are so close. Your body temperature is likely to rise, otherwise I don't know
of any problem from prolonged light (but even incandescent light does have
some slightly harmful blue light, so you should watch your own reactions to
it).  
  
**Does it matter where the bright light shines on your body to receive
beneficial effects?  
Does it matter if you have clothes on? **  
Bare skin is best; for effects on the nervous system, shining on head, face,
neck and back is good.  
  
**Does[ infrared ](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/light-
therapy/) light and red/orange light also increase the need for vitamin A? **  
Not as far as I know.  
  
**What is the best/safest way to cook seafood? I would assume boiling,
steaming or frying in coconut oil.**  
Those, or butter.  
  
**Do you have an opinion on how LCD screens affect eye strain or sleeping?**  
People react differently to different screens. Keeping the room bright, and
the screen not too bright, can reduce the eye strain. This person has very
detailed information about them: [ http://www.conradbiologic.com/articles/ ...
ckerI.html ](http://www.conradbiologic.com/articles/SubliminalFlickerI.html)  
  
**Carrot Salad:**  
Just chewing a carrot is best, any saturated fat around the same time is o.k.
What doesn't work very well is to grind the carrot very fine.  
  
**Are there any pros and cons to consuming liver and oyster in a large amount
once a week or a small amount daily?  
Is any of those better, or is there no difference nutritionally/health wise
and only has to do with convenience? **  
Convenience, because of the time preparing things.  
  
**If I consume Orange Juice, Milk, Oysters and Cocoa Powder at the same time,
will the Inhibition from the Cocoa Powder override the effects of the Orange
Juice in regards to Iron absorption?**  
I think it would be a balance.  
  
  
**What would minimize stress the most on the body, taking cold, lukewarm or
warm showers? Or would taking baths be better?**  
Warm showers can lower stress, and if the bath isn't too warm, it's effective,
too; if the bath raises the body temperature, that can cause the metabolism to
increase, sometimes causing low blood sugar.  
  
**Is 100% cocoa powder can be a suitable replacement for coffee in regards to
iron inhibition?**  
Yes.  
  
**Do you consider stretching or yoga healthy? Or lifting weights or sprinting
infrequently for that matter?**  
Those can all be helpful. The two things that most often make exercise harmful
are activity that keeps the lactic acid high chronically, and "eccentric"
exercise, in which muscles are stretched while contracting, as in running
downhill.  
  
**So to clarify, lifting weights with only concentric exercises, while making
sure to not get out of breath would be the best practice?  
Does high intensity/low volume produce greater lactic acid then high
volume/low intensity? **  
If volume refers to the mass of muscle involved, probably not, depending on
the exact intensities and volumes.  
Ten pound dumbells, lifted quickly for 30 to 60 seconds, for example, is
usually good for increasing the anabolic and protective hormones.  
  
**Is there anything to worry about/look out for when using deodorant or
shaving cream?**  
It's possible to make them without toxic ingredients, but I don't know of any
such products.

Effect of vitamin E on the accumulation of fluorescent material in cultured

Kan S, Devi SA, Kawashima S.  
Zoological Institute, Faculty of Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.  
The effect of vitamin E on the accumulation of lipofuscin-containing
fluorescent  
material in the mouse cerebral cortical cells in primary culture was studied.  
Fluorescent material was extracted in ethanol:diethylether (3:1) and  
autofluorescence intensity of the extracts was measured by a  
spectrofluorophotometer. Although vitamin E at the concentration of 0.005
IU/ml  
was not effective, 0.01 IU/ml vitamin E inhibited the accumulation of
fluorescent  
material. Fluorescent material accumulation was reduced to 76.3-86.4% of the  
control level in 6-, 12-, or 18-day treatment of 0.01 IU/ml vitamin E. High
doses  
of vitamin E (0.05 or 0.1 IU/ml) were toxic for cultured cells. Ethanol, the  
vehicle of vitamin E, at the final concentration of 0.005% was also effective
on  
the reduction of fluorescent material accumulation (81.0% of the control level
at  
18 days). The inhibitory effects of vitamin E as well as ethanol on the  
accumulation of fluorescent material in cultured cells are explained by their  
nature as free radical scavengers.

Mild stress-induced stimulation of heat-shock protein synthesis and improved  
functional ability of human fibroblasts undergoing aging in vitro.  
Fonager J, Beedholm R, Clark BF, Rattan SI.  
Laboratory of Cellular Ageing, Department of Molecular Biology, Danish Centre
for  
Molecular Gerontology, University of Aarhus, Gustav Wieds Vej 10-C, DK-8000  
Aarhus-C, Denmark.  
Repeated mild heat-shock (RMHS) treatment has anti-aging hormetic effects on  
human fibroblasts undergoing aging in vitro. Since heat and various other  
stresses induce the transcription and translation of heat-shock proteins
(Hsp),  
it was investigated if RMHS treatment affected the basal levels of four major  
stress proteins Hsp27, 70, 90 and Hsc70. The basal levels of Hsp27, Hsc70, and  
Hsp70 increased significantly in late passage senescent cells, which is  
indicative of an adaptive response to cumulative intracellular stress during  
aging. RMHS increased the levels of these Hsp even in early passage young
cells  
and were maintained high throughout their replicative lifespan. In comparison,  
the amount of Hsp90 decreased both with aging and RMHS treatment in vitro.  
However, whereas the difference in the levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 was  
statistically significant, the levels of Hsp27 and Hsc70 were statistically  
similar in normal and RMHS-treated serially passaged cells. These alterations  
were accompanied by an improved functional and survival ability of the cells
in  
terms of increased proteasomal activities, increased ability to decompose  
H(2)O(2), reduced accumulation of lipofuscin and enhanced resistance to
ethanol,  
H(2)O(2) and UV-A radiation.

75275\.  
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ethanol on in vitro  
life span, rate of contraction and lipofuscin content of neonatal rat cardiac  
myocytes. Lipofuscin was quantified by microspectrofluorometry. The effects of
0,  
3.1, 6.5, and 12.5 mM ethanol on myocytes, kept under an ambient oxygen  
concentration of 20% and 40%, were studied. Exposure to low concentrations of  
ethanol resulted in a decrease in the amount of lipofuscin whereas exposure to  
high concentration of ethanol caused an increase in the level of lipofuscin.
The  
length of cell survival in controls and 3.1 mM ethanol exposed myocytes was  
similar under 20% oxygen, but was longer in the latter group under 40% oxygen,
as  
compared to controls. The total number of contractions in 3.1 mM ethanol-
exposed  
myocytes were, respectively, 4% and 8% higher under 20% and 40% oxygen
atmosphere  
than in control cells.

Age-related decline in multiple unit action potentials of cerebral cortex  
correlates with the number of lipofuscin-containing neurons.  
Sharma D, Singh R.  
Neurobiology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University,  
New Delhi, India.  
The present study examined whether there is any obvious correlation between
the  
density of lipofuscin-containing neurons and the spontaneous neuronal action  
potentials (Multiple Unit Activity, MUA) in the parietal cortex of the aging
rat  
brain. The results showed that MUA counts were decreased with age while the  
number of lipofuscin-containing neurons was increased. The cortex with the  
highest percentage of lipofuscin-containing neurons had the lowest MUA counts  
while the cortex with the lowest percentage of lipofuscin-containing neurons
had  
the highest MUA counts. The inverse correlation between MUA and  
lipofuscin-containing neuron number was also evident when the population of
the  
lipofuscin-containing neurons was pharmacologically altered in vivo by the  
administration of anti-lipofuscin drug centrophenoxine. The inverse
relationship  
between MUA and the lipofuscin-containing neuron numbers is consistent with:
(i)  
the correlations of MUA with age-related changes in lipid peroxidation and  
biochemically measured lipofuscin concentration, and (ii) the oxidative  
stress-induced impairments of neuronal electrophysiology.

Calcium overload is associated with lipofuscin formation in human retinal
pigment  
epithelial cells fed with photoreceptor outer segments.  
Zhang L, Hui YN, Wang YS, Ma JX, Wang JB, Ma LN.  
Department of Ophthalmology, Eye Institute of Chinese PLA, Xijing Hospital,
The  
Fourth Military University, Xian, Shaanxi, China.  
PURPOSE: To investigate the role of Ca²(+) in lipofuscin formation in human  
retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that phagocytize bovine photoreceptor  
outer segments (POSs).  
METHODS: Cultured human RPE cells fed with 2 × 10⁷per l bovine POS were
treated  
with flunarizine, an antagonist of Ca²(+) channel, or/and centrophenoxine, a  
lipofuscin scavenger. The Ca²(+) changes and lipofuscin formation were
measured  
with fluoresence dye Fluo-3/AM ester, laser scanning confocal microscopy
(LSCM)  
and flow cytometry (FCM). The activity of RPE cells was measured by methyl  
thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions  
(AgNORs) assay.  
RESULTS: The Ca²(+) fluorescence intensity (CFI) of RPE cells fed with POS was  
significantly increased compared with the controls (165.36 ± 29.92 U). It
reached  
a peak with 777.33 ± 63.86 U (P<0.01) at 12 h, and then decreased but still  
maintained a high level of 316.90 ± 36.07 U (P<0.01) for 4 days. Flunarizine
and  
centrophenoxine significantly decreased the Ca²(+) overload to 227.18 ± 14.00
U  
at 12 h and 211.06 ± 20.45 U at 4 days. FCM confirmed these changes. The drugs  
also showed an inhibitory effect on the lipofuscin formation. The
proliferation  
rate of the cells fed with POS increased significantly. Both drugs had
inhibitory  
effects on the activity of the cultured cells. This tendency was confirmed by  
AgNORs assay.  
CONCLUSIONS: The Ca²(+) inflow initiated lipofuscin accumulation in RPE cells
fed  
with POS. Flunarizine and centrophenoxine can decrease Ca²(+) overload and  
lipofuscin formation in RPE cells, accompanied by maintaining cellular
vitality.

'Dark' cell formation under protein malnutrition: process of conversion and  
concept of 'semi-dark' type Purkinje cells.  
James TJ, Sharma SP, Gupta SK, Patro IK.  
Department of Zoology, Kurukshetra University, India.  
This paper deals with some deleterious effects of protein malnourishment in
rat  
cerebellum. Severe protein deprivation enhanced the formation of 'dark' cells
in  
white rats. It is postulated that abnormal changes in the neuronal contents  
induced by nutritional stress play a vital role in the formation of the 'dark'  
cells through an intermediary stage, 'semi-dark' cells. Centrophenoxine a  
lipofuscinolytic agent, however, seems to interfere with the process of
formation  
of 'dark' cells and/or helps reconversion of the 'dark' cells into the normal
or  
'light' type Purkinje cells.

Lipofuscin response to the "aging-reversal" drug centrophenoxine in rat
retinal pigment epithelium and frontal cortex.  
Katz ML, Robison WG Jr.  
The effects of centrophenoxine on the lipofuscin contents of the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) and frontal cortex of the brain were examined in
senescent female Fischer rats. Rats (106 weeks old) were injected daily for 11
weeks with centrophenoxine (80 to 120 mg/kg body weight) or saline, and then
sacrificed along with untreated 28- and 46-week-old controls. The number of
lipofuscin granules seen in the RPE by light microscopy increased by 70%
between 28 and 117 weeks of age in control animals. There was a concomitant
age-related increase in lipofuscin specific fluorescence in the RPE.
Centrophenoxine treatment neither reduced the amount of lipofuscin, nor
altered the ultrastructural appearance of lipofuscin granules in the RPE.
Between 28 and 117 weeks of age, there was an almost nine-fold increase in the
lipofuscin content of the frontal cortex of control animals; centrophenoxine
treatment failed to reverse this pigment accumulation.

The roles of vitamin E and unsaturated fatty acids in the visual process.  
Robison WG, Kuwabara T, Bieri JG.  
Laboratory of Vision Research, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of  
Health, Bethesda, Maryland, MD 20205.  
Relatively high proportions of long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids seem to
be  
required in rod photoreceptor membranes in order to provide the precise  
microenvironment for the proper function of the visual pigment rhodopsin. At
the  
same time, such high levels of lipid unsaturation put the photoreceptor
membranes  
at a high risk for autoxidation. The antioxidant vitamin E which can minimize  
autoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids is found in rather high  
concentrations in the outer segment membranes. Dietary deficiency in vitamin E  
induces disintegration of rod outer segment membranes, probably by increasing  
autoxidation. Also, it greatly accelerates the accumulation of aging pigments
in  
the retinal pigment epithelium, probably because these lipofuscin granules do  
indeed represent the end products of lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E
supplements,  
up to threefold normal levels, appear to provide no significant protection of
the  
retina from light damage produced either by short but acute or by long-term,
low  
level exposures to light. This is not consistent with current theories which  
implicate lipid peroxidation in the destruction of rod outer segments in light  
damaged retinas; more work is needed before any relation between retinal light  
damage and vitamin E levels can be assessed. Surprisingly, the amount of  
lipofuscin granule accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium is
influenced  
dramatically by dietary levels of vitamin A. Even retinas lacking a source of  
polyunsaturated fatty acids from rod outer segments still may accumulate
massive  
lipofuscin if dietary vitamin A is provided. Perhaps vitamin A, which has such
a  
dynamic relationship with the retinal pigment epithelium, becomes oxidized,
and  
then contributes to the formation of a lipofuscin-like pigment.
Centrophenoxine,  
a drug claimed to be effective in reversing the accumulation of age-related  
lipofuscin in the central nervous system, has no obvious effect in the eye or  
uterus in removing the lipofuscin granules induced by vitamin E deficiency.  
Microperoxisomes are abundant in the retinal pigment epithelium, and may be  
associated with rapid lipid turnover and/or utilization of lipid soluble  
vitamins. Their potential roles, however, need further documentation and  
clarification. Recently developed techniques and new discoveries in lipid  
research open the way for many fruitful studies on the interactions and
precise  
roles of lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins in vision.

Effects of Dimethylaminoethanol Upon Life-span and Behavior of Aged Japanese
Quail1

The lysosome hypothesis of aging predicts that membrane stabilizers will
extend life-span. Stabilizers containing the dimethylaminoethanol moiety
(DMAE) have been reported to extend the life-span of drosophila and mice. We
tested the prediction in Japanese quail (N = 15) by administering DMAE
bitartrate (18.4 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water for 69 weeks, starting at
195 weeks of age. A matched control group (N = 14) received tartaric acid (4.0
mg/kg/day) in the water. Contrary to the prediction, the DMAE-treated group
had a shorter life-span after start of treatment (49 weeks) than the controls
(69 weeks). No significant differences between the groups were observed in
body weight or daily fluid intake. Three behavioral studies were carried out
on survivors at 243-249 weeks of age, namely; activity response to light-
flash; sexual mounting response to a female quail; and classical conditioning
of the heart rate. Aged quail differed from young-adults in changes in motor
activity in response to light flashes. Aged quail appeared less responsive
initially to reinforced conditioning trials and demonstrated extinction when
light flash was not followed by electric shock. There were no detectable
differences in latency to mount or in basal heart rate, either as a function
of age or as a function of DMAE treatment.

**Response from the "Mr. Darcy" of energy protection**  
  
I think Ray Peat is amazing.  
His graciousness in responding to all of us sets a precedence for the
possibilities of a new type of "community" that is not much unlike his idea
that "energy and structure are interdependent, at every level".  
  
Anywho, here is his response to some of my questions regarding headaches, lab
tests and finding a useful form of Emodin.  
  
"I think prolactin and TSH would be worth checking. I have had bad headaches
when I used vitamin A orally, and even getting a little on my lips was enough
to do it. It could be that the Nutrisorb-A was the cause, if you used it
orally. I use it only on my legs and feet.  
It's hard now (since the FDA's anticascara action) to find a standardized aged
[ cascara ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/) product, but
Western Botanical and (in Italy) Farmalabor are two sources that I know of.
(Naturlich Kost Ko-op in Millersburg, Ohio, has cascara, but I think FDA is
currently preventing them from doing business.) The Chinese rhubarb products
are probably standardized, but I have never used them. An amount slightly less
than a laxative dose has beneficial systemic effects."

Ray Peat response to low testosterone and high cholesterol  
  
The problem with chicken is that the fat is highly unsaturated, and the meat
provides very little calcium. Milk and cheese have a much better ratio of
calcium to phosphate. Having the carrots raw (shredded, with a little olive
oil, vinegar, and salt) would help with the hormone balance, and protect the
intestine against inflammation. Supplementing [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) wouldn't have
the risk of the [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) being
converted to estrogen, which tends to happen when thyroid function is low. A
small supplement of Armour thyroid or the equivalent could quickly lower the
cholesterol, and since cholesterol is converted by thyroid into pregnenolone
and DHEA, that would probably help the testosterone. Some shellfish (oysters,
shrimp, squid, etc.) or low fat fish would provide trace minerals that might
be lacking in your diet. Several eggs per week, or liver once a week, can help
with other nutrients that are probably deficient in your present foods. Well
cooked potatoes, with butter or cream, fruit, and well cooked greens are other
foods have vitamins and minerals that are helpful.  
  
Ray Peat guidance on dosing thyroid  
  
Cynoplus ( [ www.farmaciadelnino.com ](http://www.farmaciadelnino.com) has a
good price) is cheaper than Armour, and an eighth to a fourth of a tablet
would be a reasonable amount to start with; thyroxine's half-life in the body
is two weeks, so the effect is cumulative, and if you get the desired effects
in less than two weeks the dose should probably be reduced.  
  
At the beginning, once a day, but if your temperature and pulse and symptoms
aren't just right after two weeks you could add another dose at a different
time of day. Change of seasons affects the amount of thyroid you need,
sometimes it isn't needed after using it for a while, but it's always good to
watch for signs of change.  
  
The body makes up to about 4 mcg of T3 in an hour, so each dose should be
small, with food to delay absorption. Are you having orange juice and milk in
your diet? Sometimes a B vitamin deficiency, especially [ B1
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b1-powder-thiamine-hcl-usp-grade/)
, can cause the fog. A supplement of 10 mg. is often enough to improve focus
and prevent fatigue.  
  
  
  
When you take T3 without food, it enters the blood stream very suddenly, and
the liver is likely to detect an excessive amount, causing it to produce
enzymes to eliminate it. The result can be a decrease in T3 for the rest of
the day, especially at night if you took it in the morning. Have you tried
rebreathing into a paper bag, to see if the increased CO2 affects the fog?  
  
Ray Peat on SSRIs  
  
It takes time to adapt to decreasing those drugs, keeping sugar up and
inflammation down, including bag breathing, should help.  
Starting with a little, a sixth or fourth of a tablet, of cynoplus in the
evening would be the best way to try it.

Abstract  
OBJECTIVE:  
To examine the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco use on early
follicular phase FSH, LH, E2, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).  
DESIGN:  
Cross-sectional study.  
SETTING:

PATIENT(S):  
Four hundred ninety-eight women selected from the general population, ages
36-45, who were not currently pregnant, breast feeding, or using exogenous
hormones.  
INTERVENTION(S):  
A general questionnaire assessing demography, anthropometry, and smoking
habits and a standardized dietary questionnaire assessing food and beverage
frequencies, including sources of alcohol and caffeine.  
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):  
FSH, LH, E2, and SHBG levels measured during the early follicular phase of the
menstrual cycle.  
RESULT(S):  
Significant associations observed in a univariate analysis included age > or
=40 and current smoking associated with higher FSH; higher body mass index
(BMI) associated with lower SHBG levels; and daily alcohol use, cholesterol
consumption greater than the median, and coffee use >1 cup/d associated with
higher E2 levels. In a multivariate model, total caffeine use was
significantly associated with E2 levels after adjustment for age, BMI, total
calories, current smoking, alcohol, cholesterol consumption, and day of
sampling. Early follicular phase E2 increased from 28.2 pg/mL for women
consuming < or =100 mg of caffeine to 45.2 pg/mL for women consuming > or =500
mg of caffeine per day, about a 70% increase.  
CONCLUSION(S):  
Coffee consumption and total caffeine use may increase early follicular phase
E2 levels independent of related habits of alcohol or tobacco use."

Ray Peats response to getting off antidepressant use.  
  
Keeping the metabolic rate and cholesterol up is important, so that repair and
adaptation will be quick. [ Progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) reduces
pain and anxiety, and [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) would be the
most convenient supplement for men, but it's hard to find products without
allergens. Combining progesterone and [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) or
testosterone can produce the stabilizing effect without suppressing the
libido. Benadryl and cyproheptadine are probably both helpful. Withdrawal from
morphine and SSRIs and migraine involve some similar processes.

Suppression of the drug-induced morphine withdrawal syndrome by cyproheptadine  
Klaus Opitz, Ingrid Reimann  
In rats treated with gradually increasing amounts of morphine hydrochloride
until they tolerated fatal doses, levallorphan precipitated acute body weight
loss and elicited a variety of other typical withdrawal symptoms.
Cyproheptadine markedly reduced this b.w. loss and abolished the drug-induced
withdrawal syndrome. Fenfluramine also suppressed the major signs of the
levallorphan-induced morphine withdrawal; however the combination of the three
drugs proved to be very toxic. Since both agents interfere with different
hypothalamic feeding mechanisms these results are accordant with the
hypothesis of Kerr and Pozuelo (1971) that morphine dependence and tolerance
are due to a functional disorganization of the hypothalamic centers concerned
wit the regulation of food intake.

Pharmacological analysis of certain mechanisms of morphine addiction.  
Ovcharov R, Bantoutova I, Kobourova K.  
The effects of L-Dopa, Methysergid, Diphenhydramine hydrochloride and LSD on
the development of morphine dependence and the abstience syndrome after its
withdrawal, were tested in experiments on 200 male Wistar albino rats. L-Dopa
had no efect on the development of physical morphine dependence, while
Methysergid prevented its development. Applied in rats during the abstinence
syndrome, LSD intensified their aggressivity with no influence on the
analgesic effect of morphine. Diphenhydramine reduced the aggressiveness of
the rats during the abstinence syndrome. Biochemical tests show that in
morphine-tolerant rats there was an increase in the content of brain
serotonin, less of dopamine and no changes in noradrenaline. The significance
of the brain levels of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline for the
development of physical morphine-dependence is discussed. It is pointed out
that serotonin and dopamine play an important role both for the origin of the
physical morphine dependence, and in the abstinence syndrome after its
withdrawal.  
  
Drug Alcohol Depend. 1976 Feb;1(3):221-39.  
Central serotonergic mechanisms and development of morphine dependence.  
Blasig J, Papeschi R, Gramsch C, Herz A.  
The effects of different manipulations of brain serotonin (5-HT) content on
the  
development of morphine dependence were investigated in rats, which were  
implanted with morphine pellets for 40 days. Serotonin content was decreased
by  
(a) short or long term inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase with  
para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), (b) by short or long term degeneration of
5-HT  
containing nerve terminals with 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine or (c) by degeneration
of  
5-HT containing nerve terminals by lesioning of midbrain raphe nuclei. With
all  
methods used, the frequency of withdrawal jumping was significantly reduced,  
while other withdrawal signs remained more or less unchanged. Additional  
administration of 5-HTP to chronically PCPA treated rats did not reverse the
PCPA  
effect. Since chronic reduction of 5-HT level during the whole time of
morphine  
exposure changed withdrawal symptomatology in nearly the same way as did a  
decrease in 5-HT level during the time of withdrawal only, it is suggested
that  
serotonergic mechanisms are not linked to the basic processes underlying  
dependence development but that they are only involved in the nervous pathways  
mediating the expression of some withdrawal signs.

Physical dependence in the rat induced by slow release morphine: dose-
response,  
time course and brain biogenic amines.  
Laska JF, Fennessy MR.  
1\. Physical dependence was induced in rats by administration of a slow
release  
morphine emulsion (morphine SR), and assessed by scoring abstinence signs and  
temperature changes after i.p. administration of naloxone (5 mg/kg). Three
groups  
of rats received doses of 75, 100 or 150 mg/kg of morphine SR. Dependence was  
evaluated in each of these groups after 24, 48 and 72 h. 2. The effect of
these  
treatments at the different times on brain levels of serotonin,  
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, noradrenaline and dopamine was determined. 3. A  
ceiling level of dependence was reached 24 h after 75 and 100 mg/kg and 48 h  
after 150 mg/kg of morphine SR. 4. These different treatments produced no  
significant effect on the brain levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or
serotonin.  
The levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were significantly raised in  
morphine-dependent rats and the changes correlated well with the changes in  
abstinence behaviour and temperature after naloxone. 5. The results suggest
that  
a relationship exists between serotonin turnover and physical dependence on  
morphine.

Supersensitivity of 5-HT1A autoreceptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors regulating  
monoamine synthesis in the brain of morphine-dependent rats.

Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, Associate Unit of the Institute Cajal/CSIC,  
Department of Biology, University of the Balearic Islands, Cra. Valldemossa Km  
7.5, 07071 Palma de Mallorca, Spain.  
The sensitivity of 5-HT1A serotonin receptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors  
(autoreceptors and heteroreceptors) modulating brain monoamine synthesis was  
investigated in rats during morphine treatment and after naloxone-precipitated  
withdrawal. The accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and  
3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) after decarboxylase inhibition was used as a  
measure of the rate of tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylation in vivo. Acute  
morphine (3-100 mg/kg, 1 h) increased the synthesis of 5-HTP/5-HT in various  
brain regions (15%-35%) and that of DOPA/dopamine (DA) in striatum (28%-63%),
but  
decreased the synthesis of DOPA/noradrenaline (NA) in hippocampus and cortex  
(20%-33%). Naloxone (2-60 mg/kg, 1 h) did not alter the synthesis of 5-HTP or  
DOPA in brain. Tolerance to the inhibitory effect of morphine on DOPA/NA  
synthesis and a sensitization to its stimulatory effects on DOPA/DA and  
5-HTP/5-HT synthesis were observed after chronic morphine and/or in  
morphine-withdrawn rats. In morphine-dependent rats (tolerant and withdrawn  
states) the inhibitory effects of the 5-HT1A agonists 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone  
(0.1 mg/kg, 1 h), and that of the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.1  
mg/kg, 1 h), on the synthesis of 5-HTP/5-HT were potentiated (25%-50%).
Moreover,  
the effect of 8-OH-DPAT was antagonized by WAY 100135, a selective 5-HT1A  
antagonist. In morphine-dependent rats (tolerant state), the inhibitory
effects  
of clonidine on the synthesis of DOPA/NA (hippocampus, hypothalamus) and
DOPA/DA  
(striatum) also were potentiated (35%-55%). In summary, we conclude that
morphine  
addiction is associated with supersensitivity of 5-HT1A serotonin receptors
and  
alpha2-adrenoceptors (autoreceptors and heteroreceptors) that modulate the  
synthesis of monoamines in brain.

Morphine abstinence and serotonin supersensitivity in man: analogies with the  
mechanism of migraine?  
Sicuteri F, Del Bianco PL, Anselmi B.  
Supersensitivity to serotonin during migraine attack has been previously  
observed. Since the attack has been attributed to a critical lowering of  
morphine-like factors, we can expect serotonin supersensitivity during
morphine  
abstinence. Slight signs of morphine abstinence have also been induced in  
volunteers after mild (10-24 mg/day) and limited (3 days) treatment. To
evaluate  
the sensitivity to serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and tyramine in the
smooth  
muscle of the hand dorsal vein, in vivo, the computerized venotest was applied  
before, during, and 24 h after withdrawal of morphine. Venous sensitivity to  
serotonin and dopamine (but not to noradrenaline and tyramine) increased 10-
to  
20-fold after morphine withdrawal. Venous monoamine supersensitivity in
morphine  
abstinence, similar to that observed during migraine attacks, could be
indirect  
evidence of an analogous mechanism in both conditions.  
  
Agents Actions. 1975 Dec;5(5):476-83.  
The possible role of brain histamine and H1 and H2 receptors in the
development  
of morphine tolerance and physical dependence in mice.  
Wong CL, Roberts MB.  
The possible role of brain histamine in the mechanisms of morphine tolerance
and  
physical dependence is under investigation in mice. L-histidine and histamine,  
given during the 'withdrawal' phase, significantly increase tolerance to the  
analgesic effects of morphine but reduce the degree of physical dependence.  
Metiamide significantly inhibits tolerance but has no consistent effect on  
physical dependence. These results suggest that H2 receptors may be involved
in  
the development of morphine tolerance. Mepyramine does not significantly
affect  
tolerance, and with regard to dependence there is an effect only on body
weight  
loss, which is increased. However, combined treatment with metiamide and  
mepyramine inhibits tolerance significantly more than metiamide alone; and  
withdrawal jumping is also reduced more significantly by combined treatment
than  
by the separate administration of these drugs. It is suggested that brain  
histamine is definitely implicated in the mechanisms of the 'withdrawal' phase
of  
morphine tolerance and physical dependence in mice, with H2 receptors probably  
playing the more important part.  
  
Adv Biochem Psychopharmacol. 1980;22:523-33.  
Dopamine and 5-HT supersensitivity in nonorganic central pain and in morphine  
abstinence: fortuitous or renal analogy?  
Sicuteri F, Anselmi B, Del Bianco PL.  
Unexplained pain, such as central panalgesia, might be the most common
clinical  
expression of a deficiency, central in nature, of the endorphin system. Acute  
natural opioid deficiency is comparable to morphine withdrawal in addicts  
characterized by vegetative, psychic disorder and the appearance of pain. An  
impressive supersensitivity (up to 1000 fold) to dopamine and 5-HT of the
smooth  
muscle (hand dorsal vein: venotest) is detected both in central panalgesia  
sufferers and in addicts during spontaneous (withdrawal) or pharmacological  
(naloxone) abstinence. A 5-HT and dopamine supersensitivity, of less
intensity,  
however, (10-30 fold), is found during migraine attacks: on these occasions,  
morphine-like factors in CSF appear reduced or undetectable, reinforcing the  
chemical analogy between morphine abstinence and migraine attacks. In the
present  
study, evidence of opiate receptors in the human vein is also provided: 5-HT  
venospasms, inhibited by morphine, promptly emerge when naloxone is inoculated  
locally.

Ray Peat continued:  
  
  
I knew someone who had been addicted to morphine and alcohol for 30 years, who
was drinking quarts of beer and wine daily when he didn't have morphine, who
had an opportunity for a good job if he could get sober. Starting [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-

didn't have a hangover in the morning. He used enough progesterone to neuter
most people, but said it didn't affect his sex function; he was taking a lot
of Cytomel and magnesium, but wasn't drunk again as long as I knew him, and
his general health improved.

It depends on how much [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) you can
assimilate. People would use [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) in amounts
needed to stop the withdrawal symptoms, but pregnenolone doesn't have the
powerful effects of progesterone, even in multi-gram quantities, so it's just
a matter of seeing what it can do. As I understand the mechanism (migraine,
withdrawal, etc.), estrogen-histamine-serotonin rise on a background of
hypothyroid liver malfunction, cytomel (and/or sugar, [ selenium
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/selenium-liquid/) , B vitamins) allows the
liver and other detoxifying systems to lower them, and the lower they are, the
less progesterone or pregnenolone it takes to block the symptoms.  
  
Again, talking about withdrawing from antidepressants.

The person I described who recovered so completely took about 1000 mg of
progesterone during the first night, and more than 1000 mg daily for a few
weeks, but that much could make some people comatose; it's a matter of
individual hormone status. I think the SSRI drugs continue to do harm, even
when they reduce withdrawal symptoms.

Changes in peripheral thyroid hormone levels are associated with changes in
human  
affective disorders, particularly depression. In the current study we used an  
animal stress paradigm, proposed to be an animal model of depression, to
examine  
peripheral T(3) levels during and after escapable or inescapable stress in
adult  
male rats. In this model, one animal can control the termination of foot-shock  
stress by performing a lever press, and therefore experiences escapable
stress.  
His lever press also terminates the shock for his yoked partner, who has no  
control over the stressor, and therefore experiences inescapable stress. In
three  
separate experiments, blood samples were collected during and after one or two  
sessions of escapable/inescapable stress. We found that exposure to
inescapable  
stress, but not escapable stress, caused a decrease in T(3) levels 120 min  
post-stress initiation. Peripheral T(3) levels were not significantly altered
in  
animals exposed to escapable stress. In sum, these results add to a large body
of  
previous data indicating that psychological coping can prevent the effects of  
physical stress on many diverse systems.

Do you have a preference between with high alpha or high gamma mixed
tocopherols?  
  
There is a vitamin E from France, from wheat germ oil, which is high gamma. If
that's good in theory, would 14mg (about 20 IU) daily be a good amount? That's
what one pill has.

naturelles-les-4-tocopherols-100-naturel/product_info.php/products_id/40163)  
  
His response:  
  
In similar milligram amounts, I would prefer gamma.

slightly modified molecules. I think the tendency to take too much might be a
problem with androgens generally--4 milligrams of testosterone and 15 mg of
DHEA is a normal daily production for young men, and half of that amount is
effective for middle aged men, unless the problem is something else.
Pregnenolone is safe, if it's pure, but it's good to be skeptical about

Also this regarding Cynoplus dosage for my son. And the use of retin
a/retinoids (Whew! This is long :)  
  
"An eighth or tenth of a cynoplus tablet is a good amount for a trial, it's a
little less than the body would normally produce in an hour, so it's enough to
detect as a change of state, slight change of heart rate, warming of hands,
for example. Vitamin A is such a basic metabolic factor, in the brain and
endocrine glands, liver and kidneys, etc., I think it's dangerous to
experiment with drugs that interfere with it."  
  
  
Excess Deaths in VA Tretinoin-Retin-A Trial_FDA Silent  
Even a seemingly harmless topical ointment may pose unanticipated lethal risks
which are undisclosed on the FDA-approved label.  
"I would urge you to cultivate a keenly skeptical attitude toward the
pharmacopeia as a whole..." Sir William Osler, 1907  
  
Indeed, even a seemingly harmless topical ointment may pose unanticipated
lethal risks which are undisclosed on the FDA-approved label.  
  
A concerned dermatologist, a former FDA medical officer, brought to our
attention the finding of a 6-year randomized clinical trial conducted by the
Veterans Administration involving 1,131 elderly veterans. 566 were randomized
to test tretinoin cream (0.1%), and 565 to placebo. Tretinoin, a member of the
retinoid class of medications is commonly used for the topical treatment of
acne and fine lines and wrinkles. It is marketed as Retin-A and Renova, as
well as other branded products.  
  
The purpose of trial was to establish the effectiveness of Retin-A as a
chemoprevention intervention for nonmelanoma skin cancer. The trial failed to
demonstrate effectiveness as a cancer prevention treatment. Instead, there
were statistically significant, unanticipated extra deaths among those
applying tretinoin, compared with those given a placebo: the trial was
terminated 6 months early (in 2004).  
  
In 2005, the authors published preliminary results in abstract form in the
Journal of Investigative Dermatology, stating that there was NOT a
statistically significant difference in overall mortality between tretinoin
and placebo groups: "We conclude tretinoin did not cause the mortality
difference between groups, and in retrospect the termination of the
intervention was unnecessary."  
  
Four years elapsed before the study results were finally published in January
in Archives of Dermatology [ http://archderm.ama-
assn.org/cgi/content/full/145/1/18 ](http://archderm.ama-
assn.org/cgi/content/full/145/1/18)  
  
According to published report, there were significant differences in mortality
between retinoid users and those on placebo:  
  
Table 1. Cumulative Deaths among 1131 Study Participants,shows that the
retinoid treated group consistently had an excess number of deaths compared to
the placebo group: by April 2004, there were 135 deaths: 82 (14%) deaths in
retinoid group compared to 53 (9%) placebo. Before the end of intervention in
2004 the deaths climbed to 184: 108 (19%) deaths in retinoid group compared to
76 (14%) placebo. And by the end of study (follow-up phase) there were 212
deaths: 122 (22%) deaths in retinoid group compared to 90 (16%) placebo.  
  
Table 3 Cause of Deaths reveals that greatest disparity in deaths between the
retinoid group and placebo involved:  
  
lung cancer (15 deaths vs 8), respiratory thoractic disorders (15 vs 7), and
vascular disorders (12 vs 3)--when deaths from Arteriosclerosis and
Atherosclerosis are added, the vascular risk increases to 22 vs 5.  
  
The study investigators attribute the difference to chance.  
  
However, the accompanying editorial (below) suggests caution:  
  
"While debate will continue regarding whether the association between topical
tretinoin and death found in the VATTCresulted from chance or a real
biological effect, until additional data from other studies emerge,
practitioners should view the results of the VATTC with discretion. Public
health ideally uses the precautionary principle—that possible harm should be
avoided before harmful effects are unquestionably proven.8 At a minimum, this
principle should cause prescribing physicians to discuss the results of the
VATTC with elderly men using topical tretinoin."  
  
And a published letter (below) cites earlier controlled retinoid trials with
similar results:  
  
"A causal link between tretinoin and mortality due to lung cancer or other
lung diseases is consistent with previous RCT data. Specifically, the Alpha-
Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial 7 and the Beta-Carotene and
Retinol Efficacy Trial8 both linked vitamin A–related compounds to lung
cancer. Ironically, both trials were intended to demonstrate that these
compounds could prevent lung cancer. In both studies, however, lung cancer
rates in subjects taking vitamin A–related substances were, unexpectedly,
significantly higher than in subjects taking placebo, leading to early
discontinuation of the vitamin A–related interventions in both trials."  
  
The FDA has shown utter indifference: taking no action whatsoever to alert
prescribing physicians to the potential lethal risk. The tretinoin labeling
fails to reflect the results of the VA study.

ScD; John J. DiGiovanna, MD; Julia E. Vertrees, PharmD; for the Veterans
Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention (VATTC) Trial Group  
  
Objective: To evaluate the relation of topical tretinoin, a commonly used
retinoid cream, with all-cause mortality in the Veterans Affairs Topical
Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial (VATTC). The planned outcome of this trial was
risk of keratinocyte carcinoma, and systemic administration of certain
retinoid compounds has been shown to reduce risk of this cancer but has also
been associated with increased mortality risk among smokers.  
  
Design: The VATTC Trial was a blinded randomized chemoprevention trial, with
2- to 6-year follow-up. Oversight was provided by multiple independent
committees.  
  
Setting: US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers.  
  
Patients: A total of 1131 veterans were randomized. Their mean age was 71
years. Patients with a very high estimated short-term risk of death were
excluded.  
  
Interventions: Application of tretinoin, 0.1%, or vehicle control cream twice
daily to the face and ears.  
  
Main Outcome Measures: Death, which was not contemplated as an end point in
the original study design.  
  
Results: The interventionwas terminated 6months early because of an excessive
number of deaths in the tretinointreated group. Post hoc analysis of this
difference revealed minor imbalances in age, comorbidity, and smoking status,
all of which were important predictors of death. After adjusting for these
imbalances, the difference in mortality between the randomized groups remained
statistically significant.  
  
Conclusions: We observed an association of topical tretinoin therapy with
death, but we do not infer a causal association that current evidence suggests
is unlikely.

EDITORIAL: Dealing With Unanticipated Mortality in a Large Randomized Clinical
Trial of Topical Tretinoin  
  
. . . I would urge you to cultivate a keenly skeptical attitude toward the
pharmacopeia as a whole. . . . Sir William Osler, 19071  
  
Millions of people have used topical tretinoin to treat acne and photoaging.
[2-4] In this issue, Weinstock et al 5 report an unexpected result that led to
the premature halt of their randomized, placebo-controlled Department of
Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention(VATTC)trial designed to
determine whether topical tretinoin, 0.1%, cream prevents basal and squamous
cell skin cancer in US veterans.  
  
Limited topical tretinoin use (up to twice daily to the face and ears) was
associated with increased death (end-ofintervention hazard ratio, 1.54;
P=.01).  
  
While some argue that topical tretinoin might increase pulmonary-related
mortality,6 Weinstock et al5 ultimately reject this explanation and chalk
their results up as a chance finding based on the following: (1) minimal
systemic absorption of topical tretinoin; (2) the lack of a dose-response
association; (3) the lack of specificity of causes of death; and (4) the lack
of a statistical interaction between tretinoin use and smoking with mortality.  
  
(On this last point, asbestos provides the classic epidemiological example of
an exposure producing a statistical interaction with smoking: smoking and
asbestos exposure together result in greater risk of lung cancer than the sum
of the risks from the individual exposures.)7 While debate will continue
regarding whether the association between topical tretinoin and death found in
the VATTCresulted from chance or a real biological effect, until additional
data from other studies emerge, practitioners should view the results of the
VATTC with discretion.  
  
Public health ideally uses the precautionary principle—that possibleharmshould
be avoided before harmful effects are unquestionablyproven.8 At a minimum,
this principle should cause prescribing physicians to discuss the results of
the VATTC with elderly men using topical tretinoin. More circumspect
practitioners may wish to discuss the results of the VATTC with all patients
using topical tretinoin. This dialogue should include that the results of
theVATTC may have beendueto chance, but also that the outcome of death wasnot
initially anticipated, and owing to the adhoc analysis, various important risk
factors, such as smoking status, might not have been completely ascertained.
These discussions provide an opportunity for all health care providers
prescribing tretinoin to emphasize tobacco prevention and cessation with their
patients.9  
  
Clearly, future trials of topical retinoids, especially in elderly patients
and in current and former smokers, should mortality with validated, sound
methods. With increased mortality as a foreseeable outcome, rigorous,
predetermined stopping rules and appropriate statistical methods will ensure
that trials are not halted prematurely owing to invalid (but essential)
interim analyses.10-13 Finally, unlike other investigators who have not
emphasized unexpected mortality data,14,15 we highly commend Weinstock et al 5
for reporting and highlighting these results.

COMMENTS AND OPINIONS  
  
Topical Tretinoin, Lung Cancer, and Lung-Related Mortality  
  
By Kenneth A. Katz, MD, MSc, MSCE  
  
Amid continuing controversies over drug safety,1,2 results of a trial of
topical tretinoin—a commonly used medication for acne3 and skin wrinkles,
hyperpigmentation, and roughness4—raise serious concerns for the public
health. The Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention (VATTC)
trial5,6 was a vehicle-controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT) that
studied whether topical tretinoin, 0.1%, cream applied to the face and ears
could prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer.  
  
As reported in an abstract published in 2005,6 the study observed 1131
subjects for at least 2 years. After 6 years, and about 6 months prior to the
study’s scheduled conclusion, a safety monitoring committee stopped the study
because of excess mortality among subjects who applied tretinoin (n=82 deaths
[14%]) compared with those who applied vehicle (n=53 [9%]) (P=.01).
Differences in mortality from pulmonary disease (12 vs 4) and non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) (11 vs 4) were reported.5  
  
A causal link between tretinoin and mortality due to lung cancer or other lung
diseases is consistent with previous RCT data. Specifically, the Alpha-
Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial 7 and the Beta-Carotene and
Retinol Efficacy Trial 8 both linked vitamin A–related compounds to lung
cancer. Ironically, both trials were intended to demonstrate that these
compounds could prevent lung cancer. In both studies, however, lung cancer
rates in subjects taking vitamin A–related substances were, unexpectedly,
significantly higher than in subjects taking placebo, leading to early
discontinuation of the vitamin A–related interventions in both trials.  
  
A link between tretinoin and lung-related mortality is biologically plausible,
with the putative culprit not tretinoin itself but harmful tretinoin
metabolites. This line of association begins with the finding that topically
applied tretinoin can be absorbed systemically9 and therefore can reach lung
tissue. Once inside cells, tretinoin can induce its own metabolism; continuous
dosing with tretinoin may lead not to higher levels of tretinoin but to higher
levels of tretinoin metabolites.10 It is those tretinoin metabolites that may
injure lung tissue, particularly in the presence of cigarette smoke. This was
demonstrated in a study that exposed ferrets to beta carotene (a vitamin A
precursor) or cigarette smoke or both or neither for 6 months; lungs of all
ferrets exposed to beta carotene showed a strong proliferative response and
squamous metaplasia that was enhanced by exposure to cigarette smoke.11 A
hypothesis linking lung cancer to adverse effects of tretinoin metabolites is
also supported by the finding that patients with certain types of NSCLC
(squamous or large-cell carcinomas) metabolize tretinoin more rapidly than
patients with another NSCLC type (adenocarcinoma) or patients without lung
cancer.12 This study raises the possibility that rapid metabolizers of
tretinoin may be more likely to develop lung cancer because, compared with
normal metabolizers, they have a relative deficiency of tretinoin and a
relative excess of injurious tretinoin metabolites present in their lung
tissue.  
  
Additionally, the link between tretinoin and lung disease may be
multifactorial; others have proposed that tretinoin- mediated downregulation
of defensins in lung tissue contributed to lung-related mortality in the VATTC
trial.13  
  
It is not clear whether tretinoin caused the excess lungrelated deaths in the
VATTC trial. But concern is warranted, certainly, both because a causal link
is plausible and because topical tretinoin is indicated for the treatment of
relatively minor conditions.

Dr Peat  
You have mentioned that you maintain a very high calcium to phosphorus ratio.
What is a very high ratio? Is there a maximum limit for high ratio? Is 2000 mg
calcium and 1000 mg phosphorus a safe ratio?

Trying to understand why I got some positive effects from [ cascara

or many other pro-thyroid suggestions:

It doesn't entirely answer my question, because I don't see why other pro-
thyroid measures wouldn't have reduced NO as well. I eat very digestible foods
and not expecting endotoxin to be present in excess, and since NO seems to be
caused by endotoxin, I don't know where NO comes from and why cascara
specifically was efficient.

From Dr. Peat regarding iron supplementation:  
  
As long as your hemoglobin is o.k., I wouldn't use an iron supplement, because
so many things can influence the amount of iron in the blood, even when
there's enough in the liver and marrow. Have you been getting enough copper
and other trace minerals in your diet? Including shellfish (oysters have a lot
of iron as well as other trace minerals) and liver in your diet would be the
safe way to increase your iron and hemoglobin. Did you have your hormones
measured? High cortisol can reduce the amount of iron in the blood while
increasing it in the liver.

Hi this is for all the ladies who want to start on [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) but have
irregular cycles, Dr Peat said following:  
  
  
If you know the date of the last menstruation, you could go by the calendar,
so 6 or 10 or 14 weeks later might coincide with the ovulation cycle; if you
have a sensation of ovulation, that would be a signal to start it, or if you
see a sudden rise in morning temperature that could indicate ovulation. But if
there's no cycle you can detect, just starting the progesterone could renew
the rhythm.

"Salt is often the most important thing for pregnancy nausea. Two quarts of

function, with a low ratio of [ progesterone

antibiotic on day 7. I have also increased carrot salad to 2x per day to help
with endotoxin removal.

I do not think he addressed the problem with excess fluid here. He is simply
saying milk and juices  
do not cause the problem water does. But in other interviews he has mentioned
that  
a healthy person evaporate 2 quart of fluid through lungs and skin and a
hypothyroid  
person can barely evaporate 1 quart. He also added that low thyroid people
retain water  
instead of evaporating it.

**Re: Ray Peat Email Advice Depository Discussion/Comment Thre**  
  
Hi there:  
  
This was a discussion I had with RP a couple days ago about weight loss. I was
telling him I was gaining weight and felt really swollen.  
  
"That sounds like standard hypothyroid symptoms, the body simply adjusts to
holding more water, while losing sodium quickly. An increased intake of
calcium is the single most important nutritional thing for losing weight. Low
fat milk and cheese should be the main foods; a carrot salad helps to reduce
stress hormones. Temperature and heart rate are useful indicators for judging
the amount of a [ thyroid supplement
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-desiccated-
thyroid-ndt/) to use."  
  
Then I told him I didn't mind eating that way but I had really strong salt
cravings:  
  
"There are some very salty cheeses that help to satisfy salt appetite, for
example pecorino or feta; sometimes I add salt to cheeses such as gouda,
emmental, mozzarella, or cheddar. Sometimes pork rinds, chicharrones, are good
for a salty snack; I usually heat them in coconut oil and then drain them, to
remove some of the pork fat. Orange juice, guavas, watermelons, cherimoyas,
cooked apples, cherries, and ripe papayas are good sources of sugar to have
regularly."

_Regarding high altitude living._  
  
Just a few questions:  
  
1) How long does it take to reap benefits?  
====During the first couple of weeks, the body usually has stress reactions
that have to settle down, then the improvement continues for years. A couple
of months at altitude will usually cause changes that last for several months
even at lower altitude.  
  
2) What is the lowest elevation, that one could reap good benefits?  
====Statistics for New Mexico showed improvement for every increase of
altitude within the state--I think it's continuous, from below sea level up to
around 12,000 feet.  
  
  
3) Are there any conditions which high altitude is negative for? I think I
remember saying something about asthma?  
====I should have said respiratory diseases, meaning things like emphysema and
pulmonary fibrosis. Asthma is usually improved at high altitude, above 6000
feet, for several reasons. Even in polluted Mexico City, at 7500 feet, there's
very little asthma, but people who vacation in Acapulco often get asthma.  
  
4) After settling in for a week or two, is light exercise OK? Short runs?  
====I think walking should be the main exercise for the first several weeks.  
  
  
5) Can one really reap the same benefits with bag breathing, and other
artifical ways, as they would with actually LIVING in high altitude?  
====No.  
  
  
More:  
  
(6,000 feet)  
I think those moderate elevations are very helpful. My place in Coeneo is only
6600 feet, but my nearsightedness always improves when I'm there for a few
weeks. People who are very sensitive to altitude would have a headache at
14000 feet, so that was a good test.

Hi Dr. Peat,  
  
I have a a few questions about using activated charcoal.  
  
I've read that due to its powerful adsorption it is best to take it at least 2
hours before taking any medications, supplements or food.  
  
There has been some debate whether its necessary to take it away from food or
if it's OK to take with meals?  
There is some concern that nutrients may be adsorbed and/or that digesting
food may hinder the effectiveness of the charcoal.  
  
I am aware of the V.V. Frolkis study that you have quoted but wanted to ask if
you could further clarify this for me?  
  
Thank you so much.

**Coffee and Caffeine**  
  
Q: Dr Peat  
I had this impression from your interviews that you drink several cups of
strong coffee .  
But someone at forum is claiming that you drink weak coffee in the form of  
" cafe con leche". Can you please clarify if you drink weak coffee or strong
coffee.  
What is your daily caffeine intake? I have heard you recommending 3-5 cups of
coffee.  
What do you think is the safe dose of caffeine intake daily for average  
person?( with sugar and milk) Do you think it is safe to use caffeine tablet  
of 600 mg or more to treat fatty liver?

Ray's response to my question on drilling and filling cavities and root
canals:  
  
"I think filling a cavity soon is best, and with care the pulp can often be
preserved, but a root filling is better than extraction; the material used for
a root filling doesn't matter much, if calcium oxide is used at the end.
Calcium oxide would be best for the whole thing, but the x-ray mania has
discouraged that use."

Here is a RP's email response to LucyL's question on hemorrhagic fevers.  
  
LucyL: Since Dr. Peat has written on clotting disorders, I have wondered for a
while about his take on hemorrhagic fevers. While Ebola is the most well
known, there is actually a long list of illnesses that can be hemorrhagic,
including Dengue, hantavirus (also known in America as "four corners
disease"), yellow fever, bird flu (H7N9 etc), Chikungunya, H1N1 (swine flu)
can produce hemorrhagic pneumonia as well.  
So I finally asked what he would see as an appropriate therapeutic approach to
the hemorrhaging associated with these illnesses, and this was his response:

Ray : Before birth, injuries heal without inflammation and don't leave a scar.
Two important causes for that difference are the high concentration of CO2,
which limits lactic acid production, and the absence of the n-3 and n-6
polyunsaturated fatty acids. In adulthood, the tissues become progressively
more loaded with fats of that type, leading to greater production of
inflammatory agents such as prostaglandins, and an increasing tendency to
produce lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide. Chronic systemic inflammation
is the central factor in the various degenerative diseases.

**Regarding Testicular Cancer/bleeding during surgery while taking[ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) **  
  
Dear Dr. Peat,  
  
  
First, thank you for all that you do, and have done, for the nutrition and
health community.  
  
  
Second, I have a family member who has recently been diagnosed with testicular
cancer and is slated to have one of his testicles removed on Monday. From what
it sounds like and others have interpreted from your research, testicular
cancer seems to be related to excess unopposed estrogen relative to
testosterone. So far the seemingly easiest remedy seems to be the inclusion of
high dose aspirin in the range of 3-5 grams per day.  
  
  
My question(s) are, is that what you would consider to be accurate and
effective, and if not, what would you suggest? Also, would aspirin prior to
surgery be problematic or would you wait until after the surgery to implement,
if that is what you see as the best course of action?  
  
  
Thank you very much.  
  
**  
HIs Response: **  
  
_If vitamin K is used generously, aspirin wouldn’t be likely to cause a
bleeding problem.[ Progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-
micronized-powder-usp/) could be used to lower luteinizing hormone before
surgery, if that’s high. I think tetracycline (or a derivative) would be
helpful to use with the aspirin. It’s important to check thyroid function and
vitamin D. _

Dear Ray,  
  
Do you think that leaky gut, caused by gluten, could be a main causative
factor in the initiation of type 1 autoimmune diabetes?  
  
I have noticed recently a lot of focus in paleo communities on autoimmune
diets, which omit many potentially allergenic foods, saying they can heal
autoimmune conditions and linking these diseases to leaky gut.

Dear Ray,  
  
I seem to be naturally gravitating / craving a higher fat ratio by calories.
Around 50% fat, 35-40% carbs and 10-15% protein.  
  
I have type 1 diabetes and fat is mostly saturated, except the natural omega 6
content: cheese, cream, butter, eggs etc.  
  
Does this seem too much fat or is there a reason I am likely craving it?  
  
It works out around 115g fat per day.

Dear Ray,  
  
I have type one diabetes and started too fast on cynomel (adrenaline surge I
think as I felt a little wired after 10mcg with food twice a day). I
understand now 4mcg of T3 an hour is typical of the bodies natural rhythm.  
  
What is a typical start dose for T3 and how long until an increase can be
made?  
  
Also, do people usually need cynomel and cynoplus?  
  
There is a lot of confusing info out there.

I suffer from very painful cramps (menses) and recently started 50mg [

I also have cheese for calcium, salt to taste, boiled, salted greens water

mostly white fish or shellfish and cheese for protein each day.  
  
How long is it likely to take to make a difference to the cramps each month?
They were still painful this month, but after only about 3 weeks of the above
protocol. I have type 1 diabetes also.

Dear Ray,  
  
I have tried what seems like every combination of foods out there to control
severe period pains every month.  
  
I tried progest e to no avail. Thyroid meds. Milk, eggs, cheese, coffee,
fruit, liver, oysters etc. I was very constipated and had clots the size of my
thumb each month. I have diabetes type one also. I added vegetables back in
and could at least go to the toilet again that way but the clots were so
painful to pass each month.  
  
I managed one period without pain but with severe exhaustion when I changed to
just vegetables, fruit, fish and meat (no dairy) but I felt very restricted
and lost a lot of weight - I am only 8stone now. I was 9stone previously.  
  
The doctor has now prescribed the contraceptive pill to stop the heavy bleeds
and pains, but it is making me very nauseas and I am terrified of putting this
unnatural thing into my body.  
  
Is there anything that might help me that I could have missed previously? I
wondered if the dairy could be in any way responsible.

My temps in the morning were around 97, I didn't measure at any other time.
They came up a little from 96 initially.  
  
I took progest e on my lips and gums three times a day from mid cycle onwards.  
  
Blood glucose was pretty good considering all the sugar which surprised me
(until I read your articles) starch seemed to cause issues as it kicked in a
long time after eaten when taken with fats so I had a low after eating it then
a high later, due to rapidity of insulin I take. Insulin stayed roughly the
same - always goes up mid cycle onwards anyway.  
  
I took vitamin d drops (coconut oil ones) as my levels came back low about 8
months ago. I haven't tested again since. Take about 10,000iu per day.  
  
Any ideas much appreciated - I want to stop this pill I am just very afraid of
the severe pain of menses again.

Dear Ray,  
  
I am struggling to control my blood sugar levels (bsl's) when eating fruits
with type one diabetes.  
  
I have read your diabetes articles.  
  
A typical meal for me would be protein plus fruit and fats, maybe eggs with OJ
and gelatine and a coffee with milk and sugar.  
  
I get a high bsl soon after followed by a crash. I take Novorapid insulin and
inject ahead of time as from trials it takes about 20 mins to move my blood
sugars.  
  
Added fat seems to slow sugar entry and I may get a low level after food
followed by having to rescue levels with coca cola (UK so sugar not HFCS),
then a high bsl later when everything is digested from the meal.  
  
Is it just a case of tweaking ratios of macros to suit the injectable insulin
I take?  
  
Cynoplus has not made much difference to bsl's, pulse and temp up though.  
  

> Ray Peat said:

Morning 6am:  
  
Take 10units Detemir long acting insulin  
Take 1 unit Novorapid to prevent dawn phenomenon blood sugar rise  
  
8am  
Take 4 units Novorapid  
Eat 400ml OJ plus gelatine  
Eat 2 eggs boiled  
1 mug coffee with milk and 2 heaped sugars  
Bsl goes from 5mmol up to 12mmol within 20-30mins then if I leave it (no
insulin correction) will drop after about an hour and a half to 3.2mmol then I
need sugar.  
  
Mid morning: large bunch grapes (about 500g) and cheese (40g) take 4 units
Novorapid. Bsl spikes to around 13.5mmol then drops low 3.6mmol after a couple
of hours.  
  
Evening meal (I eat more snacks in between)  
Cod and well boiled potatoes with salt and butter and runner beans and glass
of OJ.  
  
Inject 4 units Novorapid. Bsl drops within 45 mins to 3.5mmol and I drink coke
to bring up. During night, bsl spikes as high as 16mmol when presumably potato
has been digested or rebound reaction.  
  
I take Detemir before bed also, 10 units (long acting insulin)  
  
I take cynoplus through the day, 1 tablet split into 5/6 pieces plus progest
exon second half of cycle and the other supplements I mentioned.

Dear Ray,  
  
I recently had TPO antibodies show up on a blood test. I have had type one
diabetes for 28yrs.  
  
I gave up gluten soon after the results, last August.  
  
Just starting to eat more fructose, no grains, dairy out for now as it causes
acne probably due to leaky gut from gluten. I will reintroduce later.  
  
Is Cynomel okay to take with diabetes and TPO antibodies. I understand T4
conversion can be problematic?  
  
I was also wondering if paying for a full thyroid blood panel would be wise to
see if the antibodies have halted since avoiding gluten or would this be a
waste of money?

Thank you Ray.  
  
Yes, TSH was 3.9, it has gone up recently. That was Aug 2015, the one prior in
Sept 2014 was 0.93.  
  
Would a full thyroid panel be worth the money? I was considering dosing T3 on
symptoms alone.

I am trying to decide the best route to obtain thyroid meds for type 1

Dear Ray,  
  
With type one diabetes, what foods would you recommend, if dairy cannot
currently be eaten, to ensure bowel movements? I understand milk provides
bulk.  
  
Is commercial pasteurised not from concentrate orange juice okay as the staple
of my diet?  
  
And should potatoes be avoided altogether with type one diabetes, if they are
likely to increase endotoxins, or are they okay if baked and topped with
butter and salt?

No cheese as yet, I'm getting married next month so wanted to avoid risking
the acne dairy causes me until after then. Which cheeses are best to start
with please?  
  
I tried eggshells tonight, I was wondering how much eggshell is recommended to

Hey Dr. Peat,  
  
I recently made an observation that I wanted to ask you about.  
  
I am a mathematics student at university and I often find that mathematics
professors are authoritative and tend to put down students for getting an
incorrect answer.  
  
It seems like they do not like questions very much, on the other hand the
humanities professors seem more open to student involvement and questioning.  
  
Do you think that this is a product off the culture that mathematicians are
involved in?  
  
Or is it a result of mathematical rigid thinking that changes the structure of
their brain away from analogous thinking to logical thinking?  
  
Or both?  
  
I was thinking that people choose mathematics as a professor because they want
to maintain an illusion of certainty in their minds, which stands in
opposition to questioning and exploration.  
  
I also think that the repetitive, monotonous calculations might be related to
serotonin levels somehow, and as a result hostility and aggression?  
  
What do you think?  
  
thanks, Jake

Dr. Peat,  
  
I have severe pelvic floor dysfunction, with sometimes static digestion. I've
relied on marijuana to sleep and control my restless leg. Every time I stop
marijuana, I have quite severe pupil dilation, sweating, and piloerection.
Also, I have very apparent veins in the palms of my hand and blotchy hand
skin.  
  
T4 helped me initially (12 mcg), but I suffered from eye pain, worsening
restless legs, and very dry skin. I switched to T3. Though T3 felt very good,
on it I was plagued with eye infections, rather than eye pain, and very dry
nostrils.  
  
Despite the cortisol reaction to t4, might it still benefit me to combine the
t4 with t3? Might the pupil dilation indicate pituitary damage, perhaps
secondary to the marijuana?  
  
Most Respectfully Yours,  
  
James  
  
RAY PEAT REPLIES:  
  
"Adrenaline can increase to compensate for low thyroid function, and causes
pupils to dilate. Thyroxin by itself works when your liver is in good
condition, supplied with enough glucose, and not stressed by adrenaline and
other stress hormones. Something that contains both T4 and T3 is better for
getting out of a stress pattern. Armour thyroid or Novotiral might work better
than Eutirox. Too much of the weed interferes with liver function, and while
it’s recovering it’s necessary to be careful to get enough protein and other
nutrients every day, for example orange juice, eggs, milk, cheese, cooked
mushrooms, occasional shellfish."

"For about a month, I took 30-40k IUs daily vitamin a. Might that account for
some eye troubles and very dry skin? I read a chinese paper that [ taurine

help hypervitaminosis a, do you know of anything else, and would transthyretin
saturation by A interfere with supplemental t4? As with all of us, i
appreciate your dedication and humanity ineffably."  
  
Ray:  
"Vitamin A oxidizes easily and an excess can create symptoms of a deficiency,
so vitamin E is the most important thing for correcting it; excess vitamin A,
like PUFA, interferes with thyroid hormone transport, so it’s important to
balance the two."

_The dry skin and weak pulse suggest very low thyroid function. The salmon,
avocado, and rice are a good balance of fat, protein, and carbohydrate; maybe
fat cheese could be substituted for the salmon sometimes. Both sugar and fat
stimulate the digestive system hormone that stimulates brain cell renewal.[

I asked Dr Peat about Lysine supplementation and I got an answer :)  
  
My question:  
I know you’re not a big fan of individual amino acid supplementation, but if
we assume we have a pure source of L-lysine, is it a wise decision to take it
daily for its benefits on opposing gut serotonin and NO?  
  
Dr Peat's answer:  
If its use relieves symptoms, it should be safe, but I think there’s always
some risk with manufactured amino acids. Taking it with a meal would reduce
risk of inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Tinnitus is a perceived sensation of sound without actual acoustic  
  
stimulation. Currently there are no standardized drug therapies for the
treatment  
  
of tinnitus patients. A potential novel treatment for chronic tinnitus is  
  
naltrexone. Tinnitus can be considered an auditory phantom phenomenon similar
to  
  
phantom pain. Naltrexone acts predominantly on μ-opioid receptors which are  
  
present in multiple areas of the brain, including the thalamus, dorsal part of  
  
the anterior cingulate, insula, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and ventromedial
to  
  
orbitofrontal cortex. These areas overlap with the areas involved in  
  
tinnitus-related distress. The aim of the present study is to investigate
three  
  
doses of naltrexone, namely 5, 12.5, and 50 mg and determine their influence
on  
  
tinnitus complaints. We conducted a 4-week single-center, open-label treatment  
  
study.  
  
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 86 patients received the drug treatment, while 30
patients  
  
received no treatment.  
  
RESULTS: Overall tinnitus distress was significantly reduced for the drug  
  
treatment group, while for the waiting control group this was not the case. No  
  
significant effect could be obtained for tinnitus intensity. A closer look at
the  
  
data indicates that this effect is mainly generated due to a significant  
  
difference in the 50 mg drug treatment group for tinnitus distress.  
  
CONCLUSION: our results indicate that naltrexone might have an effect on
tinnitus  
  
distress and more particularly higher doses of naltrexone.

Dear Dr. Peat,  
  
  
I’m 34/male.  
  
  
Why would T3 or something like high-dose caffeine+ [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) induce water
retention, often within minutes of ingestion? It also happens at a lower dose
of the pro-thyroid substance when followed by a burst of physical activity.
Strangely, simply high-dose caffeine improves body tone at the expense of a
very shrunken penis owing perhaps to its [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) increasing
effect. It manifests itself as puffiness of the chest and abdomen. My thighs
become much larger and jiggly while my calve muscles lose definition. The
overall puffiness usually resolves at least partially overnight. I also have
spider angiomas on the inside of my thighs close to the knee indicating high
oestrogen. However, the strange thing is that the water-retention problem
doesn’t really go away even using strong aromatase inhibitors like letrozole
or exemestane, neither with a few weeks of high dose zinc or even vitamin E.  
  
  
Are there circumstances when exogenous thyroid or pro-thyroid substances can
lead to an elevation in the body’s oestrogen load? The usual explanation from
the literature is that excess thyroid increases SHBG levels and because of the
different binding capabilities of the steroids to the SHBG, the effective
androgenic/oestrogen ratio is adversely affected. Others suggest that thyroid
is flushing the oestrogen from the tissues and into the bloodstream; it’s an
intermediate state one has to soldier through. Some argue about a copper
toxicity syndrome. And there are those who argue for nutrient deficiencies, or
even a down regulation of 5aR activity.  
  
  
A lot of folks on [ raypeatforum.com ](http://raypeatforum.com/) also report
similar experiences, so I was wondering if you could shed some light on why
this is happening?

Question on [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) I sent
to Dr Peat and he kindly gave me an answer.  
  
My question:  
"I started supplementing DHEA (3 x 5 mg a day, at least six hours between
doses) four days ago with a lot of full-fat milk to bypass the liver
metabolism of DHEA and possibly avoid converting it to estrogen. I am 26 years
old. Do you think what I am doing is reasonable? What else can I do to make
DHEA more androgenic than estrogenic? My family have noticed that my teeth are
whiter than usual lately, could DHEA be responsible?"  
  
Dr Peat's response:  
"Thyroid and other antiinflammatory things (even [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) ) help to
prevent conversion to estrogen. Since stress can quickly decalcify teeth, a
good state without stress should make teeth whiter."

Regarding Meniere's disease-  
  
Hypothyroidism leads to increased estrogen and nitric oxide, and a decreased
serum osmolarity (increased dilution of body fluids) and hyponatremia. Salt,
magnesium, calcium, [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-
usp-grade-aspirin/) , antihistamine, [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) ,
tetracycline (or minocycline, doxycycline) and thyroid can correct the fluid
imbalance.

Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with Ménière's disease.  
Brenner M(1), Hoistad DL, Hain TC.  
(1)Department of Otolaryngology, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.  
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of hypothyroidism in a population of  
patients with Ménière's disease (MD).  
DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study comparing the use of thyroid hormone  
supplements between patients with MD and controls.  
SETTING: Outpatient neurology clinic specializing in the management of
patients  
experiencing dizziness.  
PATIENTS: Fifty patients who met the 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology  
criteria for MD and 50 controls matched for age and sex also experiencing  
dizziness.  
RESULTS: The 50 patients who met the criteria for MD were identified from a  
database of more than 2000 patients with dizziness seen over a 5-year period.
Of  
these, 16 (32%) were taking thyroid hormone supplements in contrast to 2 (4%)
of  
the 50 matched controls (P<.001). The median age of the patients with MD was
60  
years, and 5 (19%) of the 26 patients younger than 60 years were taking
thyroid  
hormone supplements, compared with 11 (46%) of 24 patients 60 years or older  
(P<.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the severity
of  
hearing loss, pattern of hearing loss, or prevalence of bilateral hearing loss  
between patients with MD who were taking thyroid hormone supplements and
patients  
with MD who were not.  
CONCLUSION: Ménière's disease is associated with corrected hypothyroidism.

There are few reports on the course of Ménière's disease during pregnancy. We  
report here the clinical course of Ménière's disease before, during and after  
pregnancy and discuss the possible effect of pregnancy on Ménière's disease
and  
the treatment of Ménière's disease during pregnancy. In the present case, the  
vertigo attacks increased up to 10 times per month **during early pregnancy,
when  
the serum osmolality was significantly below normal at 268 mosm/kg. ** As the  
pregnancy proceeded, the serum osmolality normalized and the vertigo attacks  
decreased in frequency. The vertigo attacks were treated by oral isosorbide
and  
intramuscular injection of low-dose diazepam. The coincidence of the decline
in  
osmolality with the increase in vertigo attacks points to serum osmolality as
a  
possible factor in the effect of pregnancy on Ménière's disease.

Premenstrual exacerbation of Meniere's disease revisited.

Some women with Meniere disease demonstrate exacerbation of symptoms during
the  
premenstrual period. It is believed that the hormonal stress of the
premenstrual  
period acts on the volatile inner ear with Meniere disease to result in  
dysfunction. Migraine, Meniere disease, and the premenstrual period may be a  
complex interaction leading to exacerbation of symptoms. Having patients
maintain  
a daily calendar of symptoms, diet, and menses can be helpful in understanding  
the disease as well as instigating treatment monitoring. Most patients can be  
effectively managed with dietary sodium restriction and a loop diuretic.

Changes in Ménière's disease responses as a function of the menstrual cycle.  
Morse GG (1), House JW.  
(1)Division of Nursing, California State University, Dominguez Hills 90747,
USA.  
[ gmorse@soh.csudh.edu ](mailto:gmorse@soh.csudh.edu)  
BACKGROUND: Ménière's disease is a complex, progressive disorder of the inner
ear  
evidenced by characteristic responses including vertigo, hearing loss, and  
tinnitus. Though considered equally common across sexes, several recent
studies  
describe women's increasing reports of symptom exacerbation during the  
perimenstruum. Empirical evidence proving this relationship is limited with no  
study exploring women's symptom reports using appropriate methodological  
procedures for menstrual cycle research.  
OBJECTIVES: To establish the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and  
Ménière's disease responses. Specific aims included comparison of Ménière's  
disease responses between menstruant women and men (control group) and  
examination of women's Ménière's disease responses and their relationship to  
their diverse menstrual symptom patterns.  
METHODS: Using a longitudinal, descriptive design, 12 men and 13 women were  
recruited via Internet and participated in daily data collection procedures
over  
three study phases.  
RESULTS: Results showed that Ménière's disease responses were similar for men
and  
women participants. Women with premenstrual magnification patterns did not
vary  
with cycle phases. However, **vertigo (P < .05) did decrease significantly  
postmenses for women with premenstrual syndrome patterns. **  
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provide evidence that a unique
relationship  
does exist between the menstrual cycle and Ménière's disease responses for
some  
women. Knowledge gained from this study is beneficial in identifying the  
importance of appropriate clinical assessment methods of menstruant women with  
Ménière's disease. Recommendations include further research with larger
samples  
and testing of different symptom management strategies for women of different  
perimenstrual symptom patterns.

Immunohistochemical investigations of the guinea pig cochlea, using a specific  
antibody to the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS/NOS II), have been  
performed 3 weeks after closure of the right endolymphatic duct (n=7).  
Endolymphatic hydrops, the morphological substrate of Meniere's disease,
became  
evident by distension of the Reissner's membrane. iNOS expression could be
noted  
in endothelium, spiral ganglion cells, in nerve fibers, in supporting cells of  
the organ of Corti and cells of the spiral ligament. Temporal bones of  
non-operated controls (n=6) as well as of sham-operated animals (n=3) did not  
show structures positive to iNOS. These findings imply that iNOS-generated NO  
could be involved in the pathophysiology of cochlear dysfunction in Meniere's  
disease.

Immunohistochemical investigations of the guinea pig vestibular system, using

been performed 3 weeks after surgical closure of the right endolymphatic duct
(n

excavation of the Reissner's membrane in all seven animals. Those animals  
revealed iNOS-expression in ganglion cells, in the wall of blood vessels and
in  
nerve fibers of the right vestibular system, while the corresponding left  
temporal bones and temporal bones of non-operated controls (n = 6) as well as
of  
sham-operated animals (n = 3) did not show any iNOS-positive structures.  
iNOS-generated NO could be involved in the pathophysiology of vestibular  
dysfunction in Meniere's disease.

Hey Ray!  
In an interview with John Barkhausen you mentioned that "A millionth of a gray
is known to produce bystander effects."  
  
\- Do you have any studies suggesting this?  
English, russian, whatever language they're in, they would be very useful.  
Also, what is you opinion on the new 'millimetre wave machines' at US
airports?  
  
**Ray's response:**

My 86-year-old mother developed a migraine in early February. It persisted for
weeks and soon involved hallucinations, plus many other symptoms, such as
internal tremors, sweats, indigestion, and emotional meltdowns. We went to
many doctors. A few were interested and thoughtful, but even the good ones did
not fix anything. I finally asked Dr. Peat for a recommendation. We had been
using the 3-drop doses of Progest-E, spaced 10 minutes apart.  
  
  
Dr. Peat's response:  
"An eighth of a teaspoon [of Progest-E] (taken with a little food is o.k.)
might be enough for her to notice a definite effect. All of the symptoms you
mention, even without the high TSH, should have made the doctors think of
hypothyroidism. (Did they even take her temperature?) A blood test for T3,
reverse T3, T4, and cortisol would probably show that the synthroid isn’t what
she needs. The liver’s ability to change T4 to T3 decreases with age."  
  
  
  
The bigger dose a few times a day has been helpful, as has the coming of
spring.  
  
And, no, nobody took her temperature.

>  METHODS: Twenty-six swine underwent percutaneous femoral puncture for

>  Contralateral control infusions of normal saline were also administered.
> Acute  
>  hemodynamic and angiographic outcomes were assessed. After recovery,
> follow-up  
>  angiography and sacrifice were performed at either 10 or 28 days. Brains
> and  
>  retia were harvested for gross and microscopic histopathologic evaluation.  
>  RESULTS: No significant hemodynamic alterations occurred acutely. Twenty-
> three of  
>  the 24 infused retia showed variable acute vasospasm that typically was
> mild to  
>  moderate in severity and transient (10 to 20 minutes). Follow-up
> angiography at  
>  sacrifice always showed normal retial arterial anatomy. No adverse clinical  
>  sequelae were noted. Gross inspection of brains showed no evidence of
> infarction  
>  or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Microscopic histopathologic examination of

>  showed mostly nonspecific changes in both exposed and control samples.
> Possible  
>  causal histotoxicity was seen in four retia (three of four exposed to

>  BACKGROUND: The infusion of PBSC or BM cells cryopreserved with DMSO is  
>  associated with frequent, but generally minor, toxicity. The incidence and  
>  severity of infusion-related toxicity is proportional to the amount of DMSO  
>  infused. In an attempt to reduce the incidence of symptoms reported by

>  receiving cryopreserved PBSC and to avoid the necessity of diphenhydramine  
>  premedication, we studied the infusion of PBSC components from which the
> DMSO was  
>  depleted after thawing.  
>  METHODS: This was a Phase I/II study of post-thaw removal of DMSO. Patients  
>  undergoing autologous PBSC transplantation with components cryopreserved
> using  
>  10% DMSO were eligible. The PBSC components were thawed, diluted with 10%  
>  dextran-40 and 5% HSA, centrifuged to remove the DMSO, resuspended in
> dextran and  
>  HSA, and infused without prior medication of the patient. Visual analog
> scale  
>  questionnaires were used for measurement of infusion-related symptoms.  
>  RESULTS: Five patients were enrolled on this study and received washed PBSC  
>  components. One patient experienced severe infusion-related toxicity and
> the  
>  study was stopped for safety reasons. Events experienced by these patients  
>  included flushing (two patients), emesis (three patients), and post-
> infusion  
>  rigors (two patients). Two patients reported an increase in nausea after
> the  
>  infusion. All patients achieved granulocyte engraftment (an ANC > 0.5 x
> 10(9)/L)  
>  at a median of 14 days and platelet engraftment (platelet count without  
>  transfusion > 20 x 10(9)/L) at a median of 11 days. No patient required

I asked Peat about MDMA :  
  
**_Question :_ **  
Do you think it's an overall serotonergic substance and hence bad for health ?
Do you think the possibly biochemical bad effects are a minor side-effect of
the positive ones ? I'm interested on any comment, idea or feeling about it
that you might hav **e.  
  
_Answer :_ **  
In pure form and moderate dose (e.g., 1 to 1.5 mg per kg body weight), I think
it’s likely to be helpful for changing the pattern of chronic stress/learned
helplessness, and maybe the chronic degenerative diseases produced by
inescapable stress. The production of nitric oxide is likely to be a problem
with large doses or chronic use.

The serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) is present in B-cell clones of diverse  
malignant origin: probing a potential anti-tumor target for psychotropics.

Following our previous description of the serotonin transporter (SERT) acting
as  
a conduit to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-mediated apoptosis, specifically in  
Burkitt's lymphoma, we now detail its expression among a broad spectrum of B
cell  
malignancy, while exploring additional SERT substrates for potential
therapeutic  
activity. SERT was readily detected in derived B cell lines with origins as  
diverse as B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mantle cell
lymphoma,  
diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Concentration and
timecourse  
kinetics for the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of the
amphetamine  
derivatives fenfluramine (an appetite suppressant) and  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "Ecstasy") revealed them as being  
similar to the endogenous indoleamine. A tricyclic antidepressant,
clomipramine,  
instead mirrored the behavior of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  
fluoxetine, both being effective in the low micromolar range. A majority of  
neoplastic clones were sensitive to one or more of the serotonergic compounds.  
Dysregulated bcl-2 expression, either by t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation or
its  
introduction as a constitutively active transgene, provided protection from  
proapoptotic but not antiproliferative outcomes. These data indicate a
potential  
for SERT as a novel anti-tumor target for amphetamine analogs, while evidence
is  
presented that the seemingly more promising antidepressants are likely
impacting  
malignant B cells independently of the transporter itself.

Enhancing the anti-lymphoma potential of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine

While 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA/'ecstasy') is cytostatic towards  
lymphoma cells in vitro, the concentrations required militate against its  
translation directly to a therapeutic in vivo. The possibility of 'redesigning  
the designer drug', separating desired anti-lymphoma activity from unwanted  
psychoactivity and neurotoxicity, was therefore mooted. From an initial
analysis  
of MDMA analogues synthesized with a modified α-substituent, it was found that  
incorporating a phenyl group increased potency against sensitive,
Bcl-2-deplete,  
Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells 10-fold relative to MDMA. From this lead,
related  
analogs were synthesized with the 'best' compounds (containing 1- and
2-naphthyl  
and para-biphenyl substituents) some 100-fold more potent than MDMA versus the
BL  
target. When assessed against derived lines from a diversity of B-cell tumors  
MDMA analogues were seen to impact the broad spectrum of malignancy.
Expressing a  
BCL2 transgene in BL cells afforded only scant protection against the
analogues  
and across the malignancies no significant correlation between constitutive
Bcl-2  
levels and sensitivity to compounds was observed. Bcl-2-deplete cells
displayed  
hallmarks of apoptotic death in response to the analogues while BCL2  
overexpressing equivalents died in a caspase-3-independent manner. Despite  
lymphoma cells expressing monoamine transporters, their pharmacological
blockade  
failed to reverse the anti-lymphoma actions of the analogues studied. Neither
did  
reactive oxygen species account for ensuing cell death. Enhanced cytotoxic  
performance did however track with predicted lipophilicity amongst the
designed  
compounds. In conclusion, MDMA analogues have been discovered with enhanced  
cytotoxic efficacy against lymphoma subtypes amongst which high-level  
Bcl-2--often a barrier to drug performance for this indication--fails to
protect.

This research is designed to further understand the effects of the novel drug  
MDMA on biologic receptor of DNA. The ultimate goal is to design drugs that
have  
higher affinity with DNA. Understanding the physicochemical properties of the  
drug as well as the mechanism by which it interacts with DNA should ultimately  
enable the rational design of novel anticancer or antiviral drugs. Molecular  
modeling on the complex formed between MDMA and DNA presented this complex to
be  
fully capable of participating in the formation of a stable intercalation
site.  
Furthermore, the molecular geometries of MDMA and DNA bases (Adenine, Guanine,  
Cytosine, and Thymine) were optimized with the aid of the B3LYP/6-31G* method.  
The properties of the isolated intercalator and its stacking interactions with  
adenine···thymine (AT) and guanine···cytosine (GC) nucleic acid base pairs
were  
studied with the DFTB method. DFTB method is an approximate version of the DFT  
method that was extended to cover the London dispersion energy. The
B3LYP/6-31G*  
stabilization energies of the intercalator···base pair complexes were found to
be  
-9.40 and -12.57 kcal/mol for AT···MDMA and GC···MDMA, respectively. Results from   
comparison of the DFTB method and HF method conclude close results and support  
each other.

Previous studies have demonstrated that caffeine administration to adult mice  
potentiates glial activation induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA).  
As neuroinflammatory response seems to correlate with neurodegeneration, and
the  
young brain is particularly vulnerable to neurotoxicity, we evaluated dopamine  
neuron degeneration and glial activation in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and  
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of adolescent and adult mice. Mice were  
treated with MDMA (4 × 20 mg/kg), alone or with caffeine (10 mg/kg).
Interleukin  
(IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)  
were evaluated in CPu, whereas tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary
acidic  
protein, and CD11b were evaluated in CPu and SNc by immunohistochemistry. MDMA  
decreased TH in SNc of both adolescent and adult mice, whereas TH-positive
fibers  
in CPu were only decreased in adults. In CPu of adolescent mice, caffeine  
potentiated MDMA-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein without altering
CD11b,  
whereas in SNc caffeine did not influence MDMA-induced glial activation. nNOS,  
IL-1β, and TNF-α were increased by MDMA in CPu of adults, whereas in
adolescents,  
levels were only elevated after combined MDMA plus caffeine. Caffeine alone  
modified only nNOS. Results suggest that the use of MDMA in association with  
caffeine during adolescence may exacerbate the neurotoxicity and  
neuroinflammation elicited by MDMA. Previous studies have demonstrated that  
caffeine potentiated glial activation induced by  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in adult mice. In this study,
caffeine  
was shown to potentiate MDMA-induced dopamine neuron degeneration in
substantia  
nigra pars compacta, astrogliosis, and TNF-α levels in caudate-putamen of  
adolescent mice. Results suggest that combined use of MDMA plus caffeine
during  
adolescence may worsen the neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation elicited by
MDMA.

Studies on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("ecstasy")-induced neurotoxicity  
mainly focus on damage of serotonergic terminals. Less attention has been
given  
to neuronal cell death produced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and other  
amphetamines in areas including the cortex, striatum and thalamus. In the
present  
study we investigated 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity
in  
neuronal serum free cultures from rat cortex. Since  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine intake induces hyperthermia in both animals
and  
humans, the experiments were performed under normal (36.5 degrees C) and  
hyperthermic conditions (40 degrees C). Our findings showed a dose-, time- and  
temperature-dependent apoptotic cell death induced by  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in cortical neurons.  
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced damage was potentiated under  
hyperthermia. The neurotoxicity was reduced by the serotonin 2A-receptor  
antagonists, ketanserin and  
(2R,4R)-5-[2-[2-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]phenoxy]ethyl]-1-methyl-3-pyrrolidinol  
hydrochloride, in both normothermic and hyperthermic conditions.  
(+/-)-2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride, a model agonist for the  
serotonin 2A-receptor, also induced a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic cell  
death. Again, protection was provided by ketanserin and  
(2R,4R)-5-[2-[2-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]phenoxy]ethyl]-1-methyl-3-pyrrolidinol  
hydrochloride against (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride-
induced  
neurotoxicity, thereby indicating that the 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  
stimulation of the serotonin 2A-receptor leads to neurotoxicity. This study  
provides for the first time evidence that direct  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine serotonin 2A-receptor stimulation leads to  
neuronal cortical death. alpha-Phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone a free radical  
scavenger and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine as
well  
as the NMDA-receptor antagonist MK-801 provided protection under normothermia
and  
hyperthermia, thereby suggesting the participation of free radicals in  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced cell death. Since  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine serotonin 2A-receptor agonistic properties
lead  
to neuronal death, clinically available atypical antipsychotic drugs with  
serotonin 2A-antagonistic properties could be a valuable therapeutic tool
against  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced neurodegeneration.

Several amphetamine analogs are potent psychostimulants and major drugs of
abuse.  
In animal models, the psychomotor and reinforcing effects of amphetamine,  
methamphetamine (METH), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; Ecstasy), and  
methylphenidate (MPD; Ritalin) are thought to be dependent on increased  
extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) in mesocorticolimbic and mesostriatal  
pathways. However, amphetamine analogs that increase primarily serotonergic  
transmission, such as p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) and fenfluramine (FEN), have
no  
potential for abuse. High doses of METH, MDMA, PCA, and FEN produce depletions
of  
dopaminergic and serotonergic nerve terminal markers and are considered as  
potential neurotoxicants. The first part of this review briefly summarizes the  
behavioral and neurotoxic effects of amphetamines that have a different
spectrum  
of activity on dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The second part
discusses  
evidence supporting involvement of the nitrergic system in dopamine-mediated  
effects of amphetamines. The nitrergic system in this context corresponds to  
nitric oxide (NO) produced from neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that has  
roles in nonsynaptic interneuronal communication and excitotoxic neuronal
injury.  
Increasing evidence now suggests cross talk between dopamine, glutamate, and
NO.  
Results from our laboratory indicate that dopamine-dependent psychomotor,  
reinforcing, and neurotoxic effects of amphetamines are diminished by  
pharmacological blockade of nNOS or deletion of the nNOS gene. These findings,  
and evidence supporting the role of NO in synaptic plasticity and neurotoxic  
insults, suggest that NO functions as a neuronal messenger and a neurotoxicant  
subsequent to exposure to amphetamine-like psychostimulants.

Mechanism of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy)-mediated

Despite numerous reports citing the acute hepatotoxicity caused by  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (ecstasy), the underlying mechanism
of  
organ damage is poorly understood. We hypothesized that key mitochondrial  
proteins are oxidatively modified and inactivated in MDMA-exposed tissues. The  
aim of this study was to identify and investigate the mechanism of
inactivation  
of oxidatively modified mitochondrial proteins, prior to the extensive  
mitochondrial dysfunction and liver damage following MDMA exposure. MDMA-
treated  
rats showed abnormal liver histology with significant elevation in plasma  
transaminases, nitric oxide synthase, and the level of hydrogen peroxide.  
Oxidatively modified mitochondrial proteins in control and MDMA-exposed rats
were  
labeled with biotin-N-maleimide (biotin-NM) as a sensitive probe for oxidized  
proteins, purified with streptavidin-agarose, and resolved using 2-DE.  
Comparative 2-DE analysis of biotin-NM-labeled proteins revealed markedly  
increased levels of oxidatively modified proteins following MDMA exposure.
Mass  
spectrometric analysis identified oxidatively modified mitochondrial proteins  
involved in energy supply, fat metabolism, antioxidant defense, and chaperone  
activities. Among these, the activities of mitochondrial aldehyde
dehydrogenase,  
3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolases, and ATP synthase were significantly inhibited
following  
MDMA exposure. Our data show for the first time that MDMA causes the oxidative  
inactivation of key mitochondrial enzymes which most likely contributes to  
mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent liver damage in MDMA-exposed animals.

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity in
mice:  
a possible mechanism underlying neurotoxicity.

Comment in  
Br J Pharmacol. 2010 May;160(2):217-9.  
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) causes a  
persistent loss of dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra of mice.  
Current evidence indicates that such neurotoxicity is due to oxidative stress
but  
the source of free radicals remains unknown. Inhibition of mitochondrial
electron  
transport chain complexes by MDMA was assessed as a possible source.  
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Activities of mitochondrial complexes after MDMA were  
evaluated spectrophotometrically. In situ visualization of superoxide
production  
in the striatum was assessed by ethidium fluorescence and striatal dopamine  
levels were determined by HPLC as an index of dopaminergic toxicity.  
KEY RESULTS: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine decreased mitochondrial complex
I  
activity in the striatum of mice, an effect accompanied by an increased  
production of superoxide radicals and the inhibition of endogenous aconitase.  
alpha-Lipoic acid prevented superoxide generation and long-term toxicity  
independent of any effect on complex I inhibition. These effects of alpha-
lipoic  
acid were also associated with a significant increase of striatal glutathione  
levels. The relevance of glutathione was supported by reducing striatal  
glutathione content with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, which exacerbated  
MDMA-induced dopamine deficits, effects suppressed by alpha-lipoic acid. The  
nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, partially prevented  
MDMA-induced dopamine depletions, an effect reversed by L-arginine but not  
D-arginine. Finally, a direct relationship between mitochondrial complex I  
inhibition and long-term dopamine depletions was found in animals treated with  
MDMA in combination with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.  
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I following  
MDMA could be the source of free radicals responsible for oxidative stress and  
the consequent neurotoxicity of this drug in mice.

Differential response of nNOS knockout mice to MDMA ("ecstasy")- and  
methamphetamine-induced psychomotor sensitization and neurotoxicity.

It has been shown that mice deficient in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)  
gene are resistant to cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization and  
methamphetamine (METH)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. The present study
was  
undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that nNOS has a major role in
dopamine  
(DA)- but not serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT)-mediated effects of  
psychostimulants. The response of nNOS knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice
to  
the psychomotor-stimulating and neurotoxic effects of  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "Ecstasy") and METH were
investigated.  
Repeated administration of MDMA for 5 days resulted in psychomotor
sensitization  
in both WT and nNOS KO mice, while repeated administration of METH caused  
psychomotor sensitization in WT but not in KO mice. Sensitization to both MDMA  
and METH was persistent for 40 days in WT mice, but not in nNOS KO mice. These  
findings suggest that the induction of psychomotor sensitization to MDMA and
METH  
is NO independent and NO dependent, respectively, while the persistence of  
sensitization to both drugs is NO dependent. For the neurochemical studies, a  
high dose of MDMA caused marked depletion of 5-HT in several brain regions of  
both WT and KO mice, suggesting that the absence of the nNOS gene did not
afford  
protection against MDMA-induced depletion of 5-HT. Striatal dopaminergic  
neurotoxicity caused by high doses of MDMA and METH in WT mice was partially  
prevented in KO mice administered with MDMA, but it was fully precluded in KO  
mice administered with METH. The differential response of nNOS KO mice to the  
behavioral and neurotoxic effects of MDMA and METH suggests that the nNOS gene
is  
required for the expression and persistence of DA-mediated effects of METH and  
MDMA, while 5-HT-mediated effects of MDMA (induction of sensitization and 5-HT  
depletion) are not dependent on nNOS.

Evidence for the involvement of nitric oxide in  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced serotonin depletion in the rat
brain.  
Darvesh AS(1), Yamamoto BK, Gudelsky GA.  
(1)University of Cincinnati, College of Pharmacy, 3223 Eden Ave., Cincinnati,
OH  
45267, USA.  
Production of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species has been thought to  
contribute to the long-term depletion of brain dopamine and serotonin (5-HT)  
produced by amphetamine derivatives, i.e., methamphetamine and  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). In the present study, the effects of  
nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors were examined on the long-term
depletion  
of striatal dopamine and/or 5-HT produced by the local perfusion of malonate
and  
MDMA or the systemic administration of MDMA. The effect of MDMA on nitric
oxide  
formation and nitrotyrosine concentration also was determined. Perfusion with  
MDMA and malonate resulted in a 34% reduction of 5-HT and 49% reduction of  
dopamine concentrations in the striatum. The systemic administration of NOS  
inhibitors, N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride and  
S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (S-MTC), and the peroxynitrite decomposition
catalyst  
Fe(III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride attenuated the  
MDMA- and malonate-induced depletion of striatal dopamine and 5-HT. S-MTC also  
attenuated the depletion of 5-HT in the striatum produced by the systemic  
administration of MDMA without attenuating MDMA-induced hyperthermia.  
Additionally, the systemic administration of MDMA significantly increased the  
formation of nitric oxide and the nitrotyrosine concentration in the striatum.  
These results support the conclusion that MDMA produces reactive nitrogen
species  
in the rat that contribute to the neurotoxicity of this amphetamine analog.

**_Millet Flour and Goitrogens_ **  
Is there any validity to the claim that millet flour contains substances (i.e.
"goitrogens") that suppress thyroid function?

/ [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/)
_ **  
In some of your interviews you said that fat oxidation is best left to the
muscle at rest, since this is their preferred fuel. Wouldn't taking substances
like niacinamide and aspirin interfere with the muscles' ability to oxidise
fat?  

> Ray Peat said:

**_Protein's affect on insulin_ **  
In your article titled "Glycemia, starch, and sugar in context" you stated,  
"...If protein is eaten without carbohydrate, it will stimulate insulin
secretion, lowering blood sugar and activating the stress response, leading to
the secretion of adrenalin, cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin, and other
hormones."  
  
How does eating carbohydrate with protein mitigate insulin secretion? Wouldn't
the presence of carbohydrate, along with the protein, simply stimulate more
insulin resulting in low blood sugar and the consequent rise in stress
hormones?  
  
Unless by carbohydrate you mean fructose, and that it has the same affect on
protein stimulated insulin secretion as it does on glucose stimulated insulin
secretion i.e. it inhibits it.

**_Coconut Oil and the Randle Cycle_ **  
It's known that in the 1940s Bernardo Houssay found that coconut oil protected
animals from poison-induced diabetes and in 1963 Randle described the
inhibition of glucose oxidation by free fatty acids. I'm trying to reconcile
the above two facts; is coconut oil exempt from becoming free fatty acids and
competing with glucose in the randle cycle?  

> Ray Peat said:
>
> Relative to PUFA, yes. When the body contains a lot of PUFA, eating coconut

_**Well cooked potatoes or ripe bananas?** _  
As a main carbohydrate source, between well cooked potatoes and ripe bananas,
which is preferable?  
I'm currently limited to either potatoes or bananas as my main carbohydrate
source. I understand that potatoes can feed bacteria in the gut resulting in
endotoxin and serotonin production; bananas contain serotonin -- yet which of
the two is the lesser evil?  

> Ray Peat said:

_**Cataracts and DNP** _  
You have an article about Cataracts and one about Fatigue, that mentions the
use of DNP as an uncoupler.  
Many incidences of cataracts were reported among those who underwent DNP
treatment for weight loss during the 1930s (Horner 1941).  
  
Do you have any thoughts on the relation between DNP and cataract formation?  
  
My initial thoughts after reading your articles are that the type of fat
stores determined the incidence rate of cataracts i.e. if you burned PUFA via
DNP, the resulting prostaglandins would cause damage to the eye. Ogino &
Yasukura 1950's however found that guinea pigs fed [ vitamin C
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) deficient diet
developed cataracts while those that were supplemented with vitamin C did not.
They went on to isolate the cataractogenic metabolite of DNP and concluded
with, "This suggests that a genetic predisposition plays an important role in
susceptibility to this cataract. This notion is strengthened by the fact that,
in spite of extensive experiments of long duration by many authors, it has
been found impossible to produce dinitrophenol cataract experimentally in
various other species, namely, in rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs,
although Bettman observed dinitrophenol cataract in a special strain of mice."  
  
Could both the type of fat stored, antioxidant deficiency and a genetic
susceptibility explain the incidence rate of cataracts after DNP treatment?  

> Ray Peat said:

**_Topical thyroid ([ NDT ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-
thyroid-natural-desiccated-thyroid-ndt/) ) for male pattern baldness _ **  
In a radio interview, you mentioned the use of caffeine in ethanol solution as
a topical remedy for hairloss or male pattern baldness.  
I have access to a natural desiccated thyroid supplement (NDT) that's in a
solution of DMSO and ethanol. Would applying this to the scalp be superior to
applying caffeine to the scalp?

**_Topical testosterone for Secondary Hypogonadism_ **  
Is the use of topical testosterone 5mg/day (in 1% gel) physiologically sound
for correcting low testosterone levels as a result of secondary hypogonadism?  
After reading many of your articles, my assumption is that a better solution
to secondary hypogonadism is to correct steroid metabolism through diet
(orange juice, milk, eggs, cheese) and a thyroid supplement. This can be
augmented with a supplement of [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) along
with vitamin E, or [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-
micronized-powder-usp/) , or [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) which would
convert into testosterone and DHT while minimizing conversion to estrogen.  
Is my assumption correct? Would the addition of topical testosterone
supplement work in the same direction as the diet and thyroid supplement?  

> Ray Peat said:
>
> Yes, I think a small supplement of testosterone will work in the same

_**Satiety with OJ and Milk** _  
In a number of your articles and in a radio interview, you mention the use of
1-2 quarts of OJ and 2 quarts of milk as a daily therapeutic diet.  
I have tried varying the amounts of OJ and milk for myself but have found that
in order to feel satiated I often have to over consume both which causes me to
put on excess body fat.  
If I count calories to ensure a daily deficit, it often means I have to reduce
saturated fat intake to meet protein and sugar requirements. This however
contributes to the lack of satiety.  
Do you have any thoughts on how to manage satiety levels while maintaining a
small calorie deficit, or at least to stop over consumption of foods like OJ
and milk?

**_Potentiation of synthetic thyroid dissolved in DMSO._ **  
I have access to a synthetic thyroid solution containing T3 and T4 in a 1:2

otherwise alter the effect of the thyroid mixture?

My question to RP: "What is the optimal dose of [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) if
someone opts to supplement it orally?"  
  
RP's response: "Its production decreases fairly steadily with age, from a
daily maximum of 12 to 15 mg in the teens, to nearly zero at 90, so
supplements of 5 to 10 milligrams are usually safe for middle aged people."

I asked ray about how he supposed long distance migratory birds like swallows
(trans-european to africa) could generate enough energy for the intense and
prolonged muscle work of the flight without a seeming abundance of dietary
enegry or large endogenous reserves of substrates for energy that a human
being at its disposal like muscle and fat.  
  
RP said:  
  
"Studies in insect flight muscle found that ATP is synthesised when the muscle
is (passively) stretched; i suppose it happens in birds too. Studies of nerves
show that after heat is emmited during activity, heat is absorbed during
recovery, i.e. The nerve slightly refrigerates its surroundings. The
absorbtion of heat (besides preventing over-heating) as ATP is resynthesized
would make the usual Expectations about chemical energy and work less
applicable."

Q: In your opinion, is a blood test for testosterone accurate for measuring
its adequacy?  
  
A: It has to be interpreted in relation to cortisol, estrogen, and sex hormone
binding globulin.  
  
Q: Would you mind explaining how we can compare these measurements in more
detail? Is estrogen blood test reliable? This is for a male, 35 years old.  
  
A: It’s best to have cortisol no higher than the middle of the range, estrogen
below the middle, testosterone above the middle. A vitamin D supplement often
helps to improve the balance, good thyroid function is essential, adequate
protein, good digestion.  
  
Q: By "estrogen", do you mean blood test for estradiol? What about SHBG, is it
not useful for a male?  
  
A: Yes, blood test. I think the SHBG might be less important for men than for
women.  
  
Q: How about if a woman decides to check these hormones, how would SHBG play
into it? At what point in her menstrual cycle is it best to do the tests, or
is that not relevant for these ratios?

Answers to questions about headaches accompanied by shakiness:  
  
An inefficient liver that, among other things, doesn't store enough glycogen
to last the whole night, is a common cause of both headaches and shakiness.
Lots of light exposure to the whole body helps to increase metabolic
efficiency. Liver and oysters about once a week, while keeping stress low,
have nutrients that help with liver efficiency. Cyproheptadine, a small amount
at bedtime, reduces night stress, might help the headaches and shakiness.  
  
Low blood sugar increases the absorption of toxin from the intestine as well
as activating nerve reflexes and inflammation, so keeping the intestine active
and clean with mild fiber, and blocking inflammation with [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) and
antihistamine, is usually helpful.  
  
The herbs can irritate the intestine, and I know someone whose liver function
was worse while she was taking milk thistle--it's good to be cautious with
them.

A: Could rifaximin be helpful for the liver?  
  
Q: Rifaximin is probably safe for short term use.  
  
Toxicol Sci. Oct 2012; 129(2): 456–468.  
Chronic Exposure to Rifaximin Causes Hepatic Steatosis in Pregnane X Receptor-
Humanized Mice  
Jie Cheng, Kristopher W. Krausz, Naoki Tanaka, and Frank, J. Gonzalez 1  
Rifaximin, a nonsystemic antibiotic that exhibits low gastrointestinal
absorption, is a potent agonist of human pregnane X receptor (PXR), which
contributes to its therapeutic efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease. To
investigate the effects of long-term administration of rifaximin on the liver,
PXR-humanized mice were administered rifaximin for 6 months; wild-type and
Pxr-null mice were treated in parallel as controls. Histological analysis
revealed time-dependent intense hepatocellular fatty degeneration and
increased hepatic triglycerides in PXR-humanized mice and not in wild-type and
Pxr-null mice. After long-term treatment, PXR target genes were induced in
small intestine and liver, with significant up-regulation in the expression of
hepatic genes related to triglyceride synthesis and lipid accumulation.
However, no significant hepatic accumulation of rifaximin was found, even
after 6 months of treatment, in PXR-humanized mice. Genes in the small
intestine that are involved in the uptake of fatty acids and triglycerides
were induced along with increased triglyceride accumulation in intestinal
epithelial cells of PXR-humanized mice; this was not observed in wild-type and
Pxr-null mice. These findings suggest that long-term administration of
rifaximin could lead to PXR-dependent hepatocellular fatty degeneration as a
result of activation of genes involved in lipid uptake, thus indicating a
potential adverse effect of rifaximin on liver function after long-term
exposure.

Answer to a question asking about a bad reaction to methylfolate and methyl
B12:  
  
I think it's risky to supplement methyl donors in substantial quantity, such
as choline, betaine, methionine, and S-adenosylmethionine.  
  
The amount of methyl in that form of B12 is so tiny that I think it's more
likely an allergic reaction; folic acid is allergenic too, and the slightly
different manufacturing processes could account for different reactions to
different products.

About suppression of endogenous testosterone production after steroid use;  
  
Q: What do you think would help a male who has used exogenous steroids (not [
pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) /
[ DHEA ](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/)
, but for example testosterone/DHT in high amounts, or any of the "designer"
anabolic steroids) for a while, to the point where the testes have shrunk, and
endogenous testosterone production has obviously been lowered? How do you see
this problem?  
  
A: Testosterone and DHT aren’t toxic, so the testes probably haven’t been
damaged, and would resume functioning with good nutritional support. 100 mg of
pregnenolone and 5 mg of DHEA would probably help their recovery, but I think
it would be good to have your LH and estrogen checked. If the LH is very high,
using a little DHT for a while might be protective until it’s more normal.
Coffee, [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-

From Jun 4, 2011  
  
"Hi Ray, I'm wondering about fruit and its avenues of metabolism. Regarding
this study, [ The effect of two energy-restricted diets, a low-fructose diet
versus a moderate natural fructose diet, on weight loss and metabolic syndrome
param... - PubMed - NCBI ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621801)  
A commenter said,"  
_That study does''t eliminate fructose as one of Kurt Harris‚ neolithic agents
of disease. Nor does it even mean much in the real world.  
Note that both groups were on a calorie restricted diet. The negative effects
of fructose consumption are due to the limited avenues available for its
metabolic disposal via the liver (glycogen or triglycerides), the limited
capacity of those avenues, and its availability in drinkable form (sodas,
fruit juices, smoothies).  
Putting people on a calorie restricted diet ˆ and one that also doesn‚t
include liquids (their most common delivery form, by far) ˆ purposely
eliminates the real-world consumption and metabolic scenario. The danger of
fructose is that its sweet taste tempts us to consume giant boluses of it,
which overwhelm in the short term the ability of our liver to process it (=
glycation = heart disease). In the longer term they overwhelm the ability of
our liver to store it (= NAFLD, T2D, etc.) None of this happens on a calorie-
restricted diet or under conditions of daily intense exercise that continually
depletes glycogen reserves. Thus Grok and the fruitarians.  
I don't enjoy being the wet blanket here, but this study still tells us
nothing about the effects of fruit-sourced fructose eaten as part of a non-
restricted diet ˆ in other words, the real-world case.  
Seriously: I know it's fun to question authority, maaaaaan, but please: let's
all think a bit about the metabolic pathways involved before gleefully setting
fire to everything that got us where we are. _ "  
  
I'm very curious what you think about it."

My question to Ray was regarding rapid onset of mastitis in a middle-aged,
non-lactating woman with a history of prolactinoma. The substances used for
relief were aspirin, bromocriptine and topical lidocaine gel.  
  
Ray's response:  
  
Aspirin, lidocaine, and bromocriptine are all likely to help, but low thyroid
is usually behind an excess of prolactin; in middle age, estrogen tends to
rise as progesterone falls. A good T3 supplement is usually the quickest way
to correct breast inflammation and pain. Have you checked your temperature and
pulse rate? A sluggish intestine interferes with the excretion of estrogen, so
raw carrots or a laxative can often, in just a day or two, increase the ratio
of progesterone to estrogen. Extra salt in your food, and a little vitamin B6
could help to lower the prolactin. Low thyroid increases water retention but
causes sodium loss, and that combination increases swelling and inflammation;
the diuretic effect of tea or coffee might help with the swelling.

In answer to a question about the anaemia of chronic disease and leukaemia....  
  
"Estrogen is a stress and crisis hormone, so there’s a steady upward tendency
in its effect with age, which is interrupted during the fertile years by [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) . Progesterone decline usually starts around age 40 because of things
interfering with thyroid function. Declining liver function and increasing
pituitary activity influence the way problems develop. Oxygen tension is
normally low in bone marrow, and stimulates constant cell proliferation, but
when estrogen’s oxygen-wasting effect is added, it changes the balance of cell
growth; its worst effect is to stimulate fibroblasts and [ collagen
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-beef-grass-fed/)
production in the marrow, displacing the red and white cells. Estrogen shifts
cells from oxidative production of carbon dioxide to the glycolytic formation
of lactic acid, tending to prevent normal differentiation of cell function.
The effects of estrogen include the leakage of the lactic acid-forming enzyme
LDH into the serum, and the increase of copper in the serum, and these are
recognized as signs of CLL, but the genetic-clonal ideology of cancer prevents
recognition of the metabolic pattern. Estrogen causes relative
hyperventilation, reinforcing the cellular changes. CLL seems to be less
common in people adapted to high altitude, where lactic acid formation is
inhibited."

Voluntary hyperventilation for 20 min causes haemoconcentration and an
increase

whether these changes depend on the changes of blood gases or on the muscle

or air with 5% CO2 for a period of 20 min. The partial pressure of CO2
decreased  
by 21.4 mmHg (2.85 kPa; P < 0.001) with air and by 4.1 mmHg (0.55 kPa; P <

Kulshrestha R, Sah SP.  
INTRODUCTION:  
Pattern of leukemia is known to vary widely throughout the world. The
characterization of distribution patterns of different subtypes of leukemia in
Nepal needs further study. We wanted to study the leukemia pattern in our
institute.  
METHODS:  
A retrospective study of 196 cases of leukemia, diagnosed at BPKIHS, between
January 1997 to December 2002 was done. We analyzed the pattern of leukemia at
BPKIHS by morphological subtype, gender, age at diagnosis, time period of
diagnosis (seasonality), and geographic distribution.  
RESULTS:  
Morphological sub typing showed that 121 cases were of acute leukemia and 75
of chronic leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia constituted the single largest
group comprising 35.2 % of all cases, followed by acute myeloid leukemia
(28.57 %) and acute lymphoid leukemia (19.9 %). Maximum numbers of cases were
from the lowlands while least number of cases were from the mountain
districts. Results were compared with literature from Nepal and other
countries. This is the second series of leukemia from Nepal.  
CONCLUSIONS:  
The data published in this study reflects the leukemia pattern in the eastern
region of Nepal. The pattern and distribution of AML, CML, ALL was similar to
that in the developed western countries while the lesser frequency of CLL was
similar to that in Southeast Asian region.

Asked about high blood pressure. I gave a few specifics about my particular
situation (including being overweight), and noted that I previously tried high
dose K2, and magnesium, and that I don't limit salt, so wanted to provide that
context to his answer:  
  
"Have you had a blood test for TSH and vitamin D? High TSH is often the main
factor in high blood pressure, so it should be low. A deficiency of calcium or
vitamin D can increase parathyroid hormone, increasing serum calcium and blood
pressure. Drinking two quarts of low fat milk per day will help to lose weight
and lower blood pressure.

Calcium, parathyroids and aging.  
Fujita T.  
Department of Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.  
Calcium is unique in its distribution in living organisms with an extremely
high  
hard and soft tissue and extra- intracellular concentration gradient. Calcium  
deficiency through stimulating parathyroid hormone secretion tends to blunt
such  
a difference by paradoxically increasing the calcium concentration in the soft  
tissue and intracellular compartment. Since aging is associated with the  
progressive aggravation of calcium deficiency, such blunting also progresses  
with aging. The dysfunction, damage and death of cells occurring in all
diseases  
is always associated with a blunting of the extra- and intracellular calcium  
components. Calcium supplement especially with highly biologically available  
active absorbable calcium, was associated with the suppression of parathyroid  
hormone secretion and the normalization of a such blunting of
intercompartmental  
distribution of calcium examples in hypertension and diabetes mellitus with  
evident improvement of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests.

Parathyroid hormone and genetic hypertension.

Recent research provides evidence that parathyroid hormone is implicated in
the  
pathogenesis of genetic hypertension. Abnormalities in calcium metabolism in  
genetic hypertension have been reported. These include hypercalciuria,
depressed  
serum ionized calcium associated with enhanced serum parathyroid hormone
levels.  
Calcium supplement resulted in normalization of calcium metabolism and
reduction  
in blood pressure. In addition, removal of parathyroid glands attenuated the  
rise in blood pressure in genetic hypertensive rat. This review focuses on the  
links between calcium metabolism and calcium endocrine system abnormalities
and  
the etiology of experimental genetic hypertension. The mechanisms by which  
dietary supplement and parathyroidectomy lower genetic hypertension are also  
discussed. Although the causality of raised parathyroid hormone in genetic  
hypertension is not yet fully understood, we conclude that this hormone may
play  
a permissive effect in the development of hypertension.

Endocrine factors related to changes in total peripheral vascular resistance
after treatment of thyrotoxic and hypothyroid patients.  
Diekman MJ, Harms MP, Endert E, Wieling W, Wiersinga WM.  
Department of Endocrinology, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam,  
The Netherlands.  
OBJECTIVE: Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) decreases in
thyrotoxicosis  
and increases in hypothyroidism. Several mechanisms may be involved, including  
adaptation to changes in heat production and direct non-genomic effects of  
tri-iodothyronine (T3) on vascular smooth muscle cells. The aim of this study
was  
to see if changes in TPR are related to changes in plasma concentrations of
the  
endothelial hormones adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 as well as other hormones  
affecting vasculature. DESIGN: A prospective study. SUBJECTS: Eleven
hypothyroid  
patients (pretreatment: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 68 (38-201) mU/l, T3  
0.7 (0.35-1.5) nmol/l, fT4 3.0 (2.0-5.9) pmol/l, median (range)) and 14 with  
hyperthyroidism (pretreatment: TSH 0.02 (<0.01-0.06) mU/l, T3 6.4 (2.3-13.0)  
nmol/l, fT4 56.1 (22.9-70.0) pmol/l) were studied before treatment and 3
months  
after reaching the euthyroid state. Blood collection was carried out  
simultaneously with the recording of finger arterial pressure (FINAP). Cardiac  
output and TPR were derived from stroke volume computations by modelling flow  
from the FINAP signal. RESULTS: Thyroid-function tests of hypothyroid and  
thyrotoxic patients did not differ after restoration of the euthyroid state.
TPR,  
expressed in arbitrary units (AU), decreased after correction of
hypothyroidism  
(from 1.32+/-0.65 to 0.96+/-0.36 AU, P=0.04) and increased after correction of  
hyperthyroidism (from 0.75+/-0.18 to 1.10+/-0.35 AU, P=0.007). Adrenomedullin  
concentrations did not change during the transition from the hypothyroid state  
3.2(0.9-11.0) pmol/l to the euthyroid state 4.9(0.9-8.6) pmol/l, but decreased  
after treatment of hyperthyroidism, from 5.2(0.9-11.0) pmol/l to 2.2(0.9-5.4)  
pmol/l. Plasma endothelin-1 was undetectable in all samples. Changes in TPR
upon  
treatment correlated with log DeltafT4 (r=-0.65, P=0.001), log DeltaT3,
(r=-0.57,  
P=0.006), Delta noradrenaline (r=0.54, P=0.02) and Delta ANP (atrial
natriuretic  
peptide) (r=-0.59, P=0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated
that  
only T3 was an independent determinant of TPR. Changes in T3 accounted for 46%
of  
the variability in the changes in TPR. CONCLUSIONS: TPR is reduced in  
thyrotoxicosis and increased in hypothyroidism. Restoration of the euthyroid  
state normalizes TPR. Changes in TPR are not related to plasma adrenomedullin  
concentrations, but 46% could be explained by changes in T3. Altered ANP  
secretion and adrenergic tone may contribute to the T3-induced changes in TPR.

Serious primary hypothyroidism, disclosed fortuitously through routine thyroid  
function test derangements, was found in a 40-year-old woman admitted to the  
hospital with a tentative diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. The clinical  
picture and electrocardiographic alterations of pseudo-ischemic heart disease  
associated with hypertension, particularly diastolic, may be the only
significant  
manifestations of hypothyroidism. Substitutive hormone replacement therapy  
enables a good prognosis for children and young adults. A diagnosis of  
hypothyroidism should be considered during the initial evaluation of  
pseudo-ischemic, hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients, even when no  
other signs or clinical symptoms of hormonal deficiency are evident.
Particular  
attention should be paid to female patients, as they are much more frequently  
affected by thyroid pathologies.

Correction of the causes of secondary forms of hypertension usually restores  
blood pressure to normal. Hypothyroidism is a potentially important but  
overlooked cause of hypertension and restoration of euthyroidism with
thyroxine  
therapy usually results in a substantial reduction in both systolic and
diastolic  
blood pressure, especially in younger subjects. The mechanism of hypertension
in  
hypothyroidism is not completely understood: changes in circulating  
catecholamines, their receptors and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
have  
all been implicated. Effective treatment with thyroxine is readily available
and  
inexpensive.

Hypothyroidism as a cause of hypertension.  
Saito I, Ito K, Saruta T.  
To study whether there is an association between hypertension and
hypothyroidism,  
measurements of blood pressure and thyroid function were determined in 477
female  
patients with chronic thyroiditis. Based on the blood levels of thyroxine (T4)  
and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 308 patients were considered euthyroid
and  
169 were hypothyroid [T4 = 2.9 +/- 0.1 micrograms/dl and TSH = 105.8 +/- 6.8  
microU/ml (mean +/- SEM)]. Diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure in  
hypothyroid patients over 50 years was higher than in euthyroid patients of  
corresponding age groups. The prevalence of hypertension was higher in  
hypothyroid patients when hypertension was defined as the systolic and/or  
diastolic blood pressure above 160/95 mm Hg (14.8% vs 5.5%; p less than 0.01).  
Correlations between diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure and either
the  
blood level of triiodothyronine (T3) or T4 was significant (r = - 0.174, p
less  
than 0.01, and r = 0.208, p less than 0.01, respectively) when data from both  
euthyroid and hypothyroid patients were combined. Adequate thyroid hormone  
replacement therapy for an average 14.8 months in 14 patients resulted in a  
normalization of thyroid function and a reduction of blood pressure (p less
than  
0.01). In four who showed no change in thyroid function due to inadequate  
replacement therapy, blood pressure remained elevated. These results suggest a  
close association between hypertension and hypothyroidism.

Hypertension in hypothyroidism: arterial pressure and hormone relationships.  
Richards AM, Nicholls MG, Espiner EA, Ikram H, Turner JG, Brownlie BE.  
To investigate the regulation of arterial pressure and vasoactive hormones in  
hypothyroidism associated with hypertension, we measured intra-arterial
pressure  
and hourly venous hormones (renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, catecholamines  
and cortisol) for 24 hours in five hypertensive patients with primary  
hypothyroidism before commencing treatment, and again after three to six
months  
of thyroxine replacement therapy. Arterial pressure fell significantly after  
thyroxine replacement in four patients. Thyroxine treatment was associated
with a  
fall in plasma norepinephrine levels together with a decline in slopes of  
norepinephrine/arterial pressure regression lines which suggests that the  
sympathetic system may contribute to the hypertension in hypothyroidism.  
Variability of heart rate, blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine fell with  
thyroxine replacement consistent with impaired damping of swings in
sympathetic  
activity in the untreated state. Reciprocal changes in arterial pressure and  
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity suggested that this system was
not  
the mediator of hypertension in hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism has been known to be associated, at times, with diastolic  
hypertension. We have found in 40 thyrotoxic patients that the induction of  
hypothyroidism by radioiodine therapy significantly increased diastolic blood  
pressure, raising it above 90 mm Hg in 16 (40%) of the patients. Restoration
of  
euthyroidism with thyroxine administration significantly reduced the systolic
and  
diastolic blood pressures in these patients, with a fall in diastolic pressure  
below 90 mm Hg in nine of 16 patients. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was  
determined by measurements of serum thyroxine and thyrotropin concentrations
in  
688 consecutive hypertensive patients, referred for evaluation and therapy of  
their hypertension. Hypothyroidism was found in 25 (3.6%) of the patients.  
Restoration of normal serum thyroxine and thyrotropin levels with thyroid
hormone  
replacement therapy lowered diastolic blood pressure to levels below 90 mm Hg
in  
32% of these patients who could be followed up after withdrawal of all  
antihypertensive drug therapy when euthyroidism had been restored (i.e., 1.2%
of  
the 688 patients). It is concluded that diastolic hypertension resulting from  
hypothyroidism is a relatively common disorder, present in 1.2% of our
referred  
hypertensive patients, that should be sought and treated.

Fregly MJ, Rossi F, Cade JR.

32610-0274.  
The systolic blood pressures of two groups of rats that were exposed to cold
(5  
degrees C) for 4 weeks were elevated significantly above that of warm-
acclimated  
controls maintained at 24 degrees C. At this time these groups were given the  
antithyroid drug aminotriazole in their food at 0.3 g/kg. At the same time,
one  
group was given 15.8 micrograms thyroxine (T4)/kg body mass per day, while the  
second received 31.6. The doses were chosen as replacement (15.8
micrograms/kg)  
and twice replacement (31.8 micrograms/kg) for the rats. The results of the
study  
revealed that both groups receiving aminotriazole and T4 had reductions in
blood  
pressure within 1 week of initiation of treatment. Blood pressures reached  
control level after 5 weeks. Cardiac hypertrophy accompanying cold-induced  
hypertension was reduced with the lower dose of T4 and prevented with the
higher  
dose. Serum concentrations of T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) in the two treated  
groups were reduced, while serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration and  
thyroid mass were increased above that of the warm-acclimated control group.
This  
suggests that the rats were hypothyroid relative to the warm-acclimated
control  
group. However, the treated rats grew at the same rate as nontreated,  
cold-exposed controls and had similar food and water intakes, a similar  
dipsogenic response to acute administration of isoproterenol, and similar
colonic  
temperatures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

I asked Ray whether it is possible for someone to start using T3 who has been
running on adrenaline for so long without it making it worse.  
  
He replied:  
  
When T3 is used in small doses, such as 3 or 4 mcg at a time, it can be very
effective for lowering adrenalin by letting glucose be more fully oxidized.
It’s helpful to keep a chart of your waking and midday temperature and pulse
rate to watch the cumulative effects of the T3, so you can adjust the dose. A
dose at bedtime typically makes it possible to go to sleep quickly; it should
be supported by things like orange juice, cheese, and milk. A [ natural

"Her taste for starches and sweet pastry is probably because she isn’t able to
store glycogen efficiently, with stress hormones causing her to metabolize
glucose quickly and wastefully. In hypothyroidism, chronically high free fatty
acids interfere with the production of energy needed to stop the stress that
keeps the fatty acids high. The starches are probably contributing to
inflammation and the production of serotonin. Small doses of an antibiotic
such as tetracycline or erythromycin can sometimes lower intestinal serotonin
production, but it’s best to find an antiseptic food that can be used
daily—well cooked mushrooms and bamboo sprouts are alternatives to raw carrot.
Finding alternative foods for the starches might be possible—cakes can be made
with powdered milk instead of flour, with eggs; salty meats (puffed pork
rinds, or bacon fried in coconut oil, for example, can be used to make finely
shredded carrots tasty); chewy gelatin with various flavors; and things like
cream-puffs or yorkshire pudding, that minimize the use of flour, might help
to lower her serotonin. I don’t think anesthesia should be combined with
cyproheptadine, but I think dentists are too aggressive in treating deciduous
teeth; the important thing is to improve her digestion and hormones as her
permanent teeth are developing. The so-called temporary fillings, made of zinc
oxide and eugenol, are very easy to put in, and are antiseptic and mildly
anesthetic topically. (I had them in wisdom teeth, and they lasted for years.)
X-rays, anesthesia, and drilling into invisible cavities have their place in
especially problematic adult teeth, but seem inappropriate for teeth that will
soon be gone."

Within tumors, some areas are less oxygenated than others. Since their home  
ground is under chronic hypoxia, tumor cells adapt to this condition by  
activating aerobic glycolysis; however, this hypoxic environment is very harsh  
for incoming immune cells. Deprivation of oxygen limits availability of energy  
sources and induces accumulation of extracellular adenosine in tumors.  
Extracellular **adenosine, upon binding with adenosine receptors on the
surface of  
various immune cells, suppresses pro-inflammatory activities. ** In addition,  
signaling through adenosine receptors upregulates a number of anti-
inflammatory  
molecules and immunoregulatory cells, leading to the establishment of a  
long-lasting immunosuppressive environment. **Thus, due to hypoxia and
adenosine,  
tumors can discourage antitumor immune responses no matter how the response
was  
induced, whether it was spontaneous or artificially introduced with a
therapeutic  
intention. Preclinical studies have shown the significance of adenosine in
tumor  
survival strategy by demonstrating tumor regression after inactivation of  
adenosine receptors, ** inhibition of adenosine-producing enzymes, or reversal
of  
tissue hypoxia. These promising results indicate a potential use of the  
inhibitors of the hypoxia-adenosine pathway for cancer immunotherapy.  
  
Adenosine A2A Receptor: A Prognosis Marker For Lung Cancer  
Tech ID: 08-11  
Summary  
The role of angiogenesis in tumor survival and metastasis is now well
recognized. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha
are both known to induce angiogenesis by upregulating a common set of
cytokines, including VEGF, but only the activation of HIF-2alpha has been
associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer. However, since HIF-2alpha is
highly labile, it is a poor candidate for a biomarker.  
Scientists at National Jewish Health have discovered that the receptor
Adenosine A2A (ADORA2A) is expressed only in response to HIF-2alpha activation
and more importantly that the expression of ADORA2A is increased in later
stage lung tumors.  
This receptor could therefore be used as a prognosis marker for lung cancer as
well as a potential new target for an anti-angiogenic approach to treating
lung cancer.

Antonia SJ5.  
Recently it has become clear that the cost associated with the Warburg effect,
which is inefficient production of ATP, is offset by selective advantages that
are produced by resultant intracellular metabolic alterations. In fact tumors
may be addicted to the Warburg effect. In addition these alterations result in
changes in the extracellular tumor microenvironment that can also produce
selective advantages for tumor cell growth and survival. One such
extracellular alteration is increased adenosine concentrations that have been
shown to impair T cell mediated rejection and support angiogenesis. The
expression of the A2A receptor in non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) tissues, cell
lines and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) was determined by performing
immunohistrochemistry and immunoblot analysis. The efficacy of the A2A
receptor antagonists in vivo was evaluated in a PC9 xenograft model. To
determine the mode of cell death induced by A2A receptor antagonists flow
cytometry, immunoblot, and cytotoxic analysis were performed. We found that a
significant number of lung adenocarcinomas express adenosine A2A receptors.
Antagonism of these receptors impaired CAF and tumor cell growth in vitro and
inhibited human tumor xenograft growth in mice. These observations add to the
rationale for testing adenosine A2A receptor antagonists as anticancer
therapeutics. Not only could there be prevention of negative signaling in T
cells within the tumor microenvironment and inhibition of angiogenesis, but
also an inhibitory effect on tumor-promoting, immunosuppressive CAFs and a
direct inhibitory effect on the tumor cells themselves.

Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by etomoxir impairs NADPH production and  
increases reactive oxygen species resulting in ATP depletion and cell death in  
human glioblastoma cells.

(1)Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA 01862, USA.  
Normal differentiated cells rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative  
phosphorylation to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to maintain their  
viability and functions by using three major bioenergetic fuels: glucose,  
glutamine and fatty acids. Many cancer cells, however, rely on aerobic
glycolysis  
for their growth and survival, and recent studies indicate that some cancer
cells  
depend on glutamine as well. This altered metabolism in cancers occurs through  
oncogene activation or loss of tumor suppressor genes in multiple signaling  
pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Myc pathways. Relatively  
little is known, however, about the role of fatty acids as a bioenergetic fuel
in  
growth and survival of cancer cells. Here, we report that human glioblastoma  
SF188 cells oxidize fatty acids and that inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation
by  
etomoxir, a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 inhibitor, markedly reduces
cellular  
ATP levels and viability. We also found that inhibition of fatty acid
oxidation  
controls the NADPH level. In the presence of reactive oxygen species scavenger  
tiron, however, ATP depletion is prevented without restoring fatty acid  
oxidation. This suggests that oxidative stress may lead to bioenergetic
failure  
and cell death. Our work provides evidence that mitochondrial fatty acid  
oxidation may provide NADPH for defense against oxidative stress and prevent
ATP  
loss and cell death.

Oxygen consumption can regulate the growth of tumors, a new perspective on the  
Warburg effect.

BACKGROUND: The unique metabolism of tumors was described many years ago by
Otto  
Warburg, who identified tumor cells with increased glycolysis and decreased  
mitochondrial activity. However, "aerobic glycolysis" generates fewer ATP per  
glucose molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in terms of  
energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less efficient process
provides  
tumors with a growth advantage.  
METHODS/FINDINGS: We carried out a screen for loss of genetic elements in  
pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth as tumors, and identified  
mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28 (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these
cells  
decreased mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but paradoxically,  
decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following Warburg's observations, this  
mutation causes decreased mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in  
glycolysis and accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either  
mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome oxidase had a
similar  
effect. **Conversely, expression of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1
(UCP1)  
increased oxygen consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of  
tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased pyruvate
consumption  
in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen consumption, increased tumor
hypoxia  
and slowed tumor growth. **  
CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these findings to show that non-oncogenic genetic  
changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism can regulate tumor growth through  
modulation of the consumption of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting  
substrate for tumor proliferation.

to treat human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
METHODS: The viability and proliferation of human NSCLC cell lines A549 and
H1299  
were assessed in vitro. Anti-tumor action was also evaluated in A549 xenograft  
nude mice treated with DEX (2 or 4 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), ig) or the positive
control  
tamoxifen (50 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), ig) for 32 d. The expression of estrogen  
sulfotransferase (EST) in tumor cells and tissues was examined. The
intratumoral  
estrogen levels and uterine estrogen responses were measured.  
RESULTS: DEX displayed mild cytotoxicity to the NSCLC cells (IC50 >500 μmol/L)  
compared to tamoxifen (IC50 <50 μmol/L), but it was able to inhibit the cell  
proliferation at low micromolar ranges. Furthermore, DEX (0.1-10 μmol/L)  
dose-dependently up-regulated EST expression in the cells, and inhibited the
cell  
migration in vitro. Triclosan, a sulfation inhibitor, was able to diminish  
DEX-caused inhibition on the cell viability. In A549 xenograft nude mice, DEX
or  
tamoxifen administration remarkably suppressed the tumor growth. Moreover, DEX  
administration dose-dependently increased EST expression in tumor tissues, and  
reduced intratumoral estrogen levels as well as the volumes and weights of
uteri.  
CONCLUSION: DEX suppresses the growth of A549 xenograft tumors via inducing
EST  
and decreasing estradiol levels in tumor tissues, suggesting that DEX may be
used  
as anti-estrogenic agent for the treatment of NSCLC.

OBJECTIVES: Based on recent findings of aromatase and estrogen receptor beta  
(ERβ) expression in non-small-cell lung cancer, we assessed the  
clinicopathological and prognostic significance of aromatase and ERβ
expression  
and their relationship to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in  
lung adenocarcinoma.  
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 150 resected primary lung adenocarcinoma  
specimens. Expression of aromatase, ERα, ERβ, progesterone receptor (PR), and  
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was evaluated by
immunostaining,  
and EGFR and KRAS mutations were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) and  
recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
RESULTS: Expression of aromatase, ERα, ERβ, PR, and HER2 was detected in
88.0%,  
1.3%, 79.3%, 2.7%, and 39.3% of specimens, respectively. In patients with EGFR  
wild-type lung adenocarcinoma, high aromatase expression was an independent  
predictor of poor OS (hazard ratio

* * *

=2.638; 95% confidence interval [CI],  
1.173-5.936; P=.019) and RFS (HR=2.505; 95% CI, 1.154-5.434; P=.020). Positive  
ERβ expression was also an independent predictor of poor RFS (HR=4.013; 95%
CI,  
1.219-13.207; P=.022). Furthermore, high aromatase expression was a
significant  
predictor of poor survival only in females (OS, P=.010; RFS, P=.007), whereas  
positive ERβ expression was an important predictor of poor survival only in
males  
(OS, P=.073; RFS, P=.051). No prognostic significance was observed in patients  
with EGFR mutations.  
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma is
an  
estrogen-dependent carcinoma, and aromatase expression and ERβ expression are  
potent prognostic markers for EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma.

Human aromatase (CYP19) responsible for the conversion of androgens to
estrogens  
is expressed not only in gonads and adrenals but also in many other tissues,  
including normal lungs and lung cancers. To investigate the involvement of
CYP19  
in lung cancer development, purified CYP19 protein and antibody are required.
In  
this study, we have developed an efficient expression method of human
aromatase  
in E. coli (>1000 nmol/L culture). The protein purified from E. coli was used
to  
raise an antibody against the human CYP19 in rabbits. The resulting antibody  
showed a high titer judged by ELISA, which allowed us to determine the
expression  
of CYP19 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Of 78 NSCLC specimens from  
Japanese patients, 50 (64%) NSCLC aberrantly expressed CYP19. This CYP19  
expression in NSCLC was independent of any clinical and pathological
parameters  
as well as the expression of other P450s, except tumor stage. The results
suggest  
that the aromatase inhibitors might be useful for the management of non-small  
cell lung cancer in postmenopausal women.

Lung cancer has become increasingly common in women, and gender differences in  
the physiology and pathogenesis of the disease have suggested a role for  
estrogens. In the lung recent data have shown local production of estrogens
from  
androgens via the action of aromatase enzyme and higher levels of estrogen in  
tumor tissue as compared with surrounding normal lung tissue. High levels of  
aromatase expression are also maintained in metastases as compared with
primary  
tumors. Consistent with these findings, clinical studies suggest that
aromatase  
expression may be a useful predictive biomarker for prognosis in the
management  
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung
malignancy.  
Low levels of aromatase associate with a higher probability of long-term
survival  
in older women with early stage NSCLC. Treatment of lung NSCLC xenografts in
vivo  
with an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) alone or combined with standard  
cisplatin chemotherapy elicits a significant reduction in tumor progression as  
compared to paired controls. Further, lung cancer progression is also governed
by  
complex interactions between estrogen and growth factor signaling pathways to  
stimulate the growth of NSCLC as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis. We
find  
that combination therapy with the multitargeted growth factor receptor
inhibitor  
vandetanib and the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant inhibit tumor
growth  
more effectively than either treatment administered alone. Thus, incorporation
of  
antiestrogen treatment strategies in standard antitumor therapies for NSCLC
may  
contribute to improved patient outcome, an approach that deserves to be tested
in  
clinical trials.

AIM: To study effects of acetazolamide on aquaporin-1 (AQP(1)) protein
expression  
and angiogenesis.  
METHODS: Establishing Lewis-lung-carcinoma model, the localization of AQP(1)
in  
tumor tissues was investigated by immunohistochemical methods; The biological  
activity of acetazolamide was detected by endothelial cells proliferation test  
(MTT) assay and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) vascular inhibition test.  
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical localization of AQP(1) in mice tumor was labeled
in  
capillaries, post capillary venules endothelial cells. After being treated
with  
acetazolamide, the number of capillaries and post capillary venules was  
significantly decreased in tumor tissue. Acetazolamide showed significant  
inhibitory effect on angiogenesis in CAM and endothelial cell proliferation.  
CONCLUSION: Acetazolamide might be identified and developed as one of
potential  
lead compounds for a new therapeutic intervention in inhibiting cancer  
angiogenesis.

This study investigated the mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of emodin, an  
active anthraquinone, on human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. In vitro growth  
inhibition and suppression on colony forming were used to evaluate the effects
of  
emodin on A549 cells. Emodin's ability in changing the expressions of  
apoptosis-related genes was studied by real-time RT-PCR. Emodin could  
significantly inhibit the growth of A549 cells with IC50 = 16.85 μg/ml (~60
μM).  
It also concentration dependently inhibited the colony-forming ability of A549  
cells with IC50 = 7.60 μg/ml (~30 μM). Hallmarks of apoptosis, such as  
single-strand DNA breakage and DNA fragmentation, were observed in A549 cells  
treated with emodin. Emodin (72 h) treatment could up-regulate the gene  
expression of FASL (p < 0.05) and down-regulate the gene expression of C-MYC
(p <  
0.01), but induce no significant changes in the gene expressions of MCL1,
GAPDH,  
BAX and CCND1. These results suggest that emodin could induce growth
inhibition  
and apoptosis in A549 cells through modifying the extrinsic apoptotic pathways  
and the induction of cell cycle arrest.

Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is a natural occurring  
anthraquinone derivative isolated from roots and barks of numerous plants,
molds,  
and lichens. It is found as an active ingredient in different Chinese herbs  
including Rheum palmatum and Polygonam multiflorum, and has diuretic,  
vasorelaxant, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory,  
and anti-cancer effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of emodin have been  
exhibited in various in vitro as well as in vivo models of inflammation
including  
pancreatitis, arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis and glomerulonephritis. As an  
anti-cancer agent, emodin has been shown to suppress the growth of various
tumor  
cell lines including hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic, breast, colorectal,  
leukemia, and lung cancers. Emodin is a pleiotropic molecule capable of  
interacting with several major molecular targets including NF-κB, casein
kinase  
II, HER2/neu, HIF-1α, AKT/mTOR, STAT3, CXCR4, topoisomerase II, p53, p21, and  
androgen receptors which are involved in inflammation and cancer. This review  
summarizes reported anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of emodin, and  
re-emphasizes its potential therapeutic role in the treatment of inflammatory  
diseases and cancer.

This study explores the link between the antiproliferative activity of emodin  
through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various cancer cell  
lines and the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) in the prostate cancer  
cell lines LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and PC-3 (androgen-refractory), as well
as  
the pro-metastatic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)
in  
the above prostate cancer cells and the nonprostate cell lines A549 (lung),  
HCT-15 (colon) and MG-63 (bone) under normoxic and hypoxia-like conditions.
Among  
all cell lines, emodin showed most growth inhibition in LNCaP, followed by
A549.  
The mechanism of cytotoxicity of emodin was postulated to be the widely
reported  
ROS generation, based on the observations of poor in vitro radical-scavenging  
activity and increased growth inhibition of emodin by ascorbic acid (AA)  
pre-treatment owing to the additive effects of ROS generation by emodin and  
pro-oxidant effects of AA. Emodin downregulated AR in LNCaP under normoxic and  
hypoxia-like conditions (simulated by CoCl(2)) and LRP1 under normoxia. Emodin  
upregulated LRP1 in other cell lines, except HCT-15, under normoxic, and even  
more markedly under hypoxia-like conditions. The downregulation of AR in LNCaP  
and upregulation of LRP1 in all cell lines, except HCT-15, under hypoxia-like  
conditions along with growth inhibition by emodin, suggests that emodin may be
a  
useful therapeutic option against androgen-sensitive prostate cancer and other  
such LRP1-expressing cancers to attempt the targeting of the elevated LRP1
levels  
to allow the uptake of emodin and/or any other accompanying therapeutic agents
by  
LRP1.

To aim of this was to observe emodin-mediated cytotoxicity and its influence
on  
Rad51 and ERCC1 expressionin non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC cells
were  
cultured in vitro with emodin at various concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100  
μmol/L) for 48 h and the proliferation inhibition rate was determined by the
MTT  
method. Then, NSCLC were treated with emodin (SK-MES-1 40 μmol/L, A549 70
μmol/L)  
or 20 μmol/L U0126 (an ERK inhibitor) for 48 h, or with various concentrations
of  
emodin for 48 h and the protein and mRNA expressions of ERCC1 and Rad51 were  
determined by RT-PCR and Western blot assay, respectively. Emodin exerted a  
suppressive effect on the proliferation of NSCLC in a concentration dependent  
manner. Protein and mRNA expression of ERCC1 and Rad51 was also significantly  
decreased with the dose. Vacuolar degeneration was observed in A549 and SK-
MES-1  
cell lines after emodin treatment by transmission electron microscopy. Emodin
may  
thus inhibited cell proliferation in NSCLC cells by downregulation ERCC1 and  
Rad51.

Comment in

Emodin (ED), an anthraquinone derivative, has been found to inhibit  
proliferation, induce apoptosis, suppress angiogenesis, impede metastasis, and  
enhance chemotherapy. However, the detailed mechanism of ED related to the  
regulation of CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) gene expression that affects  
cellular migration and invasion in prostate and lung cancer cells are not
fully  
understood. Recent evidence indicates that the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis is involved
in  
promoting invasion and metastasis in tumors. Thus, novel agents that can  
downregulate CXCR4 expression have therapeutic potential in repressing cancer  
metastasis. Among ED and its derivatives, it is found that ED downregulated
the  
expression of both CXCR4 and HER2 without affecting cell viability in tumor  
cells. The suppression of CXCR4 expression by ED was found to correlate with
the  
inhibition of CXCL12-induced migration and invasion of both DU145 and A549
cells.  
Besides, neither proteasome inhibition nor lysosomal stabilization had any
effect  
on ED-induced decrease in CXCR4 expression. The basic molecular mechanisms  
unveiled that the downregulation of CXCR4 was at the transcriptional level, as  
indicated by downregulation of mRNA expression and suppression of NF-κB  
activation. Overall, our findings suggest that ED is a novel blocker of CXCR4  
expression and, thus, has enormous potential as a powerful therapeutic agent
for  
metastatic cancer.

Gastric mucosal lesions produced by intravenous infusion of aspirin in cats.  
Bugat R, Thompson MR, Aures D, Grossman MI.  
Aspirin was given by continuous intravenous infusion to 35 intact cats for 7
days in doses ranging from 25 to 200 mg kg-1 day-1. Gastric mucosal lesions
occurred in 50 to 70% of the animals in the various dosage groups, including
deep ulcers in 20%. All of the ulcers were in antral mucosa near its border
with oxyntic mucosa. The incidence of lesions, including ulcers, showed no
apparent relation to the dose of aspirin. With all but the highest dose,
plasma salicylate levels were within or below what is regarded as the
therapeutic range for man. Asprin, 100 mg kg-1 day-1, was given for 7 days to
4 cats with pouches containing all of the antral mucosa plus some oxyntic
mucosa. One or more deep ulcers occurred in the antral mucosa of the pouches
in each of these 4 cats. The electrical potential difference across the mucosa
did not decrease, and net fluxes of hydrogen ions out of the pouch and of
sodium ions into the pouch did not increase during the 7 days of aspirin
administration despite the occurrence of ulcers in the pouches. It is
concluded that intravenous aspirin, in doses giving plasma levels within or
below the therapeutic range for man, causes gastric mucosal lesions including
deep ulcers within 7 days in cats. These lesions occur without the changes in
electrical potential difference and hydrogen and sodium fluxes that are
regarded as characteristic of the "broken barrier."

Records of 127 cats with arterial thromboembolism (ATE) were reviewed.  
Abyssinian, Birman, Ragdoll, and male cats were overrepresented. Tachypnea
(91%),  
hypothermia (66%), and absent limb motor function (66%) were common. Of 90
cats  
with diagnostics performed, underlying diseases were hyperthyroidism (12),  
cardiomyopathy (dilated [8], unclassified [33], hypertrophic obstructive [5],  
hypertrophic [19]), neoplasia (6), other (4), and none (3). Common
abnormalities  
were left atrial enlargement (93%), congestive heart failure (CHF, 44%), and  
arrhythmias (44%). Of cats without CHF, 89% were tachypneic. Common
biochemical  
abnormalities were hyperglycemia, azotemia, and abnormally high serum  
concentrations of muscle enzymes. Of 87 cats treated for acute limb ATE, 39
(45%)  
survived to be discharged. Significant differences were found between
survivors  
and nonsurvivors for temperature (P < .00001), heart rate (P = .038), serum  
phosphorus concentration (P = .024), motor function (P = .008), and number of  
limbs affected (P = .001). No significant difference was found between
survivors  
and nonsurvivors when compared by age, respiratory rate, other biochemical  
analytes, or concurrent CHE A logistic regression model based on rectal  
temperature predicted a 50% probability of survival at 98.9 degrees F (37.2  
degrees C). Median survival time (MST) for discharged cats was 117 days.
Eleven  
cats had ATE recurrences, and 5 cats developed limb problems. Cats with CHF
(MST:  
77 days) had significantly shorter survival than cats without CHF (MST: 223
days;  
P = .016). No significant difference was found in survival or recurrence rate  
between cats receiving high-dose aspirin (> or = 40 mg/cat q72h) and cats  
receiving low-dose aspirin (5 mg/cat q72h). Adverse effects were less frequent  
and milder for the lower dosage.

group received a 500 mg/kg bolus dose of aspirin intravenously. Duodenal
washouts  
were collected for six hours. The serum and perfusate aspirin content
increased  
significantly after aspirin administration (p = 0.01). However, the pH,  
bicarbonate, sodium, potassium and calcium content in the duodenal outflow did  
not show significant changes between 0 and 6 hours. A significant difference
in  
the perfusate calcium content was present between ASA treated and control cats  
starting at the end of the first hour of the experiment (p=0.005).  
Histopathological examination of the pancreas revealed marked erythrocyte  
extravasation in the ASA treated animals. It is suggested that the ASA-
related  
increase in the calcium secretion of the pancreas should be regarded as an  
indication of aspirin induced pancreatic damage.

The experiments on 42 adult male and females cats showed that acetylsalicylic

of  
100 mg/kg) increase the tension of some visceral (of the myocardium, liver,

Dear Dr. Peat,  
  
silicone-sheets are still considered the "gold-standard" for reducing
hypertrophic scars. What do you think is the mechanism behind this effect?
Maybe CO2 trapping or silicone acting as irritant causing "tissue remodeling"?
Do you have experience with other methods for reducing scars?  
  
Answer:  
  
I had a good experience with reducing a scar by coating it with viscous

Q: "I want to ask you about a quote from Haidut. I remember you saying that
impurities in [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) are responsible for many bad reactions, but I've come to
be suspicious when compounds are said to have mixed good/bad effects (like
estrogen). Thanks for your time Ray, hope you have a good thanksgiving.  
  
"In higher doses, pregnenolone not only saturates the enzymes but also seems
to inhibit 3b-HSD, which is crucial for the synthesis of testosterone. Also,
in lower doses pregnenolone seems to act as an agonist on the androgen
receptor. Higher doses lead to mostly conversion into [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) and as
such an anti-androgenic effect. So, I found what doses in humans would provide
enough pregnenolone for the beneficial effects to be observed without
triggering the negative ones. While I can't divulge what that upper limit is
to avoid getting copied by competitors :) I can tell you that 5mg pregnenolone
per dose WHEN combined with [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) has
these beneficial effects without the negatives." -haidut"  
  
Ray: "When I was buying pregnenolone from the Syntex factory in Mexico,
1984-5, to test its safety I ate a kilogram of it during a year, 3000 to 4000
milligrams per day. I didn’t detect any side effects at all, except that my
skin, that had been sagging over my eyes and on my neck, firmed up. I know a
man in his sixties who is taking a teaspoonful every day, without any bad
effects."

Q: "My girlfriend alternates armour with synthroid, she says some neuropathy
and body pains are better on the synthroid, she's had low cholesterol (I think
148 last time) and craves starch and carbs. I'm guessing her cholesterol is
still low and the t3 is using it up, resulting in a decrease in cortisone, if
synthroid seems better than armour sometimes, would this explain why? Thx"  
  
Ray: "T4 suppresses the pro-inflammatory TSH, without activating the
metabolism, so probably spares the cholesterol and other antiinflammatory
things. Does she eat enough sugar? Starches and irritating, bacteria-
supporting foods increase inflammation and probably interfere with cholesterol
synthesis. Custards, sweet fruits, and Haagen Dazs ice cream are safe ways to
increase cholesterol."

I asked Ray Peat about why it might be that I notice breast pain from taking
bioidentical progesterone like Progest-e and this was his response:  
  
"Have you had a blood test for vitamin D and TSH? High estrogen increases the
conversion of progesterone to the 5- metabolite, but thyroid and progesterone
lower estrogen, preventing the exaggeration of that pathway. A vitamin D
deficiency disturbs many hormones, and can cause breast pain."  
Here are the studies he attached:  
Endocrinology. 2003 Dec;144(12):5650-7.  
Distinct molecular pathways mediate progesterone-induced growth inhibition and  
focal adhesion.  
Lin VC(1), Woon CT, Aw SE, Guo C.  
(1)Department of Clinical Research, Singapore General Hospital, School of  
Biological Sciences, School, Singapore 637616. [ cllin@ntu.edu.sg
](mailto:cllin@ntu.edu.sg) .  
We have reported previously that reactivation of progesterone receptor (PR)  
expression in estrogen receptor (ER)- and PR-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer  
cells enabled progesterone to inhibit cell growth and invasiveness, and to
induce  
remarkable focal adhesions. The present study addressed molecular mechanisms
that  
mediate these anticancer effects of progesterone in the PR-transfected breast  
cancer cells ABC28. In response to progesterone treatment are the marked  
up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21WAF1/CIP1 and  
decreased expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1 that are required
for  
G1 progression and during cell mitosis. Progesterone also induced down-
regulation  
of phosphorylated MAPK (p42/44 MAPK). Furthermore, this study also
demonstrated  
that MEK inhibitor PD98059 that inhibits the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK
also  
caused reduction of cyclin D1 level and inhibition of cell proliferation.
These  
results suggest that inhibition of p42/44 MAPK pathway is part of the
mechanisms  
mediating progesterone's growth-inhibitory effect. On the other hand,  
progesterone-induced focal adhesion is mediated by separate pathway. Whereas  
PD98059 exhibited no effects on cell adhesion, inhibitory antibody to  
beta1-integrin was able to reverse progesterone-induced focal adhesion and  
progesterone-induced increase in the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase.
On  
the other hand, beta1-integrin antibody had no effect on progesterone-mediated  
growth inhibition and on progesterone-mediated expression of cyclins
p21CIP1/WAF1  
and phosphorylation of P42/P44 MAPK. In the context of complex functions of  
progesterone in breast cancer and reproductive organs, identification of
distinct  
pathways offers new strategies for designing therapeutic agents to target the  
specific pathway so as to minimize the side effects.

Membrane 5alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione (5alphaP) receptors in MCF-7 and MCF-10A

20alpha-dihydroprogesterone, with associated changes in cell proliferation and  
detachment.  
Pawlak KJ(1), Zhang G, Wiebe JP.  
(1)Hormonal Regulatory Mechanisms Laboratory, Department of Biology,
University  
of Western Ontario, London, Canada.  
Previous studies have shown that the progesterone metabolite,  
5alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione (5alphaP), exhibits mitogenic and metastatic
activity  
in breast cell lines and that specific, high affinity receptors for 5alphaP
are  
located in the plasma membrane fractions of tumorigenic (ER/PR-positive) MCF-7  
cells. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the mitogenic  
(estradiol; 5alphaP) and anti-mitogenic (3alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one,  
3alphaHP; 20alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, 20alphaHP) endogenous steroid
hormones  
on 5alphaP receptor (5alphaP-R) numbers and on cell proliferation and adhesion
of  
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. Exposure of MCF-7 cells for 24h to estradiol or
5alphaP  
resulted in significant (p < 0.05-0.001) dose-dependent increases in 5alphaP-R  
levels. Conversely, treatment with 3alphaHP or 20alphaHP resulted in
significant  
(p < 0.05-0.01) dose-dependent decreases in 5alphaP-R levels. Treatment with
one  
mitogenic and one anti-mitogenic hormone resulted in inhibition of the  
mitogen-induced increases, whereas treatment with two mitogenic or two  
anti-mitogenic hormones resulted in additive effects on 5alphaP-R numbers.  
Treatments with cycloheximide and actinomycin D indicate that changes in  
5alphaP-R levels depend upon transcription and translation. The non-
tumorigenic  
breast cell line, MCF-10A, was also shown to posses specific, high affinity  
plasma membrane receptors for 5alphaP that were **up-regulated by estradiol**
and  
5alphaP and down-regulated by 3alphaHP. Estradiol binding was demonstrated in  
MCF-10A cell membrane fractions and may explain the estradiol action in these  
cells that lack intracellular ER. In both MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells, the
increases  
in 5alphaP-R due to estradiol or 5alphaP, and decreases due to 3alphaHP or  
20alphaHP correlate with respective increases and decreases in cell
proliferation  
as well as detachment. These results show distribution of 5alphaP-R in several  
cell types and they provide further evidence of the significance of
progesterone  
metabolites and their novel membrane-associated receptors in breast cancer  
stimulation and control. **The findings that 3alphaHP and 20alphaHP down-
regulate  
5alphaP-R and suppress mitogenic and metastatic activity ** suggest that these  
endogenous anti-mitogenic progesterone metabolites deserve considerations in  
designing new breast cancer therapeutic agents.

Weiler PJ(1), Wiebe JP.  
(1)Hormonal Regulatory Mechanisms Laboratory, University of Western Ontario,  
London, Canada.  
Recent observations indicate that the progesterone metabolite,  
5alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione (5alphaP), which is produced at higher levels in  
tumorous breast tissue, promotes cell proliferation and detachment, whereas  
**3alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3alphaHP), which is produced at higher
levels in  
nontumorous breast tissue, suppresses proliferation and detachment of MCF-7 **  
breast cancer cells. The objective of the current study was to determine the  
presence and characteristics of binding sites for these endogenous putative  
cancer-regulating steroid hormones. Radiolabeled 5alphaP and 3alphaHP were
used  
in radioligand binding assays on MCF-7 cell (membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear)  
fractions. Binding of [(3)H]5alphaP and [(3)H]3alphaHP was observed only in
the  
plasma membrane fraction, whereas estradiol binding sites were confirmed in
the  
cytosolic and nuclear fractions. The respective membrane binding sites
exhibited  
specificity for the 5alphaP and 3alphaHP ligands with no appreciable
displacement  
at 200- to 500-fold excess by other steroids. The association rate constants
were  
calculated as 0. 107/min and 0.0089/min and the dissociation rate constants
were  
0\. 049 9 and 0.011 for 5alphaP and 3alphaHP, respectively. Saturation
analyses  
indicated single classes of molecules with dissociation constants of 4.5 and
4.87  
nM and receptor densities of 486 and 629 fmol/mg protein, respectively, for  
5alphaP and 3alphaHP. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to estradiol for 1, 24, 48, and
72  
h resulted in 2.3, 4. 2-, 2.99-, and 1.7-fold increases, respectively, in
5alphaP  
receptor density. 3alphaHP resulted in partial suppression of the  
estradiol-mediated increase in 5alphaP receptor density. This is the first
report  
of receptors for the progesterone metabolites, 5alphaP and 3alphaHP, of their  
occurrence in breast cancer cell membranes, and of **the induction of 5alphaP  
receptors by estradiol. ** The results provide further support for the
potential  
importance of progesterone metabolites in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Of the nearly 1.4 million new cases of breast cancer diagnosed
each  
year, a large proportion is characterized as hormone receptor negative,
lacking  
estrogen receptors (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PR). Patients with  
receptor-negative tumors do not respond to current steroid hormone-based  
therapies and generally have significantly higher risk of recurrence and  
mortality compared with patients with tumors that are ER- and/or PR-positive.  
Previous in vitro studies had shown that the progesterone metabolites,  
5α-dihydroprogesterone (5αP) and **3α-dihydroprogesterone (3αHP),
respectively,  
exhibit procancer and anticancer effects ** on receptor-negative human breast
cell  
lines. Here in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the ability of 5αP
and  
3αHP to control initiation, growth, and regression of ER/PR-negative human
breast  
cell tumors.  
METHODS: ER/PR-negative human breast cells (MDA-MB-231) were implanted into  
mammary fat pads of immunosuppressed mice, and the effects of 5αP and 3αHP  
treatments on tumor initiation, growth, suppression/regression, and  
histopathology were assessed in five separate experiments. Specific  
radioimmunoassays and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to
measure  
5αP, 3αHP, and progesterone in mouse serum and tumors.  
RESULTS: Onset and growth of ER/PR-negative human breast cell tumors were  
significantly stimulated by 5αP and inhibited by 3αHP. When both hormones were  
applied simultaneously, the stimulatory effects of 5αP were abrogated by the  
inhibitory effects of 3αHP and vice versa. **Treatment with 3αHP subsequent to  
5αP-induced tumor initiation resulted in suppression of further tumorigenesis
and  
regression of existing tumors. ** The levels of 5αP in tumors, regardless of  
treatment, were about 10-fold higher than the levels of 3αHP, and the 5αP:3αHP  
ratios were about fivefold higher than in serum, indicating significant
changes  
in endogenous synthesis of these hormones in tumorous breast tissues.  
CONCLUSIONS: The studies showed that estrogen/progesterone-insensitive breast  
tumors are sensitive to, and controlled by, the progesterone metabolites 5αP
and  
3αHP. Tumorigenesis of ER/PR-negative breast cells is significantly enhanced
by  
5αP and suppressed by 3αHP, the outcome depending on the relative
concentrations  
of these two hormones in the microenvironment in the breast regions. The
findings  
show that the production of 5αP greatly exceeds that of 3αHP in ER/PR-negative  
tumors and that treatment with 3αHP can effectively block tumorigenesis and
cause  
existing tumors to regress. The results provide the first hormonal theory to  
explain tumorigenesis of ER/PR-negative breast tissues and support the
hypothesis  
that a high 3αHP-to-5αP concentration ratio in the microenvironment may foster  
normalcy in noncancerous breast regions. The findings suggest new diagnostics  
based on the relative levels of these hormones and new approaches to
prevention  
and treatment of breast cancers based on regulating the levels and action  
mechanisms of anti- and pro-cancer progesterone metabolites.

For anybody interested in Ray's use of painting materials/technique...  
  
Question - "Hi Ray,  
I've often wondered your opinion on the toxicity of oil paints.  
The PUFA is kind of unavoidable but have the pigments, synthetic or otherwise,
ever bothered you?  
I ask as a painting student who works primarily with oils (but tries to avoid
the cadmium/lead/cobalts).  
Thanks for everything and best wishes,  
Lloyd  
PS I was recently re-reading from a copy of Blake's 1809 Exhibition
Descriptive Catalogue - his love of tempera and avoidance of oil (and amusing
notes about Rembrandt and others) for it's blurriness of form struck a chord
with me."  
  
Ray - "Starting in the 1950s I would buy three of the smallest tubes of color,
and a bigger tube of zinc white, and a bottle of turpentine, and paint with a
water-color-like technique, mostly just tinting the paper (no blending on the
paper) so that the little tubes would last for months. In the 1980s my girl
friend complained about the turpentine smell, so when I couldn’t paint outside
(Oregon winter) I started using mostly latex house paints, and sometimes oil
pastels. The disadvantage of a latex or acrylic paint is that it dries so fast
that it doesn’t let you think while mixing colors on a palette. Since I didn’t
have skin contact with the pigments I wasn’t worried about their toxicity, but
I used some paint sticks 20 years ago, and noticed that an umber color was
extremely allergenic or toxic to touch. A few years ago I decided to go back
to oil with turpentine, and learned that the pine turpentine industry has
disappeared—the familiar green and white cans of “pure gum spirits of
turpentine” now contained a gasoline-like petroleum distillate. If pure
turpentine was available, that, with oils, would be my preferred medium."

Dear Dr. Peat,  
  
Coffee consistently causes diarrhoea, insomnia, anxiety and jitteriness, while
caffeine dissolved in vodka or ethanol applied in even large amounts topically
doesn't even interfere with sleep, and actually improves alertness within half
a minute of application. Orally consumed thyroid also gives me very similar
symptoms and curiously seems to increase oestrogenic symptoms like bloat and
emotional lability. In your most recent KMUD interview, you spoke about how
the gut finds it relatively difficult to process pure chemicals, and thus I
was wondering if you think topically applied T3 could be beneficial? If so,
would ethanol be a viable solvent?  
  
Also, can you provide some references showing that good thyroid function leads
to a sterile gut?  
  
**"On the skin it can be very beneficial for rashes and other skin problems,
but I doubt that enough would be absorbed to correct a general hypothyroidism.
If you check your temperature and pulse rate before and after, you can tell
whether it’s affecting your metabolic rate."**

"The people I knew used a 10% solution of progesterone in vitamin E (Progest-E

Here's a study that says 3 mg/kg caffeine is ergogenic, while 6 mg/kg elevates
epinephrine. Considering its half-life, doses above around 600 mg/day will
tend to raise epinephrine in most people, so do you think this is a good
cutoff whereat thyroid (T3 and T4) supplementation should begin to raise temps
and pulse in the place of larger amounts of caffeine (for example 800 - 1600
mg)?  
  
Ray Peat: "As long as it isn’t increasing free fatty acids and glycerol I
think it’s safe, and I suspect that there might be beneficial effects other
than ergogenic at the higher doses. Unless a person is in the habit of
regularly running to exhaustion, that kind of study isn’t very useful."

My father, 69 years old, is suffering from a fatty liver and is wasting away.
I would like to provide him with your insights as they have enlightened me in
many ways and made me skeptical of some prescribed and voluntary treatments.  
  
Background:  
A longtime practitioner of Taoist Tai Chi. He is still a lifetime smoker and
was a moderate drinker (until abstaining two months ago) with a large
gut/waist.  
During an ultrasound to look at fatty deposits on his liver about 10 years
ago, they discovered the aneurism.He has been living with an aortic aneurism
for longer than a decade. He was prescribed Liptor and a calcium beta-clocker.  
  
The Problem:  
Last year he was prescribed Iron supplementation and was taken down to half-
dose for Lipitor and C blocker. After a few months was told to stop as his
Iron levels became high.From December to present, he has been getting cold
after cold with debilitating fatigue. After numberous blood work and
appointments with various specialists, he was diagnosed with Fatty Liver
Disease. His current condition is loss of body fat, water retention,
confusion, low serum sodium, soreness, fatigue and weakness.  
  
The Plan:  
He has a Liver biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks. Yesterday, his meeting with an
INTERNALIST took him off Lipitor, and he was prescribed [ Vitamin B1
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b1-powder-thiamine-hcl-usp-grade/)
and one week of the diuretic teva-spironnolactone, 25mg, 10 tablets with food.
This one week protocol is to releave somewhat but also to leave anough of the
problem to be detected in 2 weeks by the Liver Specialist at biopsy!  
My mother, was at the appointment showed a printout listing the concerns I had
and from that this Doctor agreed to take more blood tests.  
Today, my mother got the support of the Taoist Tai Chi leaders and has agreed
to encourage an Appointment at a Tradition Chinese Medicine doctor that is
highly regarded. He has yet to hear of this and to conceed to this
appointment.  
  
I appreciate the work you've put out there and am hopeful that you will be
able to share some of your time, however, I realize you are likely busy with
painting or writing.  
  
Ray Peat:  
Has he had a vitamin D test? Low thyroid function and vitamin D deficiency are
important factors in the development of fatty liver. Increased parathyroid
hormone is associated with vitamin D deficiency and fatty liver. A good ratio
of calcium to phosphate in the diet helps to lower PTH and improves fat
metabolism. Orange juice and low fat milk help to regulate fat metabolism and
are antiinflammatory. Low serum sodium is often associated with
hypothyroidism. Alcohol shifts metabolism away from oxidation, and that
metabolic shift is responsible for aneurysms as well as fatty liver. [ Aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) , thyroid,
vitamin D, and some of the flavonoids in orange juice help to restore normal
oxidation.

On 10/12/15 Ray Peat answered my email about my father's hypothyroid headache
and how to find a good doctor for him.  
  
Ray Peat: "Mary Shomon’s list of doctors by city includes some comments about
their attitude toward prescribing thyroid. Hypothyroid headaches often result
from the intestinal inflammation associated with the hormone deficiency, and
avoidance of starches (most vegetables, nuts, grains) and unsaturated oils,
and using an anti inflammatory laxative such as [ cascara
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/) , or fiber such as
shredded carrots, boiled bamboo shoots, or boiled white button mushrooms, will
often relieve headaches until the thyroid is corrected.  
The most important things about supplementing thyroid, that most doctors
ignore, are that it should be taken in small divided amounts with meals, and
that the temperature and pulse rate should be measured at waking, midday, and
afternoon, to watch the effects. The active hormone, T3, acts quickly, within
a few minutes, and leaves the body quickly (half of it in a day), while the
precursor thyroxine is hormonally inactive, and accumulates in the body with a
half life of two weeks."

Nature Post Content:

I haven't been active here for a long time, but I decided to share some older
and newer original answers from Ray within the community. For an easy
transferring into the wiki page, I have already seperated them by the right
topic. I hope this will be helpful for some people and bring on some
meaningful discussions.  
  
  
**\--- 2011 ---**  
  
**Myopia / Nearsightedness**  
"My myopia improved about 3 diopters when I spent a few months at high
altitude, and took some [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) . I think it's
the CO2 balance in the tissues with reduced oxygen pressure, Bohr effect. If
you are adapted, the higher altitudes have more effect. The time I noticed the
biggest change I was only at 6600 feet altitude, but shorter stays at 8700
feet caused quick improvement. I used that method for several years and
stopped the progression while I did it, but when I started to read all day
year after year, I neglected it. I got it from Aldous Huxley's Art of Seeing,
describing the Bates method. I worked with an optometrist who had studied at
Ohio State, when their optometry school was progressive."  
  
**Light Sensitivity / Night Blindness**  
Having liver and shellfish once a week to help with the vitamins and trace
minerals, and two quarts of milk per day, and plenty of fruit, should help
with the sensitivity and night blindness.  
  
**Major Benefits of Milk/Cheese**  
"The calcium, accompanied by some saturated fat, is a major benefit of milk
and cheese".  
  
**[ Colostrum ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-colostrum/) and
increased Glutathione **  
"Colostrum is probably o.k., but increasing glutathione isn't necessarily
evidence that something is beneficial; it's a common reaction to injury."  
  
  
**\--- 2012 ---**  
  
**Liver**  
"Too much liver can inhibit thyroid function, so the amount depends on the
individual. I think there are other reasons, but the high A content is the
main one. A high ratio of phosphate to calcium contributes."  
  
**Gelatin**  
"Some people feel better with a tablespoon or two of gelatin with their
regular foods."  
  
**CO2 Bag**  
"I had a two dollar bag of corn meal that got moist and metabolized for
several months, but the movement of air in a house is usually too much for a
bag to make a noticeable difference."  
  
**Salt**  
"Salt appetite is usually a good indicator of need."  
  
**Eye Floaters**  
"Avoiding stress, with occasional liver in the diet, regular eggs, to keep the
vitamin intake high."  
**  
Bloodshot Eyes **  
"Enlarged vessels in the eye, especially if there's yellow around them, are
suggestive of a B vitamin deficiency, especially B2, but there are no really
safe supplements of B2, so having liver once a week would be reasonable."  
  
**[ Aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/)
**  
"I think a little aspirin, regularly if not daily, is good prevention, if you
are sure to get enough vitamin K, to prevent excess bleeding. The amount
depends on how you react to it, and can change as your metabolism adjusts.
Taking some at bedtime can be very helpful for sleeping; sometimes I take
about 500 mg at night, but other times just a little. I think the crystals are
more stable, but I keep the big container (a multi-year supply) in the
freezer, and keep out enough for a couple of months. The powdered forms
developed an acetic acid smell with time, the crystals don't."  
  
****Nutrient Requirement **of a Pure Fruit / No-Fat Diet **:** ** ** **  
"Intestinal bacteria are an important source of B12, and many plant materials
contain some. Carotene can be converted to vitamin A when B12 is available. I
don't think the real causes of a B12 deficiency are known. A generous dietary
source of both A and B12 is desirable, but usually not essential. I think the
main reason for having a significant amount of fat in the diet is for its
effect on digestion."  
  
**Shea Butter**  
"Shea butter has about 3 times as much linoleic acid as coconut oil."

Magnesium Requirement **  
"Getting enough sodium in the diet helps to retain magnesium, but both of them
are lost easily when thyroid function is low; when the thyroid status is good,
the requirement for magnesium is easily met by ordinary foods. The things I
most often recommend for magnesium are the water from boiling greens such as
beet, chard, turnip and kale, and coffee. Magnesium carbonate is a very good
supplement, except that it can cause intestinal irritation. People tell me
that they don't have bowel irritation from magnesium glycinate. Either Mg
chloride or Mg sulfate with baking soda can be absorbed through the skin"

**Mineral Balance**  
"Keeping the TSH a little lower is the best way to assure balance of the

I forgot one more from 2017 about thyroid supplementation. Actually, I asked
him if small doses of thyroid (<5 mcg) should better be taken without a meal,
because of the evidence that food like coffee, calcium or iron interfere wih
thyroid absorption, and if 1/4th of cynoplus (30mcg T4 & 7,5 mcg T3 = 0,75 [
NDT ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-
desiccated-thyroid-ndt/) Grains) before bed needs a meal.  
  
"When you are hypothyroid, there’s usually an increase of stress hormones in
compensation, and they hold up the pulse rate and temperature, especially in
the early morning. T4 builds up in the body in the first few weeks, so it’s
good to stay on a certain dose for at least two or three weeks, watching its
effects, then adding a little to the dose, and watching for gradual reduction
of stress (lower morning numbers, higher midday numbers) and increase of
metabolic rate. It’s best to absorb it slowly, to imitate the normal pattern
of secretion, and food helps to slow the absorption. In the evening a little
milk, rather than a whole meal, is usually enough."

In regard to supplementing thyroid when having an irregular interval of
stress, such as with a 9-5 or school schedule:  
  
With 5 days of work stress, would the T4 cause hyperthyroidism on the weekends
when stress is lower, or would you recommend T3-only to combat the stress (I
know you don't usually)?  
  
"I think a combination or natural thyroid such as Thyrolar, Cynoplus, or
Armour is usually best. A basic antistress action of thyroid is to convert
cholesterol into [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-

](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) , and [
DHEA ](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) ,

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence of a relationship between underweight
or  
obesity and dementia risk. Several studies have investigated the relationship  
between body weight and brain atrophy, a pathological change preceding
dementia,  
but their results are inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the  
relationship between body mass index (BMI) and cortical atrophy among
cognitively  
normal participants.  
METHODS: We recruited cognitively normal participants (n = 1,111) who
underwent  
medical checkups and detailed neurologic screening, including magnetic
resonance  
imaging (MRI) in the health screening visits between September 2008 and
December  
2011\. The main outcome was cortical thickness measured using MRI. The number
of  
subjects with five BMI groups in men/women was 9/9, 148/258, 185/128, 149/111,  
and 64/50 in underweight, normal, overweight, mild obesity, and moderate to  
severe obesity, respectively. Linear and non-linear relationships between BMI
and  
cortical thickness were examined using multiple linear regression analysis and  
generalized additive models after adjustment for potential confounders.  
RESULTS: Among men, underweight participants showed significant cortical
thinning  
in the frontal and temporal regions compared to normal weight participants,
while  
overweight and mildly obese participants had greater cortical thicknesses in
the  
frontal region and the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, respectively.  
However, cortical thickness in each brain region was not significantly
different  
in normal weight and moderate to severe obesity groups. Among women, the  
association between BMI and cortical thickness was not statistically
significant.  
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that underweight might be an important
risk  
factor for pathological changes in the brain, while overweight or mild obesity  
may be inversely associated with cortical atrophy in cognitively normal
elderly  
males.”

Vasectomy and prostate cancer: the controversy reignited

A recent report of a 19% increased risk of death from prostate cancer (CaP) in
men who have had a vasectomy (1) corroborates earlier reports suggesting an
association (2, 3). This prospective study, involving 49 405 men with 24 years
median follow-up, provides the strongest level of evidence to date suggesting
a possible link between vasectomy and CaP and should not be ignored by
policymakers, family planning boards, and service providers.  
  
Previous studies have been inconsistent and the validity of any association
was questioned mainly due to possible detection bias, as well as confounding
by sexually transmitted infections. The robustness of the present study and
the finding of an association with only advanced and lethal CaP, but not early
CaP, suggest that if detection bias were present, it would be minimal and the
outcome, therefore, is likely to be internally valid.  
  
Although there would seem to be limited, external validity in extrapolating
these study findings to the Caribbean given that its study population had a
25% prevalence of vasectomy and was constituted of mostly professional,
Caucasian men, the study findings are actually relevant for the area in a
number of ways. First, the Caribbean area has the highest reported mortality
rate from CaP and no one would want to unwittingly promote a procedure that
has been shown empirically to increase its risk of death; second, there has
been an increase in the number of men requesting vasectomy in Jamaica, mostly
from the young professional and middle class (4), and this is likely to be the
case in other territories as well; and third, the national family planning
board (NFPB, Kingston, Jamaica) has been actively encouraging men to take
greater responsibility for their sexual and reproductive health and to be more
directly involved in family planning. It is likely that men who are more
involved in family planning decisions are more likely to consider having a
vasectomy. Finally, "no-scalpel" vasectomy is encouraged by the NFPB and its
website states that "there are no known long-term effects" of vasectomy (5).  
  
Although there is, as yet, no known biologically-plausible mechanism by which
a vasectomy should increase a man's risk of lethal CaP, the empirical evidence
has shown that it does. Even if this turns out to be a non-causal association,
at the very least, health care providers have a duty to immediately begin
informing men considering vasectomy of the possible increased risk of death
from CaP and to actively follow them after the procedure to ensure that it is
diagnosed early should it arise.  
  
On a broader scale, policymakers, family planning boards, and professional
associations, such as the Caribbean Urological Association and the Jamaica
Urological Society, may want to issue some kind of position statement on
vasectomy so that men and their partners can make informed decisions.

Dear Ray,  
  
I've been suffering from insomnia since childhood (difficulties falling asleep
at night even felling my body tired and very light sleep) and even though I'm
very closely following your advices for 3 years now, nothing seems to improve
regarding this issue.  
I know that you consider that sleep quality is correlated with high resting
energy state of the brain but, despite the fact I've brought back my thyroid
function to an adequate level (cynomel+ [ NDT
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-desiccated-
thyroid-ndt/) leading to highish body temperature and HR) and that I have a
very good diet, my sleep hasn't improved.  
I tried [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-
powder/) , salt, sugar, sodium bicarbonate, bag breathing, carrot salad, low
dose [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/)
(1-2mg), [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-
aspirin/) , sunlight exposure, [ red light
](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/light-therapy/) etc. and
nothing seems to help.  
I also tried valerian and surprisingly, it has a stimulating effect on me. The
only thing that sometimes knocks me out is cyproheptadine (only 0,5 mg) but I
wake up in a very bad mood.  
I might also specify that this problem isn't affected by my psychological
stress level (which is low, most of the time).  
  
Do you think that there might exist other important factors that I'm missing
out?  
  
Best regards,  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**  
Histamine and serotonin promote wakefulness, and cyproheptadine blocks those,
but its other effects aren’t very pleasant. Have you tried diphenhydramine?
Endotoxin from intestinal bacteria increases histamine and serotonin; poor
digestion is probably the most common cause of insomnia. Avoiding starches is
often helpful. Small amounts of some excipients in supplements, and allergens
in some foods, can increase the nighttime absorption of endotoxin. The
antimicrobial/antiinflammatory effects of [ cascara
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/) can improve sleep; an
antibiotic such as tetracycline can reduce the intestinal inflammation. **

Q. I know you advise the usual carrot/bamboo/mushrooms for fibers. I saw a
comment of yours that commented about potato fiber being protective against
bowel cancer, I wondered if there were any other fibers that you don't often
talk about, that protect against bowel cancer in a similar way?

Hi Ray!  
  
In a previous discussion you said :" For topical use (T3), I think about a
tenth of a microgram per milliliter is effective."  
Do you mind sharing why such a dilution is necessary?

Ok , do you think on other body parts T3 is pretty useless or needs a much
higher concentration to have an effect?  
I have found information on how the skin deactivates or transforms thyroid
hormones but not sure about T3, certain forms of T2 have their use.

So if T3 is converted into T2 by healthy mitochondria then topical T3 does not
sound like it would have negative effects besides the possibility of taking
too much at once . Would the threshold be quite lower than for an oral dose
since the effects are regional?

Hello Dr Peat '  
I hope you can point me in the right direction regarding  
Retrieving some sort of smile that I desperately need.  
  
I have only 3 teeth left in my mouth,started losing my teeth one by one  
About 12 years ago,before that gum disease, loose teeth , teeth breaking off
at  
Gum line. I was told I had a calcium problem years ago and to drink more milk  
  
Lost one tooth each on my first two pregnancies ,two on third  
Mostly stayed away from dentists after traumatic painfull removal  
Of two wisdom teeth in my teens,never went back for other two  
  
I thought I was doing the right thing holding on to my remaining teeth stumps  
As I had lots of bone loss and the bone wouldn't diminish as much if I kept my
stumps.  
Now it seems I've been holding on to toxic teeth that most probably have
caused cavitations. I m just frozen as to what options are open to me.I have
no pain in my mouth  
Last abscess about 2 years ago ,oil pulling I found great for abscesses  
  
The big worry for me is deep silent toxic infection in my jawbone,plus the
connection  
With heart disease which I have since age 39, 6 or 7 stents ,heart attack in
2015 which resulted in 3 stents back to back, torturous angioplasty almost 3
hours long ,dissection,  
But recovered well.  
  
I don't take any heart meds ,I eat quite healthy no obvious puffa's  
I take vit AEDK , [ taurine ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/ajinomoto-
taurine-usp-grade/) magnesium , [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) Brewers
yeast.  
  
I'm awaiting genetic test results from lipid clinic regarding my very high
cholesterol  
Total cholesterol.::: last summer--10.1, Christmas--7.4,--- may this year---
6.3  
No statin I think taurine lowered it nicely,not too worried about it  
  
  
I desperately need a smile of some sort, I feel so guilty ,I promised my
husband  
I would get my teeth fixed,he sadly passed away in February .  
I need to feel whole again  
  
All your advice greatly appreciated  
  
Dr peats answer  
  
I think you’re right about keeping the roots to reduce bone loss; rinsing the
mouth with coconut oil reduces bacteria. Dental abscesses probably originate
with digestive problems; a dentist I knew discovered that he no longer had to
treat his patients’ periodontal disease surgically when he prescribed
laxatives for them. I think the “silent infection” doctrine is mostly an
excuse for expensive treatments. The association between jaw abscesses and
heart disease is probably by way of a more general problem involving low
vitamin D, a low ratio of calcium to phosphate in the diet, intestinal
inflammation, and chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system.

I asked Ray about his ideas on vegetarianism and how key that is to the Gerson
diet outcomes.  
\----  
  
The ratio of potassium to sodium, and the avoidance of polyunsaturated oils,
were basic principles of Gerson’s. I think his objection to milk and cheese
was based on their high fat content, and the addition of salt to cheese. The
nutritional composition of milk from grass fed animals is very similar to that
of the grass they ate, apart from the saturation of the fatty acids. The
current ideas of the Gerson diet don’t accurately reflect Gerson’s ideas; for
example, the book his daughter published about 20 years after his death
advocated using linseed oil, on the pages where he had warned in capital
letters against using any oil, and she claimed that she had found information
in his office indicating admiration for Johanna Budwig’s ideas, including the
use of linseed oil.

"Hi Ray,  
  
[...]  
These compounds have been used to treat worms: thiabendazole, levamisole
(doesn't look safe), albendazole, mebendazole , pranziquatel and niclosamide.
Are any of these better to use? What about flowers of sulphur, garlic and
coconuts?"

If a large amount of [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) above one gram
daily is needed to lower the pulse and make one feel good and relaxed, does
this indicate a thyroid deficiency or should one continue to take the larger
amounts of pregnenolone?  
  
"I think large amounts like that (I averaged about 3 grams/day for a year) are
acting to inhibit inflammation and shift water balances, as well as inhibiting
the stress hormones via the GABA system. Reducing sources of inflammation (for
me it was grains and starches mostly) as well as regulating thyroid can take
the place of the pregnenolone."  
______________________________________________________________________  
I use DMSO and vodka as a solvent for things (pregnenolone powder for
example). I ran out of vodka; is isopropyl alcohol safe to be used in place of
ethanol in such topical preparations?  
  
"It’s o.k. on the skin if it’s allowed to evaporate quickly."  
  
I talked to Georgi Dinkhov, and he said it's probably safe since most of it
will evaporate.  
______________________________________________________________________  
You mention a period of 2-3 weeks for adrenaline to come down from thyroid.
During this time, should the person suspend the thyroid dose or continue
taking it?  
  
"If you start with a small dose, you can usually increase it slightly at
intervals of about two weeks while keeping the pulse fairly steady. Other
things that improve glucose metabolism help to lower the stress hormones."  
  
I've found pregnenolone, [ progesterone

strong androgen. By the way there is this paper ( [ Feed-forward control of

"...We have discovered a novel pathway for the metabolism of the steroid
11β-hydroxyandrostenedione (11OHA4), a major product of human steroidogenesis
which has been ignored for decades. We showed that 11OHA4 is the precursor to
the potent androgens 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone
(11KDHT). Using a combination of UPLC–MS and UPLC–MS/MS techniques we
confirmed the existence of a number of novel steroids in this pathway. **We
have since shown that 11KDHT is as potent as DHT, previously considered to be
most potent natural androgen** , a finding which has significant implications
for our understanding of androgen dependent diseases such as castration-
resistant prostate cancer and diseases of androgen excess, such as congenital
adrenal hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome."

"...The pathway was validated in the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell
line, LNCaP. Androgen receptor (AR) transactivation studies showed that while
11KT and 11OHDHT act as a partial AR agonists, **11KDHT is a full AR agonist
exhibiting similar activity to DHT at 1nM** . Our data demonstrates that,
while 11OHA4 has negligible androgenic activity, its metabolism to 11KT and
11KDHT yields androgenic compounds which may be implicated, together with A4
and [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) (S),
in driving CRPC in the absence of testicular T."  
  
[ An investigation into the androgenic activity of 11-ketotestosterone and
11-ketodihydrotestosterone ](http://ir.nrf.ac.za/handle/10907/503)  
"...This study is the first to show that 11KT and 11KDHT are metabolized at a
significantly lower rate in both cell lines when compared to T and DHT,
respectively, thus likely accounting for their apparent increased activity.
**The data clearly shows that 11KT and 11KDHT are potent and efficacious
androgens, comparable to T and DHT. Most importantly, the findings highlight
the fact that not only can 11KT and 11KDHT activate the androgen axis, and in
so doing drive cell growth, but that these steroids have the potential to
remain active for longer than T and DHT due to a reduced rate of metabolism**
. Collectively, the data demonstrates that 11KT and 11KDHT likely play a
vital, but overlooked, role in the development and progression of CRPC."  
  
"...A slower metabolic rate was observed in the VCaP cells. For example, DHT
and T substrates were depleted in 24 hours in LNCaP cells, while complete
metabolism of DHT and T substrates in VCaP cells was only achieved after 48
hours (Fig. 3.16). Nevertheless, the same trend was observed between the
respective steroids. DHT was metabolised signicantly faster (63% in 12 hours)
than the same concentration of 11KDHT (17% in 12 hours). After 24 hours, only
9% of DHT remained, compared to 60% of 11KDHT. **While DHT was completely
metabolised after 48 hours, 21% of the 11KDHT remained detectable after 72
hours** ."

steroid metabolism, since it can have widespread unexpected effects.  
**  
W: ** "Ok thanks, I thought dht and 11-keto-dht were end point steroids (Hans
selye work on combining upstream and end point steroids is interesting) , does
that mean you would not supplement with androsterone either?"

"...The order of response was determined by the least amount of androsterone
in the mixture of the daily dose that reached the given ratio (Table 1). From
this chart, it may be seen that the biologically most active mixture of these
androgens is 25% androsterone +75% dehydroisoandrosterone and that the least
active is that of 95% androsterone +5% dehydroisaondrosterone. The other
mixtures fall in progression so that as the dehyroisoandrosterone is
increased, at the expense of the androsterone, the mixtures become
increasingly more potent."  
  
"...It was observed in all of our work, as evidenced by the curves, that the
responsiveness of the chicks' comb to androgenic stimulation reaches a maximum
point at a dose between 30 and 40 gamma, after which it declines. This was not
the case when a mixture of equal parts (50% + 50%) of the two androgens were
employed in an oily solution (Figure 8). At the 40 gamma dose, the chick comb
weight response was still rising. This mixture was repeated on another "run"
of chicks and was found to be correct...The 50% androsterone +50%
dehydroisoandrosterone in oily solution is seen to be irregular due to its
peculiar activity. The interpretation of this response is not clear."

wouldn’t be dangerous, but the absorbed percentage can vary a lot.  
For a young person, 5 mg DHEA orally is a very effective amount, very old
people could use 10 to 15 mg. For a year I took an average of 3000 mg of [
pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/)
daily, with nothing but good effects, but when I tried different brands (that
was from Syntex), even 20 mg caused intestinal inflammation symptoms.  
I haven’t used androsterone, but if it functions as a pheromone, as some
people have said, I think that could activate the pituitary in possibly
harmful ways."

](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/01485017908987305)  
  
Finally, this study shows that androsterone suppressed pituitary directly.
More notably, while steroids like DHEA has estrogenic effects androsterone did
not.  
[ The effect of high doses of androgenic substances on the weights of the
testes' accessory reproductive organs and endocrine glands of young male
guinea-pigs - Bottomley - 1938 - The Journal of Physiology - Wiley Online

](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.1938.sp003660/pdf)  
"...As far as it is possible from our results to draw conclusions as to the
relative pituitary suppression potencies of any of the substances used by us,
it may be said that the power of causing pituitary suppression appears to be
correlated with androgenic potency rather than with gynaecogenic properties.
Thus in these experiments, **administration both of A5-tr-androstendiol and of
cis-androsterone caused pituitary suppression as evidenced by testicular
atrophy, while A6-tr-dehydroandrosterone had no effect. With regard to
gynaecogenic properties on the other hand, cis-androsterone has little or no
activity [Warren, 1935; Deanesly & Parkes, 1936], while A5-tr-androstendiol
and A5-tr-dehydroandrosterone are active ** [D e a ne s ly & Parkes, 1936; see
also Koch, 1937]."  
  
"...On the other hand, it is noteworthy that **with respect to the power of
producing pituitary suppression, the two male hormones found in male urine
fall into the order of potency, cis-androsterone > A5-tr-dehydroandrosterone
which is the same as their relative order of potency on the basis of the capon
comb test ** [see Koch, 1937]."

**R:** "It takes a larger dose on the skin than orally. Male pheromones cause
a surge of estrogen in females. For example, a young woman who hadn’t
menstruated in many months visited on a spring afternoon to ask my advice, and
she stayed until it was getting cold so she borrowed my sweater. She returned
it the next day, and said her period had started. That has been called the
“male mouse effect,” a surge of estrogen that will cause a pregnant female to
abort if it smells a new male, but it seems to be very strong in humans and
mammals generally."

compatible with, supportive of, the idea that the functional integration of
macromolecules, cells, and organisms, is an “electronic” state analogous to
the delocalized electronic state of metals, a tunable gel in which there are
no identifiable separate electrons—but able to interact with the discrete
valence electrons of molecules and ions, and with appropriate fields, possibly
including the fields of nuclear spin and unpaired electron spin."

Q: Lately I've been hearing a lot about how awful ocean acidification is for
marine life. What are your thoughts about this - could CO2 be detrimental in
this context?  
  
A: I think the nuclear industry is promoting most of the propaganda on climate
change, and deflecting attention away from solar cycles, and the roles of
deforestation, desertification, CO2 emission from melting tundra, increased
phytoplankton growth, and the decreased solubility of CO2 in warming oceans.
It was just after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island when people were
turning against nuclear power, that the public’s attention was diverted from
cooling of the planet and a predicted new ice age, that had been discussed for
decades, to the new warming supposedly caused by use of fossil fuels.  
  
**[ Three Mile Island, Global Warming and the CIA
](https://alethonews.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/three-mile-island-global-
warming-and-the-cia/) **  
  
Increased carbon dioxide enhances plankton growth  
January 16, 2016 Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences  
Summary:  
Coccolithophores--tiny calcifying plants that are part of the foundation of
the marine food web--have been increasing in relative abundance in the North
Atlantic over the last 45 years, as carbon input into ocean waters has
increased. Their relative abundance has increased 10 times, or by an order of
magnitude, during this sampling period, report researchers.  
Coccolithophores -- tiny calcifying plants that are part of the foundation of
the marine food web -- have been increasing in relative abundance in the North
Atlantic over the last 45 years, as carbon input into ocean waters has
increased. Their relative abundance has increased 10 times, or by an order of
magnitude, during this sampling period. This finding was diametrically opposed
to what scientists had expected since coccolithophores make their plates out
of calcium carbonate, which is becoming more difficult as the ocean becomes
more acidic and pH is reduced.  
These findings were reported in the November 26th edition of Science and based
on analysis of nearly a half century of data collected by the long-running Sir
Alister Hardy Foundation (SAHFOS) Continuous Plankton Recorder sampling
program.  
"The results show both the power of long-term time-series of ocean
observations for deciphering how marine microbial communities are responding
to climate change and offer evidence that the ocean garden is changing," said
Dr. William Balch, senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean
Sciences and a co-author of the paper. **"We never expected to see the
relative abundance of coccolithophores to increase 10 times in the North
Atlantic over barely half a century. If anything, we expected that these
sensitive calcifying algae would have decreased in the face of increasing
ocean acidification (associated with increasing carbon dioxide entering the
ocean from the burning of fossil-fuels). Instead, we see how these carbon-
limited organisms appear to be using the extra carbon from CO2 to increase
their relative abundance by an order of magnitude.**  
"This provides one example on how marine communities across an entire ocean
basin are responding to increasing carbon dioxide levels. Such real-life
examples of the impact of increasing CO2 on marine food webs are important to
point out as the world comes together in Paris next week at the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change," Balch added.  
"Something strange is happening here, and it's happening much more quickly
than we thought it should," said Anand Gnanadesikan, associate professor in
the Morton K. Blaustein Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Johns
Hopkins and one of the study's five authors.  
Gnanadesikan said the Science report certainly is good news for creatures that
eat coccolithophores, but it's not clear what those are. "What is worrisome,"
he said, "is that our result points out how little we know about how complex
ecosystems function." The result highlights the possibility of rapid ecosystem
change, suggesting that prevalent models of how these systems respond to
climate change may be too conservative, he said.  
Coccolithophores are often referred to as "canaries in the coal mine." Some of
the key coccolithophore species can outcompete other classes of phytoplankton
in warmer, more stratified and nutrient-poor waters (such as one might see in
a warming ocean). Until this data proved otherwise, scientists thought that
they would have more difficulties forming their calcite plates in a more
acidic ocean. These results show that coccolithophores are able to use the
higher concentration of carbon derived from CO2, combined with warmer
temperatures, to increase their growth rate.  
When the percentage of coccolithophores in the community goes up, the relative
abundance of other groups will go down. The authors found that at local
scales, the relative abundance of another important algal class, diatoms, had
decreased over the 45 years of sampling.  
The team's analysis was of data taken from the North Atlantic Ocean and North
Sea since the mid-1960s compiled by the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey.
The CPR survey was launched by British marine biologist Sir Alister Hardy in
the early 1930s. Today it is carried on by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation
for Ocean Sciences and is conducted by commercial ships trailing mechanical
plankton-gathering gear through the water as they sail their regular routes.
Dr. Willie Wilson, formerly a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory,
is now director of SAHFOS.  
"In the geological record, coccolithophores have been typically more abundant
during Earth's warm interglacial and high CO2 periods. The results presented
here are consistent with this and may portend, like the "canary in the coal
mine," where we are headed climatologically," said Balch.

I asked Peat a few things about his view on the laws of thermodynamics a while
ago and one of his replies might be interesting in this context.  
  
"N.A. Kozyrev, an astrophysicist, looked at the issue historically, and
concluded that the 19th century people who promulgated the first and second
laws were just mathematizing their fairly fundamentalist Christian beliefs,
building on the preceding Deists, who saw the world as a big clock set in
motion in The Beginning by the Big Watchmaker. Realizing that there was, and
is, simply no evidence for the way they formulated the laws, asserting that
time could just as well run in either direction. Kozyrev worked out the
implications of considering that time works the way it seems to, moving only
in one direction. With that assumption, the passage of time introduces
negative entropy constantly into the system. Kozyrev’s calculation from that
assumption showed that any mass, existing through time, converts negentropy
into energy, and it works out to predict that the amount of energy coming out
of the sun and stars is consistent with the observed energy, but is derived
from the asymmetry of time, rather than from nuclear reactions. He then scaled
the figures to the planets, and predicted the amount of heat coming from
Jupiter and Saturn; his figures were confirmed decades later when the space
probes made measurements at close range. The internal heat of the earth was on
the same scale, so he estimated the amount of heat that should be produced by
the mass of the moon, and predicted that there would be volcanic activity
there. Since he was an astronomer, he aimed a telescope at the dark side of
the moon, with [ infrared ](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-
category/light-therapy/) sensitive film, and showed periodic hot eruptions. A
little earlier, Fred Soddy (famous for work in nuclear fission and isotopes)
proposed continuing creation, and suggested that cosmic rays are newly formed
atoms, and if this creation is happening everywhere, there should be a certain
amount of “background” microwave radiation coming from all directions. Years
later when radiation of that sort was detected, the Deisitic Fundamentalists
proclaimed that they had discovered evidence of The Big Bang at the Time of
Creation, and ignored Soddy’s prediction."

From several recent emails...the parts pertaining to progest/ [ dhea

"I use my progesterone and DHEA dissolved in vitamin E, rubbed into my skin,
so I’m not sure how much I’m absorbing, but I adjust the amount according to
how I feel, and I think the absorbed amount is around 5 mg of DHEA and 15 mg
of progesterone.  
When I was 60, that much progesterone had a slight cold-shower effect, but now
it doesn’t—I have as many erotic dreams as when I was 30."  
  
"A few times when I took 100 mg or more of progesterone the antitestosterone
effect was very noticeable for a day or two, but it quickly passed. A teenage
male makes only about 12 mg of DHEA per day; when older men take 25 mg, they
usually get very high estrogen."  
  
"I rub some of the oil into my legs and arms every day, but some days it’s
probably less than that. About 20 years ago I tended to use equal amounts of
those, about 5 or 10 mg of each, now the extra progesterone doesn’t cause
noticeable interference with the testosterone effect."

Still on Airplanes/dirigibles/transportation conversation:  
  
"A couple quick questions: when you mention good rail transportation, do you
mean super fast trains like the MagLev (goes up to 600km/hour in the latest
tests) that are being projected by Germany and Japan?  
  
About dirigibles: I can only read their use been declining in the past
decades. Do you mean using them as a mean of transportation? In the public
opinion, airplanes aren't problematic, and are preferred over dirigibles. Am I
missing something?"  

  
  
"Public opinion is formed to optimize profits. Even hydrogen-filled dirigibles
are safe and cheap, and rapid change of time zones is seriously stressful. In
1937, the Germans were leading in commercial aviation, and the US government
was subsidizing domestic airlines to carry mail, permitting them to also carry
a few paying passengers. The Hindenburg disaster was essential for the
development of a US owned air passenger industry. People had been reluctant to
fly for safety reasons, as well as cost. The dirigibles took just over two
days to cross, and provided beds and high quality dining, for $400. The first
US transatlantic airline cost $375, people had to sit up for more than 24
hours, and only a few passengers were carried along with the mail. The
efficiency of airlines is analogous to the efficiency of nuclear power, i.e.,
it rests on government subsidies. A few days ago, the Amtrack accident was the
result of trying to save ten minutes on the trip from Seattle to Portland.
When government money is involved, people go crazy."

The question is below, first is the answer from dr Peat, sorry for that  
  
Have you checked your temperature and pulse rate cycles, to see if the [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) affects them? What about your thyroid function? Low thyroid function
commonly causes beast swelling. Under the influence of progesterone, estrogen
is converted to the water soluble sulfate and glucuronide forms, to be
excreted; if there is inflammation, from an infection or injury, these
inactivated forms of estrogen can be re-activated in the inflamed tissue.  
  
  
Dear dr Peat,  
  
Whenever I take progest-e or even [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) my breasts
become a little swallen, tender and the right breast get painful with some
sort of protrusion which I can feel with my fingers. Do you think it might be
estrogen pushed into the bloodstream? Should I ignore this symptom and
continue administration until it vanishes?  
It happened even when I applied small amounts of progest-e topically.  
I'll be grateful for any tips.

**Regarding DIY ophthalmic preparations:  
_  
ME _ : ** Hi Ray,  
  
I'm not sure if you will get this email but I couldn't find our correspondence
from times I have emailed you in the past. I have a quick question for you. I
am attempting to prepare an ophthalmic solution with coconut oil and liquid
T3, and I want to dilute the coconut oil so the T3 can disperse fully in the
solution. (The T3 I'm using isn't optimal as it contains some portion of
ethanol but it is my only option and I have already experienced great relief
of my symptoms (the inspiration to make this solution came from one of your
articles in which you mention a T3-containing eye drop likely being more
effective at restoring metabolism than oral administration of thyroid)). Do
you know of a safe emulsifier I can use in my preparation? My first thought is
egg yolk but I'm really out in left field here as far as safety of ophthalmic
solutions is concerned.  
  
There is a pilot study with rabbits on the efficacy of virgin coconut oil as
an eye re-wetting agent, but they apparently did not alter it in any way.  
  
[ https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2015/135987/
](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2015/135987/)  
  
Thanks for your consideration,  
Chris  
  
**_RAY_ : ** I know a couple of people who have used refined coconut oil in
their eyes, as a solvent for other things, and they say it isn’t especially
uncomfortable, but for some people, any oil in the eye can be painful. I think
an emulsifier, even egg yolk, would have an effect similar to [ soap
](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/homemade-soap/) in the eye.  
  
**_ME_ : ** Hi again Ray, do you think tocopherols would be an eye irritant? I
am curious to try small doses of fat soluble vitamins through the eye.  
  
**_RAY_ : ** I’ve accidentally got some in my eye when I was putting it on for
sunburn, and it was very uncomfortable.

Q. I have seen you speak about "undercooked" vegetables as a problem, and many
studies you reference regarding fiber are concerned with things such as oat
bran, not vegetables. I wondered how bad you thought "normal" vegetables such
as peppers, courgettes, tomatoes etc were, if they were cooked to excess, for
example 30+ minutes to be eaten as a side alongside a meal?

Q.  
I have seen you mention spermidine is a polyamine. There are studies regarding
spermidine as being positive such as  
  
[ Spermidine Prolongs Lifespan and Prevents Liver Fibrosis and Hepatocellular
Carcinoma by Activating MAP1S-Mediated Autophagy
](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/11/2938)  
  
Spermidine Prolongs Lifespan and Prevents Liver Fibrosis and Hepatocellular
Carcinoma by Activating MAP1S-Mediated Autophagy  
  
"Extending recent evidence that orally administered spermidine can extend
lifespan in mice, we determined that life extension of up to 25% can be
produced by lifelong administration, which also reduced liver fibrosis and HCC
foci as induced by chemical insults."  
  
I also was shown a piece looking at the polyamine content of various foods,
and found mushrooms particularly high  
[

](http://foodandnutrition.jacobspublishers.com/images/FoodNutrition/J_J_Food_Nutri_4_1_029.pdf)  
  
Yet mushrooms seem anti cancer, and good for various factors of health. Is
spermidine a cause for concern in the diet? What do you make of all this?

Hi Ray,  
I recently discovered thymoquinone, and heard you talked about it some time
ago. It has many interesting properties including crossing the BBB with ease.
Do you have any idea what a safe dose would be?  
  

Spoiler:  References

[ Thymoquinone: an emerging natural drug with a wide range of medical
applications ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387230/)  
  
In this review we aimed at summarizing the most recent investigations related
to a few and most important effects of thymoquinone. It is concluded that
**thymoquinone has evidently proved its activity as hepatoprotective, anti-
inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic and anti-cancer chemical,** with specific
mechanisms of action, which provide support to consider this compound as an
emerging drug.  
  
n traditional medicine, _N. sativa_ has been used in different forms to treat
many diseases including **asthma, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, cough,
bronchitis, headache, eczema, fever, dizziness and influenza** ( [ 1

neurodegenerative conditions and glial brain tumors. A short review -
ScienceDirect
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332216307302)  
  
Recently emerging studies conducted with animal models suggest that
thymoquinone – bearing a very simple molecular structure – significantly
crosses the [ blood brain barrier
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-
pharmaceutical-science/bloodbrain-barrier) and exerts neuromodulatory
activities **.** Indeed, in animal studies, the following actions of
thymoquinone were demonstrated: 1—Protection against ischemic brain damage.
2—Reduction of epileptic seizures and associated cerebral oxidative injury.
3—Reduction of [ morphine ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-
toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/morphine) tolerance and associated
oxidative brain damage. 4—Anxiolytic effects and reduction of immobility
stress-associated cerebral oxidative injury. 5—Reduction of diabetes-induced
cerebral oxidative stress, 6—Reduction of cerebral oxidative injuries induced
by noxious exposures including [ toluene
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/toluene) , lead
and [ ionizing ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-
dentistry/ionization) radiation. Substantial _[ in vitro
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/in-vitro) _ data
suggest that thymoquinone may be beneficial in treatment of glial tumors.
However, there is no [ clinical study
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-
pharmaceutical-science/clinical-study) investigating its antitumor effects. In
fact, thymoquinone suppresses growth and invasion, and induces apoptosis of

Quinones in the presence of reductants and catalysts can become semiquinones
in a cycle that produces reactive oxygen species, so I think it’s risky except
for treating an existing cancer.  
  
Food Chem Toxicol. 2009 Jan;47(1):129-33.  
In vitro toxicological properties of thymoquinone.  
Khader M, Bresgen N, Eckl PM.  
Nigella sativa has been traditionally used for the treatment of inflammations,
liver disorders, and arthritis. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that
N. sativa extracts and the main constituent of their volatile oil,
thymoquinone, possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepato-protective
properties. To further evaluate the toxicological properties in a
metabolically competent cellular system, thymoquinone was applied to primary
rat hepatocyte cultures, and both cyto- and genotoxic effects were tested.
Mitotic indices and the rates of apoptoses and necroses were determined as
endpoints of cytotoxicity, while chromosomal aberrations and micronucleated
cells served as endpoints of genotoxicity. In this approach thymoquinone
demonstrated cyto- and genotoxic effects in a concentration dependent manner:
it induced significant anti-proliferative effects at 20 microM and acute
cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. Thymoquinone significantly increased
the rates of necrotic cells at concentrations between 2.5 and 20 microM.
Furthermore, it induced significant genotoxicity at concentrations > or =1.25
microM. These observations support the previous finding that thymoquinone
causes glutathione depletion and liver damage, but contradict the reports
indicating antioxidant and anti-clastogenic effects. Thymoquinone might be
metabolised to reactive species and increase oxidative stress, which
contributes to the depletion of antioxidant enzymes and damage to DNA in
hepatocytes treated with high thymoquinone concentrations.

I'm taking lamotrigine for bipolar symptoms, and I'm just curious as to your
thoughts regarding the potential for things that lower anxiety (such as
anticonvulsants) in the context of a high adrenaline response to thyroid. I
don't think they improve glucose metabolism, but do you think the anxiolysis
can be helpful in this context?  
  
Dr. Peat: "There are safe, physiological methods that work better. I think
chlorinated hydrocarbons should be avoided as far as possible.  
  

Spoiler:  Dangers of Lamotrigine

Wikipedia: Side effects  
Lamotrigine prescribing information has a black box warning about life-
threatening skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), DRESS
syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).[39] The manufacturer states
that nearly all cases appear in the first two to eight weeks of therapy,[39]
or if the medication is suddenly stopped then resumed at the normal
dosage.[citation needed] Patients should seek medical attention for any
unexpected skin rash, as its presence is an indication of a possible serious
or even deadly side-effect of the drug."

me: **  
Thanks a lot!  
  
Does that mean you are against supplementing vitamin K2, emodin or [ cascara
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/) (for digestion etc..)
and drinking [ pau d'arco ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/pau-darco-
tabebuia-avellanedae/) tea on a regular basis? Do you have any idea what a
good dose would be for cancer if one were to use thymoquinone?  
**  
Ray: **  

Menadione, K3, more water soluble, is used with [ vitamin C
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) to treat
cancer, creating free radicals similar to radiation. The reductive cytoplasm
of cancer cells maintains the toxic effect. The oil soluble quinones are less
reactive in the body, especially when they are in an oxidizing intracellular
environment, which they help to stabilize. I would be inclined to use quinones
other than thymoquinone for cancer, along with activated carbonyls such as
fisetin.

With regards to a 1:1 T3 to T4 ratio you've mentioned for those with impaired
livers, do you know of any lab values that would indicate too much T3 in their
thyroid ratio and would suggest an increase in T4?  
  
**Dr. Peat** : "No, that can happen when stress increases reverse T3."  
  
Okay, so I suppose it's [the need for more T4 is] only reliant upon negative
symptoms such as arrhythmias (such as when you took only T3).  
  
Do you think the [tattoo] ink's safe or do you think it'll cause problems over
the long-term?  
  
**Dr. Peat** : "I don’t know of any safe ink, and people’s reactions vary; the
body can begin to react long after it was done."  
  
...if one's sensitized to adrenaline, supplemented thyroid should be increased
slowly. Once the adrenaline comes down, can the thyroid dose be adjusted more
drastically (say in the months between winter and summer) without any fear of
the same adrenaline surges?  
  
**Dr. Peat** : "Yes."

I emailed Dr Ray Peat about best way to deal with or treat stage 4 incurable
brain cancer - GBM - glioblastoma multiforme.  
  
He included a long, long list of references. I included them since someone
might find them interesting to read.  
  
Dr. Ray Peats email reply:  
  
Tumors have multiple causes, so I think it’s best to use things that are known
to be protective against known causes. I think cancers are continually
produced and maintained by general metabolic conditions, and if those are
ignored while trying to kill all of the abnormal cells, those cells release
signals to recruit replacement cells, which, encountering the same or worse
metabolic conditions, renew the tumor. Known causes involve inflammatory,
excitatory processes, and when those are eliminated, tumors tend to
disintegrate, undergoing “apoptosis,” a form of cell death that doesn’t create
new inflammation. Here are some articles describing the effects of some of
these antiinflammatory, antiexcitatory, substances— [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) , caffeine,
tetracylines, antihistamine/antiserotonin/anti-nitric oxide agents, [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-

powder/) , antagonists of excitotoxicity, estrogen antagonists, vitamins D, E,
and K, etc. Vitamin E (500 mg mixed tocopherols) and aspirin are things that
the medical authorities might not object to.

The present study was performed to determine whether aspirin, a cyclooxygenase  
(COX) inhibitor, has an effect on the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in C6  
glioma cells. Using an in vitro glioma invasion model, the expression of Cx43  
protein in C6 cells was significantly increased following aspirin treatment at
a  
dose of 8 mmol/l for 30, 60 and 120 min via western blot analysis. The peak
value  
of the Cx43 expression was observed in C6 cells after 120 min of aspirin  
treatment, which was significantly reduced by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In  
addition, aspirin also significantly increased the gap junction intercellular  
communication (GJIC) activity and reduced glioma invasion, which was induced
by  
PGE2. This led to the conclusion that the aspirin-induced glioma invasion  
decrease may be associated with the increased expression of Cx43 protein and  
formation of GJIC.

Our previous work has shown that S100A9 promotes the growth of glioma cells.
The  
aim of this study was to investigate S100A9 expression in glioma cells and to  
explore the potential of NSAIDs in the inhibition of S100A9. The levels of
S100A9  
were analyzed in five normal human brain tissues and 109 astrocytomas by  
immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, S100A9 levels were detected in
normal  
human astrocytes, glioma cell lines, and six pairs of matched astrocytoma
tissues  
by reverse transcription-PCR or western blotting analysis. After treatment
with  
4, 8, and 16 mmol/l aspirin, cell viability, early apoptosis rate, and S100A9  
levels were quantified. Cell viability and the changes in S100A9 levels were
also  
examined in glioma cells exposed to a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, NS-398,
alone  
and in combination with prostaglandin E2. We found that S100A9 was upregulated
in  
astrocytomas and was significantly (P<0.05) correlated with histologic grades.  
S100A9 protein levels were also elevated in six astrocytomas compared with  
matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. Both S100A9 mRNA and protein levels
were  
higher in glioma cell lines than in normal human astrocytes (P<0.05). Aspirin  
treatment inhibited cell proliferation and caused early apoptosis in glioma,  
coupled with reduced S100A9 levels. Treatment with NS-398 decreased cell
growth  
and expression of S100A9 in glioma cells; these effects were partially
reversed  
by exogenous prostaglandin E2. These results suggest overexpression of S100A9
in  
glioma cells. Aspirin may be a novel candidate for targeted prevention of
S100A9  
overexpression in glioma cells.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Currently temozolomide (TMZ) as a potent agent is widely  
used to treat the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), whereas recurrence due to  
intrinsic or acquired therapeutic resistance often occurs. Combination  
chemotherapy with TMZ may be a promising therapeutic strategy to improve  
treatment efficacy.  
METHODS: Aspirin, TMZ, and aspirin-/TMZ-coloaded poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide)  
(PLGA) microspheres were prepared by spray drying, and cytotoxicities of  
glioblastoma cells were measured.  
RESULTS: Aspirin microsphere treatment induced slight apoptosis and modestly  
inhibited proliferation of LN229 and U87 cells in vitro and in vivo through  
inhibition of β-catenin transactivation. However, aspirin-/TMZ-coloaded  
microspheres presented synergistic antitumor efficacy compared with single  
TMZ-loaded microspheres. Aspirin/TMZ microspheres induced more apoptosis and  
repressed proliferation of LN229 and U87 cells. Corresponding to inhibition of  
β-catenin signaling, β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity and STAT3
luciferase  
activity were strongly suppressed, and downstream targets expression was  
decreased. Furthermore, aspirin/TMZ microsphere intratumoral injection  
downregulated the expression of β-catenin, TCF4, pAKT, pSTAT3, and PCNA and  
delayed tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous LN229 xenografts.  
CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin sensitized TMZ chemotherapy efficacy through inhibition
of  
β-catenin transactivation; furthermore, the coloaded microspheres achieved a  
sustained release action to reduce the TMZ dosage, offering the potential for  
improved treatment of glioblastomas.

OBJECT: The goal in this study was to investigate the antitumor effect of
aspirin  
in glioblastoma cells and the molecular mechanism involved in its
antineoplastic  
activities.  
METHODS: The authors used the  
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method, flow  
cytometry, the annexin V method, and Transwell cell invasion test to detect
the  
proliferation and invasive activity of U87 and A172 glioma cells before and
after  
being treated with aspirin. To determine the effects of aspirin on  
β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) transcription activity, reporter constructs  
containing 3 repeats of the wild-type (TOPflash) or mutant (FOPflash) TCF-
binding  
sites were used. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western
blot  
analyses were used to detect the expression of multiple β-catenin/TCF target  
genes following aspirin treatment.  
RESULTS: The transcriptional activity of the β-catenin/TCF complex was
strongly  
inhibited by aspirin. Increasing the concentration of aspirin resulted in  
decreased expression of c-myc, cyclin D1, and fra-1 mRNA and protein in U87
and  
A172 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Aspirin inhibited glioma cell  
proliferation and invasive ability, and induced apoptotic cell death.  
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that aspirin is a potent antitumor agent, and  
that it exerts its antineoplastic action by inhibition of the β-catenin/TCF  
signaling pathway in glioma cells.

The in vitro antiproliferative and apoptosis inducing properties of the  
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like acetyl salicylic acid  
(aspirin) and indomethacin were investigated in T98G human glioblastoma cells
to  
explore their potential role in the chemoprevention of human glioma. The  
biological effects induced by aspirin and indomethacin on T98G cells, in which  
the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were  
confirmed by RT-PCR and immunostaining, were investigated by studying cell  
proliferation and apoptosis assays. The antiproliferative effects occurred in
a  
dose- and time-dependent manner on T98G cells by the treatment with 0.1 -2 mM  
aspirin and 25-100 microM indomethacin. Moreover, aspirin displayed the
greatest  
growth inhibition within 24 h. Approximately 90% growth inhibition occurred  
following treatment either with 2 mM aspirin or 100 microM indomethacin by 72
h  
and induction of apoptosis was confirmed by DNA laddering and TUNEL assay. Our
in  
vitro findings indicate that aspirin and indomethacin have an
antiproliferative  
effect on T98G human glioblastoma cells at toxic concentrations.

Caffeine is the most commonly ingested methylxanthine and has anti-cancer
effects  
in several types of cancer. In this study, we examined the anti-cancer effects
of  
caffeine on gliomas, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, caffeine treatment  
reduced glioma cell proliferation through G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest by  
suppressing Rb phosphorylation. In addition, caffeine induced apoptosis
through  
caspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Caffeine  
also phosphorylated serine 9 of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β).  
Pretreatment with H89, a pharmacological inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA),
was  
able to antagonize caffeine-induced GSK3β(ser9) phosphorylation, suggesting
that  
the mechanism might involve a cAMP-dependent PKA-dependent pathway. In vivo,  
caffeine-treated tumors exhibited reduced proliferation and increased
apoptosis  
compared with vehicle-treated tumors. These results suggest that caffeine
induces  
cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent cell death in glioma cells, supporting  
its potential use in chemotherapeutic options for malignant gliomas.

Theobromine, a caffeine derivative, is the primary methylxanthine produced by  
Theobroma cacao. We previously showed that methylxanthines, including caffeine  
and theophylline, have antitumor and antiinflammatory effects, which are in
part  
mediated by their inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE). A member of the PDE  
family, PDE4, is widely expressed in and promotes the growth of glioblastoma,
the  
most common type of brain tumor. The purpose of this study was to determine  
whether theobromine could exert growth inhibitory effects on U87-MG, a cell
line  
derived from human malignant glioma. We show that theobromine treatment
elevates  
intracellular cAMP levels and increases the activity of p38 mitogen-activated  
protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, whereas it attenuates p44/42  
extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity and the Akt/mammalian target of  
rapamycin kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signal pathways. It also inhibits  
cell proliferation. These results suggest that foods and beverages containing  
cocoa bean extracts, including theobromine, might be extremely effective in  
preventing human glioblastoma.

Calcium signaling is important in many signaling processes in cancer cell  
proliferation and motility including in deadly glioblastomas of the brain that  
aggressively invade neighboring tissue. We hypothesized that disturbing Ca(2+)  
signaling pathways might decrease the invasive behavior of giloblastoma,  
extending survival. Evaluating a panel of small-molecule modulators of Ca(2+)  
signaling, we identified caffeine as an inhibitor of glioblastoma cell
motility.  
Caffeine, which is known to activate ryanodine receptors, paradoxically
inhibits  
Ca(2+) increase by inositol 1,4,5-trisphospate receptor subtype 3 (IP(3)R3),
the  
expression of which is increased in glioblastoma cells. Consequently, by  
inhibiting IP(3)R3-mediated Ca(2+) release, caffeine inhibited migration of  
glioblastoma cells in various in vitro assays. Consistent with these effects,  
caffeine greatly increased mean survival in a mouse xenograft model of  
glioblastoma. These findings suggest IP(3)R3 as a novel therapeutic target and  
identify caffeine as a possible adjunct therapy to slow invasive growth of  
glioblastoma.

Calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling is an important signaling process, implicated in  
cancer cell proliferation and motility of the deadly glioblastomas that  
aggressively invade neighboring brain tissue. **We have previously
demonstrated  
that caffeine blocks glioblastoma invasion and extends survival by inhibiting  
Ca(2+) release channel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) subtype 3.
**  
Trifluoperazine (TFP) is an FDA-approved antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia.  
Interestingly, TFP has been recently reported to show a strong anticancer
effect  
on lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and T-cell lymphoma. However, the  
possible anticancer effect of TFP on glioblastoma has not been tested. Here,
we  
report that TFP potently suppresses proliferation, motility, and invasion of  
glioblastoma cells in vitro, and tumor growth in in vivo xenograft mouse
model.  
Unlike caffeine, TFP triggers massive and irreversible release of Ca(2+) from  
intracellular stores by IP3R subtype 1 and 2 by directly interacting at the  
TFP-binding site of a Ca(2+)-binding protein, calmodulin subtype 2 (CaM2). TFP  
binding to CaM2 causes a dissociation of CaM2 from IP3R and subsequent opening
of  
IP3R. Compared with the control neural stem cells, various glioblastoma cell  
lines showed enhanced expression of CaM2 and thus enhanced sensitivity to TFP.
On  
the basis of these findings, we propose TFP as a potential therapeutic drug
for  
glioblastoma by aberrantly and irreversibly increasing Ca(2+) in glioblastoma  
cells. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(1); 217-27. ©2016 AACR.

Recalling the remarkable developmental similarities between cancer cells and  
embryonic tissues, this paper argues that, by the process of
retrodifferentiation  
and heterochronization, stem cells that have become neoplastic could be said
to  
have undergone "cellular heterochrony." It theorizes, therefore, that hormones  
are the major factor in the non-random regulation of cellular heterochrony in  
tumourigenesis. Two recent articles confirm that there is low thyroxine and
high  
prolactin in glioblastomas. Thyroxine metamorphoses vertebrates' tissues so as
to  
mature the tissues, e.g., in amphibian metamorphosis. **In 1896, thyroxine
(horse  
thyroid extract) was the first successful hormonal product to be used against
a  
fulminating breast cancer. ** Recent work confirms the important role of
prolactin  
in the induction and progression of mammary, prostate and colorectal tumours.  
Although the pituitary is the main source of prolactin in vertebrates, there
is  
also placental production of prolactin, and paracrine production of prolactin
by  
tumours themselves. Since tumours produce their own prolactin, shutting down
the  
pituitary source has not proven wholly successful. Research to find prolactin  
receptor antagonists is ongoing. Therefore, prolactin inhibitors (dopamine  
agonists), prolactin receptor antagonists, plus thyroxine comprise a plausible  
metamorphic therapy for shrinking solid tumour mass. By contrast with  
"differentiation" therapies currently sought by stem cell oncologists, this
paper  
advocates "metamorphic" therapies, to introduce hormonal oncological knowledge
of  
how to modulate signalling pathways that are aberrant in the stem cells that
give  
rise to tumours. Despite subtle differences in these signalling translation  
pathways and cascades, strategies exist that will allow these evolved  
populations, going back to their stem precursors, to "metamorphose" or perhaps  
apoptotically cease proliferation.

Prolactin (PRL) is involved in numerous biological processes in peripheral  
tissues and the brain. Although numerous studies have been conducted to
elucidate  
the signal transduction pathways associated with the PRL receptor, very few
have  
examined the role of ion conductances in PRL actions. We used the patch-clamp  
technique in "whole cell" configuration and microspectrofluorimetry to  
investigate the effects of PRL on membrane ion conductances in the U87-MG
human  
malignant astrocytoma cell line, which naturally expresses the PRL receptor.
We  
found that a physiological concentration (4 nM) of PRL exerted a biphasic
action  
on membrane conductances. First, PRL activated a Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) current  
that was sensitive to CTX and TEA. This current depended on PRL-induced Ca(2+)  
mobilization, through a JAK2-dependent pathway from a thapsigargin- and  
2-APB-sensitive Ca(2+) pool. Second, PRL also activated an inwardly directed  
current, mainly due to the stimulation of calcium influx via nickel- and  
2-APB-sensitive calcium channels. Both phases resulted in membrane  
hyperpolarizations, mainly through the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)  
channels. As shown by combined experiments (electrophysiology and  
microspectrofluorimetry), the PRL-induced Ca(2+) influx increased with cell  
membrane hyperpolarization and conversely decreased with cell membrane  
depolarization. Thus PRL-induced membrane hyperpolarizations facilitated
Ca(2+)  
influx through voltage-independent Ca(2+) channels. Finally, PRL also
activated a  
DIDS-sensitive Cl(-) current, which may participate in the PRL-induced  
hyperpolarization. These PRL-induced conductance activations are probably
related  
to the PRL proliferative effect we have already described in U87-MG cells.

Prolactin (PRL) has several physiological effects on peripheral tissues and
the  
brain. This hormone acts via its membrane receptor (PRL-R) to induce cell  
differentiation or proliferation. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain  
reaction (RT-PCR) combined with Southern blot analysis, we detected PRL-R  
transcripts in a human glioma cell line (U87-MG) and in primary cultured human  
glioblastoma cells. These transcripts were deleted or not in their
extracellular  
domains. We examined the effects of PRL on intracellular free Ca2+
concentration  
([Ca2+](i)) in these cells in order to improve our understanding of the PRL  
transduction mechanism, which is still poorly documented. [Ca2+](i) was
measured  
by microspectrofluorimetry using indo-1 as the Ca2+ fluorescent probe.  
Spatiotemporal aspects of PRL-induced Ca2+ signals were investigated using  
high-speed fluo-3 confocal imaging. We found that physiological concentrations  
(0.4-4 nM) of PRL-stimulated Ca2+ entry and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization
via a  
tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. The two types of Ca2+ responses observed  
were distinguishable by their kinetics: one showing a slow (type I) and the
other  
a fast (type II) increase in [Ca2+](i). The amplitude of PRL-induced Ca2+  
increases may be sufficient to provoke several physiological responses, such
as  
stimulating proliferation. Furthermore, PRL induced a dose-dependent increase
in  
[3H]thymidine incorporation levels and in cellular growth and survival,
detected  
by the MTT method. These data indicate that PRL induced mitogenesis of human  
glioma cells.

We have examined the neuroimmunoregulatory function of prolactin (PRL) on  
astrocytic inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in the C6 glioma  
cell line. After 24 h of PRL (5-100 nM) stimulation, a concentration-dependent  
increase of NO release, evaluated as nitrite, was observed in C6 culture
medium.  
Moreover, both NO release and iNOS expression induced by interferon-gamma (250  
U/ml) were enhanced by PRL (18-100 nM). PRL-induced NO release was inhibited
by  
dexamethasone, an inhibitor of de novo iNOS synthesis. We used erbstatin (5  
microg/ml), a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, to test whether
these  
proteins were required for signaling events evoked by PRL in these cells. This  
inhibitor was able to inhibit completely the PRL-induced NO production and
iNOS  
expression. In conclusion, we provide evidence that NO production in glial
cells  
can be regulated not only by cytokines but also by neuroimmunoregulatory
hormones  
such as PRL, which is present in normal brain but may be elevated in several  
pathological states.

BACKGROUND: Meningiomas have been found to have receptors for several
hormones,  
such as oestrogen, progesterone, somatostatin, dopamine and recently also for  
prolactin.  
METHODS: To investigate any possible role of prolactin in the growth of those  
tumours we detected the presence of prolactin-receptors (PRL-R) in 22
meningiomas  
and we correlated these data with PRL serum levels in patients before surgery.
We  
also studied 13 patients with schwannomas and 7 with other cerebral tumours (4  
glioblastomas, 2 ependymomas and 1 astrocytoma).  
RESULTS: Increased prolactin binding was present in 10 (45.4 percent  
meningiomas, 9 (69.2 percent  schwannomas and in the patient with astrocytoma.  
The presence of high PRL levels was present in 6 (27.2 percent  patients with  
meningiomas, 8 (61.5 percent  with schwannomas and in 3 (42.8 percent  with  
other tumours. No direct correlation was present between serum PRL levels and
PRL  
binding in all groups.  
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion we confirmed the presence of PRL receptors in
patients  
with meningiomas and we have also shown the presence of PRL receptors also in  
schwannomas. Moreover increased serum PRL were shown in some patients with  
different tumours of nervous tissue before surgery. Our data could suggest
that  
PRL might have a role in the growth of meningiomas and schwannomas.

BACKGROUND: Malignant glioma is the most common brain cancer with devastating  
prognosis. Recurrence of malignant glioma following surgery is very common
with  
few preventive and therapeutic options. Novel targets and therapeutic agents
are  
constantly sought for better outcome. Our previous study established that  
inhibition of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channels
resulted  
in significant decrease of human glioma cell growth and proliferation. As
local  
anesthetic lidocaine has been shown to inhibit TRPM7 currents, we hypothesize  
that lidocaine may suppress glioma cell proliferation through TRPM7 channel  
inhibition.  
METHODS: TRPM7 currents were recorded in rat C6 glioma cells using the whole
cell  
patch clamp technique. Cell growth and proliferation were assessed under  
microscopic examination and biochemical assays.  
RESULTS: Lidocaine inhibits TRPM7-like currents in a dose-dependent and  
reversible manner. At 1 and 3 mM, it inhibits ~30% and ~50% of TRPM7 currents.
At  
these concentrations, it is effective in inhibiting the proliferation of C6  
cells. As expected, the TRPM7 inhibitors gadolinium and 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl  
borate have similar effects on TRPM7 currents and proliferation of C6 cells.  
Similar to its effect on C6 cells, lidocaine inhibits the proliferation of
A172  
cells, a human glioblastoma cell line.  
CONCLUSIONS: Lidocaine significantly inhibits the proliferation of glioma
cells.  
The effect of lidocaine is mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting TRPM7  
channels.

Clinical Concentrations of Local Anesthetics Bupivacaine and Lidocaine
Differentially Inhibit Human Kir2.x Inward Rectifier K+ Channels.  
Nakahira K, Oshita K, Itoh M, Takano M, Sakaguchi Y, Ishihara K.  
BACKGROUND:  
Inward rectifier K channels of the Kir2.x subfamily are widely expressed in
neuronal tissues, controlling neuronal excitability. Previous studies reported
that local anesthetics (LAs) do not affect Kir2 channels. However, the effects
have not been studied at large concentrations used in regional anesthesia.  
METHODS:  
This study used the patch-clamp technique to examine the effects of
bupivacaine and lidocaine on Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 channels expressed in
human embryonic kidney 293 cells.  
RESULTS:  
When applied extracellularly in whole-cell recordings, both LAs inhibited
Kir2.x currents in a voltage-independent manner. Inhibition with bupivacaine
was slow and irreversible, whereas that with lidocaine was fast and
reversible. Kir2.3 displayed a greater sensitivity to bupivacaine than Kir2.1
and Kir2.2 (50% inhibitory concentrations at approximately 5 minutes, 0.6 vs
8-10 mM), whereas their sensitivities to lidocaine were similar (50%
inhibitory concentrations, 1.5-2.7 mM). Increases in the charged/neutral ratio
of the LAs at an acidic extracellular pH attenuated their inhibitory effects,
and a permanently charged lidocaine derivative QX-314 exhibited no effects
when applied extracellularly. Inside-out experiments **demonstrated that
inhibition of Kir2.1 with cytoplasmic lidocaine and QX-314 was rapid and
reversible, whereas that induced by bupivacaine was slow and irreversible.**
Furthermore, dose-inhibition relations for the charged form of bupivacaine and
lidocaine obtained at different cytoplasmic pHs could be approximated by a
single relation for each LA.  
CONCLUSIONS:  
The results indicate that both LAs at clinical concentrations equilibrated
rapidly with the intracellular milieu, differentially inhibiting Kir2.x
channel function from the cytoplasmic side.

Local anesthetic inhibition of voltage-activated potassium currents in rat
dorsal root ganglion neurons.  
Komai H, McDowell TS.  
BACKGROUND:  
Local anesthetic actions on the K+ channels of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and
dorsal horn neurons may modulate sensory blockade during neuraxial anesthesia.
In dorsal horn neurons, local anesthetics are known to inhibit transient but
not sustained K+ currents. The authors characterized the effects of local
anesthetics on K+ currents of isolated DRG neurons.  
METHODS:  
The effects of lidocaine, bupivacaine, and tetracaine on K+ currents in
isolated rat DRG neurons were measured with use of a whole cell patch clamp
method. The currents measured were fast-inactivating transient current
(I(Af)), slow-inactivating transient current (I(As)), and noninactivating
sustained current (I(Kn)).  
RESULTS:  
One group of cells (type 1) expressed I(Af) and I(Kn). The other group (type
2) expressed I(As) and I(Kn). The diameter of type 2 cells was smaller than
that of type 1 cells. Lidocaine and bupivacaine inhibited all three K+
currents. Tetracaine inhibited I(As) and I(Kn) but not I(Af) For bupivacaine,
the concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of I(Kn) in type 2 cells
was lower than that for I(Kn) in type 1 cells (57 vs. 121 microM). Similar
results were obtained for tetracaine (0.6 vs. 1.9 mM) and for lidocaine (2.2
vs. 5.1 mM).  
CONCLUSIONS:  
Local anesthetics inhibited both transient and sustained K+ currents in DRG
neurons. Because K+ current inhibition is known to potentiate local
anesthetic-induced impulse inhibition, the lower IC50 for I(Kn) of small type
2 cells may reflect preferential inhibition of impulses in nociceptive
neurons. The overall modulatory actions of local anesthetics probably are
determined by their differential effects on presynaptic (DRG) and postsynaptic
(dorsal horn neurons) K+ currents.

Induction of intracellular acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in  
glioblastoma cells by lidocaine.  
Jeng I, Klemm N, Bressie S, Samson L.  
The perturbation of cellular cholesteryl ester biosynthesis in glioblastoma
C-6  
cells by lidocaine was investigated. Lidocaine specifically inhibited the  
incorporation of radioactive oleic acid into cellular cholesteryl ester but
had  
no significant effect on the incorporation of oleic acid into  
phosphatidylcholine. Oxygenated cholesterol-enhanced cholesteryl ester
formation  
was less sensitive to lidocaine inhibition. Several other local anesthetics
were  
compared. Lidocaine altered cholesteryl ester formation in time- and  
dose-dependent manners. Lidocaine was a powerful inhibitor initially and its  
potency declined with time. Lidocaine was capable of directly inhibiting  
acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in broken cell
homogenates.  
The lidocaine-mediated inhibition of cellular cholesteryl ester formation  
triggered an enhanced intracellular ACAT activity that was not fully expressed
in  
the presence of lidocaine. The activation of ACAT activity by lidocaine might  
represent a compensatory mechanism by which the inhibitory effect of lidocaine  
was partially overcome with time.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate induces c6 glioma chemosensitization via  
antidepressant-like lysosomal phospholipidosis/myelinosis in vitro.

The authors have previously shown that medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)
inhibits  
growth and increases drug sensitivity in C6 glioma with myeloid bodies.
Myeloid  
bodies can occur in cells either due to robust toxicity with mitochondrial  
membrane disruption or due to milder events such as seen in  
lysosomal-phospholipidosis. Exact patterns of myelinosis accompanying to MPA  
chemo-sensitization is important, because uncoupling of nuclear versus  
mitochondrial toxicity of anti-neoplastics by MPA would lead to safer
employment  
of glioma chemotherapy with reduced neurotoxicity. By monitoring and comparing  
cell kinetics with fine structural features of cell death, the authors
estimated  
subcellular effects accompanying growth-inhibitory drug actions in C6 glioma.
The  
analysis revealed that MPA induced mainly lysosomal phospholipidosis, while  
inhibiting clonogenicity alone and augmenting procarbazine efficacy. It
induced  
apoptosis in combination with cisplatin. It reduced mitochondrial-damage-based  
early cytotoxicity of methotrexate, yet it did not hinder its anti-clonogenic  
efficacy. Progesterone analogues - similar to antidepressants - inhibit  
cholesterol esterification, and this efficacy relates with their
P-glycoprotein  
inhibition. Reducing esterification and plasma-membrane localization of  
cholesterol may lead MPA induction of lysosomal phospholipidosis, growth  
indolency, and drug sensitization in glioma.

We have studied the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on C6 glioma  
growth in vitro in order to prove the hypothesis that it could arrest growth
and  
induce drug sensitisation in a glial tumour as it does in breast cancer cells.  
Plating, thymidine-labelling index, ultra-structure, and soft agar colony
growth  
were determined after incubation with MPA, and/or cisplatin, procarbazine and  
methotrexate (MTX). MPA (microg/ml) reduced the thymidine-labelling index by
41  
and 73% at 48 and 96 h, respectively, and decreased colony growth by 61%. Soft  
agar colony inhibition by MPA was almost as potent as MTX (0.3 microg/ml), but  
the latter drug showed very high cytotoxicity. Electron microscopy revealed
that  
in medroxyprogesterone treated cells myeloid bodies developed, but MTX
treatment  
caused mainly necrosis. Medroxyprogesterone increased procarbazine and  
cisplatin-induced colony growth and S-phase inhibition, but reduced MTX-
induced  
thymidine-labelling inhibition. In conclusion, progesterone may inhibit growth  
and sensitize to drugs.

Memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane) blocks the serotonin-induced  
depolarization response in a neuronal cell line.  
Reiser G(1), Binmöller FJ, Koch R.  
(1)Physiologisch-chemisches Institut der Universität Tübingen, F.R.G.  
The influence of memantine on several properties of a neuronal cell line was  
tested. The aim was to get some insight into possible mechanisms of action of  
this drug which is therapeutically applicable in treatment of spasticity,  
Parkinson's disease, and cerebral coma. In neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid
cells,  
memantine, at micromolar concentrations, blocked the depolarization induced by  
iontophoretically applied serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). In the hybrid  
cells, receptors of the 5-HT3 type mediated the depolarization, which was  
frequently accompanied by a series of action potentials. The inhibition by  
memantine of the serotonin response occurred fast and was completely
reversible,  
irrespective of whether the cell showed a stable membrane potential or  
spontaneous action potentials. However, memantine did not alter spontaneous or  
electrically evoked action potential activity in the hybrid cells, and
apparently  
did not block the underlying ionic conductances. Furthermore memantine did not  
affect either the cation permeability activated by substance P in the hybrid  
cells or the K+ channel triggered by bradykinin in a glioma cell line. Thus,  
memantine appears specifically to suppress the ion channel opened by serotonin
in  
the hybrid cells. The interaction of memantine with serotonin receptors and
the  
associated ion channels reported here, might give an important clue, as to a
site  
of action of memantine in the nervous system.

Efficacy of local polymer-based and systemic delivery of the anti-
glutamatergic  
agents riluzole and memantine in rat glioma models.

OBJECT: The poor outcome of malignant gliomas is largely due to local  
invasiveness. Previous studies suggest that gliomas secrete excess glutamate
and  
destroy surrounding normal peritumoral brain by means of excitotoxic
mechanisms.  
In this study the authors assessed the effect on survival of 2 glutamate  
modulators (riluzole and memantine) in rodent glioma models.  
METHODS: In an in vitro growth inhibition assay, F98 and 9L cells were exposed
to  
riluzole and memantine. Mouse cerebellar organotypic cultures were implanted
with  
F98 glioma cells and treated with radiation, radiation + riluzole, or vehicle
and  
assessed for tumor growth. Safety and tolerability of intracranially implanted  
riluzole and memantine CPP:SA polymers were tested in F344 rats. The efficacy
of  
these drugs was tested against the 9L model and riluzole was further tested
with  
and without radiation therapy (RT).  
RESULTS: In vitro assays showed effective growth inhibition of both drugs on
F98  
and 9L cell lines. F98 organotypic cultures showed reduced growth of tumors  
treated with radiation and riluzole in comparison with untreated cultures or  
cultures treated with radiation or riluzole alone. Three separate efficacy  
experiments all showed that localized delivery of riluzole or memantine is  
efficacious against the 9L gliosarcoma tumor in vivo. Systemic riluzole  
monotherapy was ineffective; however, riluzole given with RT resulted in
improved  
survival.  
CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole and memantine can be safely and effectively delivered  
intracranially via polymer in rat glioma models. Both drugs demonstrate
efficacy  
against the 9L gliosarcoma and F98 glioma in vitro and in vivo. Although
systemic  
riluzole proved ineffective in increasing survival, riluzole acted  
synergistically with radiation and increased survival compared with RT or  
riluzole alone.

In this review article, we describe the unrecognized roles of glutamate and  
glutamate receptors in malignant glioma biology. The neurotransmitter
glutamate  
released from malignant glioma cells in the extracellular matrix is
responsible  
for seizure induction and at higher concentration neuronal cell death. This  
neuronal cell death will create vacated place for tumor growth. Glutamate also  
stimulates the growth and the migration of glial tumor cells by means of the  
activation of glutamate receptors on glioma cells in a paracrine and autocrine  
manner. The multitude of effects of glutamate in glioma biology supports the  
rationale for pharmacological targeting of glutamate receptors and
transporters  
in the adjuvant treatment of malignant gliomas in neurology and neuro-
oncology.  
Using the website [ www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)
as a reference - a service developed by  
the National Library of Medicine for the National Health Institute in USA - we  
have evoked the few clinical trials completed and currently ongoing with  
therapies targeting the glutamate receptors.

Gliomas are one of the most common types of malignant tumors worldwide,
however, an effective therapeutic strategy not yet been fully determined. The
present study aimed to investigate the anti-glioma activity and underlying
mechanisms of pregnenolone, which originates from cholesterol and is
metabolized into important steroid hormones in the body. The results
demonstrated that 100 μM pregnenolone induced a significant loss of cell
viability in various malignant glioma cell lines. In the U-87 MG, LN-18 and C6
cell lines, the loss of cell viability resulted from cell apoptosis, which was
evidenced by apoptotic nuclear morphology changes and caspase 3 activation.
Moreover, the increased activities of caspase 8 and 9 strongly indicated that
pregnenolone activated the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis.
Additionally, glioma cell apoptosis was prevented by the general caspase
inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. In the C6 cells, upregulation of Fas and Fas ligand
triggered the activation of the extrinsic pathway, whereas knockdown of Fas
significantly abrogated the cell apoptosis that was induced by pregnenolone.
Furthermore, downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma 2
and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, activated the
intrinsic pathway. In conclusion, pregnenolone induced glioma cell apoptosis
in a caspase-dependent manner, which was mediated by activation of the
extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.  
Introduction  
Gliomas originate from glial cells and are the most common type of primary
brain tumors accounting for 80% of all malignant primary brain tumors (1).
According to the pathological and clinical criteria established by the World
Health Organization, gliomas are classified as grades I–IV (2,3). Grade IV
tumors, such as glioblastomas (GBMs), are the most devastating and aggressive
form comprising >50% of gliomas, and have a poor prognosis (4). The current
treatment standard of GBMs is surgical resection to a feasible extent,
followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Among the currently available
chemotherapy agents, temozolomide is the most popular; doctors and patients
favor it as it is administrated orally and efficiently crosses the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) (5). However, 67.2–76% of patients are resistant to this agent
and therefore do not benefit from it (6). Regardless of systemic therapeutic
strategies, including surgery, temozolomide and radiotherapy, patient median
survival is only 14.6 months and the five-year survival rate is ~9.8% (7,8).
The poor prognosis of glioma fuels the requirement for identifying therapeutic
agents with the merits of temozolomide, such as high lipophilicity and strong
anti-glioma activity.  
Steroid hormones are generally divided into the following five groups:
Estrogens, androgens, progestogens, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids
(9,10). The natural steroid hormones are predominantly synthesized from
cholesterol in the gonads and adrenal glands, and readily diffuse through the
cell membrane due to their lipophilic properties (11,12). Accumulating
evidence has indicated that certain steroid hormones possess antitumor
activities, such as the 17β-estradiol metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME),
which exerts the strongest activity. 2ME inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis of various types of cancer, including gliomas, and breast and
gastric cancer, independently of estrogen receptors α and β (13–15). However,
findings from a clinical trial identified low oral bioavailability of 2ME,
which prevents the transfer of this promising agent from bench to bed side
(16). The example of 2ME implies the application potential of steroid hormones
and provides the basis for the subsequent investigation of other endogenous
steroid hormones, such as pregnenolone (Fig. 1).  
The present study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects of the
endogenous steroid, pregnenolone, on GBM cells, and the mechanisms underlying
its pro-apoptotic activity via the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
Pregnenolone may be a leading compound in the treatment of gliomas and may be
modified and developed for clinical application.

The role of minocycline in the treatment of intracranial 9L glioma.  
Weingart JD(1), Sipos EP, Brem H.  
(1)Department of Neurological Surgery, Johns Hopkins University School of  
Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.  
This study was designed to explore the question of whether minocycline, a  
semisynthetic tetracycline shown to inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis, could  
control the growth of the rat intracranial 9L gliosarcoma. Minocycline was
tested  
alone and in combination with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) in  
vivo. Treatment was started at the time of intracranial implantation of 9L  
gliosarcoma into male Fischer 344 rats, 5 days later, or after tumor
resection.  
Minocycline was delivered locally with a controlled-release polymer or  
systemically by intraperitoneal injection. Systemic minocycline did not extend  
survival time. Local treatment with minocycline by a controlled-release
polymer  
implanted at the time of tumor implantation extended median survival time by
530%  
(p < 0.001) compared to treatment with empty polymer. When treatment was begun
5  
days after tumor implantation, minocycline delivered locally or systemically
had  
no effect on survival. However, after tumor resection, treatment with locally  
delivered minocycline resulted in a 43% increase in median survival time (p <  
0.002) compared to treatment with empty polymer. Treatment with a combination
of  
minocycline delivered locally in a controlled-release polymer and systemic
BCNU 5  
days after tumor implantation resulted in a 93% extension of median survival
time  
compared to BCNU alone (p < 0.002). In contrast, treatment with a combination
of  
systemic minocycline and BCNU did not increase survival time compared to
systemic  
BCNU alone. These results demonstrate that minocycline affects tumor growth
when  
delivered locally and suggest that minocycline may be a clinically effective  
modulator of intracranial tumor growth when used in combination with a  
chemotherapeutic agent and surgical resection.

Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, has been shown to inhibit tumor  
angiogenesis through inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteinases. Previous  
studies have shown this agent to be effective against a rodent brain tumor
model  
when delivered intracranially and to potentiate the efficacy of standard  
chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, the in vivo efficacy of  
intracranial minocycline delivered by a biodegradable controlled-release
polymer  
against rat intracranial 9L gliosarcoma was investigated to determine whether
it  
potentiates the effects of systemic 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea
(BCNU).  
Minocycline was incorporated into the biodegradable polymer polyanhydride  
poly[bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)propane-sebacic acid] (pCPP:SA) at a ratio of 50:50
by  
weight. The release kinetics of minocycline from the polymer were assessed.
For  
the efficacy studies, female Fischer 344 rats were implanted with 9L glioma.  
Treatment with minocycline delivered by the pCPP:SA polymer at the time of
tumor  
implantation resulted in 100% survival in contrast to untreated control
animals  
that died within 21 days. Treatment with the minocycline-polymer 5 days after  
tumor implantation provided only modest increases in survival. The combination
of  
intracranial minocycline and systemic BCNU extended median survival by 82%  
compared to BCNU alone (p < 0.0001) and 200% compared to no treatment (p <  
0.004). We conclude that local intracranial delivery of minocycline from  
biodegradable controlled-release polymers inhibits tumor growth and may have  
clinical utility when combined with a chemotherapeutic agent.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical signalling molecule involved in various  
physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Both tumouricidal
and  
tumour promoting effects have been attributed to NO, making its role in cancer  
biology controversial and unclear. To investigate the specific role of  
tumour-derived NO in vascular development, C6 glioma cells were genetically  
modified to include a doxycycline regulated gene expression system that
controls  
the expression of an antisense RNA to inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
to  
manipulate endogenous iNOS expression. Xenografts of these cells were
propagated  
in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Susceptibility magnetic resonance  
imaging (MRI), initially with a carbogen (95% O2 /5% CO2 ) breathing challenge  
and subsequently an intravascular blood pool contrast agent, was used to
assess  
haemodynamic vasculature (ΔR2 *) and fractional blood volume (fBV), and  
correlated with histopathological assessment of tumour vascular density,  
maturation and function. Inhibition of NO production in C6 gliomas led to  
significant growth delay and inhibition of vessel maturation. Parametric fBV
maps  
were used to identify vascularised regions from which the carbogen-induced ΔR2
*  
was measured and found to be positively correlated with vessel maturation,  
quantified ex vivo using fluorescence microscopy for endothelial and
perivascular  
cell staining. These data suggest that tumour-derived iNOS is an important  
mediator of tumour growth and vessel maturation, hence a promising target for  
anti-vascular cancer therapies. The combination of ΔR2 * response to carbogen
and  
fBV MRI can provide a marker of tumour vessel maturation that could be applied
to  
non-invasively monitor treatment response to iNOS inhibitors.

Methylene blue induces cytotoxicity in human brain tumor cells.

Methylene blue (MB), a known inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, induced
cytotoxicity  
in SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma and U-373 MG human astrocytoma cells in a  
dose-dependent manner. MB did not significantly alter cellular levels of cGMP
in  
both cells. 8-Br cGMP, a membrane-permeable analogue of cGMP, did not decrease  
MB-induced cytotoxicity, indicating that cGMP may not be a major target of the  
cytotoxic action of MB. However, hydroxyl radical scavengers or intracellular  
Ca2+ modulators effectively blocked the MB-induced cytotoxicity. These results  
suggest that hydroxyl radical and intracellular Ca2+ may have an important  
involvement in the cytotoxic action of MB. These results further suggest that
the  
treatment with MB may be useful for the therapeutic applications of human
brain  
tumors.

Brain has exceptional high requirement for energy metabolism with glucose as
the  
exclusive energy source. Decrease of brain energy metabolism and glucose
uptake  
has been found in patients of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other  
neurodegenerative diseases, providing a clear link between neurodegenerative  
disorders and energy metabolism. On the other hand, cancers, including  
glioblastoma, have increased glucose uptake and rely on aerobic glycolysis for  
energy metabolism. The switch of high efficient oxidative phosphorylation to
low  
efficient aerobic glycolysis pathway (Warburg effect) provides macromolecule
for  
biosynthesis and proliferation. Current research indicates that methylene
blue, a  
century old drug, can receive electron from NADH in the presence of complex I
and  
donates it to cytochrome c, providing an alternative electron transfer
pathway.  
Methylene blue increases oxygen consumption, decrease glycolysis, and
increases  
glucose uptake in vitro. Methylene blue enhances glucose uptake and regional  
cerebral blood flow in rats upon acute treatment. In addition, methylene blue  
provides protective effect in neuron and astrocyte against various insults in  
vitro and in rodent models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's
disease.  
In glioblastoma cells, methylene blue reverses Warburg effect by enhancing  
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, arrests glioma cell cycle at s-phase,  
and inhibits glioma cell proliferation. Accordingly, methylene blue activates  
AMP-activated protein kinase, inhibits downstream acetyl-coA carboxylase and  
cyclin-dependent kinases. In summary, there is accumulating evidence providing
a  
proof of concept that enhancement of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
via  
alternative mitochondrial electron transfer may offer protective action
against  
neurodegenerative diseases and inhibit cancers proliferation.

Progesterone has been suggested to be involved in the functions of the nervous  
system, but it has yet to be examined in humans. Progesterone has also been  
postulated to be involved in the biological behavior of various human
neurogenic  
tumors via **progesterone receptors A and B (PR-A and PR-B). In this study we  
examined the expression of PR and the enzymes responsible for progesterone **  
biosynthesis (P450scc, 3betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and steroidogenic  
acute regulatory protein) in human brain. We also examined the distribution of  
PR isoforms in neurogenic tumors using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR
analysis.  
The presence of PR and mRNA for P450scc, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,
and  
steroidogenic acute regulatory protein was detected in human brain. PR
isoforms  
were detected in neurogenic tumors. PR-A and PR-B were equally expressed in  
meningiomas, but PR-B was the predominant isoform compared with PR-A in  
astrocytic tumors and Schwannomas. There was **a statistically significant
inverse  
correlation between PR-A and the proliferation index in meningiomas and  
astrocytic tumors. These findings suggest that progesterone is locally  
synthesized and exerts its actions through PR in the human central nervous  
system, and that progesterone may be involved in regulation of the growth and  
development of neurogenic tumors via PR, especially in the inhibition of tumor  
cell proliferation via PR-A. **

Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a transmembrane enzyme upregulated in several  
types of tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is among the most  
aggressive tumors among gliomas. Temozolomide (TMZ) therapy combined with  
surgical or radiation approaches is the standard treatment but not effective
in  
long term. In this study we tested the treatment with acetazolamide (ATZ), an  
inhibitor of CAIX, alone or combined with TMZ. The experiments were performed
in  
2D and 3D cultures (spheroids) using glioblastoma U251N and human brain tumor  
stem cells (BTSCs). Several proteins implicated in tumor cell death were also  
investigated. The key results from these studies suggest the following: (1)
Cell  
death of human glioblastoma spheroids and BTSC is significantly increased with  
combined treatment after 7 days, and (2) the effectiveness of ATZ is  
significantly enhanced against BTSC and U251N when incorporated into  
nano-carriers. Collectively, these results point toward the usefulness of  
nano-delivery of CAIX inhibitors and their combination with chemotherapeutics
for  
glioblastoma treatment.

HIF-1α regulated genes are mainly responsible for tumour resistance to
radiation-  
and chemo-therapy. Among these genes, carbonic anhydrase isoform IX (CA9) is  
highly over expressed in many types of cancer especially in high grade brain  
cancer like Glioblastoma (GBM). Inhibition of the enzymatic activity by  
application of specific chemical CA9 inhibitor sulphonamides (CAI) like  
Acetazolamide (Aza.), the new sulfonamide derivative carbonic anhydrase
inhibitor  
(SU.D2) or indirect inhibitors like the HIF-1α inhibitor Chetomin or molecular  
inhibitors like CA9-siRNA are leading to an inhibition of the functional role
of  
CA9 during tumorigenesis. Human GBM cells were treated with in vitro hypoxia
(1,  
6, or 24 h at 0.1%, O2). Aza. application was at a range between 250 and 8000
nM  
and the HIF-1α inhibitor Chetomin at a concentration range of 150-500 nM. Cell  
culture plates were incubated for 24 h under hypoxia (0.1% O2). Further,  
CA9-siRNA constructs were transiently transfected into GBM cells exposed to  
extreme hypoxic aeration conditions. CA9 protein expression level was
detectable  
in a cell-type specific manner under normoxic conditions. Whereas U87-MG  
exhibited a strong aerobic expression, U251 and U373 displayed moderate and
GaMG  
very weak normoxic CA9 protein bands. Aza. as well as SU.D2 displayed
inhibitory  
characteristics to hypoxia induced CA9 expression in the four GBM cell lines
for  
24 h of hypoxia (0.1% O2) at concentrations between 3500 and 8000 nM, on both
the  
protein and mRNA level. Parallel experiments using CA9-siRNA confirmed these  
results. Application of 150-500 nM of the glycolysis inhibitor Chetomin under  
similar oxygenation conditions **led to a sharply reduced expression of both
CA IX  
protein and CA9 mRNA levels, indicating a clear glucose availability
involvement  
for the hypoxic HIF-1α and CA9 expression in GBM cells. ** Hypoxia
significantly  
influences the behaviour of human tumour cells by activation of genes involved
in  
the adaptation to hypoxic stress. The main objective in malignant GBM therapy
is  
either to **eradicate the tumour or to convert it into a controlled, quiescent  
chronic disease. ** Aza., SU.D2, Chetomin or CA9-siRNA possesses functional
CA9  
inhibitory characteristics when applied against human cancers with hypoxic  
regions like GBM. They may be used as alternative or in conjunction with other  
direct inhibitors possessing similar functionality, thereby rendering them as  
potential optimal tools for the development of an optimized therapy in human  
brain cancer treatment.

Aromatase, the enzyme responsible for estrogen biosynthesis, is expressed by  
human and rat glioblastomas.

The biosynthesis of estradiol and related estrogens is catalyzed by the enzyme  
aromatase. Among other tissues, aromatase is expressed in the brain, where it
is  
involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine events and reproduction. Under  
physiological conditions, the expression of aromatase in the mammalian brain
is  
restricted to neurons. However, recent studies have shown that reactive  
astrocytes express aromatase after brain injury. This opens the possibility
for  
the expression of the enzyme in other altered forms of glial cell, such as  
gliomas. In the present study, the expression of aromatase has been assessed,
by  
RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, in the rat glioblastoma C6 and in two human  
glioblastoma cell lines T98G and U373MG. **The three cell lines expressed
aromatase  
mRNA and showed a cytoplasmic pattern of aromatase immunoreactivity. In
addition,  
the three cell lines express estrogen receptor alpha, suggesting that
estradiol  
formed by aromatase may act as an autocrine ** or paracrine factor for
glioblastoma  
cells. By analogy to the implication of aromatase into the growth of other
forms  
of estrogen-sensitive tumors, such as some breast cancers, it is conceivable
that  
the expression of aromatase may play a role in the growth of glioblastomas.

Aromatase is a critical enzyme in the irreversible conversion of androgens to  
oestrogens, with inhibition used clinically in hormone-dependent malignancies.
We  
tested the hypothesis that targeted aromatase inhibition in an aggressive
brain  
cancer called glioblastoma (GBM) may represent a new treatment strategy. In
this  
study, aromatase inhibition was achieved using third generation inhibitor,  
Letrozole, encapsulated within the core of biodegradable poly lactic-co-
glycolic  
acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs). PLGA-NPs were conjugated to human/mouse
chimeric  
anti-GD2 antibody ch14.18/CHO, enabling specific targeting of GD2-positive GBM  
cells. Treatment of primary and recurrent patient-derived GBM cells with  
free-Letrozole (0.1 μM) led to significant decrease in cell proliferation and  
migration; in addition to reduced spheroid formation. Anti-GD2-ch14.18/CHO-NPs  
displayed specific targeting of GBM cells in colorectal-glioblastoma co-
culture,  
with subsequent reduction in GBM cell numbers when treated with  
anti-GD2-ch14.18-PLGA-Let-NPs in combination with temozolomide. As miR-191 is
an  
estrogen responsive microRNA, its expression, fluctuation and role in
Letrozole  
treated GBM cells was evaluated, where treatment with premiR-191 was capable
of  
rescuing the reduced proliferative phenotype induced by aromatase inhibitor.
The  
repurposing and targeted delivery of Letrozole for the treatment of GBM, with
the  
potential role of miR-191 identified, provides novel avenues for target  
assessment in this aggressive brain cancer.

Estrogens are oncogenic hormones at a high level in breast, prostate,
endometrial  
and lung cancer. Estrogens are synthesized by aromatase which has been used as
a  
biomarker both in breast and lung cancer. Estrogen biological activities are  
executed by their classic receptors (ERα and ERβ). ERα has been described as a  
cancer promoter and ERβ, as a possible tumor suppressor. Both receptors are  
present at low levels in primary multiforme glioblastoma (GBM). The GBM
frequency  
is 50 % higher in men than in women. The GBM patient survival period ranges
from  
7 to 18 months. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate aromatase and  
estrogen receptor expression, as well as 17ß-estradiol concentration in  
astrocytoma patients biopsies to obtain a prognosis biomarker for these
patients.  
We analyzed 36 biopsies of astrocytoma patients with a different grade (I-IV)
of  
malignity. Aromatase and estrogen receptor mRNA expression were analyzed by  
semiquantitative RT-PCR, and the E2 levels, by ELISA **. E2 concentration was
higher  
in GBM, compared to grade II or III astrocytomas. ** The number of cells  
immunoreactive to aromatase and estrogen receptors decreased as the grade of  
tumor malignity increased. **Aromatase mRNA expression was present in all
biopsies,  
regardless of malignity grade or patient age or gender. ** The highest
expression of  
aromatase mRNA in GBM patients was associated to the worst survival prognostic  
(6.28 months). In contrast lowest expression of ERα mRNA in astrocytoma
patients  
had a worst prognosis. In conclusion, aromatase and ERα expression could be
used  
as prognosis biomarkers for astrocytoma patients.

Fisetin suppresses ADAM9 expression and inhibits invasion of glioma cancer
cells  
through increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2.

Hospital,

Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a naturally occurring flavonoid
which  
is widely distributed in plants. It has been reported to possess some
anticancer  
and anti-invasive capabilities. We set out to explore the effects of fisetin
on  
antimetastatic and its mechanism of action in GBM8401 cells. The results  
indicated that fisetin exhibited effective inhibition of cell migration and  
inhibited the invasion of GBM8401 cells under non-cytotoxic concentrations. To  
identify the potential targets of fisetin, human proteinase antibody array  
analysis was performed, and the results indicated that the fisetin treatment  
inhibited the expression of ADAM9 protein and mRNA, which are known to
contribute  
to the progression of glioma cancer. Our results showed that fisetin  
phosphorylated ERK1/2 in a sustained way that contributed to the inhibited
ADAM9  
protein and mRNA expression determined by Western blot and RT-PCR. Moreover,  
inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 or transfection with the siERK plasmid  
significantly abolished the fisetin-inhibited migration and invasion through  
activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. In summary, our results suggest that fisetin  
might be a potential therapeutic agent against human glioma cells based on its  
capacity to activate ERK1/2 and to inhibit ADAM9 expression.

This proposal seeks to study the potential therapeutic modality of  
chemoprevention and anticancer effects and mechanisms of the flavonoids from  
Cotinus coggygria Scop. on glioblastoma cancer. In the current study, the
total  
flavonoids (TFs) isolated from Cotinus coggygria Scop. var. cinerea Engl.  
(Cotinus coggygria Scop.) and the major flavonoids of Cotinus coggygria Scop.  
(CCFs) were identified, and the inhibitory kinetics of TF and CCF on
glioblastoma  
cell lines were calculated. We also investigated whether TF or CCF regulated
the  
apoptotic mechanism in cellular models of glio-blastoma cells. Finally, we  
evaluated whether treatment with TF or CCF suppressed tumor growth and
inhibited  
migration in orthotopic mouse models of glioblastoma in vivo. In this study,
the  
CCFs were identified as rutin, myricetin, and fisetin. TF and CCF remarkably  
inhibited cell proliferation and downregulated the PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling  
pathway in glioblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, the mitochondrial  
caspase-dependent cascade was regulated by TF and myricetin. In addition, TF
and  
myricetin exhibited significant antitumor effects on glioblastoma in vivo.
Taken  
together, these results suggest that phytochemical and biological data provide  
evidence for the active components in Cotinus coggygria, and that the TFs are  
responsible for the anticancer effects on glioblastoma cell growth via
induction  
of apoptosis. In addition, the representative compound myricetin could provide
a  
clinically relevant therapeutic opportunity. Therefore, our data strongly
suggest  
that myricetin-deprived CCF can serve as a potent chemopreventive herbal  
medicine.

The effect of gamma-tocopherol on proliferation, integrin expression,
adhesion, and migration of human glioma cells.  
Samandari E, Visarius T, Zingg JM, Azzi A.  
The effect of vitamin E on proliferation, integrin expression, adhesion, and
migration in human glioma cells has been studied. gamma-tocopherol at 50
microM concentration exerted more inhibitory effect than alpha-tocopherol at
the same concentration on glioma cell proliferation. Integrin alpha5 and beta1
protein levels were increased upon both alpha- and gamma-tocopherol
treatments. In parallel, an increase in the alpha5beta1 heterodimer cell
surface expression was observed. The tocopherols inhibited glioma cell-binding
to fibronectin where gamma-tocopherol treatment induced glioma cell migration.
Taken together, the data reported here are consistent with the notion that the
inhibition of glioma cell proliferation induced by tocopherols may be
mediated, at least in part, by an increase in integrin alpha5 and beta1
expression. Cell adhesion is also negatively affected by tocopherols, despite
a small increase in the surface appearance of the alpha5beta1 heterodimer.
Cell migration is stimulated by gamma-tocopherol. It is concluded that alpha5
and beta1 integrin expression and surface appearance are not sufficient to
explain all the observations and that other integrins or in general other
factors may be associated with these events.

Chemoprevention strategies for brain tumors (specifically gliomas) are few and  
surprisingly poorly investigated. We have studied the effects of tocopherols  
(TOCs; vitamin E) on proliferation and death processes of murine glioma C6
cells.  
These vitamers showed different cell uptake and concentration- and time-
dependent  
inhibitory effects on cell growth that were significant at the lowest  
concentrations tested (1-10 microM). However, the inhibitory potency of TOCs  
seemed to reflect at least in part their actual cell concentrations at steady  
state, with the order of magnitude gamma-TOC >or= alpha-TOC > delta-TOC  
approximately or = beta-TOC. Moreover, for extracellular concentrations >or=10  
microM, TOCs also showed a significant cytotoxic effects due mainly to
necrosis,  
while apoptosis was negligible. Gamma-TOC (the form showing preferential cell  
uptake and lowest unspecific cytotoxicity) was the most effective inhibitor of  
cell cycle progression (arrest in G0/G1 phase) leading to lowered expression
of  
cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 and overexpression of p27
(specific  
inhibitor of S-phase entering). According to these signals, activated ERK1/2
and  
PKC upstream and Rb phosphorylation downstream were decreased. In conclusion,  
within TOCs the gamma form exerts the most potent and specific control of cell  
cycle progression in C6 cells (cytostatic effect). This suggests a  
chemopreventive role of this form of vitamin E in gliomas.

Study on the specificity of alpha-tocopheryl (vitamin E) acid succinate
effects

d- and dl-alpha-tocopheryl succinate inhibited growth and caused morphological  
changes in mouse melanoma (B-16), mouse neuroblastoma (NBP2), and rat glioma  
(C-6) cells in culture. To study whether the effects of alpha-tocopheryl
(vitamin  
E) succinate on tumor cells are mediated by antioxidant mechanisms, the
effects  
of lipid-soluble antioxidants, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated  
hydroxytoluene (BHT) were compared with those of vitamin E succinate. Results  
showed that these antioxidants produced alterations on the growth and
morphology  
of neuroblastoma, melanoma, and glioma cells which are similar to those
produced  
by vitamin E succinate; however, the extent of the effect depended upon the
type  
of antioxidant and the form of tumor cells. These data suggest that the
effects  
of vitamin E succinate on tumor cells may be mediated, in part, by antioxidant  
mechanisms.

The antitumor effects of vitamin K2 were studied using three glioma cell
lines:  
C6 (rat glioma cell), RBR17T and T98G (human glioma cell). The antitumor
effects  
were estimated by count assay. The results was that vitamin K2 induced growth  
inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. The RBR 17T cells exposed to vitamin K2  
for 72 hours resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and formed a
ladder  
on agarose gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the RBR17T cells exposed to
vitamin  
K2 for 24 hours were significantly accumulated in the G0G1 phase of the cell  
cycle. Those results suggested that vitamin K2 can inhibit the proliferation
of  
cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis for tumor
cells.  
The combined treatment of vitamin K2 with ACNU or 5-FU or INF-beta or  
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhanced growth inhibition significantly. In
conclusion,  
vitamin K2 can be a useful drug for the treatment of glioma.

The biological significance of vitamin D receptors expressed by glioblastoma
and  
other glial tumours is still unclear. In an effort to clarify this issue we  
studied the effects of increasing concentrations of 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and  
its metabolite 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on two human glioblastoma cell  
lines. Both substances were capable of inducing a significant (> 50%)
reduction  
in growth of the two glioblastoma cell lines at dosages over 5 microM. When
the  
HU 70 cell line was treated by increasing dilutions of 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3  
combined with 1 microM all trans-retinoic acid, significant inhibition was  
apparent even after addition of 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the nanomolar range.  
Reduction of growth index was mainly due to induced cell death. Our results  
provide in vitro evidence that vitamin D metabolites alone or in combination
with  
retinoids may be potentially useful agents in the differentiation therapy of  
human malignant gliomas.

**Me:**  
Hi Ray,  
  
I've looked a bit into minerals, vitamins and their balance which affect
enzymes which in turn affect hormones. So in this regard I wonder what would
be the purpose to manipulate hormones rather than minerals/vitamins intake,
and last but not least, how would supplementing even low doses of hormones not
lead to minerals/vitamins imbalances?  
From what I understand enzymes are tightly regulated by nutrients, and if not
enough of the right nutrients are provided then the body will not function
properly, similarly, supplementing hormones may resolve issues in the short
term but then induce deficiencies etc..  
  
**Ray:**  
The body has a powerful selective ability, able to extract things against a
concentration gradient. For example, when hair is stripped of minerals and
then dipped into a solution of minerals similar to the serum (high sodium, low
potassium, etc.) the hair will take up potassium in preference to sodium. And
the hair is dead—living cells have even greater selectivity. It’s energy that
maintains the structural selectivity; thyroid provides energy, cholesterol/ [

Energy maintaining structure and its selectivity?  
  
What would be the negative consequences of normalizing stress hormones through
direct intervention? Without meeting the condition that got them to become
elevated in the first place.  
  
  
**Raymond:**  
  
When cortisol is increased, though it does reduce inflammation and reduce
leakiness, it’s antagonistic to androgens, and shifts the balance toward
protein catabolism, and lowers the oxidation of glucose.  
  
Related to selectivity of energized cytoplasm---D.N. Nasonov, V.I. Vernadsky,
H.G. Bungenberg de Jong, G.N. Ling, A.S. Troshin, V. Matveev, Sidney Fox, and
recently I think Jeremy L. England is working on related things, energy
creating order.  
  
**Me:**  
  
If serotonin or estrogen were involved rather than cortisol, would you have
the same approach?  
  
Do you know if particular conditions could lead to high cortisol, serotonin or
estrogen and unless they are addressed the need for supplemental hormones or
drugs will always be present?  
The only people I've seen use hormonal supplements and not need them anymore
used thyroid, but most people need the supplements continuously and quite a
few had troubles with dhea, pregnenolone or thyroid. Micro-dosing psilocybin
or lsd appears to benefit all and relieve depression but again the benefits
vanish upon cessation.  
  
**Ray:**  
  
Although occasionally a short supplementation of progesterone, pregnenolone,
or thyroid will decisively correct a problem, most often there has been
something environmental-nutritional that had to be changed. If people don’t
change their diet and/or problematic surroundings, then they are dependent on
hormones, stimulants, antiinflammatories, etc.

**Q:** I would like to know your take on the Hydrogen Gas as a therapy, with
more recent studies in mice showing pretty significant protective effects. Is
hydrogen gas able to be absorb into the bloodstream and diffuse into the cells
as an antioxidant, and would it differ from normal hydrogen gas produced by
the gut bacteria? Perhaps concentration? There are some hydrogen gas producing
generators base on electrolysis, and there are elemental magnesium based
tablets that can be added to water. Are these worth testing?  
  
_**A: I would be cautious with the hydrogen generating tablets, but hydrogen
gas is plausible as an antiinflammatory supplement. I think any produced by
bacteria might be beneficial too.** _  
  
**Q:** Do you think the Hydrogen producing tablets risk is associated with
alkalinity/Hydroxide formation or heavy metals?  
  
**_A: Impurities would be my concern with the tablets._ **

Molecular hydrogen as a novel antioxidant: overview of the advantages of
hydrogen  
for medical applications.

(1)Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Development and  
Aging Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Kawasaki,  
Japan. Electronic address: [ ohta@nms.ac.jp ](mailto:ohta@nms.ac.jp) .  
Molecular hydrogen (H2) was believed to be inert and nonfunctional in
mammalian  
cells. We overturned this concept by demonstrating that H2 reacts with highly  
reactive oxidants such as hydroxyl radical ((•)OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-))  
inside cells. H2 has several advantages exhibiting marked effects for medical  
applications: it is mild enough neither to disturb metabolic redox reactions
nor  
to affect signaling by reactive oxygen species. Therefore, it should have no
or  
little adverse effects. H2 can be monitored with an H2-specific electrode or
by  
gas chromatography. H2 rapidly diffuses into tissues and cells to exhibit  
efficient effects. Thus, we proposed the potential of H2 for preventive and  
therapeutic applications. There are several methods to ingest or consume H2:  
inhaling H2 gas, drinking H2-dissolved water (H2-water), injecting
H2-dissolved  
saline (H2-saline), taking an H2 bath, or dropping H2-saline onto the eyes.  
Recent publications revealed that, in addition to the direct neutralization of  
highly reactive oxidants, H2 indirectly reduces oxidative stress by regulating  
the expression of various genes. Moreover, by regulating gene expression, H2  
functions as an anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and antiapoptotic molecule,
and  
stimulates energy metabolism. In addition to growing evidence obtained by
model  
animal experiments, extensive clinical examinations were performed or are
under  
way. Since most drugs specifically act on their specific targets, H2 seems to  
differ from conventional pharmaceutical drugs. Owing to its great efficacy and  
lack of adverse effects, H2 has potential for clinical applications for many  
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhagic shock followed by fluid resuscitation (HS/R)
triggers  
an inflammatory response and causes pulmonary inflammation that can lead to
acute  
lung injury (ALI). Hydrogen, a therapeutic gas, has potent cytoprotective,  
antiinflammatory, and antioxidant effects. This study examined the effects of  
inhaled hydrogen on ALI caused by HS/R.  
METHODS: Rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock by withdrawing blood to
lower  
blood pressure followed by resuscitation with shed blood and saline to restore  
blood pressure. After HS/R, the rats were maintained in a control gas of
similar  
composition to room air or exposed to 1.3% hydrogen.  
RESULTS: HS/R induced ALI, as demonstrated by significantly impaired gas  
exchange, congestion, edema, cellular infiltration, and hemorrhage in the
lungs.  
Hydrogen inhalation mitigated lung injury after HS/R, as indicated by  
significantly improved gas exchange and reduced cellular infiltration and  
hemorrhage. Hydrogen inhalation did not affect hemodynamic status during HS/R.  
Exposure to 1.3% hydrogen significantly attenuated the upregulation of the  
messenger RNAs for several proinflammatory mediators induced by HS/R. Lipid  
peroxidation was reduced significantly in the presence of hydrogen, indicating  
antioxidant effects.  
CONCLUSION: Hydrogen, administered through inhalation, may exert potent  
therapeutic effects against ALI induced by HS/R and attenuate the activation
of  
inflammatory cascades.

Ray said: "Inflammation in the intestine can raise systemic or regional
histamine and serotinin enough to cause prostate swelling. Avoiding starchy

inflammation. An antihistamine (diphenhydrame or cyproheptadine) and [ aspirin

On potassium and magnesium exacerbating anxiety caused by raised aldosterone:  
  
Q: "I'm reading about electrolytes now in clinical chemistry. I havent studied
ling's work in detail, though i plan to once I'm done with school. I was
curious about aldosterone, how can magnesium and potassium alone, without
sodium, exacerbate hyperaldosteronism? Is it the mineral balance of renal
cells? Thank you very much."  
  
Ray: "I don’t know that anyone has ever worked out the details of a Lingian
approach to the effect of potassium on aldosterone, but now I’ll start
thinking about it.  
  
Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss. 1984 Apr;77 Spec No:87-91.  
[Effects of potassium on renin and aldosterone].  
[Article in French]  
Kotchen TA.  
The renin-aldosterone system contributes to the regulation of arterial
pressure and to the maintenance of sodium and potassium balance. Alterations
in plasma potassium concentration have opposite and independent effects on
renin secretion by the kidney and on aldosterone secretion by the adrenal
gland. Renin secretion tends to be inhibited by hyperkalemia and stimulated by
potassium depletion. In contrast, increases of plasma potassium directly
stimulate aldosterone secretion. This effect of potassium on aldosterone
serves as a protective mechanism against the development of hyperkalemia.
Conversely, hypokalemia inhibits aldosterone production. Small changes in
plasma potassium have a greater effect on aldosterone than on renin secretion.
In patients with essential hypertension, diuretic induced alterations in serum
potassium concentrations may affect both renin and aldosterone secretion. We
have observed that therapy with a thiazide diuretic results in a reduction of
serum potassium and a greater increase in renin activity than therapy with the
potassium-retaining diuretic, spironolactone, despite comparable natriuretic
responses with both drugs. Conversely spironolactone therapy is associated
with a greater increase in aldosterone production. The greater effect of
thiazides on renin activity and the greater effect of spironolactone on
aldosterone production may be related to the thiazide induced reduction of
serum potassium and the spironolactone induced increases of serum potassium."

You've said that a person can adjust their thyroid dosage based on feel; do
you think the presence of either anxiety or depression solely can be used as
an indicator to increase one's dosage of T3 and T4? Many find it difficult to

Dr. Peat: "Pulse rate, combined with temperature, helps, and the temperature

feelings of anxiety or depression, but it’s good to have something objective.

I will post more later, I hope others can benefit from these questions and
answers.  
**  
  
  
Me ** : Do you think 10% of total calories coming from fat is enough? ( The
fat is from milk ) Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : For some people it might be, but for good digestion I think 20%
is better.  
  
**Me:** The opioid peptide beta-casomorphine-7 from A1 milk worries me, do you
have any thoughts on this since you haven't spoken fondly of opioids  
**Ray Peat** : The experiments involved injecting it into brains. It’s a
peptide derived from partial digestion of casein; good digestion should reduce
it to amino acids.  
  
**Me** : Do you know of any topical substance, that can get rid of stretch
marks, and or keep them from forming? My wife is pregnant with twins, and is
getting pretty tight skin. Thank you!  
**Ray Peat:** I had a cousin with vivid stretch marks on her pregnant belly,
and after just a couple of days of adding eggs and oysters to her diet they
were completely gone.  
  
**Me** : In regards to coffee's benefits, do you think its best to consume it
everyday? Ive heard the body adapts to it after a while and you don't receive
the benefits unless you discontinue its use regularly followed by consuming it
again. Do you think there is any truth to this? Or is it benefical to consume
cronically, without taking breaks away from it? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : I think it’s best to use it regularly. The caffeine and other
things are still working even when you have adapted so that the caffeine is
less stimulating.  
  
**Me** : If I may please ask you one final personal question. About how much
Fat do you consume per day? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : I think I average about 60 grams.  
  
**Me** : A lot of people seem to be under the impression that you think
starches are OK or even beneficial to eat, even when Fruit is available. Some
are saying that super cooked starch to the point of it being wet and somewhat
soggy, has beneficial effects that surpass sucrose. I was wondering if you
think that stuff is accurate or is starch harmful and not ideal when compared
to fruits and their sugars. Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : When a non-starchy fruit is available I think it’s always
preferable to starch. Alkali-processed corn is the only kind that I’m willing
to eat, and seldom that (e.g., corundas made with wood ashes).  
  
**Me** : I understand this is off topic from what you typically teach, but I
was wondering if you have run across any information, or learned on your own,
things that help people grieve over lost loved ones, and or fear of losing
others? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : It activates the “helplessness” reactions in the body, stress
weakening your own life, and I think it can help to get out of that if you
think of your life as a continuation of theirs—the same life, though with
fewer bodies.  
  
**Me** : Is the main reason you think sugar is better than saturated fat as a
fuel source because sugar increases CO2 more? Or are there other reasons? I
was wondering if it would be safe to get a decent amount of calories from
hydrogenated coconut oil as appose to pure sucrose. Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : I use hydrogenated coconut oil and sugar, and I think the
combination is good for most people; in situations such as heart failure, more
sugar would be preferable.  
  
**Me** : If I may ask, about how many milligrams of caffeine do you personally
get on average from coffee per day? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : At present about 500-600.  
  
**Me** : How many milligrams of caffeine per day do you think is best to get
the optimal benefits from it? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : Statistically, people who drink 5 or more cups per day are the
healthiest, but in many places it’s common for coffee to have only about 100
mg per cup.  
  
**Me** : Do you think the articles that are claiming dairy causes breast and
prostate cancer have any truth to them?  
**Ray Peat** : Most of the evidence suggests that it increases prostate cancer
but decreases other cancers, especially colon, and is protective in other
ways.  
**Me again** : If milk increases prostate cancer risk, why do you think its
safe to consume?  
**Ray Again** : If it decreases many other risks, it’s healthful.  
  
**Me** : Nutritional charts show milk containing no [ vitamin C
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) . I remeber you
said something along the lines of some animal foods containing dehydroascorbic
acid or some form of vitamin c not detected by their measuring methods. The
oranges and juice in my area all seem to be sour, which I think you said
oranges are supposed to taste sweet.  
Can I get enough vitamin C from a gallon of low fat cow milk? Or what other
safe foods contain enough vitamin C? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : A gallon provides enough vitamin C. The vitamin C in meat is
usually also much higher than the charts say. At a time when my diet was
mostly milk, meat, eggs, cheese, oatmeal, and bread, I decided to check the
amount of vitamin C in my urine, and over the period that I checked it, it was
steadily more than 2000 mg per day.  
  
**Me** : There seems to be a decent amount of information on the benefits of
nicotine ( not cigarettes, but nicotine itself or just tabacco ) Seems to be
anti-estrogenic, and pro-androgen. I haven't heard you mention it before and
was wondering if you think pure nicotine or tabacco could be a beneficial
substance? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : I think one of its good effects is stimulating the intestine,
both secretions and motion. When its use is started in middle age, it’s less
addictive  
  
**Me** : If a person started seriously lowering PUFA intake when they are in
their early twenties, and ate under 1 gram per day indefinitely, do you have
any thoughts on the potential increase in lifespan that could produce?  
**Ray Peat** : There are many well documented instances of very long lived
people whose diets were probably low in PUFA, often based on milk, for example
Old Thomas Parr:  
“He existed and even thrived on a diet of “subrancid cheese and milk in every
form, coarse and hard bread and small drink, generally sour whey”, as [
William Harvey ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey) wrote. … "On
this sorry fare, but living in his home, free from care, did this poor man
attain to such length of days".  
Parr purportedly had an affair when he was over 100 years old and fathered a
child born out of wedlock. After the death of his first wife, he married his
child's mother at the alleged age of 122. [ [3]
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Tom_Parr#cite_note-3) ” Pine, L. G. (July
1965). "Thomas Parr – the most long-lived Englishman". _Shropshire Magazine_ .
Famous Shropshire sons – no. 5. **17** (5): 26–7.  
About 20 years ago, a Florida newspaper interviewed a man whose records showed
an age of 135, who said his diet was mainly the oranges he ate while picking
them; that had been his occupation for most of his life.  
  
**Me** : You have repeatedly mentioned PUFA accumulates with aging. My
question is, if someone in their 20's started eating a diet with less than 2
grams of PUFA per day, and maintained that low PUFA intake permanently into
old age, would PUFA still accumulate with age? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : I think some would still accumulate in the fat tissues, unless
total fat intake was low, and PUFA intake was half a gram or less.  
  
**Me** : If I may ask a quick question. In your opinion, what specifically,
are the most anti-inflammatory substances a person could use or take? Thank
you!  
**Ray Peat** : Some of the most potent are also destructive to all tissues.
The safest are sugar, [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-
usp-grade-aspirin/) , [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) , [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) , [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) , thyroid hormone, lidocaine, testosterone, and food sources of
magnesium and calcium.  
  
**Me** : When it comes to total intake from food, what do you think is the
upper safe limit on total tryptophan intake for an active male? Or is it more
about the balance between it and [ glycine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/glycine-powder-usp-grade/) ? Thank you!  
**Ray Peat** : I think it’s a matter of the balance with other nutrients,
keeping all the inflammatory things low, and the metabolic rate high. The
calcium of milk is protective.  
  
**Me** : I was reading an article where you allegedly said that you grew 1.5
inches from taking DHEA. If you actually said that, I was wondering how many
milligrams of DHEA you were taking per day? How long were you taking it before
you grew? And were you taking other hormones like pregnenolone etc at the time
that might have caused the growth itself or synergized with the DHEA? I very
much appreciate all your information that you share with the public, and your
time. Thank you very much!  
**Ray Peat** : A friend and her two kids were living with us, and everyone
marked their height on the door frame; I was about 40 at the time. About a
year before we moved out of the house, I was experimenting with DHEA; I had
previously been handling progesterone occasionally for several years. I
probably took 10 or 15 mg per day, and after a few days there was a sudden
change in a mole on my belly, and my horizontal, semi-impacted lower wisdom
teeth suddenly began erupting; over a period of a few weeks, they moved into a
fully erupted position. I was about 45 at that time. I noticed that my belt
was looser, and I had a visible waste, so I checked my weight, and found that
I hadn’t lost weight, though considerable fat had disappeared. We were moving
out of the house, and before we left we checked our height on the door frame.
My younger girl friend was about the same as before, I was considerably
taller.

**Me** : Do you think a low fat (about 30 grams per day ) diet is bad for skin
health and might contribute to its premature aging and wrinkling? Or is sugar
and protein sufficient for skin health? Thank you!  
**RP** : We can make fat from protein and carbohydrate; proteins, vitamins,
and minerals are the main things for skin health.  
  
**Me** : Since saturated fats cause low grade endotoxemia by transporting
endotoxin from the digestive system into the blood and other tissues creating
an inflammatory response ( cytokines, TLR4, etc ) and since we cant completely
rid ourselves of bacteria, wouldn't it be better to eat a very low fat high
carbohydrate diet so as to avoid chronic, repeated bouts of gut derived
endotoxin exposure? Thank you!  
**RP** : I have seen the “saturated fat increases endotoxin uptake” idea, but
they ignored the bacteriostatic action of the saturated fat, and also its
acceleration of the degradation process. I consider it to have been a typical
misleading propaganda piece.  
  
**Me** : There are studies with mice/rats that show prolonged bamboo shoot
consumption induce hypothyroidism as well as damage reproductive function.
Have you read any of these studies? Have you experienced any thyroid
suppression from prolonged bamboo shoot consumption?  
**RP** : Yes, like cabbage, cauliflower, mustard and radish it’s _possible_ to
eat enough to cause enlargement of the thyroid gland, especially when the
traditional diet favors a bitter, acidic variety of bamboo, but the blanched,
mild tasting variety that’s popular in the US and China doesn’t seem to cause
problems.  
  
**Me** : In many of your articles and interviews you mention the negatives of
the unsaturated fatty acids, and at other times specifically the
polyunsaturated fatty acids. My question is, when you are mentioning the
unsaturated fats, are you including monounsaturated ones like Oleic acid? Is
oleic acid harmful? Or whenever you say unsaturated fats are you just
specifically talking about the PUFA's?  
**RP** : Yes, I mean the PUFA, oleic acid is safe, and we synthesize it
ourselves from carbohydrates. Thank you!  
  
**Me** : Do you think 18 cups of cows milk supplies enough folic acid ( folate
)?  
Orange juice doesnt seem to sit well with me currently and I was curious if
milk supplies enough b vitamins by itself. Thank you!  
**RP** : I think so, because of its high bioavailability in milk.  
Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2014 Apr;36(214):287-90.  
[Dairy products as source of folates].  
[Article in Polish]  
Kowalska M, Cichosz G.  
Abstract  
Dairy products, especially yoghurts and blue cheeses, are underestimated
source of folates in human diet. Though foliates content in dairy products is
lower than in vegetables and cereals, nevertheless their bioavailability and
stability is much better. High folate stability results from presence of
hydro- and lipophylic antioxidants efficiently protecting folates and other
bioactive compounds against oxidation processes on synergic way. On the other
hand, high bioavailability is a consequence of folic appearing in milk mainly
in form of mono glutamates and also of a presence of a protein ready to bind
folates (FBP--folic binding protein). FBP makes easier folates transport
through cell membranes. Moreover, present in milk sphingolipids and
cholesterol stimulate activity of FBP. Mould cheeses and milk fermented
beverages contain the highest amount of folates. However, cottage cheese
contain considerable amount of folic binding protein. Regular consumption of
milk fermented beverages and eating them together with vegetables and fruits
rich in folates is a chance to increase covering of folic demand.  
  
**Me** : Since I was young and still today ( 25 yrs old and male ) I remember
my knees always pop when I squat down. During my first walk to the rest room
in the morning my knees will pop quite loudly just by walking, but wont the
rest of the day ( except when I have to squat down ). Also sometimes when I
squat down and my knees dont pop, it will hurt a little until I can get them
to pop. My wrists always crack/pop when I move my hand in a circular motion,
or flex from one way to the other. I was wondering if these popping joints
indicate something is wrong? If you have any thoughts I would appreciate it!
Thank you!  
**RP** : Sometimes slightly low thyroid function can cause the cartilage in
joints to swell, and sometimes to accumulate fluid. Slight nutritional
deficiencies can contribute to it. Having some seafood once a week often
helps, and having enough protein (80 to 100 grams) and calcium (about 1500 mg)
is important.  
  
**Me** : I've been reading that cilantro is good for chelating heavy metals,
specifically Iron. I was wondering if you think cilantro is a safe food to use
as an effective way to remove iron from the body? Donating blood is time very
time consuming where I live so it hasn't been an option. Thanks!  
**RP** : I think the amount that would make a difference with heavy metals
might be allergenic. Having coffee, milk, and orange juice as regular parts of
your diet help to move iron out safely.  
  
**Me** : I've often wondered if hypothyroidism is the main underlying cause of
male pattern baldness, and women tend to be more hypothyroid than men, why is
hair loss more prevalent in males? Do you have any thoughts? Thanks!  
**RP** : [ Progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-
micronized-powder-usp/) is highly protective for the skin and follicles,
preventing the formation of harmful prostaglandins, for example.  
  
**Me** : Do you think flowers of sulphur is safe for ingestion for the purpose
of killing fungus, bacteria and or parasites? If so, do you know of a good
amount for those purposes? Thanks!  
**RP** : I found that a pinch, about 200 mg, daily for 3 or 4 days was
effective for changing my intestinal flora; the effect lasted a few months.
After using it occasionally for many years, I became sensitized to it, and it
produced intestinal irritation.  
  
**Me** : Raw Garlic has very potent antibacterial properties. Do you think its
safe to add as a topping on the carrot salad? Thanks!!  
**RP** : It’s good for flavor in small amounts, but in a high concentration
it’s toxic to both human and bacterial cells.  
  
**Me** : There seems to be some evidence that caloric restriction is
beneficial. I haven't heard you mention anything about it. I was wondering if
you think mild calorie restriction is optimal for health? Or beneficial? Or is
just eating low pufa what you consider to be optimal, regardless of calorie
intake? Thanks!  
**RP** : I’ve occasionally mentioned that the typical calorie restricted diet
increases the metabolic rate and decreases oxidative damage by reducing PUFA,
cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and iron, possibly some random toxins. In
one of the big nurses studies, someone noticed that those who ate the most
lived the longest, i.e., had the highest metabolic rate.  
  
**Me** : I haven't experienced this but I was wondering if you know what
causes kidney stones? A lot of doctors say it's from eating too much animal
protein and calcium. Do you think drinking a gallon of milk everyday
chronically would give someone kidney stones? Thank you!  
**RP** : High phosphate and low vitamin D are probably the main things. Meat,
beans, nuts, and grains have a very high ratio of phosphate to calcium. I
think milk is protective, with its good ratio of calcium to phosphate.  
  
**Me** : I read that you mentioned it might be best not to get too many
calories from saturated fat because it causes cause the body to switch to
using fat as it's main source of energy as appose to sugar. Do you still feel
the same about that? If so how much would it take to interfere with using
sugar?  
Also I was listening to one of your interviews and someone asked about things
that improve brain function. You mention fighter pilots mental function being
best on a high fat diet. If the brain uses glucose as it's main source of
energy, why do you think their mental abilities were best with more fat? Thank
you very much for your time!  
**RP** : I think it depends on the level of activity and energy use. Milk fat
has protective, stabilizing effects, and having it available for muscle
metabolism spares glucose for the brain.

Dairy milk fat augments paclitaxel therapy to suppress tumour metastasis in

Milk fat is a natural product containing essential nutrients as well as fatty  
acids and other food factors with reported anti-cancer potential. Here bovine
milk fat was tested for its ability to inhibit the growth of breast and colon
cancers and their metastasis to the lung and liver; either alone or in  
combination with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. A diet containing 5%
typical anhydrous milk fat (representing ~70% of the total dietary fat
component) fed to Balb/c mice delayed the appearance of subcutaneous 4T1
breast and CT26 colon cancer tumours and inhibited their metastasis to the
lung and liver, when compared to the control diet containing soybean oil as
the only fat component. It augmented the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on
tumour growth and metastasis, and reduced the microvessel density of tumours.
It displayed no apparent organ toxicity, but instead was beneficial for well-
being of tumour-bearing mice by maintaining gastrocnemius muscle and
epididymal adipose tissue that were otherwise depleted by cachexia. The milk
fat diet ameliorated gut damage caused  
by paclitaxel in non-tumour-bearing mice, as evidenced by retention of jejunal
morphology, villi length and intestinal γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity,
and inhibition of crypt apoptosis. It prevented loss of red and white blood
cells due to both cancer-mediated immunosuppression and the cytotoxic effects
of chemotherapy. The present study warrants the use of milk fat as an adjuvant
to inhibit tumour metastasis during cancer chemotherapy, and to spare patients
from  
the debilitating side-effects of cytotoxic drugs.  
  
I will post more later. Some of these have several studies with them, but
thats an awful lot of work to make look ok while using a phone. If someone
wants, pm me and I will send you the email if it has studies with it.

**Me** : I don't really crave fat, but realise it's importance for various
things. I was wondering if I were to be eating low fat milk, an egg, and an
abundance of sugar from fruit, table sugar, and Pepsi, could the fat produced
from the excess sugar replace fat I would have consumed in the form of
hydrogenated coconut oil, butter, etc ? Or is it still best to consume
adequate dietary fat? Thank you!  
**RP** : The excess sugar helps to keep tissue fats saturated, resisting
oxidation-inflammation, but if the thyroid is a little low, so that digestion
slows down, bacteria have a better chance to thrive when fat in the food is
lower. If a little fat is taken with some fiber, for example olive oil with
carrot salad, or butter on cooked mushrooms, the antiseptic effect is spread
along the intestine.  
  
**Me** : For someone going to take tetracycline for the first time, if I could
ask, what's a good starting dose ( how many milligrams per day ) and how many
days should one take it? And finally how often throughout the year would it be
optimal to do it again? Thank you very much!  
**RP** : It depends on whether it’s for eliminating small intestine bacteria
that cause symptoms, or for treating cancer, etc. I have started with 100 mg
twice a day and had immediate results, but for intense acute symptoms I would
use twice as much.  
  
**Me** : Is keeping vitamin D at about 50ng/ml optimal? Do you think topical
supplementation of vitamin D is best? Thank you!  
**RP** : Individuals vary in the amount of each that they need. During
northern winters, most people benefit from a supplement of vitamin D. Because
of manufacturing impurities, any supplement can be irritating to the digestive
system, but usually taking it with food is o.k. When an oral supplement causes
problems, the oily vitamins can be used on the skin, but the amount absorbed
is usually much less. I think a blood level of 50 to 55 ng/ml is optimal. I
have noticed that I tan easily rather than burning when I have supplemented
vitamin D.  
  
**Me** : Because a deficiency in light usually causes a [ Progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) deficiency
in women, would light be necessary to prevent a testosterone deficiency in
men? If so would the 130 volt 250 watt [ infrared
](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/light-therapy/) heat lamps be
good for testosterone production? Thank you very much!  
**RP** : If it looks bright where you spend most of your time. Stimulation of
the eyes is important for hormone activation.  
  
**Me** : In the case of high reverse T3 would t3 alone, or maybe with a small
amount of t4 at night be sufficient to correct that? Or are there better
approaches in lowering RT3? Thank you!  
**RP** : T3 can help, but the basic cause seems to be high cortisol and
adrenalin, probably other stress hormones. Keeping vitamin D in the normal
range, avoiding unsaturated fats, and having some sugar such as orange juice
frequently can help.  
  
**Me** : I've recently done a mold test in the basement where I live. It turns
out there is a decent amount of Cladosporium and a small amount of Ulocladium
in the air. Do you think this poses a health concern? Thank you!  
**RP** : Basements are usually moldy; if a person lives in a basement, an air
filter would be important. They can be allergenic, but their toxicity has been
exaggerated.  
  
**Me** : Do you think low intensity walking could safely help burn up PUFA
stored in the body? Thank you!  
**RP** : Yes, it’s a safe way to do it.  
  
**Me** : For someone who has eaten a high PUFA diet for about 20 years ( and
probably way too much iron ) but now for the past 2 years consumes 3 grams or
less of PUFA a day about how much vitamin E do you think is optimal? Thank
you!  
**RP** : It’s important to use the natural form of vitamin E, either mixed
tocopherals or d-alpha tocopherol; because of changed methods of extracting
vitamin E, I think it’s generally best not to use over 50 i.u. per day, until
there’s more research using the new products.  
  
**Me** : Do you think caffeine is safe for people with a very poor ability to
store sugar? Or would thyroid be more appropriate until the ability to store
sugar is fixed? Thank you!  
**RP** : Although thyroid is the essential basic thing, I have known people
who were able to stabilize their blood sugar quickly by using a small amount
of coffee (with cream) with meals.

A. After draining them thoroughly, I think once or twice a month is good.  
  
Q. What would you say the limiting factor of stopping someone eating them much

Q: We've been researching microwave radiation and its effects on health and
while we could find lots of evidence for negative effects, we were surprised
to see that brain cancer rates in the US have essentially been stable since
the introduction of mobile phones. It's also one of the main arguments of
people who'd like to see mobile phones proven safe. Do you have any thoughts
on this? I think you've even mentioned cancer rates statistics not being too
reliable and wonder if this could be the case with brain cancer as well.  
**RP: There are many ways they make evidence seem to disappear, but the animal
evidence is clear. The apologists for carcinogens say animals are different,
but animal research has been the basic evidence for much of medical practice.
Exposure to electromagnetic energy other than from telephones has been
increasing steadily.**  
  
Q: Thanks, that's very interesting! I was also wondering about a new study on
mice: [
https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/about_ntp/trpanel/2018/march/tr596peerdraft.pdf
](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/about_ntp/trpanel/2018/march/tr596peerdraft.pdf)
Can these results be dismissed as not very important just because of
comparison with historical rates, or is this just another tactic to cover up
evidence?  
**RP: It’s good to keep the historical information in mind, looking for what
accounts for the difference—food changes can be responsible for different
sensitivities as well as basal rates.**  
  
Q: I'd say one important difference with these mice was that they were all
housed inside a metal chamber, which removed most sources of outside
radiation. I think this could explain lower incidence of cancer in both
groups. However, I still don't see how this invalidates the evidence that
exposed mice had more lymphoma and other tumors mentioned below. Based just on
this, the media are now reporting that there essentially was no difference
between unexposed and exposed mice. Am I missing something?  
**RP: There is no evidence that nuclear war would end the human species, but
the precautionary principle is that we should make intelligent judgments about
important issues. People like the Koch brothers have organized campaigns
against the precautionary principle, and corporations (for example, asbestos,
cigarettes, estrogen) and the military (atmospheric bomb tests) have always
insisted on perfectly clear evidence of causality before accepting
restrictions. The media—medical journals, television, etc.—are in the business
of supporting business.[ Science’s War on Medicine
](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/sciences-war-on-medicine/) **  
  
Q: What do you think about books such as Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now,
promoted by Bill Gates?  
**RP: Pinker is possibly the worst of the ruling class apologists. Bill Gates
might just be a little stupid, but this guy seems to be consciously evil.**  
  
Q: What do you think about the native people of Americas dying in droves upon
contact with Europeans? The common explanation is that they caught various
European diseases that they were not used to, but there is not much logic in
that if disease is primarily of environmental origin. I even found an article
claiming that the natives had horrible health and lived only to 25 years of
age, but that just makes it even more illogical because then, according to
their reasoning, Europeans should be catching natives’ diseases and not vice
versa!  
**RP: A friend of mine did a study of the Matlatzincas of the Toluca area, who
had a reputation for unusual strength and vigor, and who had a very mixed
diet. They were put to work by the Spanish, and converted to a bean and
tortilla diet, and faded away. I think the story of dying from European
infections is just to avoid thinking of the extent of the genocides.**  
  
Q: In a few countries, including mine, brain cancer and other cancer rates
have been rising. In US and UK however, statistics are different, they even
show reduction for some cancers! We're thinking that this data was somehow
changed to fit their purpose. It's unlikely that in some countries the rise in
cancers is so profound while in others things are getting better.  
**RP: In 1994, Donna Shalala, US Secretary of Health and HS, declared victory
in the war on cancer. I pointed out that she was using absolutely fraudulent
statistics, and observed that, with the aging of the baby boomers, who were
just arriving at the age of high cancer incidence, by the year 2000 her phony
calculations would no longer work in the war on cancer, and that some
radically new method would be needed to hide the facts about the cancer trend.
At the beginning of the new century, the US Bureau of Statistics changed its
reporting practice, no longer publishing the annual raw death numbers, but
only age standardized numbers, without publishing their reference year. Some
agencies are now age standardizing mortality figures based on a reference year
of 2030, i.e., fantasy.**

Q: My friend who used to have high serum iron and transferrin saturation but
managed to lower them with a vegetarian diet, still has elevated bilirubin. He
used to have ALT and AST elevated too, but we brought these down with vitamins
D, B and K. What do you think could be the reason that his bilirubin is still
elevated? He notices that he sometimes gets diarrhea if he eats lots of cream,
so perhaps it could have something to do with the gallbladder, but we're not
sure. Do you think there is anything to "Gilbert's syndrome" (what his doctors
mentioned)?  
**RP: I think Gilbert’s syndrome is just one of the many patterns that can
develop with hypothyroidism. Liver enzymes usually rise in hypothyroidism
before the “muscle enzymes,” but all cells tend to leak out some of their
contents when their energy level is low.**  
  
Q: I've been researching melatonin and came across a lot of conflicting
information. I saw some of your older critiques (lowering thyroid, shrinking
thymus) and more recent praises for melatonin (opposing serotonin), so I'm
wondering, what is your current position on it? Is it safe to supplement if it
helps the person sleep better? Also intriguing are the many studies showing
that non-ionizing radiation blocks production of melatonin. I wonder if that
is a good or bad sign?  
**RP: It’s produced during the stress of darkness, by adrenergic nervous
stimulation, and I think one of its functions is to neutralize serotonin,
which could be an important antistress function. An amount much smaller than a
milligram can bring on sleep, but I doubt the safety of larger amounts. Here
are some articles about its involvement in inflammation:

The pineal hormone melatonin (MLT) exerts a variety of effects on the immune  
system. MLT activates immune cells and enhances inflammatory cytokine and
nitric  
oxide production. Cytokines are strongly involved in the synovial immune and  
inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and reach the peak of  
concentration in the early morning, when MLT serum level is higher. Nocturnal
MLT  
serum levels were evaluated in 10 RA patients and in 6 healthy controls. Blood  
samples were obtained at 8 and 12 p.m., as well as at 2, 4, 6, and 8 a.m. MLT  
serum levels at 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. were found to be higher in RA patients than
in  
controls (p < 0.05). In both RA patients and healthy subjects, MLT
progressively  
increased from 8 p.m. to the first hours of the morning, when the peak level
was  
reached (p < 0.02). However, MLT serum level reached the peak at least two
hours  
before in RA patients than in controls (p < 0.05). Subsequently, in RA
patients,  
MLT concentration showed a plateau level lasting two to three hours, an effect  
not observed in healthy controls. After 2 a.m., MLT levels decreased similarly
in  
both RA patients and healthy subjects. Several clinical symptoms of RA, such
as  
morning gelling, stiffness, and swelling, which are more evident in the early  
morning, might be related to the neuroimmunomodulatory effects exerted by MLT
on  
synovitis and might be explained by the imbalance between cortisol serum
levels  
(lower in RA patients) and MLT serum levels (higher in RA patients).

The pineal neurohormone melatonin is widely recognized as exerting important  
immunoenhancing effects that act on specific receptors in immunocompetent
cells.  
This action results in stimulation of cytokine production in lymphocytes and  
macrophages. Here we report that the nocturnal plasma concentration of
melatonin  
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is higher than in healthy controls.  
Furthermore, melatonin is present in the synovial fluid of RA patients and  
synovial macrophages express a specific binding site. We suggest that
melatonin  
may exert a disease-promoting role in RA.

BACKGROUND: Altered functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and  
altered melatonin production might modulate the circadian symptoms in patients  
with rheumatoid arthritis.  
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of different winter photoperiods on
the  
circadian rhythms of serum melatonin, cortisol, tumour necrosis factor alpha  
(TNFalpha), and interleukin 6 (IL6) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from
a  
north Europe country (Estonia) and a south Europe country (Italy).  
METHODS: The patients from Estonia (n = 19) and Italy (n = 7) had similar
disease  
severity and duration and were compared with healthy age and sex matched
controls  
in the two countries. Blood samples were collected during the period January
to  
February at 8 pm, 10 pm, midnight, 2 am, 4 am, 6 am, 8 am, and 3 pm. Melatonin  
was measured by radioimmunoassay using (125)I-melatonin. Serum cortisol,  
TNFalpha, and IL6 cytokines were assayed by standard methods.  
RESULTS: Higher circadian melatonin concentrations from 10 pm and an earlier
peak  
were observed in Estonian patients than in their age and sex matched controls  
(p<0.01). Starting from midnight, melatonin concentrations were significantly  
higher in the Estonian patients than in the Italian patients. No significant  
differences were observed for serum cortisol. Serum TNFalpha was higher
(p<0.05)  
in Estonian patients than in their controls and was correlated with the
melatonin  
levels.  
CONCLUSIONS: In a north European country (Estonia), the circadian rhythm of
serum  
concentrations of melatonin and TNFalpha in patients with rheumatoid arthritis  
were significantly higher than in matched controls or in rheumatoid patients
from  
a south Europe country (Italy).

The clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) show a circadian variation;  
joint stiffness and pain are more prominent in the early morning. An altered  
functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol) and of the  
pineal gland (melatonin) seems to be important factors in the perpetuation and  
clinical circadian symptoms of RA. Consistently, human proinflammatory
cytokine  
production exhibits a diurnal rhythmicity with peak levels during the night
and  
early morning, at a time when plasma cortisol (anti-inflammatory) is lowest
and  
melatonin (proinflammatory) is highest. Sex hormones also seem to be involved
in  
circadian rhythms of RA symptoms. Increased pain intensity and sleep
disturbances  
are observed during the luteal phase in patients who have RA, when estrogen
(and  
[ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) ) levels would be higher than in the follicular phase. The occurrence  
of circadian rhythms of the inflammatory reaction suggest important
implications  
for scheduling activities of daily living, for measurements in clinical
trials,  
and possibly for the time at which antirheumatic drugs--including
corticosteroids  
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs--are administered.

The pineal neurohormone melatonin (MLT) has been widely shown to exert an  
immunostimulatory and antiapoptotic role, mainly by acting on Th cells and on
T  
and B cell precursors, respectively. Thus, MLT might favor or promote
autoimmune  
diseases by acting directly on immature and mature immunocompetent cells. In  
fact, preclinical and clinical evidence point to a disease-promoting role of
MLT  
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MLT, whose concentration is increased in serum
from  
RA patients, may act systemically or locally in the inflamed joints. The  
circadian secretion of MLT with a peak level during the night hours might be  
strictly correlated with the peculiar daily rhythmicity of the RA symptoms. In  
rat studies employing Freund's complete mycobacterial adjuvant (FCA) as a
model  
of rheumatoid arthritis, pinealectomized rats turned arthritic and exhibited a  
significantly less pronounced inflammatory response, which was restored to
normal  
by a low MLT dose and was aggravated by a pharmacological MLT dose, that  
augmented the inflammatory and immune response. Continued investigation will  
refine our understanding of these observations, which will possibly translate  
into improved therapeutic approaches.

The circadian changes in the metabolism or nocturnal secretion of endogenous  
corticosteroids (reduction) observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are  
responsible, in part, for the time-dependent changes that are observed in the  
inflammatory response and related early morning clinical symptoms of the
disease.  
Melatonin (MLT), another circadian nocturnal hormone that is the secretory  
product of the pineal gland, has been implicated in the time-dependent RA  
inflammatory reaction with effects that are opposite to those of
corticosteroids.  
As a consequence, altered functioning of the HPA axis (early morning reduced  
corticosteroid production) and of the pineal gland (night increased MLT  
production) found in RA patients, seem to be important factors in the
appearance  
and perpetuation of the clinical circadian symptoms of the disease.
Consistently,  
human proinflammatory Th1-type cytokine production (related to MLT
stimulation)  
exhibits a diurnal rhythmicity with peak levels during the night and early  
morning, at a time when plasma cortisol (inducing the Th2-type cytokine  
production) is lowest and MLT is highest. Reduced daily light exposure as  
observed in northern Europe (Estonia), at least during the winter, might
explain  
the higher and more prolonged serum MLT concentrations that were observed in  
northern RA patients, as well as some epidemiological features versus southern  
Europe patients.

It is well known that some clinical signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis  
(RA) vary within a day and between days; the morning stiffness that is
observed  
in patients who have RA has become one of the diagnostic criteria of the
disease.  
The circadian changes in the metabolism or nocturnal secretion of endogenous  
corticosteroids is certainly responsible, in part, for the time-dependent
changes  
that are observed in the inflammatory response and related clinical symptoms.  
More recently, melatonin (mLT), another circadian nocturnal hormone that is
the  
secretory product of the pineal gland, has been implicated in time-dependent  
inflammatory reactions, with effects that are opposite of those of  
corticosteroids. Therefore, altered functioning of the  
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (reduced corticosteroid production)  
and of the pineal gland (increased mLT production) found in RA patients seem
to  
be important factors in the perpetuation and clinical circadian symptoms of
the  
disease. Consistently, human proinflammatory Th1-type cytokine production  
(related to mLT stimulation) exhibits a diurnal rhythmicity, with peak levels  
during the night and early morning, at a time when plasma cortisol (inducing  
Th2-type cytokine production) is lowest and mLT is highest. Reduced daily
light  
exposure as observed in northern Europe (Estonia), at least during the winter,  
might explain the higher and more prolonged mLT concentrations as well as some  
epidemiological features that are observed in northern European patients with
RA  
versus southern European patients.

Melatonin influences interleukin-12 and nitric oxide production by primary  
cultures of rheumatoid synovial macrophages and THP-1 cells.  
Cutolo M(1), Villaggio B, Candido F, Valenti S, Giusti M, Felli L, Sulli A,  
Accardo S.  
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genova, Italy.  
Because some of the clinical symptoms related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  
synovitis, such as joint morning stiffness and gelling, might be related to
the  
effects exerted by the diurnal rhythmicity of the neurohormone melatonin (MLT)
on  
synovial immune cell activation, we decided to evaluate the influence of MLT
on  
the production of IL-12 and nitric oxide (NO) on primary cultures of RA
synovial  
macrophages. Synovial macrophages were also prestimulated with
lipopolysaccaride  
(LPS). Results were compared with those obtained on cultured human myeloid  
monocytic cells (THP-1). A significant increase in IL-12 (p = 0.01) was found
in  
media of MLT-stimulated synovial macrophages versus RMPI-treated synovial  
macrophage controls. Interestingly, a significant decrease of IL-12 (p <
0.0001)  
was observed in media of synovial macrophages previously activated with LPS
and  
then treated with MLT, when compared to synovial macrophages treated with LPS  
alone. A significant increase in NO levels (p = 0.01) was found in MLT-
stimulated  
synovial macrophages versus RMPI-treated synovial macrophage controls.  
Interestingly, a nonsignificant increase of NO levels was observed in media of  
synovial macrophages previously activated with LPS and then treated with MLT,  
when compared to cynovial macrophages treated with LPS alone. Finally, a  
significant increase in IL-12 (p = 0.03) and NO (p = 0.002) concentrations was  
observed in media of MLT-stimulated THP-1 cells versus RMPI-treated controls.
Our  
results therefore show that MLT induces IL-12 secretion and NO production by  
unstimulated cultured RA synovial macrophages and human monocytic myeloid
THP-1  
cells. The unexpected and opposite effects on IL-12 and NO production in RA  
synovial macrophages treated with LPS may be related to dose-dependent
mechanisms  
exerted by MLT or to altered cell priming in RA macrophages; these are matters
of  
our further research. This study strongly supports the role of MLT in immune  
response modulation and in particular suggests a close relationship between  
diurnal rhythmicity of neuroendocrine pathways, cytokine and reactive oxygen  
intermediate production by monocyte/macrophages, and synovial arthritis  
symptomatology, at least in RA. **

**Me:** Do you think a clean [ creatine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/creatine-monohydrate-creapure/) supplement
is safe and or beneficial? Thank you!  
**RP** : Sometimes it has been used therapeutically, but I think manufactured
supplements are always risky, partly because of manufacturing impurities.  
Br J Cancer. 2015 Mar 31;112(7):1247-50.  
Muscle-building supplement use and increased risk of testicular germ cell
cancer in men from Connecticut and Massachusetts.  
Li N1, Hauser R2, Holford T3, Zhu Y3, Zhang Y3, Bassig BA3, Honig S4, Chen C5,
Boyle P6, Dai M7, Schwartz SM5, Morey P2, Sayward H3, Hu Z8, Shen H8, Gomery
P9, Zheng T3.  
BACKGROUND:  
No analytic epidemiological study has examined the relationship between use of
muscle-building supplements (MBSs) and testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC)
risk.  
METHODS:  
We conducted a population-based case-control study including 356 TGCC cases
and 513 controls from Connecticut and Massachusetts.  
RESULTS:  
The odds ratio (OR) for ever use of MBSs in relation to risk of TGCC was
significantly elevated (OR=1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-2.46). The
associations were significantly stronger among early users, men with more
types of MBSs used, and longer periods of use.  
CONCLUSIONS:  
MBS use is a potentially modifiable risk factor that may be associated with
TGCC.  
  
Me: I dont seem to do well with fruit/juices anymore. What is your opinion of
a milk diet? Basically 2500 - 3000 calories 1% milk, coffee daily, and weekly
liver.  
Can that type of diet be healthy long term do you think? Or would that be too
much protein, and not enough sugar? Thank you very much!  
**RP** : It would be a pretty healthful diet, but I’m not sure what effect the
low sodium to potassium ratio would have; I would want to include some salty
cheese.  
  
Me: In regards to our last conversation about the hydrogenated coconut oil and
the Raney catalyst do you think hydrogenated, solvent extracted, coconut oil
is safe? And aluminum and or hexane aren't a worry?  
Thank you again!  
**RP** : In animal tests of oils in chronic feeding, hydrogenated coconut oil
was the least carcinogenic. Chronic exposure to nickel is considered to be
carcinogenic. I think the main value of coconut oil is that it can displace
polyunsatured oils in the diet. We can synthesize our own protective saturated
fats from glucose. I notice that the vegetable oil aisle in supermarkets has
been shrinking over the last 10 or 15 years, and the soy/canola/corn oil
people seem to be stepping up their marketing efforts.  
  
Me: I understand that the body can make fats from carbohydrates and proteins,
especially when fat intake is 10% or less of calorie intake.  
My question is, do humans make fats from carbohydrates and proteins during a
calorie deficit ( eating a low fat diet 10% or less from fat ) as well? Or
does that only happen when calories are at maintenance or surplus?  
I know humans aren't as good as certain other animals at making fats, but do
it well when carbohydrate consumption meets 500+ grams. Thanks!  
**RP:** Since a calorie deficit causes stress (inhibiting the oxidation of
glucose by increasing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase), it increases the use of
protein for energy, and it would probably increase the tendency for feedings
with a momentary excess of calories to produce fatty acids.

Increase of lipogenic enzyme mRNA levels in rat white adipose tissue after  
multiple cycles of starvation-refeeding. Karbowska J(1), Kochan Z,
Swierczynski J. (1)Department of Biochemistry, Medical University of Gdansk,
Gdansk, Poland.  
Recently, we have found that despite the significant reduction of body weight
after multiple starvation-refeeding cycles, white adipose tissue (WAT)
exhibits surprisingly high rates of lipogenesis and lipogenic enzyme
activities. The purpose of this study was to determine the response of WAT
lipogenic enzyme mRNAs of rats subjected to multiple cycles of 3 days fasting
and 3 days of refeeding. **Despite the body weight reduction, significant
increase of lipogenic enzymes** (ie, fatty acid synthase [FAS], acetyl-
coenzyme A [CoA] carboxylase [ACC], adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase
[ACL], NADP-linked malic enzyme [ME], and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
[G6PDH]) mRNAs in WAT was found after multiple cycles of starvation-refeeding
of rats on standard laboratory diet. These findings, together with the results
published recently, indicate that multiple cycles of starvation-refeeding
cause the increased lipogenesis in WAT by upregulation of the lipogenic
enzymes gene expression  
  
Me: Do you think adding celery to mushrooms ( cooking them together ) would be
a safe way to increase the anti estrogenic effect? Or maybe eating celery
seperatly, cooked or raw? Or does celery have unsafe or potentially harmful
substances that would make it's long-term consumption undesirable? Thank you!  
**RP:** Celery has some valuable flavonoids, but its allergenic proteins cause
problems for some people, so it’s good to be cautious.  
  
Me: Do you know if PUFA is the main cause of hypothyroidism? I was wondering
if eventually after depleting PUFA from my body will I still need to take
thyroid for the rest of my life? Or will I not need thyroid anymore? Thank
you!  
**RP:** I think it’s the main cause.  
  
Me: Do you think combining small pieces of cytomel and Novotiral to make 4mcg
of T3 and 12 mcg of T4 and then taken a few times per day would be an
effective treatment for low thyroid? Thanks!  
**RP:** Yes, but the T4 can be taken once a day, since it slowly accumulates
over many days and is slowly converted to T3.  
  
Me: Assuming one has adequate protein and K2 in their diet, and gradually
increased the dose of [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-
usp-grade-aspirin/) , in your opinion what is the upper limit of aspirin that
a human could take everyday indefinitely without it causing problems? Thanks!  
**RP:** I have known a few people who took 4 to 6 grams per day for several
years for arthritis or cancer, but I usually think of 1000 to 1500 mg per day
as a maximum safe dose, but it depends on things like age and thyroid
function; with low kidney function, even that much could accumulate to a toxic
level.  
  
Me: I've read several studies that show that Lauric Acid inhibits 5 alpha
reductase. Do you think men should limit there intake of it so as not to lower
DHT? Thanks!!  
**RP** : I think the body compensates when something is steadily in the diet.  
  
Me: I cannot find a good available [ thyroid supplement
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-desiccated-
thyroid-ndt/) and was wondering if consuming coffee ( caffeine ) would equally
replace a thyroid supplement? Thank you so much!  
**RP** : Coffee contains some nutrients, including magnesium and niacin, that
can help with some of the symptoms resulting from hypothyroidism, but it won’t
replace the thyroid hormone.  
  
Me: [ Caffeine-induced increases in the brain and plasma concentrations of
neuroactive steroids in the rat. - PubMed - NCBI
](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837842)  
This study seems to indicate that caffeine increases [ Pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) , and [
Progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) in the brain, and plasma in rats. Do you think the Pregnenolone and
Progesterone increase would happen in humans too? If so do you think the
hormones would have a systemic effect? Or just mostly the brain? I think the
Human top end effective dose for someone my weight would be about 1200mg of
caffeine, is there an upper limit at which caffeine starts to have bad
effects? Thank you very very much!  
**RP** : 6000 mg per day is the most that I’ve known someone to use safely,
but many people have problems with much smaller amounts—it’s important to
adjust it to individual needs, and to use it with food; cream in it reduces
the rate of absorption. The effects are systemic, and other hormones are
involved.

Q. I was wondering your opinion on antibiotic resistance? The mainstream ideas
being that frequent, short doses of antibiotics cause antibiotic resistance,
which seems common for news companies to report about every now and then. I've
heard you say you use antibiotics occasionally and rather low doses. Do you
not believe this use of antibiotics can cause antibiotic resistance?

invariably accumulates the resistant strains. Doctors and corporations,
knowingly misusing them for increased profit, are the culprits.

Hey Dr. Peat,  
I'm using russet potatoes and a centrifugal juicer, although I've used golden
potatoes before with the same results. After I juice them, there is still
starch in the juice as it settles to the bottom over an hour to create a very
thick sentiment. If I were to cook it immediately after juicing, I would
assume it would still have a significant amount of starch in it.  
Haidut, another member of the forum, claims to let his sit for 2-3hrs
following juicing to let all of the starch settle.  
Should the final cooked juice be free of any visible particles?

Hair picks up things from water and air, for example lead from gun smoke. If

to the amount that’s stored. Animal studies showed that chelation can increase

Q: I've almost completed my hemostasis course, and it seems to me that
standard textbooks really have no idea what occurs in clotting. Ive more or
less committed your article on clotting to memory. It seems to me that
complement and clotting factors are essentially the same thing, and i think
redox potentials, or electrostatic forces, seem to dominate the mechanism of
clotting. I was wondering if you had any more interesting sources for an
explanation of clotting than my textbook. The involvement of adp reminds me of
danger theory. Also, do you see a practical distinction between PT, aPTT, &c?  
  
Ray: I haven’t seen any use in those distinctions. Have you read any of Melvin
Knisely’s work, about 70 years ago, with blood sludging?  
I think the most important things to investigate are the effects of
metabolites on clotting and fibrolysis, for example hyperventilation, CO2,
lactate, aldosterone, sodium, angiotensin.

I was sent a big ol' collection of Peat's quotes on antibiotics. I tried to
track down where they came and link to any discussion of them, but it seems
like most of them are new. Since they're from various sources, it's probably
worth taking them with a larger grain of salt than usual.

Me: Is my introduction of milk causing my arthritis?  
  
Ray:  
  
Many years ago someone noticed an antigenic overlap of lactobacilli with joint
tissue, and suggested that it could explain the high incidence of rheumatoid
arthritis during women’s fertile years. Another person noticed an overlap of
thyroglobulin with joint tissue. Maybe the milk increased the growth of that
kind of bacteria. I think the already increased circulation in your thyroid
means that [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-

olive oil on your skin to make it easier to spread? Covering your whole leg
would increase the effect on your ankle. Is there enough sugar in your diet?
Have you tried breathing in a bag occasionally, to increase your CO2?

The role of components of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in pathogenesis
and  
serologic diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.

During recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an  
infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. The most discussed theory is  
molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of T- and  
B-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or  
viral antigen. Information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (PM) in the  
molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) is limited. Using  
proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs,
the  
**homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and  
thyroglobulin (Tg), which are potential B- and T-cell epitopes of these
antigens,  
and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. ** Moreover,
we  
have found components of cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum 791, Bifidobacterium  
adolescentis 94 BIM, Bifidobacterium longum B379M and Lactobacillus plantarum  
B-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to TPO (anti-TPO) and antibodies
to  
Tg (anti-Tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-TPO and  
anti-Tg in ELISA. Additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between
the  
probability of detecting antibodies (Abs) to the antigens of L. plantarum B-01  
and B. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-
TPO.  
On the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the
possible  
role of PM of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in triggering ATD
by  
the mechanism of molecular mimicry. The data obtained in silico and in vitro  
should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for
extrapolations  
to the whole body. Possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of  
bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-TPO and anti-Tg
should  
be taken into consideration. Natural human Abs to these bacterial components
are  
probably able to cross-react with the TPO and Tg in the ELISA for detection of  
anti-TPO and anti-Tg, which are serologic markers of ATD. It can lead to  
unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.

Isolation and structural identification of glycopolymers of Bifidobacterium

Bifidobacterium bifidum 791 (commercially available as B. bifidum BIM B-733D)  
cell-surface biopolymers (BPs) interact selectively with human serum thyroid  
peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) autoantibodies (anti TPO and anti Tg,  
respectively). BPanti-TPO and BPanti-Tg were isolated from the soluble
fraction  
of B. bifidum BIM B-733D by affinity chromatography with anti-TPO or anti-Tg,  
respectively. Homogeneity of affinity eluates (AEanti-TPO and AEanti-Tg) was  
tested by size exclusion chromatography. For each AE, the elution profiles  
generated on the basis of absorbance at 280 nm do not conform to ELISA data
for  
functional activity characteristic of BPs. Moreover, high functional activity
was  
detected in chromatographic fractions that had significantly different
molecular  
weights and no absorbance at 280 nm, which suggests a non-protein
(carbohydrate)  
nature of BPanti-TPO and BPanti-Tg. The semi-preparative size exclusion  
chromatography of AEanti-TPO and AEanti-Tg with detection by refractometer
gave  
5,000-7,000 Da fractions containing substances that interact selectively with  
either anti TPO (BPanti-TPO) or anti-Tg (BPanti-Tg) according to ELISA data.  
Analysis by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy including a 1H, 13C-heteronuclear  
single-quantum coherence experiment indicated that both substances are linear  
α-1,6-glucans. For the first time, an immunological similarity (molecular  
mimicry) of glycopolymers of B. bifidum BIM B-733D and human thyroid proteins,  
TPO and Tg, was shown. On the whole, our data point to a possible role of  
bifidobacteria in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD). The
main  
requirements for triggering/acceleration or prevention/abrogation of ATD by  
bifidobacteria through molecular mimicry mechanism are hypothesised to be (1)  
genetic predisposition to ATD and (2) intestinal epithelium penetration by  
α-1,6-glucan.

Molecular mimicry is an attractive mechanism for triggering autoimmunity. In
this  
review, we explore the potential role of evolutionary conserved bacterial  
proteins in the production of autoantibodies with focus on granulomatosis with  
polyangiitis (GPA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Seven autoantigens  
characterized in GPA and RA were BLASTed against a bacterial protein database.
Of  
the seven autoantigens, proteinase 3, type II [ collagen
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-beef-grass-fed/) ,
binding immunoglobulin  
protein, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, α-enolase, and heterogeneous nuclear  
ribonuclear protein have well-conserved bacterial orthologs. Importantly,
those  
bacterial orthologs are also found in human-associated bacteria. The wide  
distribution of the highly conserved stress proteins or enzymes among the
members  
of the normal flora and common infectious microorganisms raises a new question
on  
how cross-reactive autoantibodies are not produced during the immune response
to  
these bacteria in most healthy people. Understanding the mechanisms that
deselect  
auto-reactive B cell clones during the germinal center reaction to homologous  
foreign antigens may provide a novel strategy to treat autoimmune diseases.

Four Lactobacillus species, namely L. crispatus , L. iners, L. gasseri, and L.  
jensenii, commonly dominate the vaginal communities of most reproductive-age  
women. It is unclear why these particular species, and not others, are so  
prevalent. Historically, estrogen-induced glycogen production by the vaginal  
epithelium has been proffered as being key to supporting the proliferation of  
vaginal lactobacilli. However, the 'fly in the ointment' (that has been
largely  
ignored) is that the species of Lactobacillus commonly found in the human
vagina  
cannot directly metabolize glycogen. It would appear that this riddle has been  
solved as studies have demonstrated that vaginal lactobacilli can metabolize
the  
products of glycogen depolymerization by α-amylase, and fortunately, amylase  
activity is found in vaginal secretions. These amylases are presumed to be  
host-derived, but we suggest that other bacterial populations in vaginal  
communities could also be sources of amylase in addition to (or instead of)
the  
host. Here we briefly review what is known about human vaginal bacterial  
communities and discuss how glycogen-derived resources and resource
competition  
might shape the composition and structure of these communities.

Q: How can we know what other substances/organisms/bits of protein chain might
also cross react? How do such homologies arise? I really like your perspective
that the immune system isn't confused "attacking itself" and so on that view
how do you understand how there "just happen" to be these homologous amino
acid sequences between, say, my TPO proteins and some from a lactobacillus? If
this overlap is at the level of generality on which all organisms use proteins
made of amino acid sequences, then it's not interesting, but if it is more
specific-- which apparently it is-- then the match it seems quite random
unless there is some kind of complicated co-evolution happening?  
  
RP:  
There are lots of areas of similar amino acid sequences in proteins of
microorganisms and animals, that are important for shaping the protein and
making it fit into its normal place in the cell. Even slight “denaturation” of
a protein can expose those areas, so stress, changing normal relationships,
can make things antigenic. Someone found that an animal’s own cartilage,
normally not antigenic, became antigenic after the cartilage was twisted.
Energy depletion of a tissue makes it very susceptible to having its antigenic
regions exposed; hypothyroidism, and high estrogen, make tissues swell; our
“immune system” helps to correct the damage, removing things that are
seriously disrupted. [ Progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) and [
pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/)
have a stabilizing effect, supported by thyroid and CO2. When the damaged
tissues are restored, the antibodies will gradually disappear. Well cooked
mushrooms and bamboo shoots are probably more effective than carrots. Small
amounts of antibiotics, flowers of sulfur, and [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) , and
bacteriophage can help by reducing bacteria in the small intestine.

Me: I am convinced the varicocele is linked to the synthetic Testosterone
Enanthate injections and the metandienone and nolvadex pills. I cannot prove
it though.  
  
I want to restore the varicocele really bad. But I am really confused on the
dynamics of it. For example, is the vein itself damaged, that it can't keep
constricted? Or is it due to compression by a muscle that keeps it in this
bloated state? Or both? The vein is called the pampiniform plexus which is
connected the scrotal/gonadal/spermatic vein. I find it so dissapointing that
this phenomenon in young males is so understudied in the medical science.
Simply cutting the vein off is not convincing to me and seems very unlogical.

treat an enlarged colon due to undigested matter and the like still sitting in
there, or is this a theory that is quackery by naturopaths?

Me:  
Dear Dr. Peat,  
  
Thank you for your kindness in giving such great advice. In my research of the
subject however I have now become further confused after reading how in
certain studies varicoceles corresponded with Nutcracker Syndrome and left
renal vein hypertension, in one study with a 100% rate apparently. Some
researchers suggest that Nutcracker Syndrome is highly underdiagnosed.  
  
Here is one such study: [ Varicocele and nutcracker syndrome: sonographic
findings. - PubMed - NCBI ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20660448/)  
  
A citation from an analysis:  
  
Varicoceles almost always occur on the left side and affect up to 9.5% of men.
Considering the frequency of incompetency or absence of spermatic vein valves,
Zerhouni et al [ 25
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878259/#R25) contend that this
finding is irrelevant and that LRV hypertension is the usual cause of
varicoceles. The LRV was compressed in 50% to 100% of all patients with
varicocele, [ 8 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878259/#R8) ,
[ 60 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878259/#R60) although not
all patients with varicocele have a distended LRV. [ 10
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878259/#R10) , [ 37
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878259/#R37)  
  
Source:  
[ Nutcracker Phenomenon and Nutcracker Syndrome
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878259/#!po=13.4921)  
  
Now this condition seems quite terrifying, and seems to be the cause of
varicocele in quite some men possibly. What would your comments be on this
condition, perhaps on the causes, and what could possibly be done for it in
terms of reverting/treating it if this is even possible? What could be a
possible explanation of its development from a biological point of view?  
  
Addendum: I might add that **nutcracker syndrome** ( **NCS** ) results most
commonly from the compression of the left [ renal vein
](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_vein) between the [ abdominal aorta
](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aorta) (AA) and [ superior

Me: Thanks a bunch! This information is really invaluable. I have read before
that you recommended succinic acid to safely chelate heavy metals. What dose
would you consider as a proper dose, and how much should be taken a day?  
  
Also, I have found that malic acid is very useful for my brain fog and

as I was afraid that my product was synthetic, as in D-malic acid. What do you
think of malic acid, and is it advisable to stick to the natural L-malic acid

**_** Hi Ray,  
  
What are your thoughts on the safety of shining redlight in the eyes? There is
evidence it could help with eye health and I find it has nice systemic
effects.*  
Do you think it's risky to use small doses of t3 throughout the day without
any supplemental t4? How to avoid excess rt3?  
  
* 

Spoiler:  Reference

[ Low-level light therapy of the eye and brain
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436183/#!po=52.1622)  
  
"A recent study showed evidence that LLLT could be effective at preventing the
effects of phototoxicity, which has clinical relevance in the prevention of
age-related macular degeneration. The photoreceptor protective effects of LLLT
are also evident when damage is induced by phototoxicity. White light at 1800
lx for 3 hours causes significant damage to the outer nuclear layer of the
retina in pigmented rats. This structural damage is accompanied by an
attenuation of the b wave in the electroretinogram. LLLT reduced the extension
of damage in the outer nuclear layer and maintained the electroretinogram b
wave amplitude.73 LLLT has also been shown to prevent inflammation and
photoreceptor damage induced by phototoxicity. LLLT at 670 nm, 9 J/cm2, and 60
mW/cm2 was given for 5 days before and 5 days after phototoxicity with bright
light in albino rats. Retinal phototoxic damage features a 25%–75% thinning of
the outer nuclear layer, degeneration of photoreceptors, loss of the retinal
pigment epithelium, and microglial invasion. In this series of experiments,
LLLT given before the phototoxic damage was highly effective at preventing the
morphological alterations observed in the nontreated group. This study also
showed evidence that the retinoprotective effects of LLLT against
phototoxicity include reduction of microglial invasion, decrease of stress-
related molecules, and increase in neuroprotective molecules. The protective
effects of LLLT were also observed at the functional level as determined with
flash-evoked electroretinography. Remarkably, the protective effects of LLLT
were long-lasting and photoreceptor function was preserved as late as 1 month
after damage. Also, LLLT alone did not have a significant effect on
photoreceptor function and it did not affect the expression of stress-related
factors.74 However, LLLT has been shown to be associated with an increase
expression of RNA involved in neuroprotective roles. LLLT prevention of
photoreceptor cell death induced by phototoxicity have been associated with a
decrease in the expression of 126 of 175 genes upregulated by light damage.75
"

**  
_ ** Reverse T3 is made from T4, so small doses of T3 usually tend to
normalize rT3 if it’s high. Ordinary [ red light
](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/light-therapy/) has an
antiinflammatory effect, helps to neutralize the effects of too much u.v. and
blue light. If it’s too bright, it can overheat the eye internally.  
  
**_** Do you think the addition of keto groups to hormones can make them
negative and why? I remember that in the past you told me you wouldn't use
them.  
  
**_** Yes, I think large doses of any modified [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) could be
harmful to the brain.  
  
**_** Thanks for the answers, that helps.  
Is there something inherent to the addition of a keto group from a biochemical
standpoint that would make bio-identical keto varieties of any steroid
harmful? [...]  
Or did you see specific studies on keto progesterone which raised concerns?  

  
  
**_** It’s that progesterone has extensive functions that are essential for
survival in good health, and something which closely resembles its structure
is likely to interfere in those processes. It could take years for
irreversible and disastrous effects to be noticed.  
  

  
**_** Thanks.  
You mentioned big doses would cause that, any idea what may be dangerous
territory? So far I've only heard about 11 k progesterone and 6 k
progesterone.  
What about 11 k dht, would that be any different?  
  
**_** I think there’s too little information to judge the risks confidently; I
would want at least some good long term animal studies before I tried one of
them.

Q: "is organic popcorn a good fiber?"  
  
R: "If it’s popped in coconut oil with butter it’s a fairly safe food, but the
high starch content has its drawbacks."  
  
NB: Whole grain bread has a lower ratio of starch to fiber than popcorn.

Q:  
Hello.  
  
Male, 40 years old.  
  
I had hypothyroidism, low temperature, low energy and depression.  
  
I have tried T4 only, desiccated thyroid, and this don’t improve symptoms,
only make my TSH suppressed. I always have high prolactin on blood tests,
around 20, even when my TSH is below 1 and the T4 and T3 tests are high on
range.  
  
Can be the high prolactin the real cause of my poor thyroid function, so it
need to be addressed first than thyroid? Is the high prolactin making me
dopamine deficient, so this explain the depression and the low energy? I also
have always oily skin and hair, pimples on my scalp and hair loss, and anti-
dandruff shampoos don’t help whit it.  
  
I know that Cabergoline lowers prolactin very fast, but I don’t want to take
it long term, how can I maintain my prolactin suppressed after taking the
drug? Can B6 in the form of P5P helps?  
Thank you very much  
  
RP:  
Deficiency of vitamin D and calcium (relative to phosphate) tends to increase
prolactin.

25-hydroxyvitamin D Correlation with Prolactin Levels and Adenoma Size in
Female Patients with Newly Diagnosed Prolactin Secreting Adenoma.  
Aboelnaga MM, Abdullah N, El Shaer M.  
OBJECTIVE:  
The present research explored the relationship of vitamin D status with
prolactin levels and adenoma size in female patients with newly diagnosed
prolactinoma and determination of hypovitaminosis D prevalence among female
patients with prolactinoma.  
PATIENTS AND METHODS:  
We enrolled 67 female patients with newly diagnosed prolactinoma (41 with
micro adenoma and 26 with macro adenoma) in this case-control study at the
time of presentation. We selected 45 female subjects as a control group who
were matched according to age, weight, height, body mass index and waist
circumference. We investigated 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating form
of vitamin D.  
RESULTS:  
Prolactinoma patients had significantly lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in
comparison with control subjects. Also, macroadenoma patients showed
significantly lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as compared to microadenomoa
patients. By contrast, microadenoma patients had nonsignificant lower
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in comparison with control subjects. Furthermore,
we found prolactinoma patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D &gt;20.00 ng/ml
showing significant differences in the prolactin levels and adenoma size when
compared with those who had 25- hydroxyvitamin D <20.00 ng/ml. In regression
analysis, 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was a significant predictor of adenoma
size in patients diagnosed with prolactinoma.  
CONCLUSION:  
Female patients with prolactinoma have lower vitamin D levels and have higher
prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency among prolactinoma
patients when compared with normal subjects. Also vitamin D deficiency in
prolactinoma patients associated with larger adenoma size and higher prolactin
level. Finally, 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was a statistically significant
predictor of prolactinoma size but not prolactin levels.

Me:I have been searching good allergen-free fructose and have given up, All
are made from corn. Instead, I've decided on using instead agave syrup and
pear juice, as they have 80% and 70% fructose respectively. I was hoping to
run a few tests on myself first, and see how my glucose tolerance test would
look like with agave, pear juice, regular cane sugar, and white rice. Then,
I'd like to test the use on some friends who are diabetic, and see how they
respond. Would agave be a good replacement for pure fructose?  
  
Ray: A problem with apples and pears is their pectin content, which can
potentially cause bowel inflammtion. The high temperature necessary to
concentrate the agave fluid (called aguamiel before it’s fermented into
pulque) into a sort of molasses causes a Maillard reaction, producing toxins,
but I don’t think that product is sold in the US. The “agave nectar” that’s
sold in the US is made from the core of the plant, rather than the juice, so
it's a very artificial industrial product, and it’s risky in a variety of
ways, including allergens.  
  
Me: I've read some unverified sources on the internet that you recommend the
use of succinic acid for lead chelation. Is this true? If so, could you please
elaborate on how it works and how you see it being used?  
  
Ray: No, I don’t recommend it. It’s produced endogenously.  
  
Me: You had talked about excessive urination being a sign of poor health. What
are the causes of excessive urination? I personally experienced this when I
took a supplement long term and noticed I was urinating a lot, even at night.
I think it moved the body's acid-base balance towards the acidic side on the
blood/extracellular fluids. Are there other causes?  
  
Ray: Sleep should turn on the antidiuretic hormone, to keep up the blood
volume during the night, but it should fall immediately in the morning;
copious urination during the day is o.k. if your fluid intake is high.
Evaporation will account for liters per day if your metabolic rate is high, so
the urine output should be well below the fluid intake.  
Me: A doctor prescribed strontium for bone health for my mom. Is this needed?
I associate strontium with radioactivity. Could this be an offshoot of the
idea of hormetics pushed on the public?  
  
Ray: There’s nothing left in official medicine besides marketing; when a
market fad fails,* new ones will appear.  
  
Me: Is the liposomal method of delivery of nutrients good? I made my own
liposomal C from a formula obtained from the web. I had to use high-
phosphatidylcholine lecithin for it. When I took it, I couldn't sleep the
whole night as I felt hungry and low in blood sugar. I suspect it was the PUFA
that caused it. I stopped using liposomal after this experience. Is there a
good basis for me staying away from liposomal formulations?  
  
Ray: The liposomal formulations are entirely for marketing. Things like
insulin can be dissolved in oil, and the digestive process incorporates the
oil into chylomicrons, i.e., liposomes.  
  
Me: The vitamin E in supplements are usually sourced from either soy or from
wheat. Are there other sources of vitamin E from food? I can't find any good
information on food that are good sources of vitamin E. My impression is that
vitamin E can only be found in plants that have plenty of PUFAs. Once, you had
mentioned that coconut oil contains Vitamin E, but I can't find supporting
documents or articles saying so. If they were mentioned, it doesn't detail how
much vitamin E is in them. I suspect that the vitamin E is in the sterols
found in coconut, as part of the isoprenes available in plants. Am I right?  
  
Ray: It’s removed in the refining. I asked a coconut oil producer in Mexico
what he did with the diatomacous earth after it’s used in the refining, and he
said he sold it to a chemical company.

**ME:**  
For a 39 year old male do you think checking testosterone levels is of any use
as a marker for optimal health?  
  
I've never had a comprehensive list of lab work done that was actually useful
so far and I wanted to do my own "check up" to speak to complement the other
metrics I currently use (i.e- body temp, pulse, mood, sleep quality,
digestion, etc.)  
  
Here's what I'm considering:  
  
**\- Full Thyroid panel that includes rT3 (free and/or total?)  
\- Vitamin D levels  
\- Estradiol  
\- Testosterone levels (not sure which to make sure is being measured) **  
  
Signs and Symptoms:  
\- not fully rested in morning  
\- belly fat  
\- desire to be recluse more than usual  
\- focus and concentration can waver a bit.  
  
I eat pastured eggs, coconut oil, butter, liver, coffee, bone broth, low fat
cheese, white button mushrooms, milk, oj, etc. Adding oysters soon and getting
more magnesium via cooked greens.  
  
I focus far more on calcium being higher than phosphate now, low daily pufa,
adequate protein, low starches and they seem to make a difference.  
  
I take T3 (6-9 mcg,) occasional pregnenelone, [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) , progest-e
before (experimenting with 3 drops before bed the past few nights which seems
to help me sleep deeper without any anti-androgenic signs so far.)  
  
Thank you  
  
**RP:**  
I think the ratio of cortisol to [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) is
more useful than estrogen and testosterone by themselves.  
  
**ME:**  
Are there specific type of each test that are better to get?  
  
(i.e- DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone), Unconjugated, LC/MS/MS or DHEA, s
(Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate) Hormone)  
CORTISOL: (i.e- Total cortisol, from saliva, etc)  
  
The labs that I can order from seem to have an assortment of choices that make
it more confusing.  
  
Thank you  
  
**RP:**  
Serum cortisol, not saliva. I think the unconjugated DHEA, rather than DHEAS,
is better, if they have the normal range for it, but the DHEAS would be second
choice.  
  
_I'll update this once I get the tests done and report back to him for his
suggestions._

*Osteoporosis drug strontium ranelate (Protelos) no longer available after August 31   
May 2017  
The osteoporosis medication strontium ranelate (Protelos) will no longer be
available in the UK after August following a decision by its manufacturers
Servier to cease marketing and supply of the drug treatment.  
The decision, the manufacturers says, has been taken because of commercial
reasons based on the drug having limited uses and being prescribed to - and
used by - very few people.  
This decision follows safety concerns about the drug connected to
cardiovascular risks which have led to its limited use and a continuous
decrease in those being treated with it. Strontium ranelate will no longer be
available anywhere in the world from August 2017.  
Protelos was licensed for treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal
women and adult men at high risk of fracture.  
  
Sarah Leyland, Osteoporosis Nurse Consultant at the National Osteoporosis
Society, said anyone currently taking this treatment is advised to talk to
their GP.

[QUOTE="Dan Wich, post: 386792, member: 446"  
_On why he talks more about biology than politics:_ [/QUOTE]  
  
The question was actually more about what can be done in the face of learned
helplessness from e.g. capitalism, racism, neoliberalism, etc. my full
original question is below, and was a bit different than the biology /
politics divide:  
  
Q: I've been reading Frantz Fanon lately, the psychiatrist and revolutionary
socialist. He speaks at length about mental disorders that the colonized
experienced for the last ~400 years. He delves deeply into both the trauma
experienced by colonizers and the colonized, and I think that even if you live
in a western society like the US, you are still internally colonized by
capital, with all of the concomitant responses, physiological and otherwise.
Unless you're rich.  
  
I wanted to ask you - how do you deal with what can be I guess learned
helplessness via just, understanding our environment, the social forces
shaping it, and the at times, nihilistic outlooks?  
  
For instance, I think it's clear that [ mitochondria are at the center of the
organism's response to stress, in both acute and chronic cases
](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/48/E6614.full) . They modulate the
organism's response to stress as you've pointed out many times, but I think
it's important to emphasize the _perception of stress_ is also experienced,
internalized, and reacted to. This much is absolutely true, at least in rats.
What is this like over time?  
  
Is it possible for us to address these issues with nutritional, supplemental,
and chemical means alone, or do we need to organize ourselves, our minds, and
our actions in such a way ultimately that leads to better possibilities for
us? If our perception of our condition is dark, _and this perception and
experience is true_ , as Lenin said, what is to be done?

Sodium bicarbonate supplementation improves severe-intensity intermittent
exercise under moderate acute hypoxic conditions  
Sanjoy K. Deb, Lewis A. Gough, S. Andy Sparks, and Lars R. McNaughton  
Acute moderate hypoxic exposure can substantially impair exercise performance,
which occurs with a concurrent exacerbated rise in hydrogen cation (H+)
production. The purpose of this study was therefore, to alleviate this acidic
stress through sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) supplementation and determine the
corresponding effects on severe-intensity intermittent exercise performance.
Eleven recreationally active individuals participated in this randomised,
double-blind, crossover study performed under acute normobaric hypoxic
conditions (FiO2% = 14.5%). Pre-experimental trials involved the determination
of time to attain peak bicarbonate anion concentrations ([HCO3−]) following
NaHCO3 ingestion. The intermittent exercise tests involved repeated 60-s work
in their severe-intensity domain and 30-s recovery at 20 W to exhaustion.
Participants ingested either 0.3 g kg bm−1 of NaHCO3 or a matched placebo of
0.21 g kg bm−1 of sodium chloride prior to exercise. Exercise tolerance (+
110.9 ± 100.6 s; 95% CI 43.3–178 s; g = 1.0) and work performed in the severe-
intensity domain (+ 5.8 ± 6.6 kJ; 95% CI 1.3–9.9 kJ; g = 0.8) were enhanced
with NaHCO3supplementation. Furthermore, a larger post-exercise blood lactate
concentration was reported in the experimental group (+ 4 ± 2.4 mmol l−1; 95%
CI 2.2–5.9; g = 1.8), while blood [HCO3−] and pH remained elevated in the
NaHCO3 condition throughout experimentation. In conclusion, this study
reported a positive effect of NaHCO3 under acute moderate hypoxic conditions
during intermittent exercise and therefore, may offer an ergogenic strategy to
mitigate hypoxic induced declines in exercise performance.

**ME:**  
Does the same rule apply for a female toddler in regards to it being harder
for T4 to convert to T3 via liver due to more estrogen than a toddler boy?  
  
Our daughter takes T3/T4 (equal to 1/16th of cynoplus per day) and we're
wondering if the T3/T4 should be more of a night usage due to T4's effect on
TSH at night and possibly T3 only during the day.  
  
We estimate based on the 1/16th of cynoplus, around 1 mcg of a cytomel would
equate to what she was getting from the cynoplus (during the day.)  
  
Is our thinking correct based on your experience?  
  
p.s- Since starting her thyroid therapy, she stood for the first time in about
week into the therapy and walked solo for the first time after 44 days (12
steps.)  
  
**PEAT:**  
I don’t know that there’s a gender difference at that age; the T3 component in
the combination is likely to improve her liver function so that the T4 is
effective. Recently someone told me that their non-walking kid had her first
bowl of ice cream and almost immediately started walking.

This is what Ray had to say about breastfeeding mothers getting vaccines.  
  
Ray:  
Substances in a vaccine are able to trigger a reaction in a nursing baby who
is allergic to that substance. Any immune reaction affects the mother’s
physiology, and vaccination can affect the quality and quantity of the milk.
Commercial dairies are interested in this because it can affect their profits,
but the medical business prefers not to investigate the subject, because it
could affect their profits.

Effect on milk production of vaccination with a bovine herpesvirus 1 gene-
deleted vaccine  
J. C. Bosch, DVM, K. Frankena, MScAg, PhD and J. T. van Oirschot, DVM, PhD  
A field trial was conducted to determine the effect of vaccination with an
inactivated bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) gE-negative marker vaccine on the milk
production of dairy cows. The daily milk yield of 455 cows in six herds was
measured electronically from six days before vaccination until 14 days after
vaccination. The treatment consisted of two injections with either vaccine or
placebo, both at an interval of four weeks. There was a small, but significant
(P&#60;0.05), decrease of about 1.4 litres per cow in milk production after a
double vaccination, the negative effect being slightly greater after the
second vaccination.

Several veterinarians and dairy producers elect to vaccinate dairy herds with  
killed combination products in the fall or spring. Postvaccinal milk drop has  
been reported following the use of some killed vaccines, making it important
to  
identify vaccines that can cause milk drop and evaluate the magnitude of  
postvaccinal milk drop. This study compared the pre- and postvaccinal milk  
production levels of dairy cows vaccinated with two commercial vaccines or  
injected with a saline placebo. Dairy cows receiving vaccine C (Cattlemaster
Gold  
FP5; Pfizer Animal Health, Montreal, Canada) experienced a statistically  
significant difference in mean postvaccinal milk drop (-1.83 kg/cow/day)
compared  
with cows receiving vaccine T (Triangle 4+Type 2 BVD, Wyeth Animal Health,  
Guelph, Ontario, Canada; -0.63 kg/cow/day) or saline (-0.02 kg/cow/day).

North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27606, USA.  
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vaccination of lactating cattle with an  
Escherichia coli J5 bacterin-toxoid would produce a significant short-term
change  
in milk production.  
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled clinical trial.  
ANIMALS: 84 healthy, lactating cows (42 Holsteins and 42 Jerseys).  
PROCEDURE: Control and vaccinated cows were paired on the basis of breed, days
in  
milk, daily milk production 1 week prior to vaccination, and parity. One cow
in  
each pair was inoculated IM with a commercially available bacterin-toxoid  
according to label directions; the other cow was given saline solution. Cows
were  
milked twice daily for 5 days before and 5 days after inoculation. Milk  
production was compared by ANCOVA.  
RESULTS: Vaccinated cows produced significantly less milk than did control
cows  
at the second and third milkings after inoculation. At these milkings, milk  
production in vaccinated cows was approximately 7% less than that of controls.  
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Vaccination of lactating cattle with an E coli J5  
bacterin-toxoid may cause a significant short-term decrease in milk
production.

Between 1 May 1998 and 22 February 1999, it was compulsory for Dutch cattle  
farmers to take measures against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1). Cattle on farms  
that were not certified as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR)-free had to
be  
vaccinated twice a year. During the vaccination programme, both farmers and  
veterinarians reported side-effects of the vaccine. These reports were
collected  
by the Stichting IBR/BVD Schade (SIS; Foundation for IBR/BVD Damage) in order
to  
draw up a damage report. In 1999 in total 6977 cattle farmers lodged
complaints  
which they considered to be related to the vaccination against BHV1. On these  
farms, 15,150 herd vaccinations had been performed, 10,269 of which were  
associated with one or more symptoms. During the compulsory vaccination
period,  
13% of the herd vaccinations led to symptoms and complaints. In March 1999, a  
number of vaccine batches were found to be contaminated with bovine virus  
diarrhoea (BVD) virus. For the purposes of this analysis, a 'known
contaminated'  
herd vaccination was defined as one in which at least one 'known contaminated'  
batch or lot of vaccine was used. In total, 987 of 1007 herds vaccinated with  
'known contaminated' vaccines developed one or more symptoms compatible with  
acute BVD. There were no commonly seen combinations of symptoms. For this
reason,  
and because the start and end dates were not reported for 55% of the symptoms,
it  
was not possible to detect a symptom pattern. Therefore there were no
'suspect'  
batches of vaccine which, although not contaminated with BVD virus, gave rise
to  
symptoms. The number of BVD symptoms was determined for those herds with  
vaccination-related symptoms. There was no difference in the distribution  
frequency between batch numbers or between 'known contaminated' batches and  
'non-suspect' batches. The farmers' definition of chronic wasting was used in  
this investigation, with the inevitable large differences in definition. The  
symptom chronic 'wasting' was reported for 3209 of the 10,269 herds with  
vaccination-related symptoms. On 161 farms (164 herd vaccinations) 'chronic  
wasting' accounted for more than 20% of the symptoms. As expected, other
symptoms  
were reported in addition to wasting. The symptom 'chronic wasting' was
reported  
more often on forms where a 'known contaminated' vaccine was used. Inactivated  
vaccine was used for 154 herd vaccinations. In 34 cases, one or more symptoms
of  
acute BVD were reported. The frequency was the same as that for live vaccines.  
The frequency of reported symptoms tended to be lower with the inactivated  
vaccine. On the basis of the SIS data, no relationship was found between
vaccine  
batch and reported symptoms. This may be because (i) the classification of a  
vaccine as 'known contaminated', 'non-suspect', and 'not known' may not have
been  
in keeping with the real status of the vaccine, (ii) farmers may have reported  
symptoms selectively, and (iii) there is no relationship with vaccination
against  
BHV1.

'Chronic wasting' in cattle acquired a special meaning in the Netherlands in  
1999\. It was used to define animal health problems that were thought to be  
associated with the use of bovine herpesvirus 1 marker vaccine. Criteria have
not  
been set by which an objectively independent inventory of the problems could
be  
made. The objective of this study was to determine management factors
associated  
with the problem of 'chronic wasting' prior to the use of the BHV1 marker  
vaccine. Knowledge about these factors could be helpful for generating
additional  
hypotheses about the aetiology of chronic wasting in cattle. A total of 188
farms  
participated in the study, of which 94 had severe problems with chronic
wasting.  
The other half consisted of control farms matched with the case farms that did  
not report problems after the use of the BHV1 marker vaccine. Data analyses
were  
performed over the period before (and not at the time of) 'chronic wasting'  
problems. Data were collected from various sources. A questionnaire was used
to  
collect information on farm management practice. In addition, information on  
laboratory submissions for 1996 to 1998, animal movements in 1998, roughage  
analyses of 1997 and 1998, expenses for animal health in 1998, and herd  
performance in 1995 to 1999 was collected. In the analyses, a distinction was  
made between information obtained objectively and subjectively. Herds with  
problems of 'chronic wasting' were larger than herds without wasting problems  
(animals, surface) but not more intensively managed. 'Wasting' herds had a
lower  
performance in terms of fertility and udder health. In addition, these herds
had  
more contact with other herds through the purchase of animals. There were no  
differences in farm management practices related to disease control and  
prevention. Additional studies are required with regard to the patho-
physiology  
of chronic wasting cows. The role of herd size needs more study.

Me: I’d like to research vaccines and wanted to ask about your general opinion
since there is so much noise online. Do vaccines even work against the illness
they are meant to work against? My impression is that science mixed up
“inflammation” and “immune response” and that is why they are using dangerous
adjuvants that trigger the inflammatory response. What is your view on that?  
  
Ray: Have you seen Suzanne Humphries’ things on vaccination? Your comment
about inflammation vs immune response describes the situation exactly. I think
inflammation is often a sign that the body’s resistance is low. The body is
designed to handle viral and bacterial infections entering through the
respiratory and digestive systems, and antigens of introduced by injection
don’t produce the same reactions that the normally acquired infections do. The
20th century medical model of the immune system introduced by Paul Ehrlich was
designed to promote the sale of drugs, and is corrupt at its core. Jamie
Cunliffe (“damage”) and Polly Matzinger (“danger”) have introduced more
biological models of immunity, that I think should displace the Ehrlich model.
Good oxidative metabolism, with optimal vitamin D and thyroid function, gets
people through epidemics without getting sick, despite being exposed to the
thing that made others sick.

Cancer; an induced disease of twentieth century! Induction of tolerance,  
increased entropy and 'Dark Energy': loss of biorhythms (Anabolism v.

Maintenance of health involves a synchronized network of catabolic and
anabolic  
signals among organs/tissues/cells that requires differential bioenergetics
from  
mitochondria and glycolysis (biological laws or biorhythms). We defined  
biological circadian rhythms as Yin (tumoricidal) and Yang (tumorigenic) arms
of  
acute inflammation (effective immunity) involving immune and non-immune
systems.  
Role of pathogens in altering immunity and inducing diseases and cancer has
been  
documented for over a century. However, in 1955s decision makers in  
cancer/medical establishment allowed public (current baby boomers) to consume  
million doses of virus-contaminated polio vaccines. The risk of cancer
incidence  
and mortality sharply rose from 5% (rate of hereditary/genetic or innate
disease)  
in 1900s, to its current scary status of 33% or 50% among women and men,  
respectively. Despite better hygiene, modern detection technologies and
discovery  
of antibiotics, baby boomers and subsequent 2-3 generations are sicker than  
previous generations at same age. American health status ranks last among
other  
developed nations while America invests highest amount of resources for  
healthcare. In this perspective we present evidence that cancer is an induced  
disease of twentieth century, facilitated by a great deception of
cancer/medical  
establishment for huge corporate profits. Unlike popularized opinions that
cancer  
is 100, 200 or 1000 diseases, we demonstrate that cancer is only one disease;
the  
severe disturbances in biorhythms (differential bioenergetics) or loss of
balance  
in Yin and Yang of effective immunity. Cancer projects that are promoted and  
funded by decision makers are reductionist approaches, wrong and unethical and  
resulted in loss of millions of precious lives and financial toxicity to
society.  
Public vaccination with pathogen-specific vaccines (e.g., flu, hepatitis, HPV,  
meningitis, measles) weakens, not promotes, immunity. Results of irresponsible  
projects on cancer sciences or vaccines are increased population of  
drug-dependent sick society. Outcome failure rates of claimed 'targeted'
drugs,  
'precision' or 'personalized' medicine are 90% (± 5) for solid tumors. We  
demonstrate that aging, frequent exposures to environmental hazards,
infections  
and pathogen-specific vaccines and ingredients are 'antigen overload' for
immune  
system, skewing the Yin and Yang response profiles and leading to induction of  
'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe' immune disorders. Induction of decoy or pattern  
recognition receptors (e.g., PRRs), such as IRAK-M or IL-1dRs ('designer'  
molecules) and associated genomic instability and over-expression of growth  
promoting factors (e.g., pyruvate kinases, mTOR and PI3Ks, histamine, PGE2,
VEGF)  
could lead to immune tolerance, facilitating cancer cells to hijack anabolic  
machinery of immunity (Yang) for their increased growth requirements.
Expression  
of constituent embryonic factors would negatively regulate differentiation of  
tumor cells through epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and create "dual
negative  
feedback loop" that influence tissue metabolism under hypoxic conditions. It
is  
further hypothesized that induction of tolerance creates 'dark energy' and  
increased entropy and temperature in cancer microenvironment allowing
disorderly  
cancer proliferation and mitosis along with increased glucose metabolism via  
Crabtree and Pasteur Effects, under mitophagy and ribophagy, conditions that
are  
toxic to host survival. Effective translational medicine into treatment
requires  
systematic and logical studies of complex interactions of tumor cells with
host  
environment that dictate clinical outcomes. Promoting effective immunity  
(biological circadian rhythms) are fundamental steps in correcting host  
differential bioenergetics and controlling cancer growth, preventing or
delaying  
onset of diseases and maintaining public health. The author urges independent  
professionals and policy makers to take a closer look at cancer dilemma and
stop  
the 'scientific/medical ponzi schemes' of a powerful group that control a  
drug-dependent sick society before all hopes for promoting public health  
evaporate.

of  
immune dysfunction toward tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Detailed analyses of  
data on chronic diseases suggest that nearly all age-associated illnesses,  
generally categorized as 'mild' (e.g., increased allergies), 'moderate' (e.g.,  
hypertension, colitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, emphysema) or 'severe' (e.g.,  
accelerated neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases or site-specific cancers  
and metastasis) are variations of hypersensitivity responses of tissues that
are  
manifested as different diseases in immune-responsive or immune-privileged  
tissues. Continuous release/presence of low level histamine (subclinical) in  
circulation could contribute to sustained oxidative stress and induction of  
'mild' or 'moderate' or 'severe' (immune tsunami) immune disorders in
susceptible  
tissues. Site-specific cancers are proposed to be 'severe' (irreversible)
forms  
of cumulative delayed hypersensitivity responses that would induce
immunological  
chaos in favor of tissue growth in target tissues. Shared or special features
of  
growth from fetus development into adulthood and aging processes and  
carcinogenesis are briefly compared with regard to energy requirements of
highly  
complex function of Yin and Yang. Features of Yang (growth-promoting) arm of  
acute inflammation during fetus and cancer growth will be compared for
consuming  
low energy from glycolysis (Warburg effect). Growth of fetus and cancer cells  
under hypoxic conditions and impaired mitochondrial energy requirements of  
tissues including metabolism of essential branched amino acids (e.g., val,
leu,  
isoleu) will be compared for proposing a working model for future systematic  
research on cancer biology, prevention and therapy. Presentation of a working  
model provides insightful clues into bioenergetics that are required for fetus  
growth (absence of external threat and lack of high energy-demands of Yin
events  
and parasite-like survival in host), normal growth in adulthood (balance in
Yin  
and Yang processes) or disease processes and carcinogenesis (loss of balance
in  
Yin-Yang). Future studies require focusing on dynamics and promotion of  
natural/inherent balance between Yin (tumoricidal) and Yang (tumorigenic) of  
effective immunity that develop after birth. Lawless growth of cancerous cells  
and loss of cell contact inhibition could partially be due to impaired  
mitochondria (mitophagy) that influence metabolism of branched chain amino
acids  
for biosynthesis of structural proteins. The author invites interested
scientists  
with diverse expertise to provide comments, confirm, dispute and question
and/or  
expand and collaborate on many components of the proposed working model with
the  
goal to better understand cancer biology for future designs of cost-effective  
research and clinical trials and prevention of cancer. Initial events during  
oxidative stress-induced damages to DNA/RNA repair mechanisms and
inappropriate  
expression of inflammatory mediators are potentially correctable, preventable
or  
druggable, if future studies were to focus on systematic understanding of
early  
altered immune response dynamics toward multistep chronic diseases and  
carcinogenesis.

**Me:**  
My wife was recommend Liposomal or Lypospheric [ vitamin c
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) before and
after getting mandatory vaccines by the government. Also take magnesium and a
zinc supplement as soon as possible.  
  
After the vaccinations, to take an Advanced TRS and Sun chlorrella.  
  
Are you familiar with any of these substances?  
  
Not sure if they'll do more harm than good.  
  
**Ray:**  
Magnesium and zinc supplements are usually safe, but milk, eggs, seafood,
meat, fruit, etc., usually provide enough. The other suggestions sound like a
supplement salesman’s ideas, and could be harmful.  
  
**Me:**  
Any specific type of magnesium or zinc supplement ingredients/qualities to
look for?  
  
My wife drinks a few cups of coffee per day (safe chelator of metals I

Would charcoal and/or [ cascara ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-
sagrada/) be useful in situation like this?  
  
**Ray:**  
Magnesium glycinate is usually safe; zinc supplements shouldn’t be more than
10 mg. Coffee is protective of the immune system, reducing inflammation. Your
usual fibrous foods are helpful, because stress increases the absorption of
endotoxin and bacteria. Cascara has antiinflammatory effects that should be
helpful; I don’t think charcoal would.

The tone of my voice varies in a way which I can't explain coherently,
although there does seem to be a correlation between anxiety and a slightly
higher pitch.  
  
Ray: The basic pitch gets lower as the larynx grows under the influence of
androgen, but nervous tension, tightening the muscles, increases the pitch.
Swelling of the vocal cords affects the sound quality, too.

**Me:**  
It is said hyperglycemia is bad because it can cause damage to nerves, blood
vessels, organs. Do you think the sugar itself can cause damage if its level
is kept high in the  
blood stream for an extended period? There is a lot going on when the body is
in a state of hyperglycemia, so it seems a little bit weird to blame any
damage that is caused entirely on the sugar itself. Could it just be something
else that happens to be high like FFA, insulin, lactic acid, or even an
absence of something, like sugar (being utilized) or CO2?  
  
**Ray:**  
_"In tissue culture experiments, very high glucose has harmful effects, but
those conditions don’t reflect what happens in the whole organism. Glucose in
the blood is increased adaptively to protect against something that’s damaging
the tissues, and that’s usually a hormone imbalance that is interfering with
the ability to oxidize glucose. The “glycation” that’s usually blamed on high
glucose is mostly caused by lipid peroxidation from polyunsaturated fats, and
the glycerol that’s liberated by lipolysis, and metabolized to methylglyoxal.
The fats block glucose metabolism for energy, and more glucose is produced to
overcome that."_

Dear mr Peat,  
  
Currently there are multiple companies working on developing chemicals that

capable of restoring (noise) damaged hearing without these new pharmaceutical

Ray peat:  
I think they, and other stem cells such as in the pancreas, are always being

I once emailed peat about alpha males and he had an interesting reply.  
  
I think it’s a projection of the social darwinist ideology of capitalism. As
the religious justification for poverty was fading, middle of the 19th
century, the hierarchic world view began seeing itself in animals, and then
that became the “scientific basis” for justifying social stratification. The
schools have been important for indoctrinating the ideology. The idea of a
“pecking order” in chickens was similar to the idea of an alpha male in apes,
and—disregarding the actual studies—became “common knowledge” by the middle of
the last century. The pecking order develops in domestic chickens only under
certain circumstances in flocks of a certain size, and in ape families the
dominant male role is much more flexible, subtle, and situational than the
genetic determinists have trained people to believe. When I was in the biology
department at the U. of Oregon, 1968-72, professors were using Desmond
Morris’s book _The Naked Ape_ as a text book—a projection of Tory social
ethics/militarism onto archeologic samples, and then an argument from that to
“human nature.” It was as if Ayn Rand’s books were being used in sociology and
philosophy courses.

I was hoping you could answer a couple of questions that I havent been able to
find answers for.  
  
Many blogs and books have written about eating carbohydrates alone on an empty
stomach leading to the shuttling of more tryptophan to the brain.  
I know fructose wont spike insulin but I am wondering if the glucose and
sucrose in a pint of orange juice eaten alone on an empty stomach would be
enough to raise brain serotonin?  
  
Secondly, do you think the amount of sugar in a coke is enough to support the
metabolic boost from the caffeine in most people?

**Me** : I’ve been recently into this fascination of smelling good perfumes
and buying some of them if money allows. The perfumes are of top quality and
from niche houses. I know some of them could induce allergy, affect hormones,
or dater people away from you but I can’t stop enjoying them. I enjoy the
notes of vanilla, rose, agarwood, ambergris, tobacco, honey, and many more
notes. What are your opinions about those fragrances? I heard they are some
notes that can arouse women, which can be inappropriate if you work at a
company with many ladies around you. Also, I heard some fragrances can
increase androgens and make you more masculine.  
  
**Ray Peat** : The same steroid metabolite increases attraction of women, and
confidence in men. Have you read Luca Turin’s work, or heard his google
lecture?  
  
**Me** : I watched some of Luca Turin's youtube videos and they were
definitely fascinating to me, especially when he talked about the vibrations
of smell molecules, as opposed to their shapes and the shapes of receptors,
being responsible for creating the fragrance. Andersterone is a pheromone that
is sold in many perfume essential oils online stores from Thailand and south
east Asia countries.  
Unrelated matter.. I see my little nephews and nieces sleeping and most of
them sleep on their stomachs. Children have a higher metabolism than us and
that’s why they can be really smart. Do you think sleeping on the stomach is
healthier than other sleeping positions (right side, left side, on the back
etc.,)? I read somewhere that sleeping on the stomach helps you avoid
excessive loss of CO2.  
  
**Ray Peat** : I think the position is better for the function of the viscera.

On Deuterium Depletion:  
  
“Hi Dr Peat,  
I'm currently diving into Deuterium research and fascinated by it; on the one
hand, high Deuterium appears to impact metabolism overtime by "jamming" ATP
synthase- so it would be prudent to keep deuterium content in body low.  
I recall in one of your interviews you mentioned deuterium depleted water, and
I want to give it a try (there's a new USA based supply offering 25ppm at
better price than the ones from EU suppliers).  
In terms of Deuterium content in foods, there's a push for Ketogenic type
diets to help deplete it, Center of Deuterium Depletion in CA recommends
reducing intake of carbohydrates, specially fruits as they believe that's
where Deuterium gets pushed into. Short of moving into high altitude regions,
is there any legitimate concerns about reducing carbs to avoid excess
Deuterium?  
On the flip side, there's investigation around using Deuterated PUFAs to
prevent lipid peroxidation damage from propagating. Looks like a drug is under
development using D-PUFAs against neurodegenerative conditions. What are your
thoughts on using D-PUFAs as a weapon against oxidative stress? Also, would be
interesting if Deuterium played a beneficial role during mead acid
production.”  
  
Dr Peat  
“I think beet sugar from areas east of the Rockies is likely to be low
deuterium, since more will be rained out enroute from the ocean. I think a
similar process of reducing deuterium is likely to be involved in producing
fruit and milk, since the aging organism accumulates deuterium; young tissues
are better than old tissues. I think LG Boros talks nonsense.”

What exactly is wrong with [ vitamin C
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) supplements?  
  
\- Me:  
  

"Hello, Ray.  
  
You've expressed your concerns with vitamin C supplementation many times
before. In spite of the potential problems, it's common to find people
reporting a good experience.  
  
Can you be more specific about what is wrong with the industrial process and
how it could be made great again? Someone shared a diagram sent by you, but
there was no comment included. It's valuable to have it clarified so that
users demand the improvement.  
  
Also, do you have an opinion on freeze-dried fruits rich in it?  
  
Let me know in case you don't want an eventual reply to be shared elsewhere."​

dried fruits?"  ​

How do you think that the traditional (good) product would have performed?  
A complicator is the fast absorption of vitamin C in relation to the length of
the experiment.

Haworth and fellow British chemist Edmund Hirsthad synthesised Asc, but also,
independently, the Polish chemist Tadeus Reichstein (Figure 7.2), succeeded in
synthesising the vitamin in bulk, making it the first vitamin to be
artificially produced (Stacey and Manners, 1978). The latter process made
possible the cheap mass-production of semi-synthetic Asc, which was quickly
marketed. Haworth was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry in part for
this work, but the Reichstein process, a combined chemical and bacterial
fermentation sequence still used today to produce vitamin C, retained
Reichstein’s name (Boudrant, 1990; Bremus et al., 2006). In 1934, Hoffmann–La
Roche, which bought the Reichstein process patent, became the first
pharmaceutical company to mass-produce and market synthetic vitamin C, under
the brand name Redoxon (Bächi, 2008).  
  
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a two-step microbial fermentation process
was developed in China (Yin et al., 1980). Compared to the Reichstein process,
the new fermentation process provides a clear cost benefit: it requires not
only less chemicals and energy but also significantly low investment in
production equipment (Xu et al., 2004). Therefore, the two-step fermentation
process substituted the classical Reichstein process and was widely applied by
Chinese manufacturers that produced more than 80% of vitamin C in theworld
market (Pappenberger and Hohmann, 2014). Currently, more than 100,000 t
vitamin C are produced every year in the world and have been widely used in
the food, beverage, animal feed and pharmaceutical industries (Bremus et al.,
2006; Mandlaa, 2014)."​

  
I don't know if they're making up for ineffectiveness, but synthetic ascorbic
acid must still have more positives than negatives. If it's a matter of trying
to stick to the original protocol, being more comfortable including than
excluding elements, it doesn't explain the increase in amount, they're dealing
with some people in critical conditions.  
  
  
There are those who are supplementing, deriving benefit from it and will keep
taking regardless of what is presented to them, which is why it would be
helpful if you could specify what's wrong with the industrial process nowadays
and how it can be made reliable. What to look and ask for?  
  
In case synthetic options are out of question, there are alternatives such as
acerola or camu-camu powder. Do you have an opinion on these? Have you ever
recommended them?  
  
Check out Table 3 below, it's useful for comparison with metal contamination
of synthetic products on the market:

"There have been several major process changes. I don’t know of any tests that

"After you mentioned this in one of your interviews by Patrick Timpone, I
tried to search for the content and wasn't much impressed:

If it remains relatively stable depending on the water quality (as linked), I
suppose that it must not be extremely contaminated. It could interact with
minerals from a meal, but people usually take it away from it or with juices
that have the chelating plant compounds that might prevent an interaction with
free minerals. Once it gets to the site of absorption, it should behave just
like food ascorbic acid. Am I missing something?  
  
From the 'Bean Syndrome' link:  
  

"In the absence of food in the stomach, hydroxyl radicals will react with the
mucosal lining, pepsin, and pepsinogen. A well-characterized hydroxyl radical
scavenger, 1.0 M ethanol, greatly reduced the rate of formation of
dihydroxybenzoates (see Fig. 1)."​

  
I don't use it and probably won't, but find it curious that it's not rare to
come across people who treat it as their favorite and most beneficial
supplement in spite of these issues, so it's difficult to think of it doing
more harm than good. I guess that they wouldn't be responding well to it if
their diets were providing enough.  
  
Do you have an opinion on food-based alternatives (dry acerola, camu-camu,
gubinge, rose hips, etc)? I'm not a vendor, but would be nice if I was because
there has to be safe options out there so that users reap the benefits without
having to deal with the detrimental effects. I ~~emphasize~~ empathize with
the struggle to find a reliable way to increase its intake, sometimes needs
are very high."​

obvious at 100% relative humidity when there’s no transpiration. It’s just one
place where the ignorance of official biology is very visible, and the funny

\- [ Where Does Ray Stand On The "Ascorbic Acid Is Not Vitamin C" Claim?
](https://raypeatforum.com/community/threads/where-does-ray-stand-on-the-
ascorbic-acid-is-not-vitamin-c-claim.7596/#post-97149)  
  

"I found that many people are highly allergic to commercial [ ascorbic acid
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) , reacting
intensely to as little as a milligram or two, while they have no reaction to
natural foods containing large amounts of ascorbate. When I hadn’t been taking
vitamin C supplements for a few months, I analyzed my uring and found that it
contained about 1000 milligrams per day. I found that much of the vitamin C in
food, for example in meat, is in the form of dehydroascorbate, which isn’t
visible to the standard analytic methods that depend on the reducing power of
the vitamin. As muscle metabolizes, some of the dehydroascorbate that it
contains is reduced to ascorbic acid, and some of that is lost in the urine.
When I stopped eating grains, beans, and nuts, the amount of vitamin C in my
urine increased considerably. Properly analyzed, a good human daily diet
contains 3000 to 4000 mg of vitamin C. Linus Pauling was unaware of the
importance of the dehydro- form of the vitamin in food, and he denied that the
commercial ascorbic acid could be allergenic. A free radical chemist found
that reagent grade ascorbic acid contained enough heavy metals, including
iron, to catalyze the formation of an extremely high concentration of free
radicals when it’s dissolved in distilled water. Traces of oxidation products,
such as those formed when a solution of glucose is heat sterilized, probably
account for the allergic reactions. Szent-Gyorgyi recognized the identity of
vitamin C as ascorbic acid, though the first names he proposed for it were
ignose and godnose.

Trace levels of transition metals can participate in the metal-catalyzed
Haber-Weiss reaction (superoxide-driven Fenton reaction) as well as catalyze
the oxidation of ascorbate. Generally ascorbate is thought of as an excellent
reducing agent; it is able to serve as a donor antioxidant in free radical-
mediated oxidation processes. However, as a reducing agent it is also able to
reduce redox-active metals such as copper and iron, thereby increasing the
pro-oxidant chemistry of these metals. Thus ascorbate can serve as both a pro-
oxidant and an antioxidant. In general, at low ascorbate concentrations,
ascorbate is prone to be a pro-oxidant, and at high concentrations, it will
tend to be an antioxidant. Hence there is a crossover effect. We propose that
the "position" of this crossover effect is a function of the catalytic metal
concentration. In this presentation, we discuss: (1) the role of catalytic
metals in free radical-mediated oxidations; (2) ascorbate as both a pro-
oxidant and an antioxidant; (3) catalytic metal catalysis of ascorbate
oxidation; (4) use of ascorbate to determine adventitious catalytic metal
concentrations; (5) use of ascorbate radical as a marker of oxidative stress;
and (6) use of ascorbate and iron as free radical pro-oxidants in photodynamic
therapy of cancer.

Blue light irradiation of 2-deoxyribose (DOR) in the presence of uroporphyrin

The

Bensch KG, Fleming JE, Lohmann W.  
The reductone ascorbic acid, present in the crystalline lens in concentrations  
higher than those of glucose, is capable of undergoing nonenzymatic "browning"  
in the presence of lenticular proteins. We studied the nonenzymatic browning  
with ascorbate in model systems employing bovine serum albumin and lens  
crystallins. When bovine serum albumin, alpha-crystallin, or gamma-crystallin  
was incubated with [14C]ascorbic acid, the formation of yellow and then brown  
condensation products appeared to correlate with increasing protein-associated  
radioactivity. The fluorescence spectrum of these products was similar to that  
of homogenates of human cataractous lenses. We suggest that the nonenzymatic  
reaction of lens crystallins with ascorbic acid may contribute, at least in  
part, to the color changes of aging lenses and to the physical lenticular  
deterioration leading to senile cataract. High dietary intake of ascorbic acid  
did not affect the fluorescence spectrum of murine lenses; thus, we assume
that  
the speed and extent of the lenticular browning reactions must depend on a  
deterioration of other factors of the multicomponent antioxidant system of the  
eye.

A study of the peroxidation of fatty acid micelles promoted by ionizing  
radiation, hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate.  
Yau TM, Mencl J.  
The kinetics of peroxidation of fatty acid micelles promoted by ionizing  
radiation, hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate were compared. At the dose-rate
range  
of ionizing radiation studied, the higher the dose-rate, the greater the total  
dose required to produce the same effect. With ascorbate, the rate of lipid  
peroxidation was dependent on the concentration of the promoter only up to 1 X  
10(-4) M, beyond which a decreasing rate of peroxidation induction was
observed.  
Higher concentration of ascorbate also suppressed the promoting effect of  
ionizing radiation. Formate, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, inhibited the  
peroxidation process promoted by these three agents. Caesium was found to be  
slightly inhibitory. EDTA and deoxycholate were also inhibitory, which may be  
attributed to iron-chelating and micelle-disrupting capacity, respectively.  
Addition of iron (Fe2+ or Fe3+) to EDTA-chelated fatty acid micelles  
re-initiated the peroxidation process. The ease of fatty acid oxidation at pH  
7.5 was arochidonic (20:4) greater than linolenic (18:3) greater than linoleic  
(18:2). This order was reversed at pH 11.5. Similarities in the kinetics of  
peroxidation obtained suggest that certain biological sequelae encountered in  
cells treated with these seemingly dissimilar agents might arise through some  
common mechanism(s).

Free radicals in biology: oxidative stress and the effects of ionizing  
radiation.  
Riley PA.  
Department of Molecular Pathology, UCL Medical School, London, UK.  
The most important electron acceptor in the biosphere is molecular oxygen
which,  
by virtue of its bi-radical nature, readily accepts unpaired electrons to give  
rise to a series of partially reduced species collectively known as reduced
(or  
'reactive') oxygen species (ROS). These include superoxide (O.2-), hydrogen  
peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO.) and peroxyl (ROO.) and alkoxyl (RO.)  
radicals which may be involved in the initiation and propagation of free
radical  
chain reactions and which are potentially highly damaging to cells. Mechanisms  
have evolved to restrict and control such processes, partly by
compartmentation,  
and partly by antioxidant defences such as chain-breaking antioxidant
compounds  
capable forming stable free radicals (e.g. ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol) and
the  
evolution of enzyme systems (e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidases)  
that diminish the intracellular concentration of the ROS. Although some ROS  
perform useful functions, the production of ROS exceeding the ability of the  
organism to mount an antioxidant defence results in oxidative stress and the  
ensuing tissue damage may be involved in certain disease processes. Evidence  
that ROS are involved in primary pathological mechanisms is a feature mainly
of  
extraneous physical or chemical perturbations of which radiation is perhaps
the  
major contributor. One of the important radiation-induced free-radical species  
is the hydroxyl radical which indiscriminately attacks neighbouring molecules  
often at near diffusion-controlled rates. Hydroxyl radicals are generated by  
ionizing radiation either directly by oxidation of water, or indirectly by the  
formation of secondary partially ROS. These may be subsequently converted to  
hydroxyl radicals by further reduction ('activation') by metabolic processes
in  
the cell. Secondary radiation injury is therefore influenced by the cellular  
antioxidant status and the amount and availability of activating mechanisms.
The  
biological response to radiation may be modulated by alterations in factors  
affecting these secondary mechanisms of cellular injury."​

"Infections are always a risk, but the presence of nanoparticles has been

ARE TATTOOS SAFE? INK TOXINS REMAIN IN HUMAN BODY FOR YEARS, STUDY SHOWS  
BY LIZETTE BORRELI ON 9/13/17 AT 3:38 PM EDT  
  
  
An international team of researchers have found nanoparticles in tattoo ink
travel inside the body and linger in the lymph nodes for long periods of time.  
  
Updated | There are many factors to think about when deciding to get a tattoo.
When choosing a tattoo artist and parlor, safety and cleanliness rank top
priority to prevent infections from dirty needles. A recent study published in
Scientific Reports suggests tattoo aficionados should also take a closer look
at the ink.  
  
Tattoo ink is made up of various organic and inorganic pigments, which can be
tainted with toxic element impurities. Researchers from Germany and France
wanted to know whether, and how, this material affects the body.  
  
The team looked to dead bodies to find out. As Gizmodo reports, the
researchers collected tissue samples from six people who had donated their
bodies to science upon death. Four of the bodies had tattoos and two did not.
Two of the four inked corpses had ink in their lymph nodes. Aluminum,
chromium, iron, nickel, copper and titanium were also present in heightened
amounts in the tattooed bodies.  
  
Using a high-tech X-ray light, the researchers found lymph nodes tinted with
the color of the tattoo. They also found nanoparticles of toxic elements from
tattoo pigment. The average size of these particles was 180 nanometers (to put
this in perspective, a human hair is around 75,000 nanometers wide).  
  
Finding lymph nodes colored with the tattoo ink was not surprising. Lymph
nodes—located in the head and neck region, armpits and groin area—help clean
the site where the tattoo needle entered. But finding pigment in nano form was
unexpected. This size "implies that they may not have the same behavior as the
particles at a micro level," Bernhard Hesse, co-lead author of the study and a
visiting scientist at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France,
said in the statement. "And that is the problem: we don't know how
nanoparticles react." And because the samples were from dead bodies that had
been tattooed not immediately before death, the researchers inferred that the
nanoparticles had lingered in the lymph nodes for a while.  
  
As for the elevated levels of titanium found in all the inked-up bodies, that
likely came from titanium dioxide, the second-most common ingredient in tattoo
inks. This white pigment is used to create certain shades when mixed with
colorants. The compound is also used in food additives, sunscreens and paints,
all of which could theoretically contribute to the elevated body levels. But
as the researchers note, prior work has shown that respiratory exposure to
titanium dioxide leaves the element only in the lung and hilar lymph nodes. In
these bodies, the nanoparticles were not confined to those specific regions,
suggesting the effects of tattoos are more than skin deep.  
  
There's also a concern that the black pigment in tattoo ink may contain
nanoparticles that are carcinogenic. A study in the British Journal of
Dermatology found some nanoparticles may cause toxic effects in the brain and
nerve damage. This finding suggests ink particles are capable of leaving the
surface of the skin and traveling throughout the body, possibly entering
organs and other tissues.  
  
There's still a lot to be learned about how these pigments interact with the
body, but clearly there's good reason to think before you ink."

Me:  
  
I have been hearing you recommend vitamin D very often recently, so I have
been trying to learn how it interacts with thyroid and C02 since it seems like
things that are very broadly helpful always have some interaction with C02.  
  
I have read vitamin D lowers iron in the blood and puts it into organs, so I
am guessing it is lowering iron usage for producing neurotransmitters. With
lowered neurotransmission, there is more GABA_B tone and the brain is quieted,
and breathing rate is lowered. As breathing rate is lowered, C02 levels go up,
and with higher C02 there are broad health-protective effects.  
  
Vitamin A seems to have the opposite effect by removing iron from organs and
increasing its usage (maybe that can be bad for people with high iron stores,
which might explain at least partially the current anti-vitamin A trend I keep
hearing about).  
  
Do you think this hypothesis could be on the right track and if so, does this
mean that eating lots of vitamin A from calf liver to get the iron into your
bloodstream and then donating blood, by drastically lowering the body's iron
stores, could make vitamin D supplementation unnecessary? Or does vitamin D
have deeper effects that go beyond iron, neurotransmitters, breathing rate?  
  
RP:  
  
Yes, vitamin D has very basic effects, including the klotho system, adrenals
and parathyroid, renin-angiotensins system, and thyroid function. I read the
anti-vitamin A book, and found no evidence in it to support his ideas.

put on respirators.  
  
The fact is that a large part of COVID-19 patients die in the most modern
hospitals in Europe using the most modern equipment (i.e. Bergamo and Madrid).
This video shows how they are being treated:

"Regarding the article  
  
Ray Peat:  
"The article sounds to me like the ideas of students who have taken a
pharmacology course in computer modeling of molecules; without an anchor to
experiment, it’s perfectly useless. Iron and particulate pollution cause lung
damage similar to the inflammation produced by the virus. Ventilating patients
decreases their antiinflammatory CO2, making the inflammation worse.
Acetaminophen, often given to patients, increases lung nitric oxide and
damages red blood cells, adding to the harm done by treatment. The suggested
treatments could aggravate the damage; for example, chloroquine increases
nitric oxide. The angiotensin produced in response to the virus increases
nitric oxide, and blocking that protects from the virus."

Bosia  
  
Abstract  
  
Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical involved in the regulation of many cell
functions and in the expression of several diseases. We have found that the
antimalarial and antiinflammatory drug, chloroquine, is able to stimulate NO
synthase (NOS) activity in murine, porcine, and human endothelial cells in
vitro: the increase of enzyme activity is dependent on a de novo synthesis of
some regulatory protein, as it is inhibited by cycloheximide but is not
accompanied by an increased expression of inducible or constitutive NOS
isoforms. Increased NO synthesis is, at least partly, responsible for
chloroquine-induced inhibition of cell proliferation: indeed, NOS inhibitors
revert the drug-evoked blockage of mitogenesis and ornithine decarboxylase
activity in murine and porcine endothelial cells. The NOS-activating effect of
chloroquine is dependent on its weak base properties, as it is exerted also by
ammonium chloride, another lysosomotropic agent. Both compounds activate NOS
by limiting the availability of iron: their stimulating effects on NO
synthesis and inhibiting action on cell proliferation are reverted by iron
supplementation with ferric nitrilotriacetate, and are mimicked by incubation
with desferrioxamine. Our results suggest that NO synthesis can be stimulated
in endothelial cells by chloroquine via an impairment of iron metabolism.

Me:  
I used an N95 mask for 2 hours.  
  
I found that the mask increased breathing effort and had anticipated some sort
of benefit from rebreathing some of the air that wasn't completely expelled:
i.e. like bag breathing increasing carbon dioxide retention.  
  
However, at the end of the 2 hours, I found the effect to be very negative. It
actually felt like the virus symptoms as reported by the media.  
  
My nasal passages had narrowed down with perhaps a histamine response.  
  
My throat area felt severely aggravated like you would feel just prior to the
onset of a cold.  
  
Next day: all gone.  
  
My question is: what type of a gas exchange disturbance had I created while
wearing the mask?  
  
Dr. Peat:  
  
The effort of breathing increases lung stress—stretch and
compression—increasing nitric oxide and other inflammation signals, similar to
the effects of the virus.  
  
Hospital ventilators are killing tens of thousands.  
  
Luciano Gattinoni, in Germany, says that one nearby hospital has a 0%
mortality rate from the virus, and another has a 60% rate, one avoiding the
“standard ventilation protocol."

"I was just talking to a friend in Mexico on the phone, who mentioned cold

between chilling and respiratory symptoms than English speakers do with “a

theory, and symptoms, until language and lived experience make a functional
reality, has happened with concepts of time and creation, cause and effect,
substance and field, existence and non-existence, etc. “ **Nothing,” as it’s
used by physicists and Christian theists, is a mental process with less
justification than the process that makes a Mexican sneeze when there’s a cold

relation of entropy to energy to make their assumptions obvious, and his use
of the word “time” doesn’t add anything useful that I can see to the
observations that he made, when he made a different assumption. But his
observations were concrete, and seemed to confirm something about the thinking
that led him to predict them. When a person questions the theological-
authoritarian-rationalist physical system, which insists that deduction from
their principles can explain everything,  
science becomes a matter of seeing what is to be seen, rather than reasoning
to a self-consistent conclusion from a perfect set of laws. A good hypothesis
is one that leads you discover what wasn’t known, not one that just confirms
present dogma.  
There are many recorded observations that can be used as context for Kozyrev’s
cluster of observations: J.L. Anderson’s non-random nuclear decay, Michael
Polanyi’s surface effects on crystal properties, Edward Morley and Dayton
Miller’s work on the velocity of light (ether drift), S. Warren Carey’s

what it is, and what it means for us."

it’s well known that the virus infects both the intestine and the lung, and
bowel inflammation leads to impaired lung function and the other things

weight rapidly. He can't keep much down and everything has to be watered down
for him. I want to help him as I know a side effect long term methimazole is
hypothyroidism. I gave him 4mcg T3 the other night hoping it would help
balance him out. Do you have any experience with pets and thyroid and how to
approach it?  
  
The rhetoric is that dogs are hypo and cats are hyper, I however don't believe
it, as I've read your remarks on the stabilizing ability of thyroid to both
conditions and the rarity of true hyperthyroidism. (Cat name) ate canned tuna
most of his life and fish and chicken are the only two things he can really
keep down. He drinks a lot of water, his kidney markers are off, his paws,
ears and nose are cold and he's always begging for food. These all seem like
hypo symptoms to me...  
  
Thank you.  
  
Ray: Cachexia is the effect of complete absence of thyroid, being cold and
having low kidney function are signs in that direction. Thyroid, T3, is
anabolic. Have you tried blending a little raw egg yolk with tuna for extra
nutrients?

Wanted to ask Ray about Accutane side effects reversal for some time now, so
here it is. Pasting it here exactly as sent and received, only without
greetings etc.  
  
**Me:**  
Just wanted to ask your opinion about Accutane side effect reversal. As far as
I'm aware, Accutane remains quite popular prescription drug for acne
treatment, despite being infamous for its side effects: depression, joint
pain, stomach pain, even changes in hippocampus. I did 1 month of Accutane
treatment and can confirm some of its effects.  
  
What would be the best thing to do in order to minimize or reverse its side
effect?  
Do you think that its damage might be permanent?  
Would it be still wise to take vitamin A after Accutane treatment?  
  
**Ray:**  
Since the symptoms can be produced by activation of the pro-inflammatory
angiotension system, and an overdose of vitamin A can create symptoms of a
vitamin A deficiency (vitamin A normally works with vitamin D to inhibit that
system), I think it might help to supplement some vitamin D (about 5000 IU
unless you get good sun exposure), vitamin A (about 10,000 IU), with some
vitamin E (20 to 50 IU), thyroid hormone (according to temperature and pulse
rate), and a good ratio of calcium to phosphate in the diet. An angiotensin
blocker such as candesartan might help with joint pain and depression.  
  
  
_Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 2001 Nov;281(5):F909-19.  
  
Effects of all-trans retinoic acid on renin-angiotensin system in rats with
experimental nephritis.  
  
Dechow C, Morath C, Peters J, Lehrke I, Waldherr R, Haxsen V, Ritz E, Wagner
J.  
  
We previously demonstrated that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) preserves
glomerular structure and function in anti-Thy1.1 nephritis (Wagner J, Dechow
C, Morath C, Lehrke I, Amann K, Floege J, and Ritz E. J Am Soc Nephrol 11:
1479-1489, 2000). Because the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) contributes to
renal damage, we 1) studied retinoid-specific effects on its components and 2)
compared the effects of all-trans-RA with those of the AT(1)-receptor blocker
candesartan. Rats were pretreated for 3 days before injection of the OX-7
antibody and continued with treatment with either vehicle or daily injections
of 10 mg/kg all-trans-RA only (study 1) or 10 mg/kg body wt all-trans-RA, 1
mg/kg candesartan, or both (study 2) for an additional 7 days. The blood
pressure increase observed in anti-Thy1.1 nephritic rats was equally
normalized by all-trans-RA and candesartan (P < 0.05). In nephritic rats,
mRNAs of angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the kidney
were unchanged, but renin mRNA was lower (P < 0.01). Renal and glomerular
AT(1)-receptor gene and protein expression levels were higher in anti-Thy1.1
nephritic rats (P < 0.05). In the renal cortex of nephritic rats, pretreatment
with all-trans-RA significantly reduced mRNAs of all the examined RAS
components, but in the glomeruli it increased ACE gene and protein expression
(P < 0.01). In nephritic rats, candesartan reduced the number of glomerular
cells and mitoses (P < 0.05) less efficiently than all-trans-RA (P < 0.01).
Both substances reduced cellular proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen) significantly (P < 0.05). No additive effects were noted when both
compounds were combined. In conclusion, all-trans-RA influences the renal RAS
in anti-Thy1.1 nephritis by decreasing ANG II synthesis and receptor
expression. The beneficial effect of retinoids may be explained, at least in
part, by reduction of RAS activity. _

"Endometriosis is clearly the result of too much estrogen, and there are good
reasons for thinking a similar imbalance is involved in vulvodynia. Estrogen
increases the presence of mast cells, which are found increased in the painful
area. Mast cells secrete a variety of proinflammatory and pain-inducing
substances including histamine, serotonin, and renin, which is converted
locally to angiotensin. Estrogen supports formation of all those. Low vitamin
D, low calcium intake relative to phosphate, and low thyroid function
contribute to the excess of estrogen relative to [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) . Vitamin
D, milk, cyproheptadine (antagonist to histamine and serotonin), thyroid, and

I was disappointed with the lack of effort in this response, but with all the

Me: " _Hi Ray,  
  
I had blood tests done about one and a half years ago for serum vitamin A
levels. The results came back at the high end of the lab ranges (57 ug/dL), so
I decided to do a "vitamin A free" diet, virtually eating zero preformed
vitamin A and reducing carotenoids to the equivalent to a few hundred IUs of
vitamin A daily on average. I retested my serum vitamin A levels thrice since
my first test in January 2019 and the results came back high every time
(around 57 ug/dL). Does this indicate potential subclinical hypervitaminosis
A? It seems odd that with no vitamin A in my diet for about 1.5 years that my
serum vitamin A levels are still so high.  
  
Are there any supplements or things that can help speed up the process of
eliminating the excess vitamin A stored in the liver?  
Are there any things that are protective against excess vitamin A? _ "

It depends partly on your metabolic rate and activity level, but you need
enough carbohydrate to prevent ketosis. Generally using mainly carbohydrates
for energy is better, because a higher respiratory quotient prevents reductive
stress, the metabolism that can lead to diabetes, dementia, heart and kidney
disease, cancer. **I think it would be good to aim for 30% of calories or
less.** Milk with 1% fat is a good staple—the high calcium content helps to

Hello Dr. Peat,  
  
I’ve noticed a pattern recently. I will eat eggs and grapes for breakfast,
then go for a 45-minute morning walk with milk and warm coffee in my thermos.
Although I typically wake around 97.5 and after breakfast can get my temp up
to 98, after my walk, my temp is frequently very low, sometimes at 96.1.
Usually I eat a few carrots and the temperature rises to 98.0 over about 30
minutes.  
  
Do you know why I might have drastically reduced temperatures after morning
and evening walks? Should I stop them?  
  
  
**Dr. Peat:**  
I think it’s best to start the day with carbohydrates and milk, before having
eggs. When glycogen stores are low, the high quality protein of eggs can lower
the blood glucose. That’s more likely to happen if thyroid and vitamin D are
low.

Eating their normal foods, rodents and birds, they usually eat the bones, so
on a meat diet it’s important to give them extra calcium—bone meal, egg

Skull growth is matched by skin growth and formation of new blood vessels.
Increased fibrosis is associated with higher estrogen, lower testosterone, and
there is a strong increasing trend in recent decades for both of those, and
they coincide with a reduction of milk consumption during that time. The
incidence of hyperparathyroidism has increased during this time, and that
hormone causes hair loss. Calcium and vitamin D help to lower parathyroid
hormone. I think milk helps to prevent baldness, as well as obesity, colon
cancer, and dementia.

Increasing incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in Denmark  
  
Ali Abood, Peter Vestergaard  
  
Introduction: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder with
different epidemiological patterns among countries. In Denmark, the incidence
of primary hyperparathyroidism was last described in 1999 when it was reported
to follow an increasing trend. In the present study, we evaluated trends in
the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in Denmark up to 2010.  
  
Material and methods: All patients diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism
from 1977 to 2010 were included. Annual incidence rates were calculated.  
  
Results: The overall incidence was clearly increased at the end of 2010 with
an annual rate of 16 per 100,000. Following a cyclic curve, year-to-year
incidence rates were fluctuating. During the entire period, the incidence was
higher in women than in men. Furthermore, in women above the age of 50 years,
a five-fold increase in incidence was observed, while there was no difference
in the increase among men above the age of 50 years compared with men under
the age of 50 years.  
  
Conclusion: The incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in Denmark continues
its remarkable rise. The overall increase in incidence may be the result of
more frequent plasma calcium measurements as well as the prevailing obesity
epidemic. The dramatic increase in incidence observed among women over the age
of 50 years requires further studies. The causes of the cyclic trend observed
are uncertain, as no seasonal variation was seen.

Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia: An Emerging Epidemic

6 , Bahman Sotoodian 7  
  
Since the initial description of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) in 1994,
increasingly more cases of FFA have been reported in literature. Although
clear epidemiologic data on the incidence and prevalence of FFA is not
available, it is intriguing to consider whether FFA should be labeled as an
emerging epidemic. A medline trend analysis as well as literature review using
keywords "alopecia," "hair loss," and "cicatrical" were performed. Medline
trend analysis of published FFA papers from 1905 to 2016 showed that the
number of publications referenced in Medline increased from 1 (0.229%) in 1994
to 44 (3.5%) in 2016. The number of patients per published cohort also
increased dramatically since the first report of FFA. Over the time period of
January 2006-2016, our multi hair-referral centers collaboration study also
showed a significant increase in new diagnoses of FFA. At this juncture, the
cause for the rapid rise in cases is one of speculation. It is plausible that
a cumulative environmental or toxic factor may trigger hair loss in FFA. Once
perhaps a "rare type" of cicatricial alopecia, FFA is now being seen in a
frequency in excess of what is expected, thus suggestive of an emerging
epidemic.

I found this email exchange on the Facebook page from a while back, some of
you may have seen it. I think it was such a good exchange that it deserved to
be on here.  
  
The question:  
Dear Dr. Peat,  
Do you have any advice for dealing with destructive feelings - pent-up anger,
resentment, hate, jealousy, childhood trauma, rejection, feeling unloved,
feeling world-weary, feeling alienated in a world full of serotonin-driven
automatons - that resurface whenever metabolism isn't optimal or when stress
becomes too much?  
Food, [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-
powder-usp/) , thyroid, sunlight and other prometabolic substances are
helpful, but they don't clear up the energy of the past stuck in the system
and influencing the evaluation of the present.  
How to protect oneself from being vulnerable, without getting bitter and
coldhearted?  
And how does one know when to run away from a stressful situation and when to
work through it and improve oneself in the process?  
  
**Ray:**  
Although I think escaping from stressful situations is good in principle, it
can be very hard in practice. For acute situations, having a milkshake, some [
pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/)
and progesterone and coffee as needed, can make it possible to direct the
anger energy into mental actions. The reality is that societies are populated
mostly by those authoritarian automatons, but when I realize that the world
still contains lots of sentient intelligent beings—some humans, many mammals,
insects, mollusks, plants--I see that alienation from the malicious system is
better than joining it.  
It’s helpful to understand how particular bad actions fit into the bad system,
even though it makes you realize that the problem is immensely bigger than the
immediate thing that you’re reacting to. Wilhelm Reich and Alice Miller wrote
about some of the ways that the evil automatons are created. But beyond that
system of automatons, there’s the real world of living intelligences.  
When I was investigating how my autonomic nervous system works, I realized
that my body takes on specific feelings in the presence of different
individuals, with a sense of fibers going out from the solar plexus connecting
with people that I feel free with, and a sense of shrinking discomfort in
other situations. With practice, I found that I had some control over those
reactions, and by directing my attention to them I could maintain a sense of
myself while in the presence of the manipulators-robots.  
Besides being self protective or therapeutic, the consciousness of alienation
from a bad system puts you into a position where you might be able to reduce
some of its destructiveness.

Ray:  
Between 1959 and 1968, my master’s degree made it possible to get teaching
jobs. In 1972, the year I got my PhD, Nixon impounded science research money,
and university jobs suddenly weren’t available. When I applied to junior
colleges, I found that most of them had obligatory pay scales, causing them to
prefer people with only master’s degrees. When I started the biology PhD
program, I had saved $2000, which was enough for tuition and living expenses
for 2 years, then I got teaching and research assistantships for the next two
years, so I finished without debts. I started teaching some adult education
courses and giving talks while writing books. Lewis Powell’s 1971 Memorandum
to the US Chamber of Commerce probably precipitated the anti-science, anti-
culture, anti-education movement that led to Nixon’s impoundment of funds
(after the research had been approved and the money assigned), and the
following policy of austerity to leave more funds for militarism. Students
responded to the rising costs by studying business instead of liberal arts. I
suppose most university libraries were similar to the Univ. of Oregon’s,
cancelling subscriptions to all of their most interesting journals, keeping
the ideologically safe ones. Universities aren’t as interesting as they used
to be; I don’t know of any graduate programs I would want to bother with.  
Einstein referred to his 7 years of work at the patent office as his
“cobbler’s trade” that every creative perosn should have. The physicist Ernest
Sternglass, who was doing technical work at the time, quoted from a long talk
he had with Einstein in 1947:  
  
"Tell me," he said, "Are you planning to go back to school?"  
"Yes, I'm thinking about it."  
"Don't go back to school. They will try to crush every bit of originality out
of you. Don't go back to graduate school."  
"Well, I--"  
"Be careful. There will be enormous pressures to conform."  
And then he told me about his own life and the mistakes he had made. "Don't do
what I've done," he said. "Always have  
a cobbler's job. Always have a job where you can get up in the morning, face
yourself, that you're doing something useful  
for humanity. Because nobody can be a genius every day. Don't make that kind
of mistake. You know, when I accepted a  
job at the University of Berlin, I had no duties really. Nothing to do except
wake up and solve all the problems of the  
universe every morning. Nobody can do that. Don't make that mistake.".  
  
The situation now is incomparably worse than in 1947. Over-specialization
reflects the increasingly authoritarian culture. Over the years I’ve taught a
great variety of college courses (anthropology, linguistics, biochemistry,
physics for biology majors, immunology, philosophy, educational psychology,
painting, etc.), and in some of them I found that an honest look at the
subject matter aroused intense political reactions. If you can earn even a
meagre income doing something that’s immediately useful, the political
reactions against your ideas will be less dangerous, but conditions are
changing, making it harder to avoid the pressures to conform."

Would methylene blue be dangerous or beneficial in an iron overload state ?  
  
Dr Peat: Like [ ascorbic acid ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-

Me: My symptoms now are low temperature (a bit below 36 C in the morning) and
I can store glycogen for no more than 2 hours, so I have to eat often.
Regardless how much thyroid I am taking, these symptoms have been presenting.
....  
  
**RP:** [Mar 5, 2020]  
Are you sure that the kind of thyroid you’re using is effective? Many products
on the market don’t have the full potency. Have you seen an increase in your
pulse rate or tempeature, or appetite, or other change after starting the
thyroid? Are you getting enough protein and calcium in your diet? Those help
to regulate temperature and metabolic rate.  
  
Me: I am taking Cynoplus / Cynomel. Right now 2/3 of Cynoplus and 3/5 of
Cynomel per day. The max I was taking was the whole Cynoplus tablet.  
36.9 C was the max I've noticed during a day, but in the morning, never above
36.0.. 35.9 even. Pulse rate was about 76 in the morning when I was taking 1
Cynoplus table (like 2 weeks ago). I haven't been measuring it lately. Before
I started thyroid in the last summer it was about 60 beats.  
My diet is pretty simple. During the day I drink about 4 L of Milk, plus 150 g
of additional sugar, plus some salt. And one egg yolk. So it's above 3000 kcal
in my calculation. I think earlier, it was less then that.  
Also occasional liver (4 oz per 1-3 weeks) and low fat fish (like one fish per
2 week.. probably not enough of this one, so I may be not getting enough [
selenium ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/selenium-liquid/) ).  
  
**RP:** [Mar 9, 2020]  
Do you drink orange juice or have other fruit? [No]  
  
Me: What are essential or useful nutrients other than sugar, minerals and [
vitamin C ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) ,
good fruits can provide?  
  
**RP:** [Mar 27, 2020]  
I think the flavonoids are very beneficial, though not technically essential.
They provide some essential amino acids too.  
  
Me: The fruits are good (better than bread, for example) for stabilizing blood
sugar because of minerals and sugar, and good balance of these two?  
  
**RP:** [Mar 29, 2020]  
If the fruits are well chosen, for ripeness, digestibility, etc.  
  
Me: Several replies above, you recommended me to have some fruits in diet. I
understand that most of the nutrients they provide are beneficial anyway, but
since I can't have them at this point, is there something in particular that
can make the biggest difference that I can try to find in another source?  
  
**RP:** [Mar 30, 2020]  
I just add a little sugar to milk, with a little coffee, when I can’t get
fruit.  
  
Me: Do you think rosehip broth would be good for vitamin C? Is it safe to have
every day?  
  
**RP:** [Mar 31, 2020]  
If you don’t have an allergy to it it’s o.k., but all foods except grains,
nuts, and refined sugar contain adequate vitamin C.  
  
Me: I've got unrefined salt from the so -called 'Pink Lake' in Ukraine. It's
kind of similar to Dead Sea. Is that salt likely to supply an adequate amount
of trace minerals if use let's say teaspoon per day?  
Here is a link, in case you'd be more interested: [ Henyches'ke Lake
](https://goo.gl/maps/qov2NpWvsN2k1FMg7)  
  
**RP:** [Apr 1, 2020]  
The pink color is likely to be from iron, and that could be associated with
toxic minerals. I doubt that it would be a safe source of the essential trace
minerals.  
  
Me: The salt is quite pink in the beginning. The woman I bought the salt from
told me that the salt is wet and bitter, and not suitable for food yet,
because it contains too much magnesium. She told me to dry it in the sun for a
day and it's gonna become much paler, almost white, and that happened. It also
tastes differently, much softer afterwards.  
  
**RP:** [Apr 5, 2020]  
Magnesium is good, but I think the pink is likely to mean that it contains
iron; a little is o.k., but it can react in the stomach with vitamins such as
C.  
  
Me: If I would dissolve the salt in water and let the solution stay for a
while (like night), would the iron likely settle to the bottom?  
  
**RP:** [Apr 5, 2020]  
I don’t think so.  
  
Me: I've found some information about what makes pink salt, from a very
similar australian lake, pink. Here are few links, if you'd like to know:  
[ How an Australian lake turned bubble-gum pink - Australian Geographic
](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/science-
environment/2016/12/australias-pink-lakes/)  
  
Do you think it is worth worrying about possible impurities in regular sea
salt (like plastic)? In other words, is sea salt safe in general?  
  
**RP:** [Apr 8, 2020]  
Sea salt is usually made in steps, with sodium chloride separating first,
making it the cleanest. If it’s grey, it’s because of clay, which isn’t as
risky as the more complex lake bed salts.  
  
Me: I know you recommend shellfish as being the best for trace minerals. You
also mentioned sea fish. If I can have only the fish now, what do you think
might be a minimum amount needed to ensure having enough of the trace
minerals? Minimum, because I don't want to use too much protein, since I'm
hypothyroid yet and already having plenty from milk. The meat of the fish is
white; the fish is without head and about 200 g on average.  
  
**RP:** [Apr 9, 2020]  
I think a weekly serving of about 120 grams is enough.  
  
Me: Is it o.k. to dissolve Cynoplus or Cynomel in hot water?  
  
**RP:** [Apr 10, 2020]  
The hormone isn’t soluble in water.  
  
Me: Hello Dr. Peat. Wanna ask you - how would I cook my calf liver not using a
pan and oil, but just water, while saving most nutrients?  
  
**RP:** [Sep 13, 2020]  
Quickly cooked liver has the best flavor, so dropping thin slices into boiling
water for just about 30 seconds, or until the blood coagulates, would be best.  
  
Me: Would it be o.k. to do this in the microwave?  
  
**RP:** [Sep 15, 2020]  
That should work.  
  
Me: Are tomatoes any good?  
  
**RP:** [Sep 22, 2020]  
In moderate amounts they are good unless you’re allergic to them; in excess,
the carotene-related pigments can disturb the hormones.  
  
Me: I'd like to know a bit more about this, Dr. Peat, so have a couple more
questions. Can other carotenoids go in the way of vitamin A functions
themselves or they have to be converted to carotene first?  
  
**RP:** [Sep 23, 2020]  
We don’t convert lycopene, but alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin are
converted to vitamin A.  
  
Me: Did you mention alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin as related to
tomatoes, or those are only carotenoids we can convert to vitamin A?  
  
**RP:** [Sep 24, 2020]  
One other can be converted to vitamin A--gamma-carotene.  
  
Me: And those are the ones that can cause problems as I understand. Are you
aware of any other fruits that contain the carotenoids in quantities that can
be risky?  
And for now, thank you very much!  
  
**RP:** [Sep 25, 2020]  
Cooked carrots or the juice, tomatoes, and orange or red sweet potatoes in
large quantities are commonly problems in hypothyroid people, or in vegans who
lack vitamin B12.  
  
Me: Hello Ray. In one of your interviews you said that after about 2 years of
a changed diet you could correct the age associated decline of thyroid
function by supplements.  
If the previous diet was really high in PUFA, what should be realistic
expectations during the first years after the diet? Would it be hard or even
possible to make the thyroid supplements work?  
  
**RP:** [Oct 8, 2020]  
The balance of T4 and T3 and the total dose have to be adjusted often at the
beginning.  
  
Me: Hi, Mr. Peat. Hope you're doing good. I have a quick question - if coconut
oil solidifies well and evenly in a refrigerator from a heated state should I
consider it as reliable or it's not enough and still might be adulterated?  
  
**RP:** [Dec 21, 2020]  
If it stays solid at 75 degrees F it contains mainly the natural mixture of
oils.  
  
Me: Hello, Dr. Peat. My dentist prescribed me a tooth gel for temporary use.
But my concern is that it contains 0.2% w/w (900ppm) of Sodium Fluoride and
has to be kept on teeth for 30 minutes. Is that enough to be toxic? Should I
be concerned?  
  
**RP:** [Jan 8, 2021]  
It shouldn’t be allowed to touch the gums or tongue.  
  
Me: For the last 6 (or more) months I've been experiencing symptoms coming
from intestinal bacteria. The symptoms visibly increase right away after
drinking boiled milk. I've been using tetracycline symptomatically to keep the
bacteria from big overgrowth, otherwise the symptoms become very intense with
time; if I would use 100 mg every day consistently, after about 2 - 3 weeks
the bacteria would be gone and so symptoms, but after a while they would come
back because of milk (I can't quit drinking milk; cheese from it doesn't seems
to cause problems). I boil raw milk in amounts of about 2.5 L and try to cool
it as quickly as I can (15 - 30 minutes to room temperature or below). The
milk has a strong specific smell after boiling, which increases with time as
well as the negative effect from milk, especially if it stays warm for longer.
My urine has the exact same smell. I recently started removing most fat from
milk before boiling and the milk seems to improve very much, I don't even
sense the smell anymore, but I don't know yet what effect it will have on the
bacterial overgrowth in the longer term.  
Don't you mind giving me your opinion on what is going on? Thank you!  
  
**RP:** [Feb 16, 2021]  
The quick reaction suggests that the bacteria are in your small intestine, and
that usually happens when the digestive processes are very slow and weak
because of hypothyroidism. Have you been checking your temperature? Have you
tried milk from different dairies? Contaminated pastures can give milk very
bad flavors.

Me: On your website in the article 'Iron's Dangers' you mentioned the benefits

**RP:** [Nov 20, 2019]  
I think it’s better to adjust the diet (instead of removing blood) so that it
contains only the amount of iron needed, and it happens that this is an
economical diet, with most of the protein coming from milk or cheese, and
using eggs to supply most of the iron needed.  
  
Me: To clarify this, if a person has high iron stores it would not be a good
idea to remove blood even every two month? (and just focus on diet?)

If the health is otherwise good, donating blood to reduce iron overload is
effective.

Joan J. Jefferys, 1 and Elizabeth C. Kimball# 1  
Marta Agudo-Barriuso, Editor  
  
Purpose  
  
To determine if oral losartan treatment decreases the retinal ganglion cell
(RGC) death caused by experimental intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in
mice.  
  
Methods  
  
We produced IOP increase in CD1 mice and performed unilateral optic nerve
crush. Mice received oral losartan, spironolactone, enalapril, or no drug to
test effects of inhibiting angiotensin receptors. IOP was monitored by
Tonolab, and blood pressure was monitored by tail cuff device. RGC loss was
measured in masked axon counts and RGC bodies by β-tubulin labeling. Scleral
changes that could modulate RGC injury were measured including axial length,
scleral thickness, and retinal layer thicknesses, pressure-strain behavior in
inflation testing, and study of angiotensin receptors and pathways by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and
immunohistochemistry.  
  
Results  
  
Losartan treatment prevented significant RGC loss (median loss = 2.5%, p =
0.13), while median loss with water, spironolactone, and enalapril treatments
were 26%, 28% and 43%; p < 0.0001). The lower RGC loss with losartan was
significantly less than the loss with spironolactone or enalapril (regression
model p = 0.001; drug treatment group term p = 0.01). Both losartan and
enalapril significantly lowered blood pressure (p< 0.001), but losartan was
protective, while enalapril led to worse than water-treated RGC loss. RGC loss
after crush injury was unaffected by losartan treatment (difference from
control p = 0.9). Survival of RGC in cell culture was not prolonged by sartan
treatment. Axonal transport blockade after 3 day IOP elevations was less in
losartan-treated than in control glaucoma eyes (p = 0.007). Losartan inhibited
effects of glaucoma, including reduction in extracellular signal-related
kinase activity and modification of glaucoma-related changes in scleral
thickness and creep under controlled IOP.  
  
Conclusions  
  
The neuroprotective effect of losartan in mouse glaucoma is associated with
adaptive changes in the sclera expressed at the optic nerve head.  
  
Go to:  
Introduction  
Glaucoma is the most common preventable cause of blindness worldwide [1], and
its damaging effects are known to be mediated through alterations at the optic
nerve head (ONH) produced by the action intraocular pressure (IOP) [2,3].
Engineering models of ocular tissues that describe IOP-induced effects show
that peripapillary sclera (PPS) behavior is important in determining the
effect of IOP on the ONH [4,5,6]. Risk factors for human glaucoma include
features related to scleral anatomy or physiology, including axial myopia,
corneal hysteresis, and corneal thickness [7]. In human glaucoma eyes the
sclera is stiffer by in vivo indirect measurement [8] and by in vitro
inflation testing [9], and undergoes alterations in PPS [ collagen
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-beef-grass-fed/)
fiber orientation [10].  
  
The sclera is substantially altered in experimental glaucoma in mice [11]
including axial elongation, increase in stiffness on inflation testing [12],
loss of non-fibrillar matrix [13] thickening and reorientation of collagenous
fiber layers, decreased scleral permeability [14], increased scleral
fibroblast activity and division, and increase in integrin-linked and actin-
cytoskeletal signaling by proteomic analysis [15]. Alterations in PPS affect
susceptibility to experimental glaucoma damage. Mice with a mutated connective
tissue gene for collagen 8α2 have larger eyes, with stiffer sclera at baseline
and they resist glaucoma injury more than do wild type C57BL/6 mice [16].
Increased scleral cross-linking by application of glyceraldehyde led to
increased retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in experimental mouse glaucoma
[17]. It is therefore likely that both the baseline state of the sclera and
its dynamic alteration could affect the manner in which IOP is translated into
a damaging stimulus in glaucoma.  
  
The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathways are activated in experimental
and human glaucoma in trabecular meshwork [18] and ONH [19,20]. Proteomic
analysis of sclera in mice with experimental glaucoma show >2-fold increases
in thrombospondins 1 and 4, known activators of TGFβ [15]. The selective
angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) inhibitor, losartan, suppresses Smad2
phosphorylation and TGFβ expression in its canonical pathway, as well as
inhibiting phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related (ERK) in a parallel
pathway. Blockade of AT1Rs increases AT2R activation, reducing TGFβ
stimulation [21]. Overactivity of TGFβ in the Marfan syndrome leads to aortic
dissection [22,23], and selective AT1R inhibition by losartan is beneficial in
mouse Marfan models and has entered clinical trials [24]. Candesartan, an AT1R
inhibitor, was reported to decrease RGC loss in experimental rat glaucoma with
oral dosing [25], no detailed studies were performed in that report to show
the mechanism by which the drug acted.  
  
We hypothesize that losartan-induced inhibition of TGFβ signaling in a mouse
model of glaucoma would alter RGC survival by modifying the scleral response
to chronically elevated IOP. Potential therapeutic alterations of the sclera
could supplement IOP-lowering therapy in human glaucoma by reducing IOP-
generated stress at the ONH [26].  
  
Me: What are your thoughts about yoga and meditation?  
  
Peat: Best when incorporated into regular activities.  
  
Me: [asked him about headaches that occur when backbending]  
  
Peat: Bacterial endotoxin creates a chronic inflammation and leakiness of
blood vessels, reducing stress tolerance.  
  
Me: [asked him what he thought would be a good career today]  
  
Peat: Teaching can be interesting as well as inoffensive.

Many of the foods with a lot of lutein have lots of other toxic components, so
avoiding them might be protective for reasons other than lutein.

increase my feeling of luck, but different substances and molecules interact
with seem to have varying effects. Psychedelic substances such as LSD,

My mother have Glioblastoma Giant Cells and waa given 2 months only to live.
She had surgery to remove 2 tumors but 1 tumor located in Cerebellum can't be
removed surgically. How I can treat her without the standard approach?  
  
**A:**  
"Acetazolamide, angiotensin blockers such as losartan, lidocaine, vitamin D, [
aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) ,
and naloxone all have anticancer effects without serious side-effects, and
they are inexpensive and available to any doctor..  
  
  
**Study Finds Acetazolamide May Be Effective in Treating Glioblastoma**  
July 22, 2018  
Alison Rodriguez  
Acetazolamide, sold under the trade name Diamox, is a drug used to treat
altitude sickness, glaucoma, epilepsy, heart failure, and seizures. According
to a new study, acetazolamide may also be effective in treating the fast-
growing brain tumor glioblastoma.  
Acetazolamide, sold under the trade name Diamox, is a drug used to treat
altitude sickness, glaucoma, epilepsy, heart failure, and seizures. According
to a new study, acetazolamide may also be effective in treating the fast-
growing brain tumor glioblastoma.  
The drug temozolomide (TMZ) is the most frequently used chemotherapy for
treating gliomas; however, not all patients respond to treatment with this
drug. TMZ damages DNA in a way that can kill tumor cells, but some tumor cells
can block or repair the DNA damage, according to a report.  
“Although alkylators like temozolomide (TMZ) improve overall patient survival,
many patients experience minimal benefit from their use. These observations
underline the critical need for predictors of response to alkylating therapy,”
the study explained.  
The study found that most patients with glioma who had high levels of the
protein BCL-3 (B cell CLL/lymphoma 3) were unresponsive to TMZ because BCL-3
shields cancer cells from the TMZ damage by activating the protective enzyme
called carbonic anhydrase II, according to the study.  
Although acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, it can restore TMZ’s
ability to kill the tumor cells. During the study, the researchers added
acetazolamide to TMZ , which enabled mice with gliomas to survive longer.
Additionally, when this combination treatment was used in several animal
models, it resulted in a 30% to 40% increase in survival time, noted the study
director Bahktiar Yamini, MD, a neurosurgery professor at the University of
Chicago Medicine.  
“This finding, when considered with the observation that BCL-3 is a candidate
oncoprotein that has never been identified as a glioma driver, indicates that
BCL3 loss is a passenger event unrelated to glioma formation,” the researchers
stated. “Although the ability of passenger events to promote unintended
therapeutic susceptibility has been shown in animal models, the link between
loss of BCL-3 and TMZ susceptibility demonstrates the importance of passenger
modification to chemosensitivity in a clinical setting.”  
Furthermore, when the researchers looked back at previous human studies, they
discovered that patients with lower levels of BCL-3 who were treated with TMZ
had, overall, survived longer than those who had high levels of the biomarker.  
The authors emphasized that, in the future, a prospective randomized clinical
trial is necessary in order to validate that the use of BCL-3 to predict which
patients will benefit from TMZ. They also suggested that the combination of
acetazolamide with TMZ may be an effective subgroup to consider for the trial
for patients with high BCL-3 expression.

(TRPM7) channels resulted in significant decrease of human glioma cell growth
and proliferation. As local anesthetic lidocaine has been shown to inhibit
TRPM7 currents, we hypothesize that lidocaine may suppress glioma cell
proliferation through TRPM7 channel inhibition. Methods: TRPM7 currents were
recorded in rat C6 glioma cells using the whole cell patch clamp technique.
Cell growth and proliferation were assessed under microscopic examination and
biochemical assays. Results: Lidocaine inhibits TRPM7-like currents in a dose-
dependent and reversible manner. At 1 and 3 mM, it inhibits ~30% and ~50% of
TRPM7 currents. At these concentrations, it is effective in inhibiting the
proliferation of C6 cells. As expected, the TRPM7 inhibitors gadolinium and
2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate have similar effects on TRPM7 currents and
proliferation of C6 cells. Similar to its effect on C6 cells, lidocaine
inhibits the proliferation of A172 cells, a human glioblastoma cell line.
Conclusions: Lidocaine significantly inhibits the proliferation of glioma
cells. The effect of lidocaine is mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting
TRPM7 channels.  
Introduction  
Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor with devastating
prognosis [1]. Maximal resection is essential for the treatment but surgery
itself is a risk factor for recurrence [2]. Recurrence of malignant glioma
following surgery is very high with few preventive and therapeutic options.
One major advance over last two decades is the development of temozolomide
that increased the survival time only by about 2.6 months after surgery when
adding to radiotherapy [3,4]. Even so, around 70% malignant glioma is not
responsive to temozolomide [5]. Therefore, it is hoped that potential new
targets and drugs are able to reduce the growth and proliferation of glioma
cells and increase the survival rate of cancer patients.  
The melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 (TRPM7) is a member of TRPM
family mediating the entry of Ca2+ and Mg2+ [6]. High expression of TRPM7 has
been found in a number of human cancer tissue and cell lines, including head
and neck cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and pancreatic
cancer [7-11]. TRPM7 plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of
Ca2+ and Mg2+ in cancer cells regulating the cell function and cycle [12].
Thus it appears to be an attractive target to suppress the cancer cell
proliferation and potentially reduce the recurrence of cancer. Our previous
studies have demonstrated that TRPM7 play an important role in the
proliferation, migration and invasion of human malignant glioma cells [13],
suggesting that TRPM7 might serve as a promising target for malignant glioma
treatment.  
Lidocaine is a widely used local anesthetic that can be administered to local
or regional tissue, epidural or intrathecal space to induce nerve conduction
block. It has been shown that lidocaine is neuroprotective against ischemia
[14] and Zn2+ induced neurotoxicity [15]. Lidocaine is the only local
anesthetic that can be administered intravenously. Intravenous infusion of
lidocaine has been found safe and effective in reducing postoperative ileus
and pain following colon resection [16]. We have found that lidocaine inhibits
TRPM7 currents in HEK293 cells and cultured neurons [15]. A safe and
beneficial profile of lidocaine makes it attractive to test its potential
effect on cancer cell biology. In the current study, we demonstrated that
lidocaine inhibits the proliferation of malignant glioma cells at least in
part, by inhibiting TRPM7 channel currents.

Dear Dr Raymond Peat,  
  
The caines like Lidocaine can reverse epigenetic changes/demethylate?  
Could it possibly prevent reverse transcription of the mRNA when injected like
Neural therapy (you have talked about)?  
  
When I take a solution of lidocaine in an enteric capsule and it thus reaches
the small intestine, would it have different effects, e.g. on SIBO?  
Thanks  
  
Ray: I had constantly bleeding colitis for more than a year, and when I took
about 20 to 30 mg of lidocaine (in a 2% solution meant for oral, dental use)
the symptoms stopped and haven’t returned in more than 30 years

**Q:** I have tried corn tortillas from nixtamalized corn yesterday. For the
first time. I ate like 5 or 6 of them and suffered with horrible stomach
cramps after . Today I had a couple of bowel movements and feel surprisingly
fine.  
Now I'm not sure if I should continue eating them or not .  
Maybe it was detox reaction ,maybe it doesnt agree with my body...  
Do you have any insights on that or what I could do ?  
  
**A** :It was probably just that your stomach didn’t expect it; they are more
nutritious than things like bread and pasta."  
  
  
**Q:** I've read from several people that theres supposedly all kind of
mycotoxins a couple hours after the preparation of the nixtamalized corn
tortillas .  
Do you think that is concerning?  
  
**A:** Only if you have moldy corn, and the alkali cooking removes much of
that, which is drained off. Wheat flour is often contaminated with mycotoxins,
so it would probably be good to nixtamalize wheat.  
  
Toxins (Basel). 2019 Apr; 11(4): 227.  
Mycotoxins during the Processes of Nixtamalization and Tortilla Production  
Sara Schaarschmidt* and Carsten Fauhl-Hassek  
Tortillas are a traditional staple food in Mesoamerican cuisine, which have
also become popular on a global level, e.g., for wraps or as snacks ( [
tortilla chips ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/masa-tortilla-chips/) ).
Traditional tortilla production includes alkaline cooking (nixtamalization) of
maize kernels. This article summarizes the current knowledge on mycotoxin
changes during the nixtamalization of maize and tortilla production. Upon
nixtamalization, mycotoxins can be affected in different ways. On the one
hand, the toxins can be physically removed during steeping and washing. On the
other hand, mycotoxins might be degraded, modified, or released/bound in the
matrix by high pH and/or high temperature. This also applies to the subsequent
baking of tortillas. Many studies have shown reduced mycotoxin levels in
alkali-cooked maize and in tortillas. Most of the available data relate to
aflatoxins and fumonisins. The reduction (and detoxification) of aflatoxins
during nixtamalization might, however, be partially reversed in acidic
conditions. The loss of fumonisin concentrations is to some extent accompanied
by hydrolyzation and by lower toxicity. However, some studies have indicated
the potential formation of toxicologically relevant modified forms and matrix-
associated fumonisins. More data are required to assess the influence of
alkaline cooking regarding such modified forms, as well as mycotoxins other
than aflatoxins/fumonisin

About vaccine shedding, and the risk to those non-vaccinated:  
  
  
  
Ray:  
Our own DNA and RNA, proteins, exosomes, etc., are constantly being shed into
our environment, so it seems extremely likely that any foreign DNA, RNA, and
protein that’s in our blood will appear in our breath, sweat, urine, etc.
Pfizer understood that, as indicated in this document. When people started
worrying about it, a Pfizer representative said that the document doesn’t mean
what it says.  
Most people aren’t harmed by the corona virus, so the similar material coming
from vaccinated people is likely to be equally harmless. The long range
effects that might result from our incorporation of the gene that produces the
spike protein would be likely to include inflammation, that would only become
a serious problem when our resistance was lowered, by sickness or aging.
Prolonged inflammation is carcinogenic, and our ACE2 enzyme (which is
inactivated by the spike protein), is one of our protective anti-cancer
factors (articles below).  
Ideally, vaccinated people would be quarantined until they could show that
they weren’t shedding the harmful material, but the govenments aren’t behaving
rationally.

8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure  
Exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or
breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within
24 hours of investigator awareness.  
8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy  
An EDP occurs if:  

  * A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention. 
  * A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception. 
  * A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy: 

• A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant
after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin
contact.  
Page 67  
PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001  
• A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the
study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female
partner prior to or around the time of conception.  
The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the
investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The
initial information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery
(see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).  

  * If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant’s partner, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the Vaccine SAE Report Form and an EDP Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the pregnancy will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 6 months after the last dose of study intervention. 
  * If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the Vaccine SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file.   
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its
outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will
follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and
notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP
Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of
the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a
termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if
clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should
be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are
conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the
pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous
abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly),
the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional
information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as
SAEs follows:

  * Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion; 
  * Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention.

PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001  
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor.
Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis
(eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the
case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with
the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.
The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant
was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his
partner.  
8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding  
An exposure during breastfeeding occurs if:  

  * A female participant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention. 
  * A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.   
The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to Pfizer Safety
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an
SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE
Report Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of
environmental exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the
participant enrolled in the study, so the information is not recorded on a
CRF. However, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in
the investigator site file.  
An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug
specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is
administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences
an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the
exposure during breastfeeding.  
8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure  
An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct
contact with the study intervention, which may or may not lead to the
occurrence of an AE. Such persons may include healthcare providers, family
members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care.  
The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safety within 24
hours of the investigator’s awareness, regardless of whether there is an
associated SAE. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Report
Form. Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the
study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the
completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file.

**SARS-CoV-2 RNA reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome**  
Liguo Zhang, Alexsia Richards, Andrew Khalil, Emile Wogram, Haiting Ma,
Richard A Young, Rudolf Jaenisch  
Abstract  
Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have
been widely reported in patients after recovery, yet these patients most
commonly are non-infectious. Here we investigated the possibility that SARS-
CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome and
that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for PCR-positive
tests. In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting
of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2
infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the
transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally
corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence
that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse
transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA
sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be
transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2
infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular
mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients. This novel feature of
SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain why patients can continue to produce viral
RNA after recovery and suggests a new aspect of RNA virus replication.  
  
from Wikipedia:  
In cellular life  
Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons
utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to
another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of
plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many
eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is
used as a template for DNA replication.[15]  
Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as
1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the
USSR (Romashchenko 1977[16]). These have since been broadly described as part
of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase,
and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA,
a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during
replication.[17]  
Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity,
have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with
reverse transcriptase playing a central role.[18]

Overexpression of ACE2 produces antitumor effects via inhibition of
angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion in vivo and in vitro  
Yun Feng 1 , Lei Ni, Huanying Wan, Liang Fan, Xiaochun Fei, Qinyun Ma, Beili
Gao, Yi Xiang, Jiaming Che, Qingyun Li  
Angiotensin II (AngII) is a multifunctional bioactive peptide in the renin-
angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a newly
identified component of RAS. The role of AngII and ACE2 in the metastasis of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the effects on matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) are still unknown. In the present study, the anti-
invasive effect and mechanism of ACE2 were investigated in vitro and in vivo.
Results of a transwell assay showed that the overexpression of ACE2 reduces
the invasive ability of A549 cells in vitro. According to the results of qRT-
PCR and western blot analysis, the inhibitory role of ACE2 was mediated
through the down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Additionally, we confirmed
that the overexpression of ACE2 inhibited cell growth and VEGFa production
while simultaneously suppressing ACE and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)
expression in human lung cancer xenografts. These results suggest that the
overexpression of ACE2 may potentially suppress the invasion and angiogenesis
of NSCLC.

Abstract  
Background: Breast cancer angiogenesis is key for metastasis and predicts a
poor prognosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a member of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS), was reported to restrain the progression of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through
inhibiting angiogenesis. However, the relationship between ACE2 and breast
cancer angiogenesis remains unclear.  
Methods: The prognosis and relative gene selection were analysed using the
GEPIA, GEO, TCGA and STRING databases. ACE2 expression in breast cancer tissue
was estimated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR). Breast cancer cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis were
assessed by Transwell migration, proliferation, tube formation, and wound
healing assays. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFa)
was detected by qPCR and Western blotting. The phosphorylation of vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), mitogen-activated protein
kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2) was examined by Western blotting. Breast cancer metastasis and
angiogenesis in vivo were measured using a zebrafish model.  
Results: ACE2 was downregulated in breast cancer patients. Patients with
higher ACE2 expression had longer relapse-free survival (RFS). In vitro, ACE2
inhibited breast cancer migration. Meanwhile, ACE2 in breast cancer cells
inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation,
tube formation and migration. In the zebrafish model, ACE2 inhibited breast
cancer cell metastasis, as demonstrated by analyses of the number of
disseminated foci and the metastatic distance. Neo-angiogenesis was also
decreased by ACE2. ACE2 downregulated the expression of VEGFa in breast cancer
cells. Furthermore, ACE2 in breast cancer cells inactivated the
phosphorylation of VEGFR2, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 in HUVECs.  
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ACE2, as a potential resister to breast
cancer, might inhibit breast cancer angiogenesis through the VEGFa/VEGFR2/ERK
pathway.

Decreased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma is associated with tumor progression  
Lin Zhou 1 , Ruifeng Zhang, Weiyan Yao, Jiancheng Wang, Aihua Qian, Minmin
Qiao, Yongping Zhang, Yaozong Yuan  
Free article  
Angiotensin II (ANG II), the biologically active peptide of the renin-
angiotensin system (RAS), is generated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
and is a regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis. Recently, there has been
increasing evidence that ANG II is involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation and migration, as well as angiogenesis via the ANG II-type 1
receptor (AT1R). These findings suggest that the ACE-ANG II-AT1R pathway is
related to cancer biology. Previous reports have shown that ACE is
preferentially expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues.
Recently a homologue of ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was
reported to counterbalance the function of ACE, but the expression and role of
ACE2 in PDAC are still unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the
expression of ACE2 in invasive human PDAC and surrounding non-malignant
tissues by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The ANG II
concentration in homogenates of pancreatic tissues was measured with ELISA,
and ACE2 protein was detected by Western blot analysis in BxPC3 and SW1990
human pancreatic ductal cancer cells. We have shown for the first time that
the expression of ACE2 is decreased in PDAC tissues, in which ANG II was
accumulated. Treatment of BxPC3 and SW1990 cells with ANG II decreased the
expression of ACE2. Therefore, ANG II may contribute to the down-regulation of
ACE2. Moreover, reduction of ACE2 expression by RNA interference promoted the
proliferation of cultured pancreatic cancer cells. These findings suggest that
ACE2 may have clinical potential as a novel molecular target for the treatment
of PDAC.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in tumor growth and tumor-associated
angiogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer  
Yun Feng 1 , Huanying Wan, Jialin Liu, Ruifeng Zhang, Qinyun Ma, Bing Han, Yi
Xiang, Jiaming Che, Huangming Cao, Xiaochun Fei, Weicheng Qiu  
Angiotensin II (AngII) is a multifunctional bioactive peptide and previous
studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) of both host and
tumor are important in tumor growth and angiogenesis in lung cancer.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a newly identified component of RAS,
with 42% amino acid homology to ACE. However, the expression and function of
ACE2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still unclear. In the present
study, we analyzed ACE2 expression in NSCLC tissue by Western blot analysis
and immunohistochemistry. AngII concentrations in the tissue homogenate were
also detected using radio-immunoassay. We also examined the function of ACE2
by transducing A549 cells with MSCV-ACE2. We have shown for the first time
that ACE2 expression decreased in NSCLC tissue in which AngII was higher than
the matching non-malignant tissues. A concentration of 10(-6) mol/l of AngII
significantly increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor a
(VEGFa) and AT1-R and decreased ACE2 expression. We also found that
overexpression of ACE2 may have a protective effect by inhibiting cell growth
and VEGFa production in vitro. ACE2 may become a target of novel strategies to
treat NSCLC.

ACE2 overexpression inhibits acquired platinum resistance-induced tumor
angiogenesis in NSCLC

, Yun Feng 1  
Angiotensin II (AngII) is a multifunctional bioactive peptide in the renin-
angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a newly
identified component of RAS. We previously reported that ACE2 overexpression
may inhibit cell growth and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
production in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the
effect of ACE2 on tumor-associated angiogen-esis after the development of
acquired platinum resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Four NSCLC
cell lines, A549, LLC, A549-DDP and LLC-DDP, were used in vitro, while A549
and A549-DDP cells were used in vivo. A549-DDP and LLC-DDP cells were newly
established at our institution as acquired platinum-resistant sublines by
culturing the former parent cells in cisplatin (CDDP)-containing conditioned
medium for 6 months. These platinum-resistant cells showed significantly
higher angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), ACE and VEGF production and
lower ACE2 expression than their corresponding parent cells. We showed that
ACE2 overexpression inhibited the production of VEGF in vitro and in vivo
compared to their corresponding parent cells. We also found that ACE2
overexpression reduced the expression of AT1R and ACE. Additionally, we
confirmed that ACE2 overexpres-sion inhibited cell growth and VEGF production
while simultaneously suppressing ACE and AT1R expression in human lung cancer
xenografts. Our findings indicate that ACE2 overexpression may potentially
suppress angiogenesis in NSCLC after the development of acquired platinum
resistance.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 attenuates the metastasis of non-small cell
lung cancer through inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition  
Yan-Rong Qian 1 , Yi Guo, Huan-Ying Wan, Liang Fan, Yun Feng, Lei Ni, Yi
Xiang, Qing-Yun Li  
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key enzyme of the renin-
angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 plays a critical counterbalancing role by
degrading angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang 1-7. Recent studies suggest that RAS
influences tumor growth and development by its paracrine effects on the tumor
microenvironment. Epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) is now thought to be
a process that plays a fundamental role in tumor progression and metastasis.
In the present study, we investigated the role of ACE2 in lung cancer
metastasis and the mechanism of EMT. This is the first study to elucidate the
mechanism through which the overexpression of ACE2 in the A549 lung cancer
cell line decreases metastasis formation in vivo and upregulates the
expression of E-cadherin both in vitro and in vivo. We also observed the
downregulation of vimentin, which supports a role of ACE2 in influencing EMT
in lung cancer. Further analysis indicated that ACE2 abrogated the
upregulation of TGF-β1-induced EMT markers, such as vimentin and α-smooth
muscle actin (αSMA) in vitro in A549 cells. Finally, exposing A549 cells
stably expressing ACE2 to DX600, an inhibitor of ACE2, recovered the
sensitivity of lung cancer cells to TGF-β1-mediated induction of EMT. Our
study demonstrated that ACE2 attenuated the metastasis of lung cancer and may
serve as a target for new strategies to inhibit EMT in cancer cells.

Roles for host and tumor angiotensin II type 1 receptor in tumor growth and
tumor-associated angiogenesis  
Nozomi Imai 1 , Tatsuo Hashimoto, Minoru Kihara, Shin-ichiro Yoshida, Ichiro
Kawana, Takuya Yazawa, Hitoshi Kitamura, Satoshi Umemura  
Angiotensin II (AII) is a multifunctional bioactive peptide, and host renin-
angiotensin system (RAS) is closely associated with tumor growth. Recent
reports have described that AII is a proangiogenic growth factor, and that
Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists reduce tumor growth and
tumor-associated angiogenesis. In this paper, we investigated the
participation of AT1 receptor-signaling in cancer progression using murine
Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, which express AT1 receptor, and AT1a
receptor gene-deficient (AT1a-/-) mice. When LLC cells were implanted
subcutaneously into wild-type (WT) mice, developed tumors showed intensive
angiogenesis with an induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) a.
Compared with WT mice, tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis was
reduced in AT1a-/- mice with reduced expression of VEGFa. In AT1a-/- mice,
administration of the AT1 receptor antagonist, TCV-116, showed further
reductions of tumor growth, tumor-associated angiogenesis, and VEGFa
expression. In vitro study, the expression of VEGFa mRNA and the production of
VEGFa protein in LLC cells were significantly increased by AII, which were
cancelled by AT1 receptor antagonist, CV-11974. Although the expression of
other angiogenic factors, such as angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, epidermal
growth factor, and VEGF receptor 2 mRNA, was also investigated in tumor
tissues, the expression of VEGFa was most correlated with tumor size among
those other angiogenic factors. VEGFa induction by AT1 receptor-signaling in
both host and tumor tissues is one of key regulators of tumor growth and
tumor-associated angiogenesis. In conclusion, tumor tissue RAS as well as host
tissue RAS were found to have an important role in tumor growth. AT1 receptor-
signaling blockade may be a novel and effective target in the treatment of
cancer.

If one had to get one of the vaccines ...  
  
Q: If one and had to take one of the vaccines, which is the least harmful? My
guess : Sputnik or AstraZeneca?  
  
A:  
I think both of those include the code for the spike protein, which is the
unpredictably dangerous component. As I understand it, Sinovac induces
antibodies to the viral substance, in the traditional vaccine manner. This
suggests that it is what has always been meant by “vaccine,” while the others
are something other than vaccines—gene therapy is a more accurate term. I
think people should assimilate the messages of Reiner Fuellmich and Michael
Yeadon, at least, before making decisions.  
  

##  How does the Sinovac vaccine work?​

The Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac is behind the CoronaVac,
an inactivated vaccine.  
It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to
the virus without risking a serious disease response.  
By comparison the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines being developed in the West are
mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected
into the body, triggering the body to begin making viral proteins, but not the
whole virus, which is enough to train the immune system to attack.  
"CoronaVac is a more traditional method [of vaccine] that is successfully used
in many well known vaccines like rabies," Associate Prof Luo Dahai of the
Nanyang Technological University told the BBC.  
  
"mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine and there is [currently] no
successful example [of them] being used in the population," Prof Luo adds.

"According to that description, it should be no more harmful than any

injection of nucleic acids specifying the spike protein—which has no rational
basis in science. Intramuscular aluminum hydroxide is always harmful to some
degree, and is based on ignorance of the nature of biological disease
resistance."

The guy just says the things that seem reasonable to an organic chemist.
Sucharit Bhakdi has pointed out that the spike protein, expressed on the
surface of an endothelial cell, activates inflammatory immune and clotting
reactions, leading to clotting and bleeding problems, CVT and DIC. The
subtleties of the immune system, such as exosomes assimilating viral nucleic
acids and disseminating them the way viruses do, or the axonal retrograde
transport of intramuscularly injected substances, don’t fit into institutional
science.

Q:  
1\. Have you ever heard of someone improving their hearing - specifically
people who are experiencing hearing loss?  
  
2\. Why do the fried/heated fats (no matter which ones - coconut, olive,
butter etc) give me eczema, dry skin and scalp as well as some blood sugars
dysregulation while "raw" fats have no problems?  
EXAMPLE: If I cook steak or meat on a grill or use an oven I have 0 issues and
If I add some fats to it, or fry in a pan I get all of these skin issues? Are
they harder on the liver or is there something else which I'm missing!  
  
RP:  
Do you supplement vitamin D and get enough calcium in your diet relative to
phosphate? Heated fats are more irritating, and the intestine is exaggeratedly
sensitive if vitamin D, calcium, and thyroid are low.  
  
Some people experience improved hearing when they move to a high altitude; I
think it has to do with improved circulation.  
  
People going to a high altitude, e.g., 6500 feet or more, sometimes notice
improved hearing. Adapting to altitude increases the CO2 retained in the body,
improving capillary circulation. The drug acetazolamide increases CO2, and can
have similar effects. Thyroid and vitamin D, caffeine and [ thiamine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b1-powder-thiamine-hcl-usp-grade/)
can help to maintain CO2 levels.  
  
Am J Otol. 1989 Mar;10(2):142-5.  
Long-term effect of acetazolamide and chlorthalidone on the hearing loss of
Menière's disease  
J Corvera 1, G Corvera  
Abstract  
A retrospective computerized analysis of the records of patients with
Meniere's disease was made to evaluate the effect of acetazolamide and
chlorthalidone on the rate of hearing loss. Three groups were compared as
follows: (1) 79 patients treated with chlorthalidone for 5 to 13.4 years; (2)
42 patients medicated with acetazolamide between 5 and 7.8 years; and (3) a
control group of 71 patients who received only intermittent symptomatic
treatment for vertigo, followed for 5 to 24.1 years. In the short term, after
2 to 6 weeks of treatment, a statistically significant decrease of the average
hearing loss was observed with both chlorthalidone and acetazolamide. In the
long term, more than 5 years, no preventive effect on the deterioration of the
hearing loss could be detected. Both acetazolamide and chlorthalidone can be
useful for diagnostic purposes by causing a fluctuation of hearing, as well as
for the management of the vertigo attacks, but it is not useful for the long-
term prevention of the hearing deterioration in Meniere's disease.  
  
Q: Also there is a study stating that higher altitudes and hypoxia states can
cause deafness and hearing problems.  
  

###  [ Influence of high-altitude hypoxic environments on the survival of
cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in rats
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5228326/)

The aim of the present study was to observe the histological changes in the
peripheral auditory system in rats at different time-points after relocating
from low altitude to high altitude (3,600 m). The general physical condition
of the rats was observed ...

www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  
"Ischemia and hypoxia in the inner ear are the main factors leading to sudden
deafness, acute acoustic trauma and presbycusis. An animal experimental study
confirmed that cochlear tissues were particularly sensitive to hypoxia, and
cochlear compound action potential and endocochlear potential disappeared
after only 8 sec of cochlear hypoxia (1). In addition, in vitro experiments on
organ cultures of the cochlea found that hypoxia causes cochlear hair cell
(HC) loss and neuronal death (2,3). The mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced
inner ear damage are not clear."  
  
  
RP: That’s when the change is so extreme that adaptation doesn’t happen. When
climbers on Mt. Everest were suffering such symptoms, and dementia, breathing
CO2 corrected the problem.  
  
_____________________________________________________________  
  
Q:Will breathing in the bag by increasing CO2 also improve circulation? What
are the best ways that you know of that can improve one's circulation?  
  
RP:  
Yes, the bag breathing can make your skin noticeably pinker, and lower blood
pressure. Calcium, vitamin D, thyroid, and [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) are things
that help capillaries.

Q: Asked Ray about a random list of supplements  
**A: Some chemicals that are very important metabolically can be disruptive
when they are taken orally in inappropriate forms or combinations or amounts.
For example, free ionic copper taken with food can degrade vitamins and amino
acids. PQQ is probably safe, but I think much more research is needed to be
sure. Most vitamin E products contain small amounts of potentially harmful
impurities. The amount of aspartate in a tablet of magnesium aspartate is
harmless, but it’s good to be cautious; I knew someone who began having daily
seizures when he used large amounts of magnesium and calcium aspartate; his
daily seizures continued for four months, and stopped the day after he
discontinuted the supplements. I think there’s a risk of methyl imbalance when
large amounts of betaine are used chronically.**  
  
Q: Hello, tocotrienols are unsaturated, but vitamin A is as well. I wonder if
they could be helpful?  
**A: A small amount of tocotrienol contributes to the protective vitamin E
action.**  
  
Q: Which milk brand do you prefer using Mr Peat? someone said that your
favorite milk brand was discontinued. I'm wondering how they even found out
your favorite milk brand!  
**A: At the beginning of the panic, they disappeared, but they all came back
to some degree. Kirkland and Lucerne are two good brands in the pacific
northwest.  
^(Disclaimer on above this was last year before Peat knew about the
emulsifiers/fillers in milk. I'm also unsure if he knows about the production
processes of the above milks or is going by taste as I think those brands are
non organic, not sure if Peat cares about certified organic milk) **  
  
Q: Do you think 1mg boron every other day is beneficial. Studies seem to show
pro estrogen effects yet some studies show pro testosterone effects and yet
some show pro DHT effects... the medical people are deciding whether boron is
an essential nutrient but boron and vanadium are already being included in
several multivitamin products.  
Vanadium supposedly mimics insulin? Also what about ashwaganda? Supposedly
boosts thyroid and lowers cortisol. Guggul and coleus forskoli also seem
interesting.  
**A: I don’t think there’s good science supporting boron; vanadium is probably
safe in very small amounts. I think forskilin can be dangerous, creating
stress reactions.**  
  
Q: 50mg of [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) supplementation (capsule form, no ingredients in capsule
besides cellulose), caused 12 pounds weight gain in 10 days. This weight gain
did not subside or go away even after the pregnenolone was stopped for months.
All the symptoms from the pregnenolone supplementation matched high cortisol
symptoms. The pregnenolone seemed to be converting entirely to cortisol and
estrogen. I believe you mentioned pregnenolone doesn't have side effects but I
think the studies you mentioned regarding it were done on healthy younger men,
so they would likely be converting pregnenolone into the correct androgenic
hormones whereas someone who has poor thyroid function likely converts the
pregnenolone directly to stress hormones and estrogen?  
**A: There is some real junk being sold as pregnenolone, what brand was it?
Real pregnenolone protects against increased cortisol, lowers cortisol it it’s
abnormally high. It can lower estrogen too.**  
  
Q: How does [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-
aspirin/) impact muscle growth and muscle mass? there are lots of bodybuilders
who have attempted to use T3 for fat burning/weight loss purposes. Many of
them have advised to keep T3 doses extremely low because T3 leads to both
muscle burning and wasting and fat loss, apparently T3 does not differentiate
between burning muscle or fat.  
What about aspirin, does aspirin also target both muscle and fat mass for
fuel. since it inhibits lipolysis does that mean aspirin and [ niacinamide
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b3-niacinamide-powder-usp-grade/)
preserve fat mass while burning muscle and sugar?  
**A: Aspirin and T3 activate oxidative energy production, but they have to be
used at a “physiological” level, which varies situationally; it’s usually
around 3 mcg/hour, and bodybuilders habitually use crazy amounts.**  
  
Q: What are your thoughts on supplementing freeze dried thyroid gland, liver
testicle and other beef organs, deer antler velvet extract, freeze dried
oyster, krill oil, nigella sativa oil  
**A: I prefer, for sanitation, standard desiccated thyroid. Other dehydrated
substances often contain lipid peroxides and tryptophan decomposition
products.**  
  
Q: vitamin E stimulates the immune system and triggers autoimmune conditions,
should intake be limited?  
**A: Someone just has the facts mixed up. Injecting foreign material
intramuscularly damages the nervous and immune systems; many chemically active
lipids have similar effects. Entering the body as a nutrient, vitamin E is
antiinflammatory.**  
  
Q: these people had autoimmune conditions and said their conditions
experienced flareups in response to vitamin E usage. People have had extreme
immune flareups from the herb ashwagandha, from [ dhea
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) , from
7 keto dhea, from pregnenolone, from higher doses of vitamin MK4 ,from iodine,
and from things like yohimbe bark, Pau D arco bark, and pine bark
extract/pycnogenol.  
**A: I don’t know of any wheat germ based vitamin E that doesn’t contain toxic
amounts of polyunsaturated fats. Bacteria, fungi, and viruses stimulate the
immune system; most of the published statements about stimulating the immune
system are dangerous nonsense.**  
  
Q: You used to use a wheat germ vitamin E, wasnt that with polyunsaturated
fats? What source of vitamim C did you use? How do you explain people having
severe autoimmune responses in response to consuming some of these substances
like pregnenolone or ashwagandha or vitamin e or vitamin K  
**A: I wrote about the polycosanol in the old vitamin E from wheat germ, but I
didn’t use it myself, it had been discontinued for a long time before I got
interested in it. My first experience with[ vitamin C
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) was when it was
called cevitamic acid, and the largest tablets available were 50 milligrams.
Three years later, a new method for making vitamin C very cheaply led to 500
mg tablets becoming common. Remembering my amazing first experience with 50
mg/day, I took 500 mg, and the next morning had a sore throat and cough. That
eventually led to finding, when I was working at a clinic in Eugene, that
nearly all the people I saw with chronic “allergy” lost all their symptoms
when they stopped their supplements. I think vitamins A and E were the last of
the regular supplements that I used, and that was around 1972. I started using
pregnenolone from Sigma Chemical, then got it by the kilogram from the Syntex
factory in Mexico. When they stopped making it, I got a few kilos from
European companies, but when they stopped making it, I found that pregnenolone
from other sources produced hormonal effects that shouldn’t be pregnenolone,
so I stopped using it; that was some time in the ‘90s. Pure pregnenolone never
produced hormonal effects in either human or animal studies. Minor producers
don’t have the resources of the giants to produce extreme purity. **  
  
Q: Hello Ray! What kind of foods do you like to eat out, which restaurants do
you eat out at regularly  
**A: I haven’t eaten in a restaurant since 1984. Restaurants have always been
notoriously unsafe places to eat, but in the age of food chemistry it has
become impractical to try to identify trustworthy places.**  
  
Q: Do you know what the original 50mg vitamin C was sourced from. Most vitamin
C is sourced from corn and fungus or mold. There are some manufacturers
selling vitamin C extracted from berries, these capsules come in much smaller
sizes of 80mg each and are extracted from amla berry acerola cherry other
berries. These berry vitamin Cs are referred to as whole food vitamin C and
are much more expensive  
**A: The vitamin C products “from natural sources” that I’ve seen contained
ascorbic acid and dried plant material.  
(^Disclaimer I think there are some products which use an actual freeze dried
acerola cherry or amla berry mixture, which is very low like 80mg vitamin C
per capsule. im not sure Ray is aware of these as theres only a few companies
making these) **  
  
Q: Do you think bread is harmful in general. Like a burger a few times a week,
would there be significant health effects involved due to the bun? Its the
typical enriched white flour brioche bun.  
**A: Most people tolerate it very well.  
(^Disclaimer I'm not sure if Ray is aware as there's all kinds of filler
ingredients and inflammatory things in many processed bread buns these days)
**  
  
Q: Mr Peat, I was also wondering, how come you never show your face/video call
during your youtube podcasts/interviews?  
Also, do you think masturbating to pornography would increase
estrogen/cortisol and have harmful physical side effects that you do not get
from sex with a live partner? or is masturbation and watching naked women a
non factor when it comes to physical health?  
**A: My computer doesn’t have a camera or microphone; I use a landline phone;
the constant technological up-dates and innovations are doing more harm than
good. Just thinking about, anticipating, sex increases testosterone, makes the
whiskers grow faster; general good health keeps the increased testosterone
from increasing estrogen and cortisol.**  
  
Q: does milk in the us provide an excess of the nutrients vitamin A, [
molybdenum ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/molybdenum-liquid/) , and more  
**A: No. Occasionally, phobic ideas about nutrients circulate, including
places like the raypeatforum, and milk phobia seems to be a chronic cultural
problem.**  
  
Q: Also, do you think masturbating to pornography would increase
estrogen/cortisol and have harmful physical side effects that you do not get
from sex with a live partner? or is masturbation and watching naked women a
non factor when it comes to physical health?  
**A: Ordinarily, just thinking about, anticipating, sex increases testosterone
and well being, but in a stressed hypothyroid person it’s possible that the
testosterone produced by sexual arousal could be converted to estrogen.  
(^I asked him this question again as I was hoping to get a more specific
answer comparing sex with a partner to masturbation. it seems he did address
it) **  
  
Q: Does masturbation cause negative hormonal effects that you wouldnt get from
sex with a partner? or is it the same hormonally as long as youre thinking
about sex while masturbating?  
also sir, what are your thoughts on supplementing with amino acids such as [
creatine ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/creatine-monohydrate-creapure/) ,
beta alanine, [ taurine ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/ajinomoto-taurine-
usp-grade/) , [ glycine ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/glycine-powder-
usp-grade/) ? some claim beta alanine has anti diabetic effects, that creatine
supplementation powerboosts the mitochondria and boosts mitochondrial
function, that taurine helps excrete fluoride/maintain thyroid function in
presence of fluoride, that glycine reduces tryptophan and serotonin.  
but isnt it also risky supplementing individual amino acids as they could
cause an imbalance in other amino acids, or other vitamins or minerals? isnt
there always a risk to supplementing amino acids  
**A: It would be more helpful to read some physiology books instead of the
internet. Almost everything there is exploitative, insane, stupid, or a blend
of those.**  
  
Q: Mr Peat how much milk do you drink a day? which brand and style of milk do
you use?  
do you stick to whole milk only now? apparently the whole milk, has much less
additives than other milks. perhaps because most whole milks only have vitamin
d3 added instead of vitamin A and D. that synthetic vitamin A may be very
harmful compared to natural vitamin A from milk and liver. vitamin D3
supplements are supposedly just made from sheep cholesterol exposed to UV
light.  
Mr Peat, how does lactose as a sugar compare to glucose and sucrose? do you
think lactose is a superior sugar to glucose and sucrose. does it burn off
easier etc.  
**A: I get it directly from farmers who don’t treat it, and then I skim it
because I don’t want so much fat. Lactose promotes the absorption of calcium
and probably other nutrients.**  
  
Q: Thats incredible mr Peat! do you care if the milk from your farmers is
grass fed, non gmo, organic etc?  
do you pasteurize the milk yourself or do you essentially drink a raw skim
milk product?  
thats incredible. do you think pasteurized, organic whole milk purchased from
a grocery store is not safe?  
**A: The organic milk I have had from various supermarkets, supposedly
reliable brands, has often had an unpleasant taste and soured quickly, even
when pasteurized, which I think indicates poor feeding and milking techniques.
Sanitary milking practices and good feed—combined hay and pasture—produce
clean milk with a good taste that doesn’t need pasteurization. I often heat
the milk to speed separation of the cream.**  
  
Q: mr Peat how much milk do you drink per day? do you think casein proteins
are superior to whey proteins? or are both proteins equally valuable?  
**A: I have averaged two quarts a day for a long time. The method of
separating whey from casein determines how much calcium each has; neither by
itself is as good.**  
  
Q: So Mr. Peat how do you get in 180 grams of protein per day since that milk
only provides 64 grams of protein. why don't you drink 4 quarts of whole milk
a day instead of 2 quarts?  
**A: I don’t eat, or recommend, that much protein. For years I drank a gallon
per day. The calorie content of a gallon of whole milk is too much unless you
are very active physically.**  
  
Q: Interesting, how much protein do you eat? I heard you recommended 150 grams
minimum and personally consumed around 170 grams protein a day! shouldnt milk
boost the metabolic rate to such a high extent that you can safely consume
3000 calories per day of milk and whey protein, fruit juices etc  
**A: There are lots of insane proposals on the internet, and that forum seems
to be meeting its cuota.**  
  
Q: Asked Peat a question about a young bodybuilder dude dying at just 29 years
old, died from a cancer of some sort.  
**A: In the US, the incidence of cancer in young people is increasing; one of
the factors is probably increased vaccinations.**  
  
Q: how dangerous are these thermometers which can get your temperature without
touching you? are we being dosed with radiation right on our brains and
foreheads with these new touch free thermometers?  
**A: The skin on the forehead is a poor indicator of core body temperature.[
Infrared ](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/light-therapy/)
radiation is safe. **  
  
Q: random legal question regarding damages for assault  
**A: Monetary damages for injury are usually based on amount of disability,
sometime with the addition of punitive damages. `**  
  
Q: Mr Peat what do you think about androsterone and 11 KETO dht  
**A: Not sufficient research to know of safety.**  
  
Q: Mr Peat I thought you have used DHT in the last year and liked using it a
lot? someone was saying you mentioned the purple brand or something... or
purple panda... is that all false information  
**A: Internet silliness.**  
  
Q: Mr Peat, next time you do the youtube podcast with Danny can you clarify
your experience/thoughts on DHT as I've heard conflicting things  
**A: I have tried it, and experienced an effect from it, but it isn’t
something I use or recommend except for extreme situations such as terminal
cancer.**  
  
Q: mr Peat apparently you have talked about steroids being safer the higher up
in the chain they are and riskier the lower they are. isnt DHT a very far
endpoint steroid which comes after pregnenolone, dhea, testosterone, making it
unsafe.  
And how come youve talked about cholesterol and pregnenolone, but not squalene
and lanosterol? apparently, squalene is the most ancient molecule and is the
precursor to lanosterol, which is then the precursor to cholesterol. doesnt
this mean squalene would be the most safest and beneficial to supplement or
consume, followed by lanosterol, followed by cholesterol, and then followed by
pregnenolone and dhea which many have experienced negative effects from...  
**A: No, I said the opposite, that the final steroids, especially cortisol,
estrogen, and aldosterone can have toxic harmful effects, and that
cholesterol, pregnenolone, and[ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) are safe.
Squalene is very susceptible to oxidation, e.g., blackheads. The claims of the
cosmetic industry are just as likely to be false as those of the drug
industry.

Clinical implications of lipid peroxidation in acne vulgaris: old wine in new
bottles  
Whitney P Bowecorresponding author1 and Alan C Logan2  
Acne vulgaris is a common dermatological disorder, one that is frequently
associated with depression, anxiety and other psychological sequelae. In
recent years there has been an increasing focus on the extent to which
oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of acne. Emerging studies
have shown that patients with acne are under increased cutaneous and systemic
oxidative stress. Indeed, there are indications that lipid peroxidation itself
is a match that lights an inflammatory cascade in acne. The notion that lipid
peroxidation is a 'starter gun' in acne is not a new one; here we review the
nearly 50-year-old lipid peroxidation theory and provide a historical
perspective to the contemporary investigations and clinical implications.  
In addition, we present a novel hypothesis in which lipid peroxidation may be
priming an increased susceptibility to co-morbid depression and anxiety in
those with acne. The emerging research on the systemic burden of oxidative
stress in acne sheds further light on the brain-skin axis. The recent findings
also suggest potential avenues of approach for the treatment of acne via
specific nutrients, dietary modifications, oral and topical interventions.  
  
Lipid Peroxidation and Acne - Early Research  
One plausible mechanism driving the early release of inflammatory mediators is
that described by the near half-century-old lipid peroxidation theory of acne.
In 1965, University of Chicago investigator Allan L. Lorincz postulated that
oxidative breakdown of squalene and other skin lipids may not merely be a
consequence of the acne process. He suggested that lipid peroxides might be
directly 'acnegenic to the skin'. Based on his theory, it was hypothesized
that antioxidants would be of value in limiting and preventing the condition
via reduction in the formation of peroxides and other oxidation products. In a
small controlled pilot study (n = 15) he reported clinical success with
topical alpha-tocopherol (0.05%) in acne after one month of evaluation by an
independent examiner [14]. While there had been previous reports of clinical
success with vitamins A and C [15-19], Lorincz was the first to specifically
consider antioxidants to be of value in acne. The previous benefits of what
would turn out to be called antioxidant vitamins and flavonoids (including an
800 mg oral vitamin C and hesperidin complex) were largely attributed to
support of normal keratinization [17,18].  
  
Further support to the lipid peroxidation hypothesis would come from
University of California, Davis, scientist Alloys L. Tappel, who reported in
1975 that lipid peroxidation is evident in acne, and that localized free
radical damage and peroxides might be involved in initiating the damaging
inflammatory reactions [20]. Following this, other investigators reported that
components of sebum, particularly squalene, show enhanced comedogenicity when
oxidized [21]. Indeed, squalene was reported to be highly sensitive to
oxidation and researchers reported that both squalene and its oxidized
metabolites are found at much higher levels in acne vs. healthy controls
[13,22-24]. **  
  
Q: That is what I was saying youre saying as well Mr Peat however isnt DHT and
even testosterone part of the end point steroids? pregnenolone turns to
progesterone or dhea and progesterone can turn into cortisol or aldosterone
while dhea can turn to testosterone which can turn to estrogen or DHT? in a
stressed organism it is more likely pregnenolone will go towards cortisol and
estrogen?  
**A: No, it just doesn’t work that way. “Can turn into" has nothing to do with
how the organism works. It’s best to assume that everything on the internet is
wrong—they are repeated thousands of times, on “reputable” sites, but it isn’t
possible to learn anything useful by studying the great trash heap of the
internet.**  
  
Q: apparently PUFAS also lower bad cholesterol.  
i was wondering, what mechanism do PUFAS lower cholesterol by?  
and, why is it a good thing when thyroid hormone lowers cholesterol but a bad
thing when PUFA lowers cholesterol?  
**A: Cholesterol is converted to protective hormones in proportion to thyroid
function. Cholesterol is bound inside the blood vessels, liver, brain, and
other organs as a defense against PUFA toxicity.**  
  
Q: why do the PUFA lower cholesterol!  
**A: They cause tissue damage, and cells combine them with cholesterol (as
esters) for protection, but those esters accumulate in all the tissues with
aging, and stresses liberate them, causing prion diseases and other protein
folding forms of degeneration.  
  
Docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids increase prion formation in
neuronal cells  
Clive Bate, Mourad Tayebi, Luisa Diomede, Mario Salmona & Alun Williams  
BMC Biology volume 6, Article number: 39 (2008)  
Abstract  
Background  
The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, otherwise known as prion
diseases, occur following the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC)
to an alternatively folded, disease-associated isoform (PrPSc). Recent studies
suggest that this conversion occurs via a cholesterol-sensitive process, as
cholesterol synthesis inhibitors reduced the formation of PrPSc and delayed
the clinical phase of scrapie infection. Since polyunsaturated fatty acids
also reduced cellular cholesterol levels we tested their effects on PrPSc
formation in three prion-infected neuronal cell lines (ScGT1, ScN2a and SMB
cells).  
Results  
We report that treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) or the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin reduced the
amounts of free cholesterol in membrane extracts from prion-infected neuronal
cells. Simvastatin reduced cholesterol production while DHA and EPA promoted
the conversion of free cholesterol to cholesterol esters. Crucially, while
simvastatin reduced PrPSc formation, both DHA and EPA significantly increased
the amounts of PrPSc in these cells. Unlike simvastatin, the effects of DHA
and EPA on PrPSc content were not reversed by stimulation of cholesterol
synthesis with mevalonate. Treatment of ScGT1 cells with DHA and EPA also
increased activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 and prostaglandin E2
production. Finally, treatment of neuronal cells with DHA and EPA increased
the amounts of PrPC expressed at the cell surface and significantly increased
the half-life of biotinylated PrPC.  
Conclusion  
We report that although treatment with DHA or EPA significantly reduced the
free cholesterol content of prion-infected cells they significantly increased
PrPSc formation in three neuronal cell lines. DHA or EPA treatment of infected
cells increased activation of phospholipase A2, a key enzyme in PrPSc
formation, and altered the trafficking of PrPC. PrPC expression at the cell
surface, a putative site for the PrPSc formation, was significantly increased,
and the rate at which PrPC was degraded was reduced. Cholesterol depletion is
seen as a potential therapeutic strategy for prion diseases. However, these
results indicate that a greater understanding of the precise relationship
between membrane cholesterol distribution, PrPC trafficking, cell activation
and PrPSc formation is required before cholesterol manipulation can be
considered as a prion therapeutic.

Q: Mr Peat what kind of honey do you use. do you care if its organic and raw  
i heard all liquid honeys have been processed and heated that honey is solid
naturally. some say solid raw honey is dangerous  
**A: Natural honey is liquid, but if it’s exposed to dry air for a long time
it dehydrates and crystallizes; that doesn’t lower its quality.**  
  
Q: do you know if lighter or darker honey is better? do you know what kind of
vitamins/minerals are present in honey? are the benefits of honey related to
its sugar and antioxidants or is there something more.  
**A: Dark honey is more likely to be irritating. The value is mostly the
concentrated sugar, but there are small amounts of antioxidant materials.**  
  
Q: sir do you think drinking bovine blood is healthy or beneficial? the same
way you eat steak or bovine meats, is it good to have a high amount of blood
alongside those meats. isnt the iron content of the blood balanced out by
other nutrients present in the blood. dont some tribes, cultures, and even
rich elites in the modern world, consume animal (or maybe human) blood for its
healing and rejuvenating properties? is there some truth or factual basis to
this idea of vampires existing, as in humans who feed on animal or human blood
and actually remain in a good physical condition due to it despite aging in
terms of years  
**A: The traditional Maasai diet of iron-deficient milk was supplemented by a
small amount of iron-rich blood. Most common diets already have excessive
iron.**  
  
  
  
There are a lot of other things I'm curious about and will maybe ask as I
haven't emailed Peat for a while. Im curious of his thoughts on creatine/beta
alanine supplementation, himalayan pink salt, penis enlargement/if a higher
metabolism increases it's size, and a few other things.

On hypertension, calcium channel blockers, acute psychosis:  
  
Ray: Has his vitamin D been checked? Calcium channel blockers such as
nifedipine tend to increase parathyroid hormone, and high PTH is associated
with aneurysms. Does he drink milk and eat cheese? Low intake of calcium
relative to phosphate increases PTH. High PTH has been associated with
psychological changes.

Nifedipine, but not verapamil, acutely elevates parathyroid hormone levels in
premenopausal women  
A G Wynne, S A Romanski, G G Klee, S J Ory, W M O'Fallon, L A Fitzpatrick  
Background: Calcium channel antagonist therapy in humans has been associated
with changes in anterior pituitary, thyroid and adrenal hormone secretion.
Human studies assessing effects of calcium channel antagonists on calciotropic
hormones have been few and typically involved small numbers of subjects
studied for short periods of time. Few of these previously published studies
have included women. The endocrine effects of calcium channel antagonists in
women have become increasingly important as more women are taking these agents
for diseases such as hypertension, angina, Raynaud's phenomenon and migraine.  
Objective: To assess both acute and chronic effects of calcium channel
antagonists on calciotropic hormones in women.  
Design: A four-week prospective, randomized trial.  
Subjects: Twenty-nine premenopausal women, randomly assigned to receive either
240 mg of sustained release verapamil or 30 mg of sustained release nifedipine
daily. LABORATORY END-POINTS: Total and ionized serum calcium, phosphate,
creatinine, parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTHrP) and calcitonin, measured at baseline, after 24 hours, and 28 days of
treatment.  
Results: Total and ionized calcium, phosphate, creatinine, PTHrP and
calcitonin levels were not altered significantly after 24 hours or 28 days in
any of the subjects, when compared to baseline. There were no significant
differences in PTH levels after 24 hours or 28 days of verapamil treatment.
There was a significant increase in serum PTH levels after 24 hours of
nifedipine therapy; however, these differences were not evident after 28 days
of therapy.  
Conclusions: The short-term administration of nifedipine results in increased
release of parathyroid hormone; however, long-term administration has no
significant effect on the concentrations of calciotropic hormones.

Increased Incidence of Hypovitaminosis D Among Patients Requiring Treatment
for Cerebral Aneurysms  
Jian Guan, Michael Karsy 1 , Ilyas Eli 1 , Erica F Bisson 1 , Scott McNally 2
, Philipp Taussky 1 , Min S Park 3  
Objective: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage management is hampered by our
incomplete understanding of what variables promote aneurysm formation, growth,
and rupture. Because hypovitaminosis D has been identified as a risk factor
for other vascular diseases, we examined its association with cerebral
aneurysms requiring treatment.  
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with cerebral
aneurysms with recorded 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels undergoing treatment at
our institution from May 2010 to May 2015. We compared these patients with a
group of patients without aneurysms. We used multivariable Poisson regression
and backward elimination to identify factors associated with cerebral
aneurysms, with a threshold P < 0.20. A propensity-matching algorithm was
used, incorporating all factors with P < 0.10 in our regression model.  
Results: Patients in the aneurysm group were older than those in the control
group (P = 0.001) and more likely to be female (P = 0.004), to be tobacco
users (P < 0.001), and to have a diagnosis of hypertension (P = 0.001), but
ethnicity, body mass index, and diabetes rates did not differ. Vitamin D
levels in the aneurysm group were lower than in the control group (23.3 ± 12.3
vs. 28.7 ± 14.1 ng/mL, P = 0.001), and the patients were more likely to be
vitamin D deficient (P = 0.028). Multivariable Poisson regression demonstrated
that vitamin D level, tobacco use, age, and sex were significantly associated
with aneurysms requiring treatment (P < 0.05). The propensity-matching
algorithm confirmed a significant difference in vitamin D levels between the
aneurysm and control groups (P = 0.01).  
Conclusions: Patients with cerebral aneurysms requiring treatment have a
significantly higher incidence of hypovitaminosis D compared with patients in
a control group.

Post 677 Title: Dr. B · Jun 18, 2021 at 1:41 AM Author: Dr. B Post Content:

Q: Mr Peat, what your thoughts on [ creatine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/creatine-monohydrate-creapure/)
supplements?  
methionine, arginine, [ glycine ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/glycine-
powder-usp-grade/) , and SAM-e/ and choline are used to make creatine
endogenously.  
i have heard creatine somehow boosts phosphate levels in the body too.  
so im wondering your thoughts on creatine supplements.  
  
what do you think about eating grounded up animal bones for calcium? theres
new zealand grass fed bovine, ground up bone powder available online. it has
calcium to phosphate in a 2 to 1 ratio and apparently these cows are organic,
drug and disease and antibiotic free and purely grass fed.  
i think the maasai or maybe other tribes eat bones for calcium sometimes.  
what do you think about silver EMF blocking tents as well as high altitude
tents? emf tents use silver to block EMF. high altitude tents someghow attempt
to replicate a high altitude environment some of them use certain machines to
lower the air pressure im not sure if theres side effects associated with
those  
  
**A: I had a friend who got an expensive “altitude tent”; it smelled so bad
she couldn’t use it. I recently heard of a 15 year old boy who was using a
creatine supplement, died of heart arrest. Bone meal was a popular supplement,
until a published analysis showed very high lead content. Wire nets can
provide EMF shielding if they are grounded.**  
  
Q: mr Peat someone posted these quotes from your article to attempt to promote
iodine/iodide usage please advise on this. Some are claiming you only have
negative opinions on iodine supplementation, not on iodide supplementation,
similar to how chlorine is toxic whereas chloride is beneficial and necessary.  
  
From "The transparency of life: Cataracts as a model of age-related disease"
by Ray Peat.  
One of the best-known free radical scavenging substances that has been widely
used as a drug is iodide. It has been used to treat asthma, parasites,
syphilis, cancer, Graves’ disease, periodontal disease, and arteriosclerosis.
Diseases that produce tissue overgrowth associated with inflammation--
granulomas--have been treated with iodides, and although the iodide doesn’t
necessarily kill the germ, it does help to break down and remove the
granuloma. Leprosy and syphilis were among the diseases involving granulomas*
that were treated in this way. In the case of tuberculosis, it has been
suggested that iodides combine with unsaturated fatty acids which inhibit
proteolytic enzymes, and thus allow for the removal of the abnormal tissue.  
  
In experimental animals, iodide clearly delays the appearance of cataracts.
(Buchberger, et al., 199l.)  
Inflammation, edema, and free radical production are closely linked, and are
produced by most things that interfere with energy production.  
Endotoxin, produced by bacteria, mainly in the intestine, disrupts energy
production, and promotes maladaptive inflammation. The wide spectrum of
benefit that iodide has, especially in diseases with an inflammatory
component, suggests first that it protects tissue by blocking free radical
damage, but it also suggests the possibility that it might specifically
protect against endotoxin.  
  
**A: If someone had leprosy, scrofula, syphilis or unexplained granulomas and
couldn’t get appropriate things such as penicillin, then a short trial of
iodine wouldn’t be crazy. Medical use can’t be extrapolated to chronic large
doses as a nutritional supplement. Have you seen the many studies of the
hamful effects on the thyroid of regular iodide supplementation?**  
  
Q: anyway some of the dudes on the forums have mentioned theres studies
showing b6 supplements deplete [ vitamin B1
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b1-powder-thiamine-hcl-usp-grade/)
. there is one or two studies claiming pyridoxine HCL inhibits activity of the
active form of b6 pyridoxal 5 phosphate so some recommend using the active b6
form.  
these studies always seem to come out years after the fact. as far as
copper/zinc depleting each other, b6 depleting b1 etc. it seems that when you
supplement evern a single vitamin or mineral, it will undoubtedly deplete or
affect anothe vitamin or mineral.  
in animal thyroid glands, there is T1, T2, T3, T4, calcitonin and parathyroid.
when you take T4 and T3 you get something totally different. the animal
thyroid gland can probably be eaten infinitely or by the pound with no ill
effect. the same goes for [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) . it
probably has to be in balance with other hormones and even nutrients. why do
you recommend progesterone and T3? also I have tried T3 and actually gained
weight from it and noticed it burning up muscle tissue.  
progesterone can apparently convert to cortisol and aldosterone especially in
stressed organisms. apparently people have gained weight and had issues with
it.  
  
**A: John Ioannidis’ article “Why most research findings are false” is worth
reading. Things discussed on “forums” aren’t. Ordinary corporate advertising
has been supplemented by the much more economical practice of hiring product
reviewers to slander competing products, joining multiple forums with their
"unhappy experiences."  
Specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies were discovered among impoverished
people living on foods that were just available sources of energy, and they
are rare when people can buy the foods they want. Government agencies serve
the industries that they should regulate, and shouldn’t be trusted as reliable
sources of information.  
In the case of my friend's kid who was dying from diarrhea, appropriate foods
weren’t being given in the hospital, and the 10 mg of vitamin B6 obviously
served the purpose without depleting anything.  
Your sentences "progesterone can apparently convert to cortisol and
aldosterone especially in stressed organisms. apparently people have gained
weight and had issues with it” wouldn’t be acceptable even in an English
composition class, unless “apparently” could be backed up in some way with
evidence. **  
  
Q: what are your thoughts on the PROP 65 warning label. some whey protein
products have that prop 65 warning which is concerning... especially since
many whey products dont have that prop 65 warning  
**A: Have you read my article on Prop 65?**  
  
Q: do you disagree with wikipedias statement on [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) "Pregnenolone
(P5), or pregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one, is an endogenous steroid and
precursor/metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of most of the steroid
hormones, including the progestogens, androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids,
and mineralocorticoids.[1] In addition, pregnenolone is biologically active in
its own right, acting as a neurosteroid"?  
**A: Wikipedia isn’t a reliable source, but in that case their statement is
accurate.**  
  
Q: Mr Peat progesterone is a precursor to aldosterone and cortisol  
Mr Peat,i have tried out very high quality pregnenolone capsules from very
high end expensive brands like pure encapsulations and life extension  
just 50mg pregnenolone, daily for 10 days caused 12 POUNDS of weight gain
which did not subside even after stopping. so i do not see how you can say
pregnenolone doesnt convert to cortisol/estrogen/aldosterone, how does it
cause that weight gain without converting to toxic hormones?  
by the way the pregnenolone usage also shrunk my testicles and caused hair
loss on the scalp. as well as a bit of a burning sensation in the thyroid. it
also caused significant dry eyes.  
**A: Progesterone is an antagonist to aldosterone and cortisol. Experiments
have shown clearly that pure pregnenolone, like pure progesterone, lowers
cortisol in stressed animals with high cortisol. The price of a supplement,
and the claims of its vendor, don’t have anything to do with its quality. Pure
pregnenolone just doesn’t cause hormonal effects such as you mention. I
haven’t recommended pregnenolone use for several years, since I started
hearing about reactions that could only be caused by major impurities.**  
  
Q: Mr Peat, how do those experiments show or prove that is always the case? in
chemistry charts, pregnenolone is a precursor hormone to aldosterone and
cortisol the same way [ dhea
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) is a
precursor to testosterone/estrogen. there have been a variety of people,
trying a variety of different brands of pregnenolone experiencing the side
effects of hair loss, weight gain, bloating etc. how are you certain that
pregnenolone cant cause such effects if even mainstream chemistry charts claim
it is a precursor hormone to cortisol. additionally, nearly all pregnenolone
supplements on the market are required to carry an FDA warning mentioning they
could increase estrogens and cancer risks.  
**A: For more than 50 years, in animals and people pregnenolone didn’t have
those effects. When it became "a product," dozens of little companies, with no

INTRODUCTION  
While the fiftieth anniversary of the proposal that chromium (as the trivalent
ion) is anessential trace element for mammals is rapidly approaching, little
progress has actuallybeen made in establishing the nutritional requirement for
and biochemistry of chromiumover these five decades. This is in stark contrast
to the advances in knowledge of thenutritional role and biochemistry of other
essential trace elements. The transition metals in the third row of the
Periodic Table from vanadium to zinc (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,Cu, and Zn) and
also molybdenum and tungsten are generally considered to be essentialfor some
form of life. Currently, for each of these transition elements except
chromium,at least one metallobiomolecule has been well characterized in terms
of its function, three-dimensional structure, and mode of action. In fact,
whether chromium is essentialhas been questioned since it was first proposed
to be essential over four decades ago;the question of essentialness is still
debated openly (see Chapters 2 and 3). Certainly that such a basic question
still remains unanswered is problematic.

Q: what are the amounts of chromium in foods you recommend? Mate the RDA for
chromium was 120mcg for many years and recently in 2019 was downgraded to
35mcg. regardless it seems extremely difficult to get the rda. do you think
the rda of 120mcg for chromium is correct or 35mcg? how would we get this
amount just from liver and milk  
**A: The book link I sent describes the absence of science behind the claims
of essentiality.**  
  
Q: mr Peat the weston a price foundation wrote an article about your views on
omega 3 and omega 6 and they claim you are flawed and that omega 3/6 are
essential in small amounts, as found in WAPF recommended foods... they also
promote cod liver oil for its omega 3 and vitamins A D and K  
**A: That article was published under the name of Mary Enig, a respected lipid
researcher, but people told me that she was too sick with cancer at the time
to have written it. The article contained such absurdities that it amounted to
defamation of Enig; if they have continued to post it, that doesn’t say much
for the judgment of the managers of the website.**  
  
Q: mr Peat what do you think is a good amount of chromium to take in per day
and which foods would you use to obtain it?  
**A: The book explains that the idea of chromium as an essential nutrient
doesn’t have a clear basis in science; it has become a cult to promote the
very lucrative industry.**  
  
Q: do you think supplementing creatine, beta alaniine and taurine is useful
have you tried using them sir! creatine monohydrate  
**A: The purity of individual amino acids on the market has been a real issue,
so their theoretical benefits have to be considered in relation to what’s
available.**  
  
Q: hi mr Peat  
apparently vitamin b6 in pyridoxine hydrochloride depletes b6 and causes
issues?  
do you recommend not supplementing with zinc and vitamin b6 at all?  
what about supplementing magnesium?  
**A: I don’t recommend supplements generally, because foods can provide them,
and the supplements are always contaminated to some extent in the
manufacturing process. In extreme cases I have recommended a small dose of
pyridoxine hydrochloride which worked immediately and very well.**  
  
Q: but theres apparently studies saying pydorizine hydchloride inhibits and
depletes activity of pyridoxal 5 phosphate. people say you should only use the
active form of supplement. also what cases did you suggest b6 supplementation
for what was the purpose/ which foods even contain b6. it seems to not be
present in any foods, at least not in high amounts to reach 2 milligrams or
more daily  
**A: People say anything to sell their product. It’s in a wide range of foods.
I’ve given small supplements for a variety of problems. The first time was a 2
year old child that had diarrhea that the hospital couldn’t control, and after
3 or 4 days they said she was within a few hours of dying; it was only at that
point that the father dared to give her the supplement, and the diarrhea
stopped almost immediately. My suggestion, in 1962, was based on old research.
It’s effective for many problems related to the distribution of salts and
water.**  
  
Q: Mr Peat  
apparently you have online articles and some lines in nutrition for women
where you said positive things about benefits of iodide.  
youve talked about the risks of iodine in many online articles and interviews
on youtube.  
some are claiming you only believe iodine is bad, not iodides. they are
supplementing hundreds of milligrams of potassium iodide daily and claiming
that you agree with their supplement usage and you believe iodide is very
beneficial and only iodine as in lugols iodine is bad.  
is this true? do you think iodide can safely and beneficially be used in huge
doses daily, while only iodine supplements are bad? i assumed when you used
the term iodine you meant both iodine and iodide. most iodine supplements are
potassium iodide just like iodized salt  
**A: Used occasionally as a topical antiseptic, tincture of iodine is safe.
Historically iodide has been used to treat a breast infection. That’s very
different from the cult of daily use of large amounts of iodide, started by
Guy Abraham.  
The founder of the current iodine cult, Guy Abraham, was promoting iodine
along with their radiation devices to protect against electromagnetic
pollution. I couldn’t decide whether he really believed those things, or just
used them to sell his product.

Abstract  
Common causes of unilateral breast uptake of Tc-99m pertechnetate are
predominant breast-feeding on one side, mastitis, and breast cancer. Uptake of
Tc-99m pertechnetate in the epithelial cells of the breast, like that of
iodide, depends on the transmembrane sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the
expression of which is known to be greatly enhanced during lactation and in
breast cancer. The authors present an interesting case of predominant left
breast uptake of Tc-99m pertechnetate detected incidentally during thyroid
scintigraphy, for the evaluation of a nodule in the left lobe of thyroid.

The authors report a case of granulomatous mastitis associated with erythema

potassium iodide. The breast lesion clinically simulated a tumor of high
malignant grade. Granulomatous mastitis is a benign and rare disease. Its
interest lies in the possible association with systemic manifestations and in
its steroid responsiveness. This condition has been recently described as a
distinct entity. When associated with systemic manifestations, sarcoidosis
should be considered.

Abstract  
A 10-year-old pregnant Norwegian Fjord horse was examined for gross swelling
of the muzzle of 2 years' duration. Examination of biopsy specimens revealed
diffuse dermal fibrosis, micropustule formation, and vascular thrombosis;
large numbers of Actinobacillus lignieresii were isolated in pure culture.
Prolonged treatment with i.v. administration of sodium iodide and oral
administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole caused regression of the
swelling and did not induce abortion. A 5-month-old American Paint filly was
examined for swelling in the udder region. Bacteriologic culture of purulent
material obtained from the left teat revealed A lignieresii. Treatment with
oral administration of rifampin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resulted in
complete resolution of clinical signs. To the authors' knowledge, these
findings represent the first report of mastitis and chronic nasal cellulitis
caused by A lignieresii infection in horses.

Q: Mr Peat im wondering if your recommendations regarding supplementation of
iodine are the same as for iodide? Many people are aware of your comments
regarding IodINE supplementation, but some people are claiming your comments
apply only to Iodine and that you believe there are benefits to supplementing
large, several milligram doses of IODIDE like potassium iodide. the logic
being used is these people claim chlorine is bad chloride is essential, and
similarly they claim you believe only iodine is bad whereas you like
supplementing with iodide

have often pointed out the damage to the thyroid gland that even moderate
iodide supplements can cause:

Thyroid cancer and thyroiditis in Salta, Argentina: a 40-yr study in relation
to iodine prophylaxis.

The natural history of thyroid cancer and thyroiditis in relation to iodine  
prophylaxis in the region of Salta, Argentina, where goiter is common was  
investigated over a time span of 40 yr. For analysis of thyroid cancer, the  
specimens were divided into two periods. The first 15 yr (59 cases), including
5  
yr before prophylaxis, was compared with the second 25 yr (182 cases), a
period  
well after salt iodination. Papillary carcinomas formed the largest group of  
tumors in both periods, with a significant increase in their proportion in the  
second period (44 vs 60%, chi(2): p < 0.05), while the percentage of
follicular  
and undifferentiated carcinomas decreased and medullary carcinoma remained
about  
the same. The ratio of papillary to follicular carcinoma rose from 1.7:1 in
the  
first period to 3.1:1 in the second. Four thyroid lymphomas of non-Hodgkin's  
B-cell type occurred in the second period in females over age 50. A severe  
lymphoid thyroiditis was present in the two cases with assessable background  
thyroid tissue. The frequency of moderate to severe lymphoid infiltrate in  
females rose from 2 of 12 (16.6%) in the preprophylaxis period to 34 of 114  
(28.0%) in the last 25 yr after prophylaxis. After salt prophylaxis,
thyroiditis  
was more frequent in patients with papillary carcinoma (36.2%) than in those
with  
nonpapillary tumors (14.7%) (chi(2), p < 0.02). These observations indicate
that  
a high dietary intake of iodine may be associated with a high frequency of  
papillary carcinoma and thyroiditis, and that thyroiditis is more commonly  
associated with papillary carcinoma than with other thyroid tumors. The  
occurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas only in the postprophylaxis period may
be  
linked to an increase in thyroiditis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the salt iodization program, which was  
initiated in 1989 on frequencies of thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma in
Fars  
province of Iran, which was previously an iodine deficient area. METHODS: Four  
hundred and eighty-two thyroidectomy specimens belonging to the pre-iodization  
period from 1983 to 1988, and 466 post iodization specimens from 1998 to 2003  
were re-examined for presence of lymphocytic infiltration and types of thyroid  
tumors. This study was carried out in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences,  
Iran. RESULTS: The frequency of lymphocytic infiltration in non-neoplastic  
specimens increased from 30-60.5% after salt iodization (p<0.001). Background
of  
lymphocytic infiltration in neoplastic specimens also increased from 18.5-61%  
after iodine prophylaxis (p<0.001). The frequency of papillary carcinoma in  
neoplastic specimens increased from 15-43% (p=0.01) and that of follicular  
adenoma decreased from 69-32.5% (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Salt iodization is  
associated with an increased occurrence of histologic thyroiditis and
papillary  
carcinoma.

Iodine excess may lead to thyroid diseases. Our previous 5-year prospective  
survey showed that the prevalence and incidence of hypothyroidism or
autoimmune  
thyroiditis increased with iodine intake. The aim of the present study was to  
investigate the optimal range of iodine intake by comparing the prevalence of  
thyroid diseases in three areas with slightly different levels of iodine
intake.  
In 2005, 778 unselected women subjects from three areas with different iodine  
intake levels were enrolled. Levels of serum thyroid hormones, thyroid  
autoantibodies, and urinary iodine were measured, and thyroid B ultrasounds
were  
performed. Among the subjects with mildly deficient iodine intake, those with  
adequate intake, and those with more than adequate intake, the prevalence of  
clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism was 0, 1.13, and 2.84%, respectively
(P =  
0.014); that of thyroid goiter was 24.88, 5.65, and 11.37%, respectively (P <  
0.001); that of serum thyrotropin values was1.01, 1.25, and 1.39 mIU/l,  
respectively; and that of serum thyrotropin/thyroglobulin ratio was 7.98,
6.84,  
and 5.11, respectively (P < 0.001). In conclusion, median urinary iodine
100~200  
mug/l may reflect the safe range of iodine intake levels. Serum  
thyrotropin/thyroglobulin ratio might be a better index of evaluating iodine  
status.

Induction of goitrous hypothyroidism by dietary iodide in SJL mice.  
Li HS, Carayanniotis G.  
Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's,  
Newfoundland, Canada.  
Prolonged intake of large amounts of iodide has been reported to increase the  
incidence of goiter and/or hypothyroidism in humans as well as animals prone
to  
spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis. In the current study, we investigated the  
role of dietary iodide on the development of hypothyroidism, as well as  
thyroiditis, in strains of mice that do not develop spontaneous autoimmune  
thyroiditis. Intake of 0.05% NaI via drinking water for 10 wk induced  
hypothyroidism in SJL/J mice as indicated by elevated TSH and depressed total  
T(4) values in serum and formation of colloidal goiter with an inactive
flattened  
thyroid epithelium. Hypothyroidism did not appear to have an autoimmune basis  
because only focal mononuclear cell infiltrates were found intrathyroidally,
and  
antithyroglobulin antibodies or increased organification of iodide were not  
detected. These phenomena were not observed in similarly treated CBA/J mice,  
suggesting polymorphisms in genes controlling events downstream of iodide
uptake  
by thyrocytes. Interestingly, RT-PCR analysis indicated that unlike CBA/J,
SJL/J  
mice could not down-regulate Na/I symporter gene expression during the NaI  
treatment. No significant temporal or strain differences were observed
regarding  
the expression of thyroglobulin, pendrin, thyroid peroxidase, and DUOX1 and
DUOX2  
genes after NaI intake. Our results point to the generation of a mouse model
for  
the study of iodine-induced hypothyroidism, which does not seem to have an  
autoimmune basis.

Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, 69495 Pierre-Bénite Cedex, France.  
Epidemiological studies, as well as animal models, indicate that iodine might
be  
an immunogenic agent for the thyroid gland, at least in subjects predisposed
to  
thyroid autoimmunity. This review presents data, either epidemiological or  
experimental, obtained in different conditions: constant and stable iodine  
status, either deficient, sufficient or excessive; long-term iodine
prophylaxis;  
temporary supplementation with iodide (6-12 months) or iodised oil. Moreover,
we  
also discuss data obtained in the general population, among subjects with  
euthyroid goiter, or autoimmune goiter, or even in women prone to post-partum  
thyroid diseases. It is concluded that the significant increase in the
prevalence  
of autoimmune thyroid diseases in populations living in iodine sufficient
areas  
should not prevent the implementation of the iodine prophylaxis.

Enhanced iodination of thyroglobulin facilitates processing and presentation
of a  
cryptic pathogenic peptide.  
Dai YD, Rao VP, Carayanniotis G.  
Division of Endocrinology, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of  
Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.  
Increased iodine intake has been associated with the development of
experimental  
autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), but the biological basis for this association  
remains poorly understood. One hypothesis has been that enhanced incorporation
of  
iodine in thyroglobulin (Tg) promotes the generation of pathogenic T cell  
determinants. In this study we sought to test this by using the pathogenic  
nondominant A(s)-binding Tg peptides p2495 and p2694 as model Ags. SJL mice  
challenged with highly iodinated Tg (I-Tg) developed EAT of higher severity
than  
Tg-primed controls, and lymph node cells (LNC) from I-Tg-primed hosts showed a  
higher proliferation in response to I-Tg in vitro than Tg-primed LNC reacting
to  
Tg. Interestingly, I-Tg-primed LNC proliferated strongly in vitro against
p2495,  
but not p2694, indicating efficient and selective priming with p2495 following  
processing of I-Tg in vivo. Tg-primed LNC did not respond to either peptide.  
Similarly, the p2495-specific, IL-2-secreting T cell hybridoma clone 5E8 was  
activated when I-Tg-pulsed, but not Tg-pulsed, splenocytes were used as APC,  
whereas the p2694-specific T cell hybridoma clone 6E10 remained unresponsive
to  
splenic APC pulsed with Tg or I-Tg. The selective in vitro generation of p2495  
was observed in macrophages or dendritic cells, but not in B cells, suggesting  
differential processing of I-Tg among various APC. These data demonstrate that  
enhanced iodination of Tg facilitates the selective processing and
presentation  
of a cryptic pathogenic peptide in vivo or in vitro and suggest a mechanism
that  
can at least in part account for the association of high iodine intake and the  
development of EAT.

Excess iodine induces the expression of thyroid solid cell nests in
lymphocytic thyroiditis-prone BB/W rats. Zhu YP, Bilous M, Boyages SC.
Department of Clinical Endocrinology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.
Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that lymphocytic thyroiditis
and/or an increased iodine intake may be risk factors for the development of
thyroid cancer. We previously reported that excess iodine accelerated the
development of thyroid lymphocytic infiltration (LI) in the autoimmune BB/W
rat model. We also found that excess iodine increased thyroid cell
proliferation in a disordered manner. The present study was designed to
further explore these observations and to address the question as to whether
excess iodine under certain conditions predisposes the thyroid gland to
neoplasia. To test this hypothesis, the lymphocytic thyroiditis-prone BB/W rat
was exposed to excess iodine in drinking water. Ten BB/W rats at 4 weeks of
age were given iodine water (NaI 0.05%) for 10 weeks, whilst another 10 BB/W
rats were given tap water and served as controls. Eighteen normal Wistar rats
were also divided into excess iodine and control groups, served as a
comparison to the BB/W rats. We found that an excess iodine intake accelerated
the development of LI in the BB/W rat. Severe LI was usually accompanied by
prominent thyroid cell proliferation, evident as numerous microfollicles and
cell masses, not forming normal thyroid follicles. Numerous lymphocytes and
plasma cells often encroached on these areas of increased cellular
proliferation. The surprising feature, and a possible indicator of activated
thyroid cell proliferation, was the high incidence of thyroid solid cell nest-
like lesions (SCN) in the iodine treated BB/W rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Thyroid autoimmunity in endemic goitre caused by excessive iodine intake.  
Boyages SC, Bloot AM, Maberly GF, Eastman CJ, Li M, Qian QD, Liu DR, van der  
Gaag RD, Drexhage HA.  
Department of Medicine, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.  
The pathophysiology of endemic goitre caused by excessive iodine intake is not  
well defined. By interacting with the immune system, iodine excess may trigger  
the development of autoimmune thyroid disease such as lymphocytic Hashimoto's  
thyroiditis (LT). In an attempt to examine this further, we compared the  
presence of thyroid autoantibodies in 29 goitrous children, from an iodine  
excess area, and in 26 healthy children, from an iodine sufficient area, of  
north central China. Serum was tested for antimicrosomal (MAb),  
anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb), second colloid antigen antibodies (CA2-Ab) and TSH  
binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII). Affinity chromatographically
purified  
IgG was tested for thyroid growth-stimulating activity (TGI) by two different  
methods: a sensitive cytochemical bioassay (CBA) using guinea-pig thyroid  
explants and a mitotic arrest assay (MAA) employing a continuous rat thyroid  
cell line (FRTL-5). We found no increased prevalence of LT in patients with  
endemic iodine goitre. The levels of MAb, TgAb and CA2-Ab did not differ  
significantly between the two groups of children. Further, TBII were not
present  
in either group. Thyroid growth-stimulating immunoglobulins (TGI) were the
major  
autoantibodies found in children with goitres caused by iodine excess. In the  
CBA, 12 of 20 (60%) goitrous children and 0 of 12 (0% P less than 0.05)
healthy  
children were positive for TGI. Similar results were found in the MAA, and a  
good correlation between results of the CBA and MAA was found (P = 0.003).  
Maximal TGI activity in dose-response CBA showed a good relation with clinical  
goitre size (r = 0.63; P less than 0.05) indicating a possible  
pathophysiological role for these antibodies. We conclude that endemic iodine  
goitre is not associated with Hashimoto's lymphocytic thyroiditis.
Nevertheless,  
autoimmune growth factors such as TGI may play a primary role in the  
pathogenesis of thyroid growth in this condition.

Induction of autoimmune thyroiditis in chickens by dietary iodine.  
Bagchi N, Brown TR, Urdanivia E, Sundick RS. Clinical studies have suggested
that excess dietary iodine promotes autoimmune  
thyroiditis; however, the lack of a suitable animal model has hampered  
investigation of the phenomenon. In this study, different amounts of potassium  
iodide were added to the diets of chicken strains known to be genetically  
susceptible to autoimmune thyroiditis. Administration of iodine during the
first  
10 weeks of life increased the incidence of the disease, as determined by  
histology and the measurement of autoantibodies to triiodothyronine,
thyroxine,  
and thyroglobulin. Further support for the relation between iodine and  
autoimmune thyroiditis was provided by an experiment in which iodine-deficient  
regimens decreased the incidence of thyroid autoantibodies in a highly  
susceptible strain. These results suggest that excessive consumption of iodine  
in the United States may be responsible for the increased incidence of  
autoimmune thyroiditis.

Human Nutrition Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich,  
Switzerland. [ michael.zimmermann@ilw.agrl.ethz.ch
](mailto:michael.zimmermann@ilw.agrl.ethz.ch)  
BACKGROUND: There are few data on the adverse effects of chronic exposure to
high iodine intakes, particularly in children. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the
study was to ascertain whether high dietary intakes of iodine in children
result in high thyroid volume (Tvol), a high risk of goiter, or both. DESIGN:
In an international sample of 6-12-y-old children (n = 3319) from 5 continents
with iodine intakes ranging from adequate to excessive, Tvol was measured by
ultrasound, and the urinary iodine (UI) concentration was measured.
Regressions were done on Tvol and goiter including age, body surface area,
sex, and UI concentration as covariates. RESULTS: The median UI concentration
ranged from 115 microg/L in central Switzerland to 728 microg/L in coastal
Hokkaido, Japan. In the entire sample, 31% of children had UI concentrations
>300 microg/L, and 11% had UI concentrations >500 microg/L; in coastal
Hokkaido, 59% had UI concentrations >500 microg/L, and 39% had UI
concentrations >1000 microg/L. In coastal Hokkaido, the mean age- and body
surface area-adjusted Tvol was approximately 2-fold the mean Tvol from the
other sites combined (P < 0.0001), and there was a positive correlation
between log(UI concentration) and log(Tvol) (r = 0.24, P < 0.0001). In the
combined sample, after adjustment for age, sex, and body surface area,
log(Tvol) began to rise at a log(UI concentration) >2.7, which, when
transformed back to the linear scale, corresponded to a UI concentration of
approximately 500 microg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic iodine intakes approximately
twice those recommended-indicated by UI concentrations in the range of 300-500
microg/L-do not increase Tvol in children. However, UI concentrations >/=500
microg/L are associated with increasing Tvol, which reflects the adverse
effects of chronic iodine excess.

Taguchi S, Murakami S, Hagiwara K, Noda Y, Ukawa S. Department of Internal
Medicine, Hokkaido Central Hospital for Social Health Insurance, Sapporo,
Japan. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and its relation to thyroid
autoantibodies (TAA) and urinary iodide concentration (UI) was studied in
apparently healthy adults in Sapporo (n = 4110) (Sapporo group), and in five
coastal areas of Hokkaido (n = 1061) (coastal group) which produce iodine-rich
seaweed (kelp). The frequency of above normal UI (high UI) in the morning
urinary samples of coastal group was 10.8%, significantly higher than that of
Sapporo group (6.4%) (p < 0.001). Frequency of positive TAA in both groups
were similar. In Sapporo group TAA was positive in 6.4% of males and 13.8% of
females with an age-related increase. The overall prevalence of
hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.15 mU/L) in coastal group (0.6%) was similar to that
in Sapporo group (1.1%), while that of hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.0 mU/L) in
coastal group (3.8%) was significantly higher than that in Sapporo group
(1.3%) (P < 0.001). The frequency of high UI correlated significantly with
that of hypothyroidism with negative TAA (r = 0.829, P < 0.05), but not with
positive TAA, or with that of hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism was more
prevalent in TAA negative subjects with high UI than with normal UI. Moreover,
serum TSH and thyroglobulin levels were higher and free T4 level was lower in
former than in latter group. These results indicate that 1) the prevalence of
TAA negative hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient areas may be associated with
the amount of iodine ingested, 2) this hypothyroidism is more prevalent and
marked in subjects consuming further excess amounts of iodine, and 3)
excessive intake of iodine should be considered an etiology of hypothyroidism
in addition to chronic thyroiditis in these areas.

A case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis with thyroid immunological abnormality  
manifested after habitual ingestion of seaweed.  
Okamura K, Inoue K, Omae T.  
An interesting case of iodide induced goitre with immunological abnormalities
is  
described. The patient who was sensitive to synthetic penicillin had
previously  
been treated for exudative pleuritis, congestive heart failure and acute renal  
failure. Following recovery, he began to ingest large amounts of seaweed after  
which he developed goitrous hypothyroidism. It was of interest that the serum  
level of gamma-globulin increased, and subsequently the antithyroid microsomal  
antibody became strongly positive, suggesting that thyroidal autoimmune  
processes had been precipitated. Biopsy of the thyroid gland revealed chronic  
thyroiditis, with evidence suggesting extreme stimulation by TSH. Hight  
thyroidal uptake of 131I, positive perchlorate discharge test and biochemical  
analysis of the thyroidal soluble protein showed severe impairment of hormone  
synthesis following continuous accumulation of excess iodide. While there is  
evidence suggesting that increased iodide may be an important factor in the  
initiation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, this may result from the marked
increased  
sensitivity of Hashimoto's gland to the effects of iodine. Thus an occult
lesion  
could be unmasked in this manner. The mechanism by which iodide mediates this  
effect is not clear.

Iodine and thyroid autoimmune disease in animal models.  
Ruwhof C, Drexhage HA.  
Department of Immunology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam.  
Thyroid autoimmune diseases are complex, polygenic afflictions the penetrance
of  
which is heavily dependent on various environmental influences. In their  
pathogenesis, an afferent stage (enhanced autoantigen presentation), a central  
stage (excessive expansion and maturation of autoreactive T and B cells), and
an  
efferent stage (effects of autoreactive T cells and B cells on their targets)  
can be discerned. At each stage, a plethora of inborn, endogenous or exogenous  
factors is able to elicit the abnormalities characteristic of that stage, thus  
opening the gateway to thyroid autoimmunity. Iodine is an important exogenous  
modulating factor of the process. In general, iodine deficiency attenuates,  
while iodine excess accelerates autoimmune thyroiditis in autoimmune prone  
individuals. In nonautoimmune prone individuals, the effects of iodine are  
different. Here iodine deficiency precipitates a mild (physiological) form of  
thyroid autoimmune reactivity. Iodine excess stimulates thymus development.  
Iodine probably exerts these effects via interference in the various stages of  
the autoimmune process. In the afferent and efferent stage, iodine-induced  
alterations in thyrocyte metabolism and even necrosis most likely play a role.  
By contrast, in the central phase, iodine has direct effects on thymus  
development, the development and function of various immune cells (T cells, B  
cells macrophages and dendritic cells) and the antigenicity of thyroglobulin.

Excess iodine ingestion has been implicated in induction and exacerbation of
autoimmune thyroiditis in human populations and animal models. We studied the
time course and sex-related differences in iodine-induced autoimmune
thyroiditis in NOD-H-2h4 mice. This strain, derived from a cross of NOD with
B10.A(4R), spontaneously develops autoimmune thyroiditis but not diabetes.
NOD-H-2h4 mice were given either plain water or water with 0.05% iodine for 8
weeks. Approximately 54% of female and 70% of male iodine-treated mice
developed thyroid lesions, whereas only 1 of 20 control animals had
thyroiditis at this time. Levels of serum thyroxin (T4) were similar in the
treatment and control groups. Thyroglobulin-specific antibodies were present
in the iodine-treated group after 8 weeks of treatment but antibodies to
thyroid peroxidase were not apparent in the serum of any of the animals.
Levels of thyroglobulin antibodies increased throughout the 8-week iodine
ingestion period; however, no correlation was seen between the levels of total
thyroglobulin antibodies and the degree of thyroid infiltration at the time of
autopsy. The thyroglobulin antibodies consisted primarily of IgG2a, IgG2b, and
IgM antibodies with no detectable IgA, IgG1, or IgG3 thyroglobulin-specific
antibodies. The presence of IgG2b thyroglobulin-specific antibodies correlated
well with the presence of thyroid lesions.

A breeding line of domestic cats spontaneously developing symptoms of
hypothyroidism between the 40th and 60th day of life (fur changes, loss of
appetite, growth retardation), elevated levels of antibodies against
microsomal structures and thyroglobulin, and lymphocytic thyroid infiltration
has been recently established at our facility. Aim of our studies was to
examine the effect of high iodine ingestion or prophylactic thyroid hormone
therapy on functional and morphological characteristics of this Hashimoto-like
thyroiditis in cat. From birth to day 80 of life cats were treated with iodine
(n = 9; 0.1 mg/l) or thyroxin (n = 13; 2.0 micrograms/ kg/d) respectively.
Untreated animals served as controls (n = 12). Cat-serum was tested for
thyroid function (TT3, TT4). After 8 weeks the thyroid tissue was submitted to
routine histological processing (H&E) and the inflammatory activity was
scored. Additionally immunohistological staining was performed for MIB-1, IgG,
IgM and MHCII expression. Both untreated hypothyroid (UHC) as well as iodine-
treated (IC) cats revealed a significantly higher degree of thyroid
inflammation and higher tissue levels of IgM as the thyroxin-substituted
animals (TC). Epithelial proliferation decreased significantly in the IC and
TC groups as compared to the untreated controls. No significant differences
regarding IgG production and HLAII expression were detectable. Early thyroid
hormone therapy significantly decreases both incidence and activity of
autoimmune thyroiditis in cats as measured by inflammatory infiltration, IgM
production and epithelial proliferation. Animals with excess iodide intake,
however, show an aggravation of the autoimmune inflammatory activity.

Iodide induced lymphocytic thyroiditis in the BB/W rat: evidence of direct
toxic effects of iodide on thyroid subcellular structure.  
Li M, Boyages SC.  
Department of Clinical Endocrinology, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.  
A high dietary iodine intake accelerates the development of lymphocytic  
thyroiditis (LT) in the BB/W rat. Our previous studies have defined the
temporal  
sequence of the immunological events triggered by excess iodide intake in
these  
animals. It was still not clear, however, whether these observed immunological  
changes were a direct effect on immune effector cells, or whether they  
represented a secondary response to a toxic effect of iodine on thyroid
tissue.  
In the present study, the effect of excessive iodine intake on the subcellular  
structure of the BB/W rat thyroid gland, particularly, whether iodide had a  
toxic effect independent of its immune response has been examined. BB/W rats  
were exposed, prenatally through maternal drinking water, to excessive iodide
at  
two doses (Moderate 3 x 10(-6) M iodide/l; High 3 x 10(-3) M iodide/l); a
third  
group of BB/W rats was given tap water; till 12 weeks postnatal age. Two
groups  
of Wistar rats received high dose iodide water or tap water for the same
period  
of time and served as controls. Thyroid gland ultrastructure was determined by  
electron microscopic (EM) examination. Thyroid 125I uptake and perchlorate  
discharge tests were also performed in separate experiments. We found that  
thyroid glands of non-iodine supplemented Wistar rats were morphlogically
normal  
under EM. There were no overt changes in the iodide treated Wistar rats. By  
contrast, iodide treated BB/W rats exhibited marked accumulation of secondary  
lysosomes and lipid droplets; markedly swollen and disrupted mitochondria and  
extreme dilatation of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

An excess of dietary iodine accelerates the development of a thyroid-
associated lymphoid tissue in autoimmune prone BB rats.  
Mooij P, de Wit HJ, Drexhage HA.  
Department of Immunology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  
Previous studies have shown that dietary iodine enhances the severity and  
incidence of focal thyroiditis in autoimmune BB rats and OS chickens. However,  
which lymphoid cells are involved in the development of the iodine-induced
focal  
thyroiditis and what the consequences are for the anticolloid antibody  
production have not been studied in detail. We therefore performed a study in  
which 3-week-old female BB rats were kept on either an enriched iodine diet  
(EID; iodine intake, 100 micrograms iodine/day) or a normal iodine diet (NID;  
iodine intake, 7 micrograms iodine/day) for a period of 18 weeks. The  
development of the focal thyroiditis was immunohistologically studied.  
Immunohistological data were compared to the thyroid hormone status and  
anti-colloid antibody production. Our data confirm that a high dietary iodine  
intake results in an accelerated development of the focal lymphoid cell  
infiltrates in the thyroid of the BB rat. After 12-18 weeks of an EID 50% of
the  
BB rats developed these infiltrates. Our data additionally show that: (a) the  
process starts with increases in the number of infiltrating MHC class  
II-positive dendritic cells and a clustering of these cells with T cells, B  
cells, and some macrophages and (b) the focal infiltrates are highly organized  
and consist of central B cell follicle-like structures surrounded by rims and  
areas of T cells. The architecture of the focal thyroiditis is hence very  
similar to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and secondary lymphoid organs  
(spleen and lymph node). Only minor signs of thyrocyte destruction were  
observed. We therefore consider the term "thyroiditis" as inappropriate and  
prefer the term "thyroid-associated lymphoid tissue." Since the thyroiditis  
component was small, it is also not surprising that the BB rats on the EID  
remained euthyroid. The presence of the thyroid-associated lymphoid tissue in  
the BB rats was positively correlated to the presence of anti-colloid antibody  
in the serum of the BB rats. We speculate that the dietary iodine might have  
direct effects on cells of the immune system or on cells forming the  
microenvironment of lymphoid tissue (reticulum cells). A role for highly  
iodinated thyroglobulin in the accelerated development of thyroid-associated  
lymphoid tissue is also possible.

Iodine induced lymphocytic thyroiditis in the BB/W rat: early and late immune
phenomena.  
Li M, Eastman CJ, Boyages SC.  
Department of Clinical Endocrinology, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.  
The effect of iodine excess on thyroid function and on the immunological  
sequence of events leading to lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) was studied in the
NB  
subline of BB/W rats to determine the mechanisms by which the level of iodine  
intake influences the development of LT in this animal model. Iodine  
supplemented water (500 micrograms/l, Group 1 or 500 mg/l, Group 2) or  
non-iodine supplemented tap water (Group 3) was given to breeding pairs and  
their offspring ad libitum. A Wistar rat group, also given tap water (Group 4)  
served as controls. To determine the immunological sequence of events, the  
phenotypic nature of the infiltrating thyroid lymphocytes was examined by  
specific immunoperoxidase staining in BB/W and Wistar rats at 6, 9, 12, and 15  
weeks. Antigen-presenting cells and class II (Ia) antigen expression on  
thyrocytes were also examined. The first immunological event apparent in the  
iodine-treated BB/W rats was a sharp increase in the number of Ia positive  
dendritic cells at 9 weeks compared with control BB/W and Wistar rats. In the  
iodine excess groups dendritic cells were associated with scattered areas of  
lymphocytic infiltration, comprising predominantly T helper cells (W3/25). T  
suppressor cells (OX 8) and IL-2 receptor positive activated T-cells (OX 39)  
were both present in small numbers. B-cells (OX 12) were absent. In addition,  
thyrocytes did not exhibit Ia antigen expression. By contrast, lymphocytic  
infiltration was not found at 9 weeks in control BB/W rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

Iodine-induced subclinical hypothyroidism in euthyroid subjects with a
previous episode of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) occurs most frequently in patients
with  
underlying thyroid disease and is generally believed to be due to the iodine  
contamination of amiodarone and iodine released by the metabolism of the drug.  
We and others have suggested that the thyrotoxicosis may also be secondary to  
amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. To further determine the etiology of AIT, we  
administered large doses of iodides [10 drops saturated solution of potassium  
iodide (SSKI) daily] to 10 euthyroid patients long after an episode of AIT  
believed to be due at least in part to amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. Six of  
these 10 patients had an abnormal iodide-perchlorate discharge test before
SSKI  
administration, indicating a subtle defect in the thyroidal organification of  
iodide. During SSKI administration, 6 patients developed marked iodine-induced  
basal and/or TRH-stimulated serum TSH elevations, 2 had suppressed basal and  
TRH-stimulated TSH values, and 2 had normal TSH responses compared to  
SSKI-treated euthyroid subjects with no history of amiodarone ingestion or  
thyroid disease. Serum T4 and T3 concentrations remained normal and unchanged  
during SSKI administration in both the AIT patients and control subjects.
These  
results strongly suggest that excess iodine may not be the cause of the  
hyperthyroidism associated with amiodarone therapy, especially in those
patients  
with probable amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. Furthermore, like patients with
a  
previous history of subacute thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, the
present  
results suggest that some patients with a previous history of AIT may be at
risk  
to develop hypothyroidism when given excess iodine.

The relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and iodine intake: a
review.  
Foley TP Jr.  
Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes Mellitus, School of
Medicine,  
University of Pittsburgh.  
There is evidence to suggest that elevated levels of iodide in the diet are  
associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) in susceptible individuals,
and  
that autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) is less common in
susceptible  
individuals who live in regions with dietary iodine deficiency. There are  
epidemiologic studies in endemic goiter areas that report an increase in ATD,  
particularly thyroiditis, after the therapeutic administration of iodized
salt,  
bread and oil. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid is rarely found in  
patients from severe endemic goiter regions, yet there is a reversal of this  
observation after dietary iodine supplementation. Thyroid antibodies, both  
thyroglobulin (TgAb) and peroxidase (TpAb) or microsomal, were not detected in  
serum from patients with endemic goiter, but became positive in 43% of
subjects  
three and six months after therapy with iodized oil, and there developed  
transient hyperthyroidism. Similarly, the addition of iodine to the diet or
the  
administration of iodine-containing medications increases the frequency of ATD  
and the severity of existing autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, autoimmune  
thyroiditis has been induced by the administration of excess iodide to strains  
of chickens and rats that are genetically predetermined to develop the
disease.  
We are beginning to understand the pathogenesis of ATD. In hyperthyroidism the  
evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb)  
stimulate the TSH receptor to induce excessive and sustained secretion of  
thyroid hormones. Cellmediated immune mechanisms, such as antibody dependent  
cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), initiate the lymphocytic infiltration and  
thyrocytotoxicity in autoimmune thyroiditis. The mechanisms that initiate the  
development of the abnormal immune response and the relationship of ATD with  
excess iodide are poorly understood. There is evidence that an increase in the  
iodination of thyroglobulin (Tg) enhances its immunogenicity. The results of  
clinical and experimental studies support the requirement of a genetic  
predisposition to the development of ATD that may be precipitated by exposure
to  
certain environmental factors. Another mechanism supported by experimental
data  
is the direct toxic effect of excess iodide on iodide-deficient thyroid
glands.  
High concentrations of iodide after oxidation to iodine causes epithelial  
necrosis and inflammation associated with lipofuscin accumulation suggestive
of  
toxicity mediated by lipid peroxidation from excessive amounts of free
radicals.  
The epithelial damage would initiate inflammatory and immune responses.
Although  
these mechanisms would relate to the onset of autoimmune thyroiditis on
exposure  
to excessive amounts of iodide, the relationship of iodide intake and
autoimmune  
hyperthyroidism is less clear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

To assess the importance of the role of thyroidal iodine in the pathogenesis
of  
thyroiditis in the obese strain (OS) chicken, a model of spontaneous and
severe  
disease, we studied the effect of antithyroid drugs that reduce thyroidal
iodine  
or prevent its metabolism. Reduction of thyroidal iodine was achieved with  
KClO4, an inhibitor of iodine transport and mononitrotyrosine (MNT), a drug
that  
promotes loss of thyroidal iodine as iodotyrosines. A regimen consisting of  
KClO4 and MNT administration beginning in ovo and continuing after hatching  
reduced thyroidal infiltration to 2% of control values and decreased  
thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) production for as long as 9 wk. Untreated birds  
had severe disease by 5 wk of age. The suppression of disease was independent
of  
TSH, not mediated by generalized immunosuppression and reversed by excess  
dietary iodine. Two drugs that inhibit the metabolism of iodine,  
propylthiouracil (PTU) and aminotriazole, reduced thyroidal infiltration and  
TgAb levels, although to a lesser extent. When splenocytes from OS chickens
with  
thyroiditis were transferred to Cornell strain (CS) chickens, a related strain  
that develops late onset mild disease, only the recipients that were iodine  
supplemented developed thyroiditis. In conclusion, autoimmune thyroiditis in
an  
animal model can be prevented by reducing thyroidal iodine or its metabolism
and  
optimal effects require intervention at the embryonic stage.

Iodine and thyroid disease.  
Woeber KA.  
Mount Zion Medical Center, University of California, San Francisco.  
Iodine is a requisite substrate for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones, the  
minimum daily requirement being about 50 micrograms. An autoregulatory
mechanism  
within the thyroid serves as the first line of defense against fluctuations in  
the supply of iodine and also permits escape from the inhibition of hormone  
synthesis that a very large quantity of iodine induces (Wolff-Chaikoff effect  
and escape therefrom). Environmental iodine deficiency continues to be a  
significant public health problem worldwide, compounded in some geographic  
regions by the presence of other goitrogens in some staple foods. The
pathologic  
consequences of severe iodine deficiency include endemic goiter, endemic  
cretinism, increased fetal and infant mortality, and an increased prevalence
in  
the community of cognitive and neuromotor disabilities. The implementation of
an  
iodization program prevents endemic cretinism and reduces the frequency of the  
other pathologic consequences of iodine deficiency. Iodine excess results  
principally from the use of iodine-containing medicinal preparations or  
radiographic contrast media. The pathologic consequences of iodine excess will  
ensue only when thyroid autoregulation is defective, in that escape from the  
Wolff-Chaikoff effect cannot occur, or when autoregulation is absent.
Defective  
autoregulation characterizes the fetal and neonatal thyroid, Hashimoto's  
thyroiditis, radioiodine or surgically treated Graves' hyperthyroidism, the  
thyroid of patients with cystic fibrosis, and the thyroid that has been
exposed  
to weak inhibitors of the organic binding of iodine. In these circumstances,
the  
provision of excess iodine may lead to iodide goiter with or without  
hypothyroidism. Absent autoregulation may be a feature of longstanding  
multinodular goiter, and the provision of excess iodine in this circumstance
may  
induce thyrotoxicosis (Jod-Basedow disease). The pathologic consequences of  
iodine excess will resolve when the source of iodine has been dissipated. In  
addition to its role in reversing iodine deficiency, iodine is used as  
adjunctive therapy for hyperthyroidism. By inhibiting the proteolytic release
of  
iodothyronines from thyroglobulin, it induces a prompt slowing of thyroid  
hormone secretion. This effect is exploited in the treatment of thyrotoxic  
crisis or severe thyrocardiac disease. Iodine also reduces thyroid cellularity  
and vascularity and therefore is used in the preparation of the patient for  
thyroidectomy. Finally, by exploiting the failure of escape from the  
Wolff-Chaikoff effect, iodine may also be used in the early management of  
radioiodine-treated Graves' hyperthyroidism.

rats.  
Reinhardt W, Appel MC, Alex S, Yang YN, Braverman LE.  
Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester  
01655\.  
The BB/Wor rat spontaneously develops autoimmune insulin dependent diabetes  
mellitus and lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT). Excess iodine ingestion enhances
and  
low iodine diet decreases the incidence of LT in this rat model but does not  
affect the incidence of diabetes mellitus. The administration of a low dose of  
methimazole (MMI; 870 ng/gm bw ip daily) from 30-90 days of age had no  
significant effect on thyroid function or on the incidence of iodine induced
LT  
and serum anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies measured by an ELISA assay. A
large  
dose of MMI (0.05% in the drinking water) induced goiter and hypothyroidism.
In  
addition, the incidence of LT was markedly attenuated (76% vs 6%, p less than  
0.001) and reduced titers of serum anti-Tg antibodies (0.59 +/- 0.1 OD vs 0.08  
+/- 0.01, p less than 0.001) were observed. This inhibitory effect of MMI on
the  
occurrence of iodine induced LT in the BB/Wor rat may be due to the lower  
antigenicity of the poorly iodinated Tg secondary to MMI therapy and/or to an  
immunosuppressant effect of MMI itself.

[Experimental goiter formation]  
[Article in French]  
Denef JF.  
Nodules formation in goiter is still poorly understood due to the lack of an  
adequate animal model. The key role of iodine in the increased heterogeneity
of  
iodine metabolism and in cold follicle formation has been demonstrated.  
Administration of iodide excess to goitrous mice induces follicle cell
necrosis  
and thyroiditis. Necrosis and inflammation can be prevented by reducing the  
iodine dose, giving T3 or T4, or combining iodide with antithyroid drugs or  
vitamin E. This suggest that iodide toxicity is related to excessive
production  
of free radicals. During inflammation, Ia positive interstitial cells were  
increased in number whereas no Ia expression was seen in follicular cells.

Q: mr Peat I was wondering how do you deal with drinking 1% or 2% milks in the
usa? Considering they all have significant amounts of added vitamin A. Doesnt
that provide excessive vitamin A especially when youre drinking a gallon of
milk a day, or do you limit your intake of milk in order to avoid the added
vitamins?  
Have you looked into whey protein powder? Is whey protein powder made from raw
whole milk, or is it made from pasteurized milks with the added vitamins? If
the whey protein powder is made from milk that does not have any added
vitamins in it, should we look into getting our protein needs mostly from a
good grass fed whey protein product, and limiting milk consumption  
**A: I don’t think there’s a risk of too much vitamin A from a gallon; the
emulsifier risk is from allergic reactions. Dehydration causes some oxidative
damage to cystein and tryptophane, at least.**  
  
Q: But a gallon of milk would contain about 9600 IU vitamin A palmitate?
Additional liver, cheese, etc could even add more to that.  
**A: Very large amounts of vitamin A can interfere with thyroid functions, and
with a vitamin E deficiency it can autooxidize, but that only happens with
doses of 100s of thousands of units. The allergenicity of things like PEG and
polysorbate decreases as their profitability rises, along with industry bribes
to the regulatory agencies. This corruption goes back to the 1940s and the
rise of the giant “food” industries.

To diagnose his near-fatal allergy attacks, this patient became 'Sherlock
Holmes.' (And he found the culprit.)  
Daily Briefing  
To diagnose his near-fatal allergy attacks, this p...  
When a man with no known allergies experienced two near-fatal anaphylactic
reactions, he turned detective to unearth what caused the allergic reactions
that almost killed him, Lisa Sanders writes for the New York Times Magazine.  
  
A near-fatal incident  
The man "had never had any allergies—except, according to his parents, some
trouble with penicillin when he was a child." But that changed when he was
receiving treatment for arthritis in his neck. Physical therapy wasn't helping
with the arthritic pain, so the man's doctor suggested a steroid injection
into the spinal area to reduce inflammation.  
  
The shot itself was not painful, according to Sanders, but when the man stood
up, he felt warm. "His hair was drenched in sweat. He felt pins and needles
all over his body ... his arms and hands were covered by angry red welts,"
Sanders writes. Before the man blacked out, he felt the "quick sting" of an
epinephrine shot in his thigh.  
  
In the ED, he was given more epinephrine and IV fluids. Doctors said he was
allergic to the steroid medication. But Sanders writes that diagnosis "didn't
make sense" because "[t]he body is naturally awash with steroid hormones."  
  
The experience left the man "wary" of unfamiliar medications, Sanders writes.
But it wasn't until two years that he experienced his second, nearly fatal
reaction: Minutes after swallowing a laxative for a colonoscopy, the man's
"mouth started to itch and the strange pins-and-needles feeling that preceded
the welts started." He took a dose of Benadryl, which helped subdue his
symptoms.  
  
The man contacted his doctor and requested a different laxative to prepare for
the colonoscopy. The man was "relieved" to see that the next laxative had a
different name and was made by a different manufacturer, Sanders writes. He
drank a glass of the medication, and soon felt the sweating, welts, and pins
and needles returning—and this time, Benadryl didn't help.  
  
The man's wife heard a loud crash throughout the house, and she discovered her
husband on the floor. His "face was swollen ... his eyes were open but
unseeing," and "a strange gurgling noise emanated from his open mouth,"
Sanders writes.  
  
When E.M.T.s arrived, the man's blood pressure was so low it couldn't be
detected, and his trachea was "dangerously narrowed" by swollen tissue. "When
he opened his eyes, he heard the E.M.T.s discussing whether they would need to
cut a hole in his airway," Sanders writes, "But his breathing improved, and he
was once again hustled to the [ED] by ambulance." The man was taken to the
Williamson Medical Center, where he was given more epinephrine and IV fluids,
and was discharged after a few hours.  
  
The sleuthing begins  
The man wanted to get to the bottom of his mysterious, life-threatening
allergy. "He was allergic to something that nearly killed him," Sanders
writes, but he didn't know what it was.  
  
The man scheduled an appointment at Vanderbilt's allergy clinic, but the next
available slot was weeks away. So he decided to take matters into his own
hands.  
  
His first step was to learn what medications has triggered his allergic
reactions. From the first doctor, he learned he'd been given a steroid
medicine called Depo-Medrol. Through some internet sleuthing, he learned the
name of the laxative that had caused his anaphylaxis, GaviLyte-C, and the one
that caused the milder reaction, MoviPrep. All three products had two
ingredients in common: sodium chloride and polyethylene glycol (PEG).  
  
The man "ate a lot of salt," so he ruled that out as the culprit causing his
allergic reaction, Sanders writes. However, the man was not familiar with PEG,
which turned out to be "an inert chemical" used as a filler and lubricant in
hand lotions, pills, and gel caps, as well as steroids and laxatives.  
  
At his appointment with Cosby Stone, a physician at Vanderbilt who specializes
in allergic reactions to medication, the man said, "I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job or anything ... but I'm pretty sure I'm allergic to PEG."  
  
When the man told the doctor his story, "Stone was amazed," Sanders writes,
adding, "Few patients come in linking an allergy to such an obscure product."  
  
Stone discussed the case with an adviser, Elizabeth Phillips, to determine
whether PEG could be behind the man's severe allergic reactions.  
  
The doctors found evidence of similar cases when reviewing literature. "They
returned to the room and congratulated the man on his sleuthing abilities,"
Sanders writes.  
  
The mystery is solved  
For the next few weeks, the doctors set out to prove that PEG was causing the
man's anaphylaxis.  
  
After testing, they found that the man had a "severe allergy to PEG" and
polysorbate 80, one of PEG's "chemical cousins," Sanders writes. The allergy
most likely developed because the man was often exposed to industrial PEG at
his job at the regional power company. For "genetically predisposed
individuals, … repeated exposure can lead to an allergic reaction," Sanders
writes.  
  
The doctors advised the man to perform a thorough inspection of the
ingredients of unfamiliar products or drugs before using them, and told him to
get a medical alert bracelet that could alert others of his allergy. The
doctors warned him that "the chemical is everywhere," Sanders writes. **

Me: How come the left is so willing to accept mainstream, corporate
viewpoints?  
  
  
Ray:  
  
I think the way to interpret it is that the real left, starting in the 1940s,
has been disappeared, and in its absence, the antiwar, anti-imperialist humane
issues of the paleoconservatives have become more conspicuous, but without any
foundation for effectiveness. In place of the union-based left, the “new left”
was created by the agencies that neutered the unions. In the late 1960s there
were people like Martin L. King who were reconnecting unionism with
antiimperialism, but the outcome was to intensify the promotion of the pseudo-
left, new left, issues. Racial “equality," disconnected from the class system
and from reality, became a tool of the CIA-FBI. The Democratic party
cooperates in keeping potential left activists completely out of the system.

Q: any other thoughts on altitude tents, would sleeping with your head under a
pillow and blanket provide some benefits similar to bag breathing and high
altitudes? its odd it smelled bad, maybe some odd materials or something.  
are you sure the supplement was just [ creatine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/creatine-monohydrate-creapure/) , many of
these supplements are pre workout mixes with massive amounts of caffeine and
sometimes other nutrients like citrulline, beta alanine, and all inds of other
amino acids or stimulants. what are the risks to creatine, does it cause
overmethylation symptoms.  
some people get their whole room EMF proof using apparently silver paint to
block EMF. and somehow they make their whole room high altitude by lowering
air pressure and oxygen...  
**A: Supplements nearly always do more harm than good, but sometimes the right
amount for a short time is necessary.  
It’s easier to increase CO2 in a tightly weatherized house than to reduce the
pressure and oxygen significantly, and CO2 protects against the damage done by
excess oxygen. **  
  
Q: Mr Peat, what kind of women do you like, and do you think men with good
metabolisms like women with bigger breasts and curves whereas men with lower
metabolisms are more likely to be into other men. or does metabolism have

**Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy**  
  
Me: I heard a report about this condition on the radio recently. The presenter
explained that the condition was usually seen in menopausal women and called
it a broken heart syndrome . I thought it was a joke but it seems they were
serious. Please could you explain this condition in the context of menopause,
Is this a case of excess oestrogen or poor thyroid function?  
  
Dr. Peat: There’s evidence that it involves low thyroid and increased
estrogen, and low body temperature. Women with the syndrome are likely to have
a history of migraines and Raynaud’s pnenomenon. It happens 9 times as often
in women as in men.

Me:  
Hello Ray!  
  
I hope you can help me out there. I seem to recall you having said something
about the QT intervals as indicative of how responsive heart muscles are in
relaxing, and with that it can be used as a gauge for hypothyroidism.  
  
This lines up also with the behavior of the Achilles tendon as used in the
Achilles Tendon reflex test.  
  
While the Achilles tendon test requires one to observe the speed of the reflex
and make a qualitative judgment on thyroid status, I find having an ECG and
using the computed QTc value more easy to use to determine the thyroid state.  
  
I have been using 440 msec as my basis. If the value value is higher, one is
hypothyroid. Is this a correct cut-off value to use?  
  
Thank you and hope you are having a nice summer weekend!  
  
Ray:  
  
I think it might be quite a bit shorter than 440 when thyroid level is best.

A. I. Zotin, "Aging and rejuvenation from the standpoint of the thermodynamics
of irreversible processes," Priroda 9, 49-55, 1970. [The process of aging
"...is manifested by a decrease in entropy and...also by a continuous decrease
in the rate of heat production.. The organism exhibits two types of approaches
to a steady state: (i) constitutive movement of the system to the final steady
state and (ii) inducible return of the system to the current steady state
after deviating under the influence of internal or external factors. Oogenesis
represents a constitutive deviation from the steady state; entropy reaches a
level sufficient for the start of development and passage of the living system
into the state of constitutive approach to the final steady state. From the
standpoint of the thermodynamic theory of development, oogenesis reflects the
process of regeneration of the system. In all other stages of life there is

Me: Thoughts on novavax, a direct spike protein vaccine (no mrna or viral

Ray:  
Any adjuvant can be a problem. In principle, a toxic protein is better than
the RNA for a toxic protein, but it takes a long time to know the risks and
benefits of any vaccine.  
  
Me: Thoughts on the claim that 99% of people dying are unvaccinated?  
  
Ray:  
Since they have so far been lying about all the important issues, I assume
this is also a lie. If a sick person has been vaccinated, and has the usual
comorbidities, the preferred diagnosis of the cause of death would be one of
the other problems. The practice with the unvaccinated has been to list the
cause of death as covid, if they have a cough and a fever, or if they have
tested positive by PCR for the virus, even when they might have cancer,
cardiac infarction, diabetes, or traumatic injury, and even though the PCR
test at 40 cycles is meaningless.  
  
Me: Is it possible to make a safe vaccine without an adjuvant?  
  
Ray:  
Rubbing an inactivated virus into the skin will activate the immune system,
probably much more effectively than injecting it, and the more organized
reaction is likely to involve much lower production of antibodies. Since
Ehrlich and his magic bullet pharmaceutical advertising slogan, the magic
bullet antibody has been treated as the essence of immunity. Metchnikoff’s

but it didn’t fit well into the “each disease has its appropriate drug”
business plan.

**A: I haven’t gone near an airport since they got the x-ray machines and the
guns. I always travel by car, ship or train. I don’t distinguish between work
and fun.**  
  
Q: Sir how to protect ourselves from emf and radiation and 5g  
Calcium and milk helps?  
Liver? Vitamin d?  
  
**A: A room or house can be shielded with screens attached to ground.**  
  
  
Q: What kind if screens, the silver metal screens..? Is silver the only metal
that protects from EMF  
Sir do you have a smartphone with the gmail app? How did you reply to my email
so quickly  
Sir what dietary things can we use to protect from EMF or help detox their
effects...  
I heard calcium and magnesium can help  
But obviously magnesium supplements are dangerous  
Several people get a hair shedding effect from  
Vitamin K2 MK4  
I think its actions with calcium lead it to maybe drop calcium too low which
results in prolactin and PTH rising which is why this hair shedding effect
occurs from K2 MK4...  
  
  
**A:Any conductor works, e.g. iron or copper. No cell phone, it’s just chance
when I answer an email. From internet reports, doing anything can cause hair
shedding.**  
  
  
Q: Im not sure whats changed but ive heard [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) is extracted
from wild yam or from diosgenin. Maybe in the past it was sourced from beef
brains or something and was safer. [ Taurine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/ajinomoto-taurine-usp-grade/) doesnt have
serious side effects, but modern taurine supplements have side effects in many
people, and i remember in the past it was extracted from bull testicles
whereas now its chemically synthesized...  
  
**A: From the symptoms people are describing, I think some of the pregnenolone
being sold is contaminated. I ate 3000 mg per day 35 years ago, when only one
big company was making it.  
The pregnenolone I had was made from wild yam diosgenin by Syntex, which had
the best equipment and the best chemists. There are dozens of companies making
it now, and like most other products, it’s being made without the best
available methods which would be too expensive. **  
  
Q: In the past, many people got sunlight and outdoor activity. Yet there were
both white europeans, asians and arabs, yet also darker native Americans,
south americans, indians and africans.  
It seems the darker skin color and darker hair color is not just a result of
being in the sun longer but is because the darker skin color likely resulted
from cultures who were nudist or who showed a lot more skin?  
Keep in mind the european whites had Conservative Christian culture, the
Arabian whites had Islamic culture, these two groups would wear covering
clothing and cover most of the body even in warm desert weather.  
The indians and africans had tribal cultures and different religions more open
to nudity.  
Is this why arabs and europeans are lighter skinned while indians and africans
are darker? All these groups were out in sunlight all day, except the arabs
and europeans likely werent showing as much skin?  
  
**A: I think so; covering the skin can create a vitamin D deficiency unless
certain kinds of food are available, so lighter skinned people will be more
likely to survive in those conditions.**  
  
Q: What causes these large noses to develop in many Indian and African people?
How come the large noses are seen as unattractive by so many people, it seems
many people prefer medium colored skin tones or lighter skin tones, and prefer
smaller noses to larger noses. Are these things like very dark skin and huge
noses harmful to the body in some way, is it like an overdose of sunlight that
causes these effects?  
  
**A: Stressful prenatal conditions reduce the size of the eyeballs and brain,
and those defects are biologically recognized. The shape of eyelids and noses
has very little biological meaning, and the preferences are powerfully shaped
by the history of colonialism.**  
  
  
  
Q: Are you usually home these days? What do you do for fun besides painting?
Seems like you use the computer a lot!  
Professor Peat  
Is reaching puberty at 11 years old early for men, whats the ideal age for
puberty for men...  
Sir whats your thoughts on myostatin  
Do you believe the stories? Christian/Islamic Prophet Noahs grandfather
Methlusah, lived until 967 years old. Prophet Adam was apparently 50 feet
tall... do you think these things were true  
Someone said the oceans all used to be in the skies, providing a shell and
protection from radiation, and that this allowed humans and animals to get to
much much larger sizes and development have you heard of the oceans all being
in the skies and after the great flood they settled at the bottom...  
Sir, apparently gelatin lacks all the BCAA and methionine and histidine and
tryptophan and cysteine... is it not a good protein soudce since BCAAA are
especially needed  
Everyone seems to hate big noses including peoole who have them...whys that,
is there maybe something indicating poor health when it comes to a very large
nose on someone...  
  
**A: Gelatin contains the BCAA; its value is the lack of the pro-inflammatory
amino acids that are required for growth. All of our tissues have self
regulating growth systems, to maintain proper organismic form.**  
  
Q: Are there any vaccines you approve of? Some people claim polio vaccines are
really important and etc  
IT all seems strange... i dint think any vaccine are needed  
  
**A: It’s mostly just something to keep doctors busy; the tetanus vaccine has
only killed a few people (botulism has rarely killed kids).  
The new RNA things are extremely different, have already killed many more than
all the other vaccine together.

Q: Whats that on bitchute you linked there  
Did you take any vaccines yourself do you think polio and tetanus and
meningitis vaccines are safe  
Do you like eating fertile eggs  
Apprently they inhibit myostatin leading to more muscle growth  
  
  
**A: That’s about the corona virus and vaccine. I haven’t been vaccinated, and
don’t usually eat fertile eggs.**  
  
  
Q: Have you tried milk from guernsey, jersey, ayrshire, milking shorthorn,
brown swiss, illawatta, dutch belt cows?  
All have very different tastes flavors.  
DO you think the taste of milk changes depending whether its a guernsey dad,
jersey mom vs a jersey dad and guernsey mom? Maybe it leans more towards one
direction depending on parents breeds? Even though both are jersey guernsey
mixes  
Sir would you ever drink human breast milk? Apparently its very digestible and
nutritious apparently theres a market for it. Do you think the taste of breast
Milk changes depending whether the mama is black or white or asian or indian
or latina etc...  
  
**A: I haven’t tried them all; even within a breed, individual cows have
slightly individual flavors, and it varies over time, depending on how they
feel and what they eat. It’s the same with people, their diet affects the
flavor, and it’s sweeter when they are happy.**  
  
  
Q: Which cow breed do you like best?  
Dutch belt are very rare, less than 1500 in the world, the ones in the US are
closer to the original breed than the ones in eirope now, you can actually
order raw dutch milk online from dutchmeadowsfarm.com,  
Worth a try for it  
Brown swiss, ayrshire, illawatta and milking shorthorn seem very tough to find
in the US.  
Jersey milk seems best, followed by jersey holstein mix, followed bt holstein,
followed by dutch belt and then guernsey  
The guernsey and jersey milks are golden yellow colored instead of white,
apparently they have a lot more nutrients than the holstein milk and some say
white milk only exists now because of factory farmed cowd and if milk is white
it lacks nutrients compared to non white milk  
  
**A: Jerseys are my favorite, for personality, but the flavor depends mainly
on what they eat.**  
  
  
Q: Where can we get breast milk as adults, and would it be healthier to drink
breast milk from a healthy human than from a different animal mate  
  
**A: There are internet places that sell it frozen for women who can’t produce
enough milk.**

Q:  
I believe I heard in one of your interviews that your house was cement - To
protect myself from outside temperature, EMF, 5G, etc. - would a fully cement
home with many windows for sunlight be a good start for a peat-friendly home?  
  
Ray:  
It depends on the climate. Thick cement walls, with insulination on the
outside, keep the temperature relatively steady, so that the day’s heat keeps
the nights warm, and cool nights keep the days from overheating. My favorite
houses have been adobe, with thick mud walls and high ceilings. For example,
an old house in Mexico with neither heating nor cooling stayed around 69
degrees F most of the time.

Microdosing psychedelics: More questions than answers? An overview and
suggestions for future research  
Kim Pc Kuypers, Livia Ng, David Erritzoe, Gitte M Knudsen, Charles D Nichols,
David E Nichols, Luca Pani, Anaïs Soula, David Nutt.  
Background:  
In the past few years, the issue of ‘microdosing’ psychedelics has been openly
discussed in the public arena where claims have been made about their positive
effect on mood state and cognitive processes such as concentration. However,
there are very few scientific studies that have specifically addressed this
issue, and there is no agreed scientific consensus on what microdosing is.  
Aim:  
This critique paper is designed to address questions that need to be answered
by future scientific studies and to offer guidelines for these studies.  
Approach:  
Owing to its proximity for a possible approval in clinical use and short-
lasting pharmacokinetics, our focus is predominantly on psilocybin. Psilocybin
is allegedly, next to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), one of the two most
frequently used psychedelics to microdose. Where relevant and available, data
for other psychedelic drugs are also mentioned.  
Conclusion:  
It is concluded that while most anecdotal reports focus on the positive
experiences with microdosing, future research should also focus on potential
risks of (multiple) administrations of a psychedelic in low doses. To that
end, (pre)clinical studies including biological (e.g. heart rate, receptor
turnover and occupancy) as well as cognitive (e.g. memory, attention)
parameters have to be conducted and will shed light on the potential negative
consequences microdosing could have.

Q:Mate why not drink breast milk instead of cows milk...  
What do you eat when travelling  
**A:Obviously the expense. J.D. Rockefeller had his daily milkshake. Cow's
milk is almost as good.**  
  
Q: Professor Peat  
I dont follow, are you saying jd rockefeller drank human breast milk daily,
and you’d do the same if it was readily available? Where did rockefeller get
his milk supply from?  
Sir, you mentioned covering skin causing vitamin d deficiency...  
what were people in colder climates supposed to eat, apparently the cod liver
oil was excellent source of vitamim d3 but if thats not acceptable how are
people in the colder places supposed to get vitamim d since sunlights scarce
and their clothes cover their skin as well... are people not meant to be
living in very cold places to begin with...  
**A: Cod liver is a better source of vitamin D than cod liver oil.**  
  
Q: As a grown adult, should breast milk be sourced from someone you know, and
can trust isnt using vaccines or PUFA or all those different things  
**A: It’s more likely than cow’s milk to transmit disease.**  
  
Q: SIr did rockefeller drink breast milk daily? Was it his wifes or whos  
**A: Having one’s own cow reduces the risk of infection. Rockefeller bought
it.**  
  
Q: Is it worth drinking breast milk and is it better to get it from a family
member, significant other, or like online, or whoever's healthiest  
**A: I don’t think it’s worth the bother and expense.**  
  
Q: Dr Peat i heard you said A2 vs A1 shouldn’t matter but A2 seems to cause no
digestion issues in many people also heard A2 has proline on the molecule
whereas A1 has a histidine instead of proline or something... supposedly A1
has more of an opioid effect than A2...  
**A: The differences in the milk have been demonstrated by injecting the
partially digested casein into the brains of mice. As far as science goes, the
difference is only a matter for marketing. People are easily changed by
advertising. Medicine in the last 100 years has been nothing but the creation
of a more and more lucrative market.**  
  
Q: Sir How tall are you and how long have you been vaccine, fluoride and xray
free  
**A: I haven’t measured for years, but the last time, maybe 5 years ago, I had
grown another half inch since I had an exam for a drivers license five years
before that. About 5’10”. I drank fluoridated water unknowingly for about 3
days while visiting; I always reject x-rays; never vaccinated as a child.**  
  
Q: A2 is proline A1 is opood? A1 only developed 1000 years ago apparently due
to animals being sick and fed cow meat  
**A: Advertisers always make up anything to sell the product.**  
  
Q: Dr Peat , have you heard of belgian blue cattle  
OF you google them they look very impressive... extremely lean, muscular,
apparently they, despite being given similar feed to other cows are able to
create a lot more muscle and store less fat apparently tis is due to them
having a myostatin deficiency  
**A: Their mother was scared by a body builder.**  
  
Q: I don’t understand?  
What allowed you to gain height in your 80s is it the high calcium diet and
good thyroidd function  
**A: I think it started in my 40’s when I first supplemented thyroid,[ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) , and
[ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) . I think spending time later in high altitude Mexico helped the
process.  
  
A popular (and widely believed) old wives’ tale in anglo culture was the idea
that birth defects reflected the image that was impressed on the pregnant
women:  
  
"Awhile ago there was a thread about jokes you didn't get in cartoons. I just
remembered this one:  
In Porky in Wackyland we find out that a three (Stooges) headed creature's
mother was "scared by a pawnbroker's sign." I never quite understood that
comment. What does that mean exactly?  
The only thing I could come up with is a similar comment in The Elephant Man,
where people blamed John Merrick's horrible deformity on the fact that his
mother was knocked down by an elephant while pregnant. Is the comment in
Wackyland meant to hint at this same sort of thing? Or am I way off base?" **  
  
Q: How can we get RU486 sir... I wonder what it would do given it's anti
cushing's effects  
**A: I think[ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) is as effective and easier to get. **

](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/13/7001?cct=2302)  
  
When a PCR tests positive for Covid what exactly is it finding?  
  
**Dr Peat: Several years ago, when the CDC was reporting big numbers of people
dying from seasonal “influenza,” actual tests were showing that the pneumonia
cases were associated with small percentages of influenza, corona, and
syncytial virus, some bacterial infections, and many with no identifiable
pathogen. The PCR test, according to Kary Mullis, can’t diagnose anything, and
isn’t valid when run for more than 20 or 25 cycles, because of the high number
of false positives with more cycles. Hospitals were instructed by WHO and CDC
to run it for 40 to 45 cycles, guaranteeing that it would almost always
produce a positive result. When the vaccines became available, the CDC
announced that they would be recommending a lower number of cycles. When they
wanted a frightening number of “cases,” at least 40 cycles, when they wanted
to show that vaccines were effective, a more reasonable number of cycles.
Influenza deaths disappeared suddenly the week that “covid” deaths spiked;
phony tests allowed them to rename the cause of death.

_**Me** _ :  
  
Dr. Peat, thank you again for all your efforts to educate people like myself.
You've been an important and impactful teacher in my life and others.  
  
One question I've heard you answer many times is the question of viral
isolation particularly whether or not SARSCOV2 exists. These questions are
brought up by people who have listened to the work of people like Andre
Kaufman and Tom Cowan.  
  
Your answer seems to be that one need not isolate a thing completely to view
its effects. I can't entirely comprehend this concept. It seems to me that in
order to show that something has a said effect it needs to be isolated in the
first place to know its effect. And knowing would then later reproduce
identification.  
  
The known definition of isolation many are looking for in studies that claim
to have isolated SARSCOV2 don't seem to have actually done it. The
purification of the samples seems absent and without purification there can be
no identification of a disease causing culprit.  
  
Here it is worded by the doctors I'm referring to [ Virus Isolation (SOVI) by
Morell, Cowan & Kaufman ](https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/sovi/)  
  
I'd love if you could offer some more clarity on why you believe SARSCOV2 to
exist and if it has ever been properly isolated and shown to be the causal
culprit of COVID19. Thank you!  
  
**Dr. Peat** :  
  
If they have a particular tissue extract that will cause the same symptoms
100% of the time, and find that putting that extract through a filter with a
smaller pore size results in an extract that never causes the disease, as
researchers were doing 120 years ago, they had evidence that a particle of a
certain size was causative. They they treated their sample in different ways,
showing that certain chemical or enzymic treatments would always destroy the
infectivity, narrowing the range of possibilities of the nature of the
infective substance. Specific antibodies produced in reaction to the substance
provided more information about its composition. A very large number of tests
increased knowledge of the composition of the infective substances. When
electron microscopes became available, images of the infective concentrates,
combined with chemistry, provided information about the spatial arrangement of
the chemical components whose presence and proportions were known. Procedures
known already to destroy infectivity of the substance could now be seen to
cause specific changes in the EM images. I think Cowan and Kaufman have just
skipped a century of the details of virology.

What can I tell people who are taking PDE5 inhibitors who may want to know
more about what they are taking and the risks?  
  
Thanks and I will post this to forums if you respond as many people have the
same questions.

Serious side-effects of lucrative drugs usually aren’t discovered until after
patents have expired; who would fund the research? They work by increasing
inflow to the penis, but testosterone works by reducing outflow, and its

Avermectin Confers Its Cytotoxic Effects by Inducing DNA Damage and
Mitochondria-Associated Apoptosis

Avermectin (AVM) has been widely used in agriculture and animal husbandry on
the basis of its broad spectrum of effective anthelmintic activity and
specificity targets. However, AVM induction of cytotoxicity through DNA damage
is remains elusive. Here we investigate the cytotoxic effects of AVM in human
nontarget cells in vitro. We clarify that AVM inhibited the viability of HeLa
cells and enhanced apoptosis. We have used alkaline comet assay and γH2AX foci
formation to detect DNA damage of HeLa cells. As expected, we found AVM caused
DNA double-strand breaks in HeLa cells, as measured by significance of comet
assay parameters (e.g., tail DNA) and increases of γH2AX foci in HeLa cells.
Moreover, established assays of cytotoxicity were performed to characterize
the mechanism of AVM toxicity on HeLa cells. The results demonstrated the
collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and up-regulating the expression
level of Bax/Bcl-2 resulted in a release of cytochrome c into cytosol as well
as the activation of caspase-9/-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP). We conclude that AVM has a potential risk to human health by inducing
human cell DNA damage and mitochondria-associated apoptosis.

Abamectin affects the bioenergetics of liver mitochondria: A potential
mechanism of hepatotoxicity  
Juliana C Castanha Zanoli 1 , Marcos A Maioli, Hyllana C D Medeiros, Fábio E
Mingatto  
Free article  
Abstract  
Abamectin (ABA) is a macrocyclic lactone of the avermectin family used
worldwide as an antiparasitic agent in farm animals and pets and as the active
ingredient of insecticides and nematicides. In this study, the effects of
abamectin on the bioenergetics of mitochondria isolated from rat liver were
evaluated. Mitochondria are responsible for converting the energy released by
electron transport and stored as the binding energy molecule ATP. Xenobiotics
that interfere with its synthesis or utilization can be acutely or chronically
toxic. Abamectin (5-25μM) caused concentration-dependent inhibition of the
respiratory chain without affecting the membrane potential or the activity of
enzymes NADH dehydrogenase or succinate dehydrogenase. This behavior is
similar to oligomycin and carboxyatractyloside and suggests direct action on
F(o)F(1)-ATPase and/or the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). ABA more
pronouncedly inhibited ATPase phosphohydrolase activity in intact, uncoupled
mitochondria than in freeze-thawed disrupted mitochondria. ADP-stimulated
depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential was also inhibited by
ABA. Our results indicate that ABA interacts more specifically with the ANT,
resulting in functional inhibition of the translocator with consequent
impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics. This effect could be involved in
the ABA toxicity to hepatocytes.

The role of mitochondria and biotransformation in abamectin-induced
cytotoxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes

Free article  
Abstract  
Abamectin (ABA), which belongs to the family of avermectins, is used as a
parasiticide; however, ABA poisoning can impair liver function. In a previous
study using isolated rat liver mitochondria, we observed that ABA inhibited
the activity of adenine nucleotide translocator and FoF1-ATPase. The aim of
this study was to characterize the mechanism of ABA toxicity in isolated rat
hepatocytes and to evaluate whether this effect is dependent on its
metabolism. The toxicity of ABA was assessed by monitoring oxygen consumption
and mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ATP concentration, cell
viability, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, release of cytochrome c, caspase
3 activity and necrotic cell death. ABA reduces cellular respiration in cells
energized with glutamate and malate or succinate. The hepatocytes that were
previously incubated with proadifen, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, are more
sensitive to the compound as observed by a rapid decrease in the mitochondrial
membrane potential accompanied by reductions in ATP concentration and cell
viability and a disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis followed by
necrosis. Our results indicate that ABA biotransformation reduces its
toxicity, and its toxic action is related to the inhibition of mitochondrial
activity, which leads to decreased synthesis of ATP followed by cell death.

Avermectin induced inflammation damage in king pigeon brain  
Li-Jie Chen 1 , Bao-Hong Sun, Jian Ping Qu, Shiwen Xu, Shu Li  
To determine the effect of Avermectin (AVM) on inflammation damage in king
pigeon brain, eighty two-month-old American king pigeons were randomly divided
into four groups, and were fed with either commercial diet or AVM-supplemented
diet containing 20 mg kg(-1)diet, 40 mg kg(-1)diet, and 60 mg kg(-1)diet AVM
for 30, 60 and 90 d, respectively. Then, the expression level of inflammatory
factors (iNOS, PTGEs, NF-κB), histological damage, and ultra-structural damage
were examined. It showed that AVM caused higher expressions (P<0.05) of iNOS,
PTGEs, NF-κB with disorganized histological and ultra-structural structures in
cerebrum, cerebellum, and optic lobe. Meanwhile, inflammatory and
histopathological damage were induced by AVM in king pigeon brains. In
addition, the main targeted organelle in nervous system was mitochondria,
which indicated that mitochondria may be relevant to the process of
inflammation induced by AVM. To our best knowledge, this is the first report
to study the toxic effect of AVM on inflammatory damage in king pigeon. Thus,
the information presented in this study is believed to be helpful in
supplementing data for further AVM toxicity study.

Avermectin induced liver injury in pigeon: mechanisms of apoptosis and
oxidative stress  
Wen-Jun Zhu 1 , Ming Li, Ci Liu, Jian-Ping Qu, Ya-Hong Min, Shi-Wen Xu, Shu Li  
Extensive use of avermectin (AVM) can result in environment pollution, and it
is important to evaluate the potential impact this antibiotic has on
ecological systems. Few published literatures have discussed the liver injury
mechanisms induced by AVM on birds. In this study, pigeons were exposed to
feed containing AVM (0, 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg diet) for 30, 60, 90 days
respectively. The results showed that AVM increased the number of apoptosis
and the expression level of caspase-3, 8, fas mRNA in the liver of pigeons.
Ultrastructural alterations, including mitochondrial damage and chromatin
aggregation, become severe with increase exposure dose. Exposure to AVM
induced significant changes in antioxidant enzyme {superoxide dismutase (SOD)
and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)} activities and malondialdehyde (MDA)
content, augmented protein carbonyl (PCO) content and DNA-protein crosslink
(DPC) coefficient, in a concentration-dependent manner in the liver of
pigeons. Our results show that AVM has toxic effect in pigeon liver, and the
mechanism of injury caused by AVM is closely related to apoptosis and
oxidative stress.

Abstract  
Avermectin (AVM), as a biological insecticide, is widely used in agriculture
and forestry production globally. However, inhalation of AVM may pose a risk,
and the lung is the direct target, but the cytotoxicity of AVM on human lung
cells is still unclear. Here, we attempted to elucidate the cytotoxic effect
and molecular mechanism of AVM on human lung A549 cells. The results indicated
that AVM inhibits cell proliferation, and enhances programmed cell death
(apoptosis and autophagy). In addition, we found the AVM-treated cells showed
an obvious drop in mitochondrial membrane potential and LC3-I/II, increased
ROS production, DNA double-strand breaks, caspase-3/9 activated, PARP cleaved,
cytochrome c and Bax/Bcl-2 content rise. The results showed that AVM induced
mitochondria-related apoptosis and autophagy in lung A549 cells. These results
indicate that AVM can pose a potential threat to human health by inducing DNA
damage and programmed cell death.

Monitoring selective autophagy of mitochondria using super-resolution
microscopy  
Ziyue Li 1 , Nicholas T Ktistakis 2  
Selective elimination of damaged mitochondria via macroautophagy (mitophagy)
is a conserved cellular process that plays an important role in organismal
health. In recent years mitophagy has been studied in parallel to the more
general, non-selective autophagy pathway induced in response to amino acid
starvation with important similarities and differences noted between the two.
The elaborate sequence of membrane rearrangements that give rise to
autophagosomes in the non-selective pathway have their counterpart in
mitophagy, but with the addition of other factors, such as a ubiquitin mark
and mitophagy receptors, which mediate cargo recognition. In some types of
mitophagy such as the one induced by ivermectin, the forming autophagosomal
structure contains six different elements: the targeted mitochondrial
fragment, a section of endoplasmic reticulum that provides a cradle, a
ubiquitin layer, the mitophagy receptors and the early and late autophagosomal
proteins/membranes. Super-resolution microscopy is ideally suited to
investigate the spatial relationships between these elements that converge
together but retain some distinctive localization, and we provide here a
general protocol that can be used for mammalian cells.

Q:  
Hi Ray,  
  
do you think it is sensible to try to make ones own steroids and thyroid
supplements? I really do not like the idea of being too reliant on companies
that i know nothing of and i would like to get a little home lab started.  
How would you do that? Do you think this is a good idea? I am living in
germany and i can not find a source for methylene blue, and lately i have the
urge to start my own hobby lab.  
A:  
**If you have access to a farm or meat packing business to get thyroid glands,
preparing them for use can make a better product than is generally available.
The investment needed for making high quality steroids is very large; checking
the purity of, and potentially improving them, available bulk products is
practical.**  
  
Q2:  
Do you think it could be an issue having too many plants in a single room
apartment (i also sleep here). Will they not reduce co2 levels? Or is this a
nonissue, i tried readng papers about it but i can not really judge this, the
papers mostly deal with very small rooms (nasa clean air study)  
A:  
**During the night, plants emit CO2, so are helpful.**  
  
Response to answer:  
I lack undestanding but i think for example Dracaena trifasciata (mother in
law tongue) don't do this. They are reversing the process of releasing the co2
at day and up taking it at night or "holding their breath". this is why they
are sometimes recommended as bedroom plants (high co2 at night seen as bad)  
  
[ Crassulacean acid metabolism - Wikipedia

[ Crassulacean acid metabolism: plastic, fantastic
](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/53/369/569/614535)  
from the wiki:  
[ CAM plants ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAM_photosynthesis) that use
Crassulacean acid metabolism as an adaptation for arid conditions. CO2 enters
through the [ stomata ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomata) during the
night and is converted into the 4-carbon compound, [ malic acid
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malic_acid) , which releases CO2 for use in
the Calvin cycle during the day, when the stomata are closed. The dung jade
plant ( _[ Crassula ovata ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassula) _ ) and [
cacti ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus) are typical of CAM plants.
Sixteen thousand species of plants use CAM. [ [9]
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation#cite_note-Dodd02-9) These
plants have a carbon isotope signature of −20 to −10 ‰. [ [10]
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation#cite_note-O%27Leary88-10)  
  
maybe interesting to you, maybe i can find out how significant the effect is.  
  
May the co2 be high in your room mr peat.  
**A:  
I doubt that their metabolic rate is high enough to make a big difference,
compared to the amount people release. **  
  
Q3:  
Hi Ray,  
  
do you know if ammonia oxidizing bacteria have a negative side effect in their
metabolism in regards to human physiology?  
  
I have stopped taking regular showers after reading about david whitelocks
work, and he proposes the idea that animals like to roll in the mud because
they get bacteria through this, and the bacteria oxidizes ammonia which
results in less smelly body odor.  
  
I have tested this now for 1-2 years, only taking very little showers, never
with [ soap ](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/homemade-soap/) and
it works, i barely ever get a bad smell under my armpits, and others have
confirmed it.  
  
However, i wonder if the bacteria would have a negative effect (endotoxin or
nitric oxide or just a byproduct of the metabolism) that would be bad for the
human physiology.  
  
>The Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria studied by AOBiome consume ammonia as their
food source and produce NO.  
This increase of NO is what has me worried, but it is on the skin and wont be
relevant towards my physiology then?  
i am really confused about this, if you can provide any input i would really
appreciate it, no one ever talks about this anywhere.  
  
**A:  
I think bathing is the problem, but for different reasons. Soapy water removes
the lipid barrier, and that disturbs the complex lipid-steroid metabolism of
the skin, interfering with the natural antibiotic processes of the skin.

Abstract  
The eccrine gland is one of the major cutaneous appendages and secretes sweat.
Its principal function is thermoregulation during exposure to a hot
environment or physical exercise. In addition to this function, we show that
LL-37, a member of cathelicidin family of anti-microbial peptides, is
expressed in sweat. LL-37 protein and mRNA was seen in the eccrine structures
of normal human skin by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. LL-37
was localized to both the eccrine gland and sweat ductal epithelial cells,
whereas dermcidin, a previously described natural antibiotic in sweat, was
expressed only in the gland itself. The anti-microbial activity of LL-37 and
dermcidin against various bacteria in the sweat ionic environment was
demonstrated by solution colony forming assay using synthetic peptides, and in
sweat obtained from normal volunteers. These results indicate that
cathelicidin is secreted in human sweat, has potent anti-microbial activity
against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and can, after
processing from the preproform, provide a barrier for protection against
infection. Thus, sweat represents a unique mode of delivery for potent innate
immune effector molecules in the absence of inflammation. **

Continuing from above :  
  
Q:So it seems like the EU allows a maximum of 600 bec/kg . Do you think that's
a reasonable number ?  
I looked it up and some places in germany test every wild pig , because they
generally have higher Caesium137 levels .  
In my region there seems to be less radiation ,but they only test from time to
time because of that . I get sausages from a local farmer in Germany and
sometimes eat wild pig salami from Italy.  
  
A: I think Italy didn’t get the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl, so their
sausage should be safer.

Q :  
Hello Mr. Peat,  
I've been worrying about my money on my bank account, it seems to be less safe
then ever .  
I know you once said that investing money in chickens ,farm animals or farms
would be good .  
  
But if that isn't on option, for whatever reason , do you think investing in
physical gold or silver is an okay alternative?  
  
Thank you for your continuous answers.  
  
A: Yes, those are durable and portable, and will always have some value.

Q: Hi Ray,  
  
could you share your insights about denis noble? do you think it is good
material?  
If you can recommend someone or a good book to learn more about soil biology i
would greatly appreciate it. Have you written about soil biology in one of
your newsletters?  
Is peak phosphorus really a thing or just "club of rome" fearmongering as
usual.  
  
  
  
  
**A: His ideas on biological causation are very important. Too much phosphorus
in fresh water is a problem, but eventually brown kelp and plankton will be
practical sources of phosphorus for fertilizer.**  
  
  
_**Revealing the Ocean’s Hidden Fertilizer**  
May 14, 2015  
  
Phosphorus is one of the most common substances on Earth. An essential
nutrient for every living organism—humans require approximately 700 milligrams
per day—we are rarely concerned about consuming enough of it because it is
present in most of the foods we eat. Despite its ubiquity and living
organisms’ utter dependence on it, we know surprisingly little about how it
moves, or cycles, through the ocean environment.  
  
Scientists studying the phosphorus cycle in the ocean knew that it was
absorbed by plants and animals, and released back to seawater in the form of
phosphate as they decay and die. Over the last 10 years, a growing body of
research has hinted that phosphorus was being transformed by microbes in the
ocean in ways that remained a mystery.  
  
A new study by a research team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
(WHOI) and Columbia University reveals for the first time a marine phosphorus
cycle that is much more complex than previously thought. The work also
highlights the important but previously hidden role that some microbial
communities play in using and breaking down forms of this essential element.  
  
The paper is published May 15, 2015, in the journal Science.  
  
“This is an exciting new discovery that closes a fundamental knowledge gap in
our understanding of the marine phosphorus cycle,” says the study’s lead
author Ben Van Mooy, a biochemist at WHOI.  
  
Much like phosphorus-based fertilizers boost the growth of plants on land,
phosphorus in the ocean promotes the production of microbes and tiny marine
plants called phytoplankton, which compose the base of the marine food chain.
It’s been unclear exactly how phytoplankton are using the most abundant forms
of phosphorus found in the ocean—phosphates and a strange form of phosphorus
called phosphonates.  
  
“Phosphonates have always been a huge mystery,” Van Mooy says. “No one’s been
able to figure out exactly what they are, and more importantly, if they’re
made and consumed quickly by microbes, or if they’re just lying around in the
ocean.”  
  
To find out more about these mysterious phosphonates and how microbes
metabolize them, the researchers took samples of microbes like phytoplankton
from seawater obtained at a series of stations during a cruise from Bermuda to
Barbados in the summer of 2014. They added phosphate to the samples so that
they could see the microbes in action.  
  
The research team utilized ion chromatography on board the ship for water
chemistry analyses, which allowed them to observe how quickly the microbes
reacted to the added phosphate in the seawater.  
  
“The ion chromatograph (IC) separates out the different families of
molecules,” explains Van Mooy. “We added radioactive phosphate and then
isolated the phosphonate to see if they became radioactive too. It’s the
radioactive technique that let us see how fast they transform phosphate to
phosphonate.”  
  
They saw that about five percent of the phosphate in the shallow water samples
were taken up by the microbes and changed to phosphonates. In the deeper water
samples, which were taken at depths of 40 and 150 meters (131 feet and 492
feet), about 15 to 20 percent of the phosphates were reduced to phosphonates.  
  
“Although evidence of the cycling of phosphonates has been mounting for nearly
a decade, these results show for the first time that microbes are producing
phosphonates in the ocean, and that it is happening very quickly,” says
coauthor Sonya Dyhrman, an associate professor in the Department of Earth and
Environmental Sciences at Columbia University. “An exciting aspect of this
study was the application of the IC method at sea. In near real time, we could
tell that the phosphate we added was being transformed to phosphonate, and
everyone on the ship got to share in this moment and the process of
discovery.”  
  
A better understanding of phosphorus cycling in the oceans is important since
it impacts the marine food chain and, therefore, the ability of the oceans to
absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide. The researchers say that solving the
mystery about phosphonates also reinforces the need to identify the full suite
of phosphorus biochemicals being produced and metabolized by marine microbes
and what physiological roles they serve for these cells.  
  
“Such work will help us further resolve the complexities of how this critical
element is cycled in the ocean,” Dyhrman adds.  
  
“A reason to be excited about the findings of this elegant study is in the
paper’s last sentence: ‘the environmental, ecological, and evolutionary
controls . . . remain completely unknown.’ There’s still a lot we don’t know
about the sea,” says Don Rice, program director in the National Science
Foundation’s Division of Ocean Sciences, which funded the research.  
  
The work was also supported by grants from the Simons Foundation.  
  
The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is a private, non-profit organization
on Cape Cod, Mass., dedicated to marine research, engineering, and higher
education. Established in 1930 on a recommendation from the National Academy
of Sciences, its primary mission is to understand the ocean and its
interaction with the Earth as a whole, and to communicate a basic
understanding of the ocean’s role in the changing global environment. For more

cycle, cells were incubated in bottles containing trace quantities of
radioactive phosphate. University of Southampton graduate student Despo

Rouco, place the bottles in a large container that is designed to mimic the
light and temperature of the surface ocean. The container also ensure that the
bottles, and the radioactivity they contain, never fall into the ocean. _

Q:  
I notice when I wear a cap or any type of headwear I get a great boost in
temps/metabolism and feel serotonin lower a lot - I feel a lot more calm.  
  
Does head insulation and increasing temperature for the brain provide a good
boost in metabolism ? I was curious why I never see you in headwear or if this
was correct  
  
A:  
  
I wear a hat when I’m in a cold place, but generally my thick hair has been
enough. Keeping the brain temperature up is extremely important, especially
for restful sleep. It’s natural for the forehead to be a little cooler than
the rear parts of the brain. In the winter I keep a high-watt bulb over my
work area, shining on my head.

I was curious to know if you had any thoughts on ghosts and ghosts stories ?
Sometimes I think that ghosts are not real and the stories are from people

\- do you personally believe in ghosts or have a take on it ?  
  
**A:  
  
A physical chemisst, John O’Meara Bockris, compiled a collection of well
documented stories (The New Paradigm); I think it’s likely that interaction
among the living can account for what appear to be actions of ghosts—usually.

Q: "Dear Dr. Raymond Peat,  
I was not specifically asking if they are safe to wear, but rather, if copper
bracelets might actually be beneficial in terms of its electric morphogenesis
or simply just absorption through the skin.  
Maybe a Brass (5% Zinc) bracelet would be of interest, too?"  
  
A: "A copper bracelet does release enough copper to be absorbed in a
nutritionally useful quantity."  
  
Q: "Does the copper differ from "organic copper" found in e.g. milk? Does it
matter or can the body produce enzymes to deal with that?"  
  
A:"With very small amounts there’s not much difference."

Hello Mr. Peat  
It’s well know that thyroid can lower high cholesterol, but I’ve also heard of
those with low cholesterol taking thyroid and it normalizing their cholesterol
levels. Can you describe how this process works? Something along the lines of
the cholesterol enzyme being dependent on thyroid?  
  
RP: **Glucose metabolism provides the (acetate) substance for making
cholesterol, and thyroid hormone is a basic regulator of glucose metabolism—in
an extremely stressed system, cholesterol synthesis will be limited.**

Q:  
It is said that during evolution our gut size grew smaller as our brain size
grew bigger - I was reading another study about how a larger skull on a person
correlates with smaller digestive organs - it seems that the liver and
gastrointestinal tract are as metabolically expensive as the brain - is there
some type of trade-off between the 2 when a person maintains a high metabolic
rate ?  
  
It is also said that smaller stomachs seem to really only tolerate high-
quality, easily digestible food - I notice for squirrel monkeys diets compared
to other primates this seems to be the case and they have some of the largest
brain to body mass ratios  
  
**A:**  
Diet choices go with evolution—like the squirrel monkeys’ fruit diet, foods
that support brain development have to be high in carbohydrate, easy to
digest, abundant in the environment, and adequate in overall nutrient content
and balance. A less concentrated diet, containing a lot of plant material,
causes adaptive enlargement of the intestine.

Q: Hello Mr. Peat,  
What do you think is the best way to store olive oil?  
Thank you .  
  
A: Refrigerated.  
  
Q: Okay thank you!  
  
Do you think it makes sense to throw away the part of the oil that doesn't
become solid in the fridge?  
  
A: I don’t know; is the taste different?  
  
Q: I haven't tried it personally. But I will ask the person who told me and
get back to you.  
  
(Later)  
I havent heard back from him yet.  
  
But I tried it out myself and the olive oil got completely solid at 5°C in the
fridge. It looks like green coconut oil. There's not a single drop coming out
of the bottle.  
Does that mean its fats are very saturated?  
  
Have you seen that before with olive oil?  
It's a new kind of olive oil that I use . I put my old one in the fridge to
see if it will become solid as well.  
  
A: Mine does completely solidify at that that temperature. If they use a
solvent to extract more oil after the first pressing, it will contain more
PUFA. Also, the FDA found that an extremely high percentage if the olive oil
sold in the US has been adulterated with cheaper things such as soy oil.  
  
Q: Okay, thanks!  
  
The other oil has been in the fridge for half the day and hasn't become solid,
at all. So I think I won't buy that one again.  
  
What do you think about olive oil as a skin care product against dry skin or
wrinkles? There's some old people that swear by that.  
  
A: Good olive oil is good for the skin.  
  
Q: Do you have any favorite olives? I've read that koroneiki olives have a
good amount of [ policosanol ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/nano-soma/)
in it.  
  
Speaking of policosanol: in my new olive oil there's a white mist/sediment,
could that be the long chain saturated fatty acids?  
  
A: I like all olives. I doubt that saturated fat would separate.  
  
Q: Okay .  
  
Do you think any olive oil would become solid if you leave it in the fridge
long enough ?  
  
My older olive oil eventually did become solid ,it just took a lot longer than
my new one.  
  
Here's what the person told me about pouring the liquid part away :  
  
"I tried my DIY pufa reduced olive oil on my carrot salad and the usual
slightly bitter taste has disappeared. Positively surprised."  
  
A: That suggests that it’s reducing the PUFA conent of what’s left.

A novel role for lidocaine in COVID-19 patients?  
  
Dylan T. Finnerty1,2,3,∗ and Donal J. Buggy1,2,3,4  
Editor—Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel viral respiratory
disease that was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. The
pathophysiology of the disease remains under investigation; however, a new
perspective has emerged that neutrophils may play a central role in the organ
damage and mortality associated with COVID-19.1  
  
The most abundant leucocyte in peripheral blood, neutrophils play a crucial
role in immune response to infection by killing pathogens (bacteria, fungi,
viruses) by means of phagocytosis and oxidative burst. A third mechanism by
which neutrophils kill invading organisms was discovered in 2004: formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).2 NETs are web-like structures of DNA
studded with proteins that are extruded from the nucleus of neutrophils and
function to trap and kill circulating pathogens. Like much of the immune
response, netosis (the process of forming NETs) functions well as long as it
is closely regulated. When dysregulation of netosis occurs, collateral damage
ensues. Excessive production of NETS has been associated with disease
progression in a range of pathological conditions including pre-eclampsia,
lupus erythematosis, myocardial infarction, and sepsis.3, 4, 5, 6
Interestingly, the organ systems most commonly damaged by NETS, the pulmonary,
cardiovascular, and renal systems, are the same organ systems that are most
affected in severe COVID-19.1  
  
NETs and COVID-19  
  
Elevated levels of citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) have been observed in
hospitalised patients with COVID-19.7 Cit H3 is a specific biomarker of the
presence of NETs. Whether the presence of markers of netosis bears clinical
relevance is unknown as no longitudinal cohort studies have been published.
However, in numerous disease models elevated Cit H3 is associated with poor
outcomes.8, 9, 10 Interestingly, serum from COVID-19 patients triggered NET
release from control neutrophils in vitro, suggesting COVID-19 creates a
cellular environment in which netosis is more likely to occur.  
  
NETs and acute respiratory distress syndrome  
  
A subgroup of COVID-19 patients develops an acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS)-like state that frequently requires ICU-level support.
Although there is some disagreement as to whether these patients fit the
Berlin definition of ARDS, such discussions are to some degree academic.11
What is clear is that COVID-19 can cause a severe viral pneumonia associated
with profound hypoxaemia and need for mechanical ventilation. NETs have been
shown to contribute to disease progression in pulmonary infections,12, 13, 14
and animal models suggest that therapies that reduce formation of or lyse NETs
reduce lung injury and mortality.15 , 16 Levels of NETs in the plasma and
broncho-alveolar lavage fluid correlate with disease severity in patients with
pneumonia-induced ARDS.17  
  
NETs and thrombosis  
  
A hypercoagulable state has been described in COVID-19 patients resulting in a
high incidence of venous thromboembolic phenomena that contribute to the
disease burden.18 NETs activate the contact pathway of the coagulation system
while at the same time neutrophil elastase (a component of NETs) degrades
natural antithrombotic agents such as antithrombin III and tissue factor
pathway inhibitor.19 NETs are a prognostic indicator of venous thromboembolism
in cancer patients and partly explain the hypercoagulable state associated
with cancer.20 An animal model has shown that aberrant production of NETs
causes microvascular thrombi particularly in the lungs.21  
  
NETs and the COVID-19 cytokine storm  
  
A proportion of COVID-19 patients develop a dysregulated release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines that is termed a cytokine storm. Onset of this disease
state in COVID-19 patients is associated with high mortality, and suppression
of these overactivated cytokines is a therapeutic target of current interest.
NETs have been shown to induce macrophages to secrete interleukin-1 (IL-1),
which in turn induces IL-6.22 , 23 Both these ILs are seen as key players of
the cytokine response, and antagonists to these cytokines (tocilizumab and
anakinira) are currently being investigated in COVID-19 patients. Decreasing
NET formation may help to dampen the upstream signal stimulating the release
of these cytokines.  
  
NETs as a therapeutic target  
  
A recombinant DNAase (Dornase Alfa) is currently licensed for use in cystic
fibrosis patients where it functions to dissolve NETs present in sputum and
hence reduce the associated viscosity.24 Its use has been suggested in
COVID-19 patients who may also have thick gelatinous airway secretions.1
Colchicine is currently being trialled in COVID-19 patients with a hypothesis
that it may reduce neutrophil recruitment and hence NET formation ( [
ClinicalTrials.gov ](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) identifiers: NCT04326790,
NCT04328480, NCT04322565, NCT04322682).  
  
Lidocaine as a potential therapy  
  
The local anaesthetic drug lidocaine has been shown to reduce markers of
netosis.25 This prospective RCT looked at the influence of anaesthetic
interventions on netosis expression in patients undergoing breast cancer
surgery. Subjects who received a lidocaine infusion, commencing at induction
and continuing for 24 h postoperatively, had lower levels of Cit-H3 detected
in plasma compared with well-matched control subjects who did not receive
lidocaine. This is the first trial to show that lidocaine can positively
influence the development of NETs in patients undergoing surgery. A mechanism
for how lidocaine could suppress the formation of NETs has not been described
but could be partly explained by its known anti-inflammatory properties.26  
  
The evidence that lidocaine can suppress development of netosis in
perioperative patients raises the possibility of repurposing it for use in
COVID-19 patients. As evidence mounts that NETs play an important role in the
pathological process of COVID-19, an agent that suppresses this could bring
potential therapeutic benefits. Although lidocaine would not have a direct
effect on the SARS CoV-2 virus, it may help to temper the immunological storm
that is triggered in patients with severe disease (Fig. 1 ).  
  
Open in a separate window  
Fig 1  
Proposed mechanism of lidocaine suppression of netosis. Purple cell represents
a neutrophil undergoing netosis. G-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor;
G-CSF R, granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor; HMGB-1, high mobility
group box-1; TLR-4, Toll-like receptor-4.  
  
Lidocaine infusions have a strong record of safety in clinical medicine. They
are frequently used in chronic pain conditions and in gastrointestinal surgery
where they have been shown to reduce postoperative opioid requirements and
enhance bowel recovery.27 , 28 We hypothesise that lidocaine infusion in
COVID-19 patients may decrease the formation of NETs and modulate the severity
of disease.  
  
Apart from its primary role as a local anaesthetic agent, lidocaine exhibits
cytoprotective properties. Its ability to delay the onset of ischaemia-related
potassium efflux may explain its benefit in animal models of brain injury.29
In addition, lidocaine has been shown to exhibit a number of anti-inflammatory
properties. The ability of lidocaine to inhibit high mobility group box-1
(HMGB-1),30 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) merits further
research as both HMGB-1 via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)31 and G-CSF32 are key
mediators in the initiation of netosis.33  
  
Triggering of netosis is a complex process that can occur through a variety of
mechanisms. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a well-
described pathway with some evidence suggesting that commonly used anaesthetic
drugs such as propofol may suppress ROS and subsequent NET formation in
healthy volunteers.34 However, netosis can also occur through ROS-independent
pathways such as the HMGB-1 and G-CSF pathways. The primary pathway of netosis
in COVID-19 patients is not currently known.  
  
Important limitations should be highlighted with this proposal. The current
evidence for lidocaine in suppressing netosis is in the perioperative setting.
Here it is the surgical stress response that triggers formation of NETs. The
mechanisms by which netosis occurs are not fully understood and possibly
differ between patients undergoing surgery and those with viral pneumonia.  
  
The optimum timing and duration of administration of lidocaine with a view to
suppressing netosis is unknown. Furthermore, it is not known if this results
in longer-term clinical benefits once the infusion is stopped. The work by
Galoș and colleagues25 showed that lidocaine can suppress a biomarker of
netosis at 24 h after surgery, but whether this translates into meaningful
clinical benefits for patients was not answered. However, we do know that
higher levels of NETs in the postoperative setting correlate with disease
progression in cancer surgery and a higher incidence of venous
thromboembolism.35 , 36

Q. (Paraphrased) TSH is higher than I'd like, Vit D is lower than I'd like,
and I'm not sure what to make of the high thyroglobulin antibodies?  
  
A. Prolonged stimulation by TSH promotes inflammation, and that leads to
formation of antibodies. When TSH is normalized, the antibodies tend to
subside over a period of several months. The low vitamin D contributes to an
inflammatory state; keeping calcium intake high relative to phosphate supports
vitamin D and thyroid functions.  
  
Q. Do you think calcium intake relative to phosphate needs to be high on a
meal-by-meal basis, or over the course of a day or week?  
  
A. The mineral absorption is fairly slow, so I think the day’s average is what
matters.

[ Why do women live longer than men? ](https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-

**A: I don’t know about old male mice, but in humans old men often have much
more estrogen than women of the same age, so a relatively neutral competitor
of estrogen should be helpful. I think[ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) is likely
to be better. **  
Q: Do you think that these milder neutral forms of estrogen compete for ER
binding sites to limit the more damaging effects of stronger estrogens, or
just dilute their concentration in tissues? Would there be any therapeutic
applications to combine 17alpha-estradiol and progesterone to tackle estrogen,
perhaps via two different mechanisms?  
**A: It weakens the effects of estradiol on the receptors. Progesterone acts
in a variety of ways, reducing estrogen production and activation, and by
degrading the estrogen receptor.**

Im less worried about the angiona itself, more that there could be something

What do you think that could be ?  
  
A: Traditionally, high estrogen, low thyroid are thought to be involved.

Q: Do you know of a good strategy to shrink a goiter?  
  
A: Both T4 and T3 can lower TSH, helping to shrink a goiter, but doing it with
just T3 would tend to give you a fast pulse and a tendency to over-heat.
Cynoplus has a generally good balance of T4 and T3, a 4 to 1 ratio; some
people use a little T3 with it, according to how they feel and function. It’s
available from [ farmaciadelnino.mx ](http://farmaciadelnino.mx/) . One of the
effect of T3 is to lower your estrogen ( [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) helps too)
while increasing your [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) . Estrogen
tends to enlarge a goiter, by blocking the enzyme that converts thyroglobulin
(“colloid”) to the active secreted hormones, and progesterone activates those
enzymes. If the goiter is visibly enlarged, a certain amount of progesterone
can activate the conversion of thyroglobulin to the extent of producing
hyperthyroidism during the process (e.g., with a resting pule rate of about
125 beats per minute). It’s better to do it slowly with thyroid supplements
suppressing TSH. [ Pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) , being converted to progesterone, might have similar
accelerating effects.

currency exchange rates would show a rise in the dollar relative to those

Q: Hi,  
I have a few female patients that struggle with lipedema.  
I told one to do things that help the liver and lower estrogen/ increase [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-

it, but I'm not sure about it.  
  
What do you think would be reasonable dietary or supplementary interventions
to help with this condition ?  
  
Thank you.  
  
A: When cells are exposed to estrogen, their first two reactions (almost
instantaneous) are to take up water and to activate fat synthesis. When
dietary fats contain a lot of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the activity of
estrogen is increased. Unsaturated fats have. higher affinity for water than
saturated fats do.  
  
Q: Thank you.  
do you think lipedema is reversible, without liposuction?  
  
A: Yes, by correcting the diet and hormones.

Q: Hello Mr. Peat,  
Do you know if altitude generators like the one below actually have similar
benefits as beeing at high altitude or is this just marketing?  
  
That's what they say about the mechanism of their generator:  
  
"Hypoxico systems generate normobaric hypoxic air to replicate the oxygen
levels found at altitudes up to 21,000ft/6,400m. This is achieved by drawing
in ambient air, separating oxygen molecules to meet the desired O2 percentage,
then outputting a continuous flow of fresh, filtered, hypoxic air for
breathing. This allows altitude training to be performed anywhere on Earth,
even at sea level!"  
  
A: Oxygen depletion can be helpful in some situations, but it definitely isn’t
equivalent to higher altitude. When people successfully adapt to altitude,
their internal CO2 increases, with beneficial changes in metabolism and
hormones. Successful adaptation to altitude takes at least several days;
otherwise, lactate increases instead of CO2. When CO2 is absorbed through the
skin by sitting in a tub or bag of the gas, any excess is exhaled (and
respiration is slightly stimulated by higher CO2). Depending on a person’s
health, the exhaled air contains a great variety of volative compounds, some
of which are toxic, and account for some of the effects on cognition that have
been blamed on CO2 in crowded offices and auditoriums. Ammonia, nitric oxide,
carbon monoxide, isoprene, methanol, ketones and a great variety of volatile
hydrocarbons are exhaled. Low atmospheric pressure and stimulated respiration
accelerate these breath emissions. These can accumulate to noticeably toxic
levels in a tightly closed space.  
  
Q:Interesting. So it does make sense to frequently let fresh air in your room,
to get rid of these toxic gases ?  
  
A: Yes. Exercising in a closed space is likely to have noticeably toxic
effects.  
  
Q:Oh , that is good to know!  
  
On the altitude generator:  
Do you think it is inferior to altitude because it can only be used for a
certain amount of time during the day or because of the normobaric pressure it
has ?  
  
A: Acclimatization is a prolonged, continuous process.

**About Best Living-Climate  
  
Me: **  
Hey Dr. Peat. I currently live in California, but I’m planning to move this
summer to somewhere more affordable, within the US. I’m considering places
that are sunny, near the equator, but without excessive humidity. I also want
to live somewhere that provides large amounts of tropical fruit.  
  
What do you think is the best pro-metabolic, pro-fruit living environment in
the US?  
  
**Ray:**  
High, sunny places like Santa Fe, NM, are as expensive as California, and can
be very cold; Santa Barbara grows some tropical fruit, otheriwise, cities with
big universities usually have some for their international students. The “hill
country” of NW Texas has a compromise altitude and weather and nice scenery,
but not much else. The lowest latitude places in the US, i.e., Florida, are
unlivably hot and humid for many people. For fruit, goat milk, altitude,
weather, and costs, there are thousands of good places in Mexico.  
  
**Me:**  
Thanks, Dr. Peat. The idea of moving to Mexico is extremely intriguing--a nice
climate, fruit, and goat milk are all I need to enjoy a happy life. Can you
suggest a few cities that I can check out, to start my search?  
  
**Ray:**  
I think it’s good to spend a week or two at a moderate altitude, 4000 to 5000
feet, to adapt, before doing much at higher altitude. Towns around Guadalajara
without heavy industry are probably less polluted; Zapotlanejo, Jalisco,
Zamora, Michoacan, and Tequila, Jalisco might be good places to start. The
Patzcuaro area is very nice, towns around the big lake; Valle de Bravo, State
of Mexico, is expensive but nice, usually has good fruit.

Q: Hello Mr. Peat,  
I saw a study where pig lard strongly increases testosterone in mice. A lot
more than coconut oil, olive oil, sesame oil and fish oil. It also lowered
total cholesterol quite a bit.  
Do you have any idea what the mechanism could be ?  
Because I can't see anything in pig lard that olive oil or coconut oil don't
have.  
They used iberian pig lard for the study.  
  
This is the name of the study:  
  
"Dietary Fat Influences Testosterone, Cholesterol, Aminopeptidase A, and Blood
Pressure in Male Rats"  
  
A: Iberian pigs, with an acorn diet, have lard that’s very different from the
lard of corn and soy fed pigs.  
  
Q:The authors mention that the iberian lard they used is actually higher in
PUFA than regular lard. They suspect that this is where the benefits came
from. Shouldn't that have the opposite effect on testosterone and cholesterol
?  
  
A: Yes, long chain PUFA increase estrogen. US pork is typically more than 30%
PUFA, Iberian pork just under 10%.

Chloromethane emissions in human breath  
Frank Keppler, Jan Fischer, Tobias Sattler, Daniela Polag, Nicole Jaeger,
Heinz Friedrich Schöler, Markus Greule.  
Abstract  
Chloromethane (CH3Cl), currently the most abundant chlorinated organic
compound in the atmosphere at around ~550 parts per trillion by volume (pptv),
is considered responsible for approximately 16% of halogen-catalyzed
stratospheric ozone destruction. Although emissions of CH3Cl are known to
occur from animals such as cattle, formation and release of CH3Cl from humans
has not yet been reported. In this study a pre-concentration unit coupled with
a gas chromatograph directly linked to a mass spectrometer was used to
precisely measure concentrations of CH3Cl at the pptv level in exhaled breath
from 31 human subjects with ages ranging from 3 to 87years. We provide
analytical evidence that all subjects exhaled CH3Cl in the range of 2.5 to 33
parts per billion by volume, levels which significantly exceed those of
inhaled air by a factor of up to 60. If the mean of these emissions was
typical for the world's population, then the global source of atmospheric
CH3Cl from humans would be around 0.66Ggyr-1 (0.33 to 1.48Ggyr-1), which is
less than 0.03% of the total annual global atmospheric source strength. The
observed endogenous formation of a chlorinated methyl group in humans might be
of interest to biochemists and medical scientists as CH3Cl is also known to be
a potent methylating agent and thus, could be an important target compound in
future medical research diagnostic programs.

**Me** : Do you have a recommendation about the ideal room temperature for
sleeping? In where I live, outside temperatures are starting to increase so we
have to use AC to keep the room cool. Does sleeping under the AC affect human
biology in a negative manner? I feel it dries the air and I wake up with a
stuffed nose especially if the cooled air is hitting my face.  
  
**Ray** : Have you checked the relative humidity in the cool room? Usually a
cool room with comfortable covers allows the body to regulate its temperature.  
  
**Me** : How can I check the relative humidity? In that note, would you
recommend a humidifier to increase the humidity of the cool room?  
  
**Ray** : Weather reports usually give the relative humidity; when that air is
cooled, the relative humidity increases considerably. It can be calculated
from the decrease in temperature, but a little device, usually combined with a
thermometer, is convenient.  
  
**Me** : In my city right now, the temperature is 106 F and relative humidity
is 7%. We’re 50 km from the sea. Everyday I open my window for half an hour to
let new air comes in. So I would guess the room humidity is more than 7% due
to a lower temperature inside (even with the AC off) and the water steam
coming from the bathroom and kitchen. I will probably get the device to be
sure of the numbers. When I sleep I usually put the AC on 75 F. There is a
“dry” mode in the AC remote controller. That mode is supposed to reduce
humidity while keeping the room cool.  
  
What is the ideal relative humidity inside houses if we’re planning to cool
the air in the day and during sleep? Do you think getting a dehumidifier is a
good idea?  
  
**Ray** : In a 75 F room, relative humidity between 35 and 60 is o.k.;
bathroom, kitchen, and people add to the humidity, but with the outside
relative humidity of only 7%, a humidifier might help.  
  
**Me** : Unfortunately, most of the year, the humidity is quite high,
especially at night. So if humidity goes higher than 60%, do you think a
dehumidifier would help or does it affect health negatively? If someone has
respiratory problems like asthma, would sleeping in a less humid room help
him?  
  
**Ray** : High humidity itself tends to soften mucus and can improve asthma
symptoms, but the humidity favors the growth of microorganisms and can
increase allergens in the air.

Q: A while ago you said a very interested thing:  
  
"The holistic aspect of the organism has almost always been neglected as a
component of inflammation.  
And why healthy people can avoid getting inflammatory conditions. A lot of it
is simply a matter of their attention, how their brain is organized in daily
work. If you're scattered and distracted constantly by meaningless tasks, I
think that seriously affects your inflammation processes and immunity."  
  
  
  
I was wondering what people could do to stop those scattered thoughts, outside
of nutrition and supplements.  
And the best thing I could come up with is finding a purpose in life. A
purpose will make it easier for them to focus on something meaningful and not
engage in useless, instant gratification things.  
  
What do you think about that?  
  
  
A: Yes, a meaningful, purposeful life is essential. The present culture and
economy, the fact that most work is producing either harmful or useless
things, is a great health problem.  
  
Q: Thanks. Do you have any advice on how to find one's purpose ?  
  
Do you think building a family could be a good purpose ?  
  
  
A: Yes, combining your efforts with others in a project is effective.

You also talked about some macrolide inhibiting a certain kinase. Would you

You said:  
  
"After it was discovered to be a great treatment for fungal infections it was
found to have many other effects, anti-inflammatory effects, which are typical
effects of that family, azithromycin for example and in exploring how the
anti-inflammatory effect works, they found that it works on a particular
kinase, an enzyme that attaches phosphate groups to particular enzymes and
functional proteins. And the phosphorylation directs towards growth and
inflammation and they found that the antibiotic inhibiting this particular
kind of phosphorylating enzyme, extended life span drastically and reduced
cancer and inflammatory diseases."

Q: Would you consider parboiled rice as a good alternative to nixtamalized
corn ? (or white rice is better ?)  
In parboiled rice the starches are in gelatinized form though I don't
understand the exact chemistry of it.  
  
A: **I think thorough cooking of white rice is better. Corn and other grains
can be nixtamalized easily with calcium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, or
sodium carbonate.**

**Q** : I'm really sorry to bother you Mr. Peat but my question hasn't been
asked on several occasions on your podcast with Danny and Georgi and I had to
send you an email.  
  
Question is about **EAR HEALTH** :  
\- **Hearing loss and can it be improved/reversed**  
\- **Constant feeling of pressure**  
\- **Constant earwax buildup**  
\- **Tinnitus**  
\- **Extreme pain around the whole ear region when it's cold, so I always need
to wear a hat.**  
  
Just to put things in context I think I've done most of the things you
recommend for 8 months except using thyroid and few other supplements. I have
crohn's which is under control and some brain lesions as well  
  
**RP** : Have you had blood tests? Low thyroid function is the most common
reason for ear problems. Have you noticed any changes in the tinnitus
according to what you eat? What are your main foods?  
  
[After this I sent him a long email explaining everything but he didn't
reply.]

**Jun 7, 2021, 1:15 AM**  
  
  
**Q** : I'm sorry to bother you Mr Peat. // It's funny I called him "Mr" Peat
:)) //  
  
I have two questions to which you can just reply quickly.  
  
1\. Have you ever heard of someone improving their hearing - specifically
people who are experiencing hearing loss?  
2\. Why do the fried/heated fats (no matter which ones - coconut, olive,
butter etc) give me eczema, dry skin and scalp as well as some blood sugars
dysregulation while "raw" fats have no problems?  
EXAMPLE: If I cook steak or meat on a grill or use an oven I have 0 issues and
If I add some fats to it, or fry in a pan I get all of these skin issues? Are
they harder on the liver or is there something else which I'm missing!  
  
Love you Mr Peat!  
  
**RP** : Do you supplement vitamin D and get enough calcium in your diet
relative to phosphate? Heated fats are more irritating, and the intestine is
exaggeratedly sensitive if vitamin D, calcium, and thyroid are low.  
  
**Q** : I have been supplementing Thorne VIT D+ K topically every day for the
past 4 months. I eat a fair bit of cheese and I had to cut back on milk after
using doxycycline because I get these intense chest pains/stiffness after I
wake up. I have no idea what this could mean. My doxy cotanied silica,
titanium dioxide and a few other nasty stuff so I probably made a big mistake
in taking it.  
  
What about the hearing question Mr Peat? Did you ever know or hear of anyone
hearing improving?  
  
Thank you so much for everything!  
  
**RP** : Some people experience improved hearing when they move to a high
altitude; I think it has to do with improved circulation.  
  
**Q** : Thank you so much for answering Mr Peat.  
Will breathing in the bag by increasing CO2 also improve circulation? What are
the best ways that you know of that can improve one's circulation?  
Also there is a study stating that higher altitudes and hypoxia states can
cause deafness and hearing problems: [ Influence of high-altitude hypoxic
environments on the survival of cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion
neurons in rats ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5228326/)  
  
**RP** : People going to a high altitude, e.g., 6500 feet or more, sometimes
notice improved hearing. Adapting to altitude increases the CO2 retained in
the body, improving capillary circulation. The drug acetazolamide increases
CO2, and can have similar effects. Thyroid and vitamin D, caffeine and [
thiamine ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b1-powder-thiamine-hcl-
usp-grade/) can help to maintain CO2 levels.  
  
Am J Otol. 1989 Mar;10(2):142-5.  
Long-term effect of acetazolamide and chlorthalidone on the hearing loss of
Menière's disease  
J Corvera 1, G Corvera  
Abstract  
A retrospective computerized analysis of the records of patients with
Meniere's disease was made to evaluate the effect of acetazolamide and
chlorthalidone on the rate of hearing loss. Three groups were compared as
follows: (1) 79 patients treated with chlorthalidone for 5 to 13.4 years; (2)
42 patients medicated with acetazolamide between 5 and 7.8 years; and (3) a
control group of 71 patients who received only intermittent symptomatic
treatment for vertigo, followed for 5 to 24.1 years. In the short term, after
2 to 6 weeks of treatment, a statistically significant decrease of the average
hearing loss was observed with both chlorthalidone and acetazolamide. In the
long term, more than 5 years, no preventive effect on the deterioration of the
hearing loss could be detected. Both acetazolamide and chlorthalidone can be
useful for diagnostic purposes by causing a fluctuation of hearing, as well as
for the management of the vertigo attacks, but it is not useful for the long-
term prevention of the hearing deterioration in Meniere's disease.  
  
**Q** : Thank you so much Mr.Peat! You are the best! I appreciate you very
much!  
The acetazolamide sold in my country contains: Povidon, Glycerol,
Microcrystalline cellulose, Sodium gluconate, Colloidal Silicon dioxide,
Magnesium-stearate and Talc.  
I think it has the worst possible ingredients I would say, would you say that
the risk outweighs the benefits and I should focus on alternatives until I
find a purer form of the drug?  
  
**RP** : Yes, the bag breathing can make your skin noticeably pinker, and
lower blood pressure. Calcium, vitamin D, thyroid, and [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) are things
that help capillaries.  
  
That’s when the change is so extreme that adaptation doesn’t happen. When
climbers on Mt. Everest were suffering such symptoms, and dementia, breathing
CO2 corrected the problem.  
  
Yes. There are many other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors available in pure
form; coffee, vitamin B1, and a good ratio of calcium to phosphate can help.

**Q** : Hi Mr. Peat  
  
You've said once:  
  
" _The only analysis of gelatin that I have seen showed very little fluoride.
Since most of the fluoride in an animal is concentrated in the **_bones_ ** ,
and gelatin is made from **_skin_ ** , it probably doesn't contain much _ ."  
  
I am making my gelatin from ox tails and whole legs which includes the bones
as well.  
  
My question: Would you say this is a safe way of making gelatin since it can
extract fluoride from the bones or is there a better way?  
  
**RP** : The bone fluoride is very insoluble, so I don’t think there’s a
problem. Long bones contain marrow, and prolonged cooking of that produces a
lot of fat oxidation products. The tendons and ligaments around joints are the
main source of gelatin, rather than the bone itself.

**Jun 14, 2021, 12:02 AM**  
  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
What is the mechanism behind INTENSE chest stiffness/pain and inflammation and
also around the kidney region after waking up. It usually happens if during
the day I ate milk and/or some heated/fried fats. It got worse after
doxycycline use (Which somehow seems to push me into a fat oxidation state)
but It started happening around the 25th-26th year of my life. I'm 31 now.  
  
This study seems to confirm my experience:  
[ Doxycycline Alters Metabolism and Proliferation of Human Cell Lines
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3669316/)  
  
" _Here, we report that **in human cell lines** , commonly used concentrations
of **doxycycline** change gene expression patterns and concomitantly **shift
metabolism towards a more glycolytic phenotype** , evidenced by **increased
lactate secretion and reduced oxygen consumption** . We also show that these
concentrations are sufficient to slow proliferation _ .".  
  
Thank you for everything, love from Serbia!  
  
**RP** : Foods that cause stress can cause changes in energy metabolism
similar to the doxycycline changes. What are your main foods? Have you checked
your thyroid function?  
  
**Q** : Hey Dr Peat  
  
I don't want this to come out the wrong way but I've been eating pretty clean
and the way you've talked about. Minced beef a few times a week, Oysters,
Cheese, Mushroom and carrot salad (every day), occasional cooked kale, lot's
of fruits, honey, OJ, Coca cola, occasional bread, organic wheat pasta, and
milk.  
  
My inflammation gets worse after milk and fried/heated fats and better after
mostly fruits and/or baking soda before bedtime.  
  
I have to mention that the doxy I've used was full of titanium dioxide and
silica and other nasty stuff.  
Could it be that those things somehow messed up with my sugar
oxidation/oxidative metabolism or is it something else?  
  
**RP** : When a person becomes sensitive to gluten, the inflammation from an
occasional meal with bread or pasta can become very prolonged.

Email exchange lasted from Jun 16, 2021 - Jul 20  
  
  
**Q** : Hi Dr. Peat  
  
I am going to do some blood work and some other analyses. Could you recommend
what is relevant to check for?  
What Thyroid hormones should I look for and what are other useful things to
look at as well?  
Thanks for everything!  
  
**RP** : TSH and vitamin D should be included along with standard blood
chemistry.  
  
**Q** : //I've sent him a long email of my blood work + my issues with
hearing, other stuff etc...//  
  
.. Thank you and forever grateful  
  
**RP** : After a few weeks on the present fourth of a cynoplus you should
notice an increase in your temperature and improvement of some symptoms. As
your temperature rises, the TSH should get lower, and the albumin higher.
Cholesterol might rise a little, which would be better. You are likely to need
to increase the amount of cynoplus to get things normalized.  
  
**Q** : Thank you so much Dr Peat  
Would you say I need to increase cynoplus to half of a tablet or just add a
bit of T3 (cynomel) to a 1/4 of cynoplus or should I experiment with both?  
Much love  
  
**RP** : After about two weeks the effects of cynoplus will be apparent, and
you might want to try small amounts of T3 while watching for its effects.  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I'm a bit confused about how to increase my thyroid dosage at the moment.  
I'm on 1/4 of cynoplus for 15 days. I haven't experienced much greater
temperatures (maybe afternoon rose just a fraction but it's not constant) and
most of my problems still linger on.  
  
You once said no more than 10mg of T3 per meal so maybe I can do 1/4 cynoplus
+ 1/8 of cynomel [ Which is 10.725mg of T3 ]  
Or I can have two doses around the day. 1/4 cynoplus with Breakfast/Lunch and
then 1/4 cynomel for dinner?  
Or the easiest way would be to just increase my cynoplus to half a tablet [
Twice a day]?  
  
What do you think?  
  
Thank you for everything!  
  
**RP** : Just increasing it to 1/4 tablet twice a day would be simplest. If
you use Cynomel, it should be taken at a different time than the Cynoplus,
since that contains T3 too.  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
Would you say that if your liver is not functioning properly then T4 [1/4
Cynoplus 2x a day] over time could give you some problems like slowing down
the liver, bloating etc.  
  
I've been experiencing some pain/tenderness and pain in my ileocecal valve -
which tends to get really tender and painful during my Crohn's flare up.. And
also it seems that I have some Inability to use [my already low] dietary fat
as my skin becomes red and flaky and I break out in eczema after using them.
[Similar as to when I was using Doxycycline]  
  
I'm considering instead of using 1/4 of Cynoplus 2x a day to use 1/4 Cynoplus
+ 1/4 Cynomel maybe.  
  
Or did you know anyone who used only T3 with no T4?  
  
Thank you  
  
**Q** : I'm so sorry to bother you again Dr Peat  
Could you maybe explain some mechanism in which thyroid supplementation
[Cynoplus 2x 1/4] would give me the same results as Doxycycline?  
So, since increasing thyroid to 2x 1/4 cynoplus I had blood in my stool, pain
in my ileocolic valve, eczema on my face and scalp, flaky skin, extreme
hardening of the scalp. Almost the same effects as when using doxycycline.  
  
I cannot make sense of it. I'm so stuck and confused. I thought this would
help me and not harm me in any way.  
  
Could it be that thyroid uses a lot of VIT D and since I'm already deficient
in it [and not supplementing it for 1 month] it creates some environment of
low VIT D?  
  
Or do you have anything else in mind?  
  
Please, any advice would be helpful to make sense of it.  
  
Thank you so much  
  
**RP** : Many people start with only T3 in small divided doses, and then
gradually introduce some T4 when their liver is more active. Are you checking
your temperature and pulse rate? T3 takes effect very quickly, so it’s
important to watch closely for its effects.  
  
**RP** : If your liver is very sluggish, an accumulation of T4 can have
antithyroid effects, which could include eczema. Using T3 only can reverse
that effect. It’s important to watch your temperature and pulse rate, to
normalize your vitamin D, and to get enough calcium and magnesium.  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I've been using only 2xT3 [Cynomel] for the previous 7 days and I had some
improvements skin wise but I still have some blood in my stool and pain and
discomfort in the gut [ileocolic valve and also on the opposite  
side as well]. As you know I am a Crohn's sufferer but I was mostly without
problems and bleeding for 2 years until now.  
  
With the gut problems I also got this tingling sensation in the middle of my
chest - making me cough - which I don't remember ever having. Also some
pressure in my head and some headaches. General feeling of not being well
[Except for only one day where I really felt "euphoric" and had a sense of
"wellbeing".]  
  
My ears are better in terms of not clogging and not feeling full at all but my
hearing is mostly the same - maybe slightly improved because of no congestion.  
My morning temperatures are between 35.9 - 36.4 degrees celsius. My morning
pulses are between 74 - 78 and after breakfast or lunch my temperatures vary
from 36.6 -37.1 and my pulse increases to 80-90 BPM.  
  
But I'm bleeding somewhere in the intestine still after T3. Milk gives me more
problems gut-wise and makes me have some bad stools but also makes me feel
better overall [probably because of calcium]. I haven't supplemented VIT D
still [Which was already low] but I will start from monday.  
  
I reduced my cynomel to 1/8 a day to see if there is going to be any
improvements but I'm still very much stuck. I've been using carrot salad and
mushrooms pretty regularly and with no improvements.  
  
So my ears are better but overall I'm worse. And tremendously confused.  
  
Any further advice Dr. Peat?  
  
**RP** : Years ago I had seriously bleeding colitis, and I found that a single
oral dose of lidocaine of about 20 mg (in the form of 2% lidocaine gel)
stopped the bleeding immediately, and it never returned. Much larger doses
have been administered rectally, but it can also be used transdermally.  
  
**Q** : Yeah I know about that. I've heard you say it many times and for the
past 3 days I'm re-reading everything regarding lidocaine on a forum.  
  
I've been applying it topically for months but I never took it orally because
I have 5% lidocaine cream at my disposal.  
  
Would you take 5% if that's what you've had at that moment?  
  
**RP** : Covering more skin with the lotion will provide a good systemic dose.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr. Peat. I always try to cover the whole stomach so I will
try it again.  
  
But wouldn't you say that the problem seems to be that I've somehow
reactivated the entire system which gave me crohn's in the first place. It
could be the bacteria or fungus or whatever. And I wouldn't say the bleeding
is the main problem, it's what is causing the bleeding. And it all seemed to
start after using the thyroid.  
  
Do you see any correlation there?  
Would the thyroid thin the blood and my damaged ileocecal valve had problems
with that?  
Would you say that the intestine [Which in my case was probably the lowest
metabolic organ in my body] couldn't keep up with the increased metabolism and
demands from the organism?  
Was my liver in a very weak state and the increase of T4 put my liver in a
state of shock and it released all of the bacteria and viruses etc back into
the intestine?  
  
I just can't seem to grasp the whole situation.  
  
**RP** : Have you had blood tests for TSH and vitamin D? How much milk are you
drinking? What other foods?  
  
**Q** : Hi Dr Ray.

_And Dr Peat you have most of the information in this email thread. We've
exchanged 18 email regarding this topic and thyroid usage and my intestine
problem. That is in case you need some extra information or you forgot how we
came here. Most of the information is in this email thread._  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
Do you think that the cynoplus/cynomel contain some form of nanoparticles? I
cannot seem to explain digestion problems and endotoxins symptoms I've
experienced other than that. My problems started after increasing Cynoplus
from 1/4 once a day to twice a day. You've said that I've maybe shocked the
liver with too much T4 and after that I've used only T3 for 10 days. But after
using only T3 I've had bloody stools and diarrhea as well. After reducing T3
to 1/8 a day I don't have blood in my stool but still have diarrhea every day.
Bloating, skin issues. hardening of the scalp, eczema, lung issues, headaches
- all point to endotoxin.  
  
How could thyroid cause these symptoms? Nanoparticles? Should I try some
natural thyroid?  
  
**RP** : What are your foods? Do you use any nutritional supplements? Do you
keep track of your temperatures and pulse rates?  
  
**Q** : No supplements at this point. Only some 5% lidocaine creme which I use
every other day. I've been following your food advices for over a year with no
issues so it must have been the [ thyroid supplement
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-desiccated-
thyroid-ndt/) ,  
  
Foods: Minced beef a few times a week, Oysters, Potatoes, 2-3 Eggs, Cheese,
Mushroom and carrot salad (every day), occasional cooked kale, fruits
[watermelon, melon, cooked apple, dates], honey, OJ, Coca cola, milk [1l-2l a
day] etc.  
  
My morning temperatures are between 35.9 - 36.4 degrees celsius. My morning
pulses are between 74 - 78.  
After breakfast or lunch my temperatures vary from 36.6 -37.1 and my pulse
increases to 80-90 BPM.  
  
**RP** : Are the mushrooms cooked? Melon, potatoes, apples, and dates are
potential problems. What kind of cheese do you eat?  
  
**Q** : //I sent him a long mail with no response//  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr.Peat  
  
Apparently these are the ingredients of Cynomel [And probably Cynoplus]
tablets:  
  
Corn Starch  
Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate  
Sugar glass  
Talc  
Stearate acid powder  
Gelatin  
Ethyl alcohol  
Purified water  
  
Would you say there is something in here which could make my already weakened
intestine bleed and create inflammation?  
  
Thank you.  
  
**RP** : Using a vitamin D supplement dissolved in pure olive oil should
reduce inflammation in your intestine; it’s possible that excipients in pills
irritate the inflamed membranes. Tightening and hardening of the skin suggests
that your parathyroid hormone might be very high, and normalizing your vitamin
D might remedy that.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr. Peat. The bottles of Thorne VIT D and very high quality
olive oil are arriving on Wednesday. Can you maybe suggest some other way to
supplement thyroid in the meantime? Maybe Georgi's product or some pure
desiccated thyroid which you are familiar with?  
  
RP: Talc can contain toxic impurities.  
  
**RP** : There are products that contain vitamin D in only olive oil. The
Thorne product contains some problematic materials. It can be used on the skin
safely, but with only about 5% absorption. Armour thyroid, USP, is relatively
safe; a pure powdered glandular product would be ideal, if one can be found.  
  
Other Ingredients: Hypromellose Capsule, Leucine, **Microcrystalline
Cellulose, Silicon Dioxid** e, Vitamin E (d-Alpha-Tocopheryl)  
  
**Q** : Hey Dr. Peat  
  
Wow, thank you very much for that information you are helping me tremendously.  
I'm going to order thyroid from _[ Lifegivingstore
](https://lifegivingstore.com/) .com. _ I hope that you are familiar with them
and that their product is reliable.  
  
As far as Thorne VIT D I'm a bit confused. There are several brands of VIT D
from thorne and you are probably referring to the capsule one [ [ Vitamin
D-5,000 - NSF Certified for Sport: Get the vitamin that supports healthy
teeth, bones, and muscles, as well as cardiovascular and immune function*
](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/d-5-000-vitamin-d-capsule) ] which
contains all the ingredients you've mentioned.  
  
But I'm getting the liquid one [ [ Vitamin D Liquid: Good health starts with
vitamin D, which supports healthy bones and muscles, cardiovascular health,
and immune function* ](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/vitamin-d-liquid) ]
and they've stated " **It comes in a base of medium chain triglyceride oil
without soy oil or sesame oil, and it is preserved with mixed tocopherols
(natural vitamin E)"** and as far as I can tell those are the only other
ingredients.  
What do you think?  
  
I sincerely hope that you think more highly of this specific product since I
ordered a few and I was planning to use it orally with some HQ olive oil.  
At least until I find an even more quality brand of VIT D3.  
  
Love and gratitude Dr. Peat!  
  
  
**RP** : Some people react very badly to MCT taken orally; it can promote the
development of food allergies.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr.Peat  
  
So you would still advise to take this one topically until I find the purer
version.  
It would extremely help If you could suggest one for me. I know you probably
don't want to endorse anyone or something like that but It would be of great
help.  
High quality VIT D3 with good bioavailability would probably really improve my
condition.  
  
Love,  
  
**RP** : There are several brands in pure olive oil only, but they vary a lot
in price; I think this one is fairly priced:  
  
[ Amazon product ](//amazon.com/dp/B00E028SD0?tag=rapefo-20)  
_ [ View: https://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Vitamin-Softgels-
Bottles/dp/B00E028SD0 ](https://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Vitamin-Softgels-
Bottles/dp/B00E028SD0) _  
  
  
**Q** : You are just the best!  
  
Thank you so much!

**Q** : Hello Dr.Peat  
  
Is there any mechanism through which dietary calcium [from milk] would go into
soft tissues?  
  
It seems that when there is some systemic or intestinal inflammation in my
body I become very stiff when drinking milk.  
  
I always had some chest pain and stiffness but now I have that
pressure/stiffness on the back of my head and neck. It seems to increase when
I try to breathe deeply, maybe suggesting that I cannot get enough oxygen to
my brain through these blood vessels?  
  
**RP** : Inflammation in the intestine can cause body pains and stiffness by
increasing circulating endotoxin and serotonin and histamine. Dietary calcium
and vitamin D lower parathyroid hormone, and elevated parathyroid hormone is
the main factor causing calcification of soft tissues.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
You've said that old studies with oxidized cholesterol were the cause for
everyone to think that cholesterol causes heart disease, atherosclerosis and
all of these fibrotic conditions.  
  
So my question is since I usually have problems with "heated fats" would that
mean that the heat will make the cholesterol oxidize and therefore lead to my
"fibrotic-like" problems?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Those effects take years to progress.

If I do certain things to increase my CO2 [bag breathing, slow breathing,
holding my breath] while living at low altitude, how long will that CO2 be
retained in my blood and tissues before I need to do the exercises again?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Even if higher CO2 is continuous, it keeps changing things for
months; studies after months in a submarine with high CO2 showed that their
bones were still assimilating it.

**Q** : Hi Dr. Peat  
  
1\. What are the things that "break down" hardened [ collagen
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-beef-grass-fed/) in
our bodies?  
2\. And what would you think it's preferable? Pure high quality [ glycine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/glycine-powder-usp-grade/) supplement or
gelatine made from factory farmed animals?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : I think gelatin is preferable. Things that reduce stress (and so
increase the ratio of [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) to
estrogen) help to reverse the aged state of collagen.

//I thought about not sharing this personal story but who gives a f//  
  
**Q** : Hi Dr Peat  
  
This might sound funny but is there any way that we can "uncondition"
ourselves. It seems like we can only add more conditioning/knowledge.  
  
I've had some "traumatic" experiences when I was a kid which keeps repeating
in my nervous system over and over again. I pooped my pants in kindergarten
and It left me ashamed and now most of the time I have fear of pooping my
pants. For example when there are no bathrooms around.  
The funny thing is - that I can really make myself need to go to the bathroom
in a matter of seconds when I'm in this fearful/anxious state. All the muscles
and "energy" in the intestine start "pushing down" and all hell break loose.
There is no way I can stop it.  
  
I've noticed some improvements [the stress not being that intense] when
following your principles of health which could indicate that high serotonin
rewired my nervous system in some way?  
  
**RP** : Have you tried cyproheptadine in very small doses to reduce the
serotonin effects?

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I've listened to the recent podcast on fibrosis with Danny and Georgi and It
all finally makes sense. All of my symptoms and problems with chest and
intestine stiffness. Sometimes I even feel like my intestines are made of
stone. And it is usually after some big inflammation [like the recent one
where I bled out my intestine due to cynomel and cynoplus inpuritues].  
  
All pointing to my constant gut inflammation and crohn's disease leading to
the accumulation of calcium which all leads to fibrosis and calcification.  
  
The only thing that ever radically helped me [ and this was before I found you
] was basically a fruitarian diet.  
  
So. you've said: " **_But if the cells are de-energized then calcium starts to
accumulate too much and then i guess under the influence of parathyroid
hormone starts to become part of the fibrotic tissue is that correct_ ** ?"  
  
So my questions are:  
1\. Would that mechanism translate to a high calprotectin in the feces?  
  
2\. Would you say cutting off calcium while you are in an inflamed and de-
energized state, beneficial? I always found that milk for example would make
me more and more stiff and painful after some inflammatory state took place -
indicating that the calcium is becoming a part of the fibrotic tissue?  
  
3\. Also, heated fats would do the same things as milk. I've removed heating
any fat and just boiling some eggs and seafood, eating a bit of parmigiano
reggiano cheese and that made me feel 60% better in a matter of 2-3 days.
Would that indicate that the oxidized cholesterol also plays a role in
fibrosis and calcification?  
  
So sorry for the long email  
  
Much love to you Dr. Peat  
  
**RP** : High parathyroid hormone and high iron intake, with low vitamin D,
vitamin K, calcium and magnesium in the diet, and hyperventilation are things
that contribute to abnormal calcificaiton.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
You've said to me that "a pure powdered glandular product would be ideal, if
one can be found".  
  
I've purchased one from [ Life Giving Store ](https://lifegivingstore.com/) [
[ LINK ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-
desiccated-thyroid-ndt/) ] and I hope this is a good quality thyroid.  
  
They've stated that one serving contains 30mg of thyroid.  
  
But I was wondering what is the best way to use it and how much at the
beginning?  
What is the ratio of T4 and T3 in [ NDT
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-desiccated-
thyroid-ndt/) like this?  
Should I drink it by mixing it with some other food or drink?  
  
Thank you for all the emails you answered. I'm beyond grateful.  
  
Lots of love  
  
**RP** : The traditional standardized glandular was diluted 1 to 3, and the
standard starting dose was usually 30 mg; if it hasn’t been diluted, than the
starting dose would be 10 mg. When it’s digested, it releases T4 to T3 in a
ratio of roughly 3 or 4 to 1. It can be taken with food, it doesn’t matter.

Apparently you've said that: " **_many people who have even a slight

supplements_ ** ".  
  
So how should one go about that? I could buy some topical D3 from Georgi's
company or buy the VIT D3 in olive oil you recommended a few weeks ago.  
  
Do you think topical should raise D3 levels more instead of high oral dosages?  
  
Does the same apply for VIT K as well?  
  
Love and gratitude  
  
**RP** : Only a small percentage is absorbed through the skin; sometimes even
with the oral doses it takes a while to optimize the blood level.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I'm a bit confused about how to dissolve [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) . Should I
add baking soda at all? To hot or warm water? Would I drink until I reach the
sediment?  
  
I've always had an increase in my tinnitus when I drink the tablet but now I
would like to try dissolving a very small amount. Maybe just a quarter of a
tablet [25mg] to see where my threshold is.  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : A quarter of a tablet will dissolve in a cup of warm water; there
shouldn’t be much sediment.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr. Peat  
  
I was wondering,  
  
Since I got pain and intestinal bleeding after taking tablets and supplements
with silica, titanium dioxide, talc, microcrystalline cellulose etc, such as
Cynomel and Cynoplus - would you say that I can dissolve Cynomel and Cynoplus
the same way as Aspirin to remove impurities? Is thyroid water soluble?  
  
Thank you!  
  
**RP** : It isn’t water soluble. Have you tried a glandular product? The last
time I looked, Armour thyroid didn’t contain silica, talc, or titanium.  
  
**Q** : Yes I did Dr.Peat.  
  
I bought [ NDT ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-
natural-desiccated-thyroid-ndt/) from [ Life Giving Store
](https://lifegivingstore.com/) [ [ Natural Beef Thyroid
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-desiccated-
thyroid-ndt/) ] and I've been using it for 1 week so far.  
I am using 5 Grams or 30mg of NDT twice a day. [So 60mg per day]. Do you have
any opinion on this specific NDT?  
  
Armour thyroid still contains the following [which I am afraid of using]:
**calcium stearate, dextrose, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch
glycolate and opadry white.**  
  
Do you know any way or place where I can get like the pure pharmaceutical T4
and T3 in a powder form - without all the nasty stuff they always put in a
tablet.  
I could feel the benefits of Cynomel and Cynoplus for example, but the
inflammation and bleeding in my intestine led to SO MUCH MORE harm than the
thyroid hormone could negate.  
  
**RP** : I’m not familiar with that product.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat.  
  
In your article "Aging, estrogen, and [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) " you've
said the following:  
  
" **In studies of tendons, excess estrogen, aging, and cooking (the phenomenon
of the curling pork chop) all caused hardening and contraction of the[
collagen ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-beef-grass-
fed/) ** ."  
  
What do you mean by cooking? Like cooking or heating food and meat?  
Would the cooked food increase the hardening of the collagen inside the body
and that's why I usually feel so stiff after cooking/heating fats and
proteins?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Digestion breaks down the structure of gelatin, so those changes
produced by heat don’t affect nutrition.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr.Peat  
One more question  
  
You talked about the negative effects of darkness.  
So, I was wondering. If someone is a night owl and he spends his night time
with a good incandescent light turned on, drinking and eating some sugary
stuff, calcium, sodium etc - would the negative effects of darkness be
diminished in any way?  
  
**RP** : Yes, even intermittent bright light can reduce the damage.

I cannot find high quality animals here to make my own gelatine at the moment,

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
What is the mechanism behind increased tinnitus after using [ Aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) [even 25mg
increases it].  
The few things that I've noticed that increase my tinnitus is coca-cola and
caffeine sometimes. So not always. But aspirin always increases it.  
  
Could it be that it is increasing circulation and my blood vessels are in a
very bad state [I have hearing loss/tinnitus/crohn's/brain lesions, loss of
hairs on my lower legs and other obvious circulatory problems].  
  
**RP** : Intestinal inflammation, increasing endotoxin, serotonin, and
histamine is probably the cause. I have known people who quickly stopped their
tinnitus just by eliminating certain foods.

Email exchange from Aug 19, 2021 - Aug 21  
  
  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
Sorry to bother you but I'm super confused.  
It's been 5 days of taking VIT D3 [in olive oil - the one you recommended to
me a few weeks ago].  
I've been taking 30 000 IU/10 000 x3 besides changing nothing else in my diet.  
  
And for the past 2 days I've been feeling terrible and today I had blood in my
stool [The same way as when I was using cynomel/cynoplus and doxycycline].  
  
After supplementing D3 my face was getting drier and my scalp harder and
stiffer.  
  
Feeling really terrible and feeling like I've hit a wall. I really thought
this was going to help me. I'm just trying to find the mechanism behind this.  
  
**Q** : To add to this email I've also added gelatin to my diet so that could
also be it. I'm going to experiment which one is it.  
  
**RP** : Do you take the vitamin D orally? That would be too much orally, but
probably not enough if it’s on the skin. Yes, a poorly made gelatin could
cause the symptoms. In early July you mentioned drinking 3 liters of milk;
have you continued that?  
  
**Q** : Hi Dr Peat  
  
I do take D3 orally.What would you say then is a safe oral D3 dose?  
My gelatin is very well dissolved and I even use the strain to remove some
chunks - but there are not any.  
  
When I physically damage my intestine in any way, like I did now - my milk has
to be very low. Otherwise my scalp, face etc become even more stiff and dry.
And while using D3 I also felt my whole intestine getting stiff - In the same
way I feel when I eat a high meat diet for example. Very strange.  
I think that with the damage and inflammation in my intestine, milk is highly
metabolically intense for my crohn's, energy-lowered intestines to handle. I
feel like it just further increases my stress hormones. Today I woke up with
some knee and hip pain which I don't remember ever happening.  
I am going to do some egg shell powder + leafy greens for calcium until I fix
my gut to tolerate milk again.  
  
But with the D3 supplementation I was drinking around 1.5l of milk plus cheese
and cooked kale+chard. And I was just getting more stiff and feeling unwell.  
  
I'm going to experiment with using [ collagen
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-hydrolysate-beef-grass-fed/) and
D3 separately after I lower inflammation and bleeding, just to confirm all of
this and I will report back  
  
Much love  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I was thinking and I remembered you talked about glycerine being very
irritating to you...  
In this VIT D3 there was a glycerine as well so could that also be what caused
the bleeding and the cascade of all of these problems I experienced?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : : I think that’s possible; MCT can have similar effects.  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
If you remember [And you can see some of our conversation in this thread] I've
been struggling with VIT D3 supplements.  
For the past 3 days I've been using around 50,000 IU topically [ 2x a day, so
in total 100,000 IU ] and again I'm getting the same symptoms as oral
supplementation. Red, dry, damaged face. Full or rosacea and eczema/dermatitis
Just no bleeding thus far when I defecate but I think It will happen soon. And
my brain also feels tight/relaxed/sleepy.  
  
And I've been thinking a lot and reading your stuff and I think I've figured
it out.  
Considering I have brain lesions, crohn's, tinnitus, hearing loss all point
out my microcirculation and capillary circulation is totally weak and damaged.  
  
I've been having the same symptoms [ to VIT D3] as when I use cynoplus and
cynomel. [ Aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-
aspirin/) makes my tinnitus increase. And I had the same discomfort in my
ileocolic valve a long time ago when I used ginkgo biloba.  
Also doxycycline did the same damage to my face. If I'm not mistaken - **They
are all blood thinners** .  
  
Could it be that all of my problems are maybe not only ingredient related but
my microcirculation and blood vessels cannot handle the overload of blood
thinning effect?  
For example my ears didn't feel clogged after cynoplus but three is some kind
of threshold after I'm totally messed up and bleeding.  
  
I've read your "Rosacea" article and you've talked about this mechanism. I've
been using [ niacinamide
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b3-niacinamide-powder-usp-grade/)
but with no effect.  
  
Could you PLEASE offer some advice on how to proceed from here or deny/confirm
my reasoning.  
  
Much love and always grateful!  
  
**RP** : Does your diet include enough [ riboflavin
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b2-riboflavin-powder-usp-grade/) ,
and calcium relative to phosphate? Have you had blood tests for vitamin D,
TSH, etc.?  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
My results are from 2 months ago:  
Cholesterol -3.9 [3.4 - 5.2]  
HDL - 0.80 LOW [1 - 1.90]  
Blood calcium C - 2.10 [2,02 - 2.60[  
Blood Phosphor P - 0.95 [0.87 - 1,62]  
VITAMIN D3 - 20,80 LOW [30+]  
Albumin - 31,20 LOW [35-52]  
Calprotectin - 223,30 HIGH [< 50]  
TSH - 3,93 [0,25 - 4,30]  
PTH - 32,90 [4,60 - 58,11]  
T3 - 1 LOW [1,08 - 3,08]  
T4 - 65, 70 [51,60 - 141,90]  
  
FOOD: Lower fat, lots of carbs [fruits] and orange juices. Mushrooms, liver
[once, twice a week] carrot salad, oysters, eggs, cheese, cooked greens, beef
[1-2 a week] and potatoes 1-2 times per week. I lowered my milk since it gave
some intestinal discomfort after oral VIT D3 inflamed my gut. So I don't eat a
lot of phosphate and I eat a lot of riboflavin foods.  
  
I remember developing crohn's disease just after few months after the doctor's
therapy for tinnitus - which involved some blood thinners [BETAHISTINE and
GINKGO BILOBA - LEAF EXTRACT]  
  
Can you please share your opinion on blood thinners for a person with a lot of
circulatory and circulation problems. I believe I have some vasculitis but I
never tested for it. I seem to have the negative symptoms to a lot of blood
thinners. And my best skin was when I was using K2 [mk4].  
  
Much love Dr. Peat  
  
**RP** : I think low thyroid and vitamin D are the main things, but there
might be inflammation from some fruits, potatoes, cooked greens, and possible
additives in cheese.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr. Peat but with all due respect there is no way that this
is down to food.  
  
I've been eating the same way for over 2 years and I only experience these
side effects when adding supplements.  
  
I have low VIT D3 but then experiencing tremendous suffering when trying to
supplement it. If some random person gave me this D3 supplement I would
honestly think he was trying to kill me. It's that bad  
  
I am so stuck, beyond words.  
  
Can you think of any other mechanism through which D3 can cause such harm?  
Do you think the blood thinning can cause harm to people with very bad blood
vessels, capillaries and circulation?  
  
I'm so sorry for being so pushy I am just so lost.  
  
RP: The effects of the anti-coagulants aren’t long lasting.  
  
**Q** : Does VIT D3 deplete some vitamin or mineral specifically in quite
large amounts?  
  
It's very difficult to believe any of the pro D3 narrative when I'm
experiencing such intense side effects.  
The main problem for me is because I believe YOU. And you are so sure it is
beneficial but all I experience is how it is not.  
  
**Q** : Could it be that D3 activated some dormant viruses or bacterias/fungi
since it is known to be a potent antibacterial and I'm experiencing some die
off symptoms or endotoxin die off?  
  
**RP** : Did you use any vitamin D that contained MCT?  
  
**Q** : No Dr Peat. I'm using the one you recommended:  
VIT D3 in olive oil with no added ingredients [except glycerin].  
  
It makes all of my problems worse and I have to stop taking it.  
It's definitely the VIT D3 since I have the same symptoms with oral and
topical supplementation.  
I've experimented with it twice and my problems subside when I remove the
supplement.  
  
For the past year I've been using it with K2, topically [Thorne, only with MCT
as an ingredient] and I've had no problems.  
It seems the VIT K2 negates all the bad effects of D3.  
  
**Q** : Hi Dr. Peat  
  
I just want to say that I love you and respect you indefinitely. I don't think
I'm smart enough to offer some counter arguments to your claims, just my
direct experience.  
I wrote 500 pages of notes by reading your articles and listening to your
podcast over the past year. I never trusted anyone more regarding health.  
I've listened to countless hours of you talking about VIT D3 and mentioning no
side effects. I was so hopeful It will help me. In the past I was using it
with no problems [Thorne D3+k2, topically].  
  
But after this recent experience with D3 and all the calcifying and fibrotic
experiences I've had [and still have] - I feel kind of fearful going forward
and trusting the other information. Sort of a mental blockage. Like I don't
trust you or you've let me down.  
Probably because my brain has also changed a bit after the experience,
probably more estrogenic and serotoninic.  
  
So I guess what I am saying is that I need some confirmation from you that you
actually believe my experience rather than saying that the food or something
else irritated me [ because I've been eating the same things for almost 2
years with no problems].  
  
Could you see any mechanism through which my claims would be true? I'm 3 days
off the D3 and my skin is getting better.  
  
I've also sent you some pictures of my face before and after D3 - if you need
further information.  
  
Much love!  
  
**Q** : Alright Dr. Peat,  
  
Forget about this email. I'm sorry, I am a bit sensitive and emotional.

**Q** : Hi Dr. Peat  
  
How does one take [ cascara ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-
sagrada/) sagrada?  
  
How many mg is optimal?  
In food/drink?  
On an empty stomach?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : People vary tremendously in their response to it. A common tablet
size was 500 mg, but even a fourth of that was much more than enough for many
people. A mere taste of it can stimulate the whole digestive system.  
  
**Q** : I've dissolved a a .15CC scoop in hot water and drank it  
  
I've heard just now that you like to put a bit on your tongue and then drink
milk.  
  
Do you think there are more benefits to the way you consume it?  
  
**RP** : The taste is important, so the water should be effective. It usually
takes about 8 hours for the laxative effect.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
Do you know what is the best way to supplement Vitamin K?  
In pill form or liquid type?  
Do you know any brand that you feel comfortable recommending?  
Much love  
  
**RP** : I have used various forms, the important thing is that the excipient
be safe, without silica, preferably no MCT.  
  
**Q** : Is there any way to measure the effectiveness of the given VIT K
supplement?  
Should we aim for both MK-4 and MK-7?  
Can you remember any that you liked specifically?  
Thank you Dr. Peat  
  
**RP** : The liver modifies it, so I think K1 or K2 is adequate. In a large
dose, vitamin K can quickly normalize high blood pressure.  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
Do you think that maltodextrin is a safe excipient in a VIT K powder
supplement?  
  
Are the requirements for K1, K2 [MK-4] and [MK-7] different?  
What is the optimal dose for someone with IBD and fibrosis/calcification
symptoms?  
  
**RP** : I think it’s safe if it’s the only excipient. I think any vitamin K
will support the functions that depend on K; the liver can interchange the
forms.  
In case there are impurities in it, I think the first doses should be very
small; then, 45 mg per day has been used without side effects other than lower
blood pressure.

I grinded up and made my first eggshell powder for getting extra calcium.  
  
How much would you suggest daily?  
Someone said that quarter of a teaspoon three times a day equals to 2000mg is
that true?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : If you mix it with your food, it probably won’t irritate your
digestive system, and that amount will help to balance the phosphate in foods
such as meat and fish. It doesn’t provide a significant amount of magnesium.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
If the tissue damage is the cause of the appearance of estrogen in that tissue
in order to heal it - what causes that tissue to become easily damageable?  
  
Like in my case for example. I have Crohn's and my intestine is easily damaged
with supplements and even [ cascara
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/) sagrada for example. It
causes bleeding and all these stress hormones get activated and after that It
takes months until I've restored some of the oxidative metabolism.  
  
So what is specifically the mechanism that damages tissues that easily and how
to heal that tissue without involving estrogen?  
  
Is that tissue already estrogenic on its own based on previous inflammations
and bleeding?  
Will VIT E help with removing estrogen from inflamed tissues?  
Is the intestine calcified and lower in energy and therefore it's easily
damaged?  
  
Can the microbes and bacteria in the small intestine damage the tissue and
walls of the intestine as well?  
  
Thank you Dr Peat and much love!  
  
**RP** : Accumulated polyunsaturated fats and iron in tissues are often
important factors in the inflammation, increasing estrogen and other
inflammatory effects. Vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, vitamin E, [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) ,
bicarbonate/CO2, thyroid hormone and flavonoids are important protective
factors.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I want to buy some CO2 tank to use either in the bathtub or in some plastic
bag while I'm in it.  
  
Although, I'm totally clueless as to how I should "transport" the CO2 from the
tank to the tub or the bag.  
Do I need some other device to be able to do it?  
  
Sorry if the question is too silly.  
  
Much love.  
  
**RP** : The tanks usually have a valve similar to a water faucet, and
attaching a hose is convenient for directing the gas, but with a plastic bag,
it can just be held against the nozzle. If you turn the valve carefully you
can get a moderate stream, but about an eighth of a turn will fill a big bag
in a few seconds. It’s extremely cold when it comes out, so you have to watch
that you don’t freeze your fingers. Welding shops might have a hose that fits.
Some gas specialty stores will try to sell you very expensive gauges and
regulators that aren’t necessary. It’s good to understand the “gas laws,” the
relation of pressure to temperature and volume.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
If you oxidize glucose properly and that increases your ATP and CO2 levels in
the blood - Would your breath rate be faster or slower?  
  
I've heard someone say that in that case your breath will be faster because
the body tries to eliminate excess CO2 from the blood to maintain the Oxygen-
CO2 levels balance.  
  
But I don't know if they are trying to equate "breathing faster" to
hyperventilating - which in that case doesn't make any sense.  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Rate of breathing isn’t the same as volume of air exchanged, and the
amount of air exchanged isn’t what determines hyperventilation. A low rate of
oxidation, with a “normal” rate of air exchange, amounts to hyper-(more than
needed)-ventilation. An unusually high oxidative metabolism needs a large
volume exchange, and sometimes that will be provided by an unusually high
respiratory rate, though usually with deeper breathing too.  
  
**Q** : Thanks Dr Peat  
  
Is 99% pure CO2 gas safe to use for CO2 baths?  
  
**RP** : Yes.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
My eyes are getting extremely dry after taking [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) (around
12mg, orally or on my gums).  
I also seem to urinate a lot more. I usually use it at night.  
  
Why do you think this is?  
  
**RP** : Have you checked your temperature and pulse rate? A higher
temperature might temporarily affect tear flow. Progesterone can help the
tissues to release excess water.  
  
**Q** : I didn't measure the pulse and temp before going to bed,  
  
I am usually quite warm when I lay in bed - not sure about the pulse...  
  
I don't feel progesterone increases my body temp in any way. It just makes me
feel tired/relaxed and my eyes shut and dry out completely - almost so that I
cannot open them for a couple of seconds and when I do - it feels only like
air is inside...

Much love Dr. Peat  
  
**RP** : I would reduce the amount. When I was in my late 20s my brow ridges
thickened, and I didn’t think it looked good, but I got used to it. I think
it’s a normal effect of the hormonal changes of maturing.

I constantly have a clogged nose - 90% of the time.

Things get a little better when I eat only fruits but still not ideal.  
What are the things that could lead to this situation?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Irritation in the bowel. Certain fruits are hard to digest, or
contain proinflammatory thing such as serotonin. Banans, pineapples, and dates
are examples.  
  
**Q** : I don't eat bananas. Dates and pineapples sometimes. Usually OJ, fruit
juices (with no pulp), kiwi and only a few others.  
And this is when my nose feels the best. When I eat fruits in the morning.  
  
As soon as I eat meat or fatty food I feel my nose getting clogged.  
  
**RP** : When fats cause digestive problems it’s almost always the result of
hypothyroidism.

I think you've said something like "If the cell accumulates too much calcium
it will be hard to stimulate it".  
  
Would you say then that If someone's bowel - or particularly ileocolic valve -
is calcified do to a lot of tissue damage from crohn's disease and
inflammation - would you say that if the organism is trying to stimulate it in
any way ( by person's trying to increase metabolism by supplementing thyroid
or using something like [ cascara ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-

blood and cause more tissue damage?

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
What do you think of the "Innate immune system" and it's suppression and
activation? Does it even exist and can you actually activate it or suppress
it?  
  
I hear a lot of doctors using angiotensin II receptor blockers like losartan
and olmesartan just to name a few using it to improve innate immune response.  
  
What is your take on it?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Those do help; also quinine.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr. Peat  
  
I've been exposed to a lot of biotoxins and mycotoxins during my lifetime and
I always fall back on their symptoms as soon as my immune system goes down.  
Clogged nose, balanitis (white coating and inflammation of glans),
intestine/digestion problems, skin issues, histamine, liver/kidney problems,
fatigue, mood swings etc. They always seem to linger though, never fully
disappear.  
[ Progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) unfortunately doesn't help [12-24mg a day] or VIT K also...  
  
Things like Doxycycline, Thyroid [cynomel, cynoplus], VIT D make me bleed out
of my intestine - probably by somehow modulating immune response - I have no
idea how.  
But since I have Crohn's disease there must have been some bug involved right?  
  
I'm so confused about these immunosuppressive and immunostimulating ideas. How
would one know the difference? For some VIT D is immunosuppressive as well as
progesterone for example.  
I've had extremely bad exacerbation of all of my symptoms and even some old
childhood ones reappeared after using high doses of VIT D3 [In olive oil,
topically and orally]. Is this because VIT D is immunosuppressive or
immunostimulant?  
  
**RP** : The receptor blockers have many important protective effects.  
Do you eat any preparted (canned or packaged) foods?  
  
**Q** : I don't recall eating any canned or packaged food - so no citric acid
or any other bad stuff.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
For the past month I've been using:  
  
K2 [MK-4]: 45mg  
Whole VIT E [ [ Whole E 2oz ](https://healthnatura.com/whole-e-2oz/) ]: 1.5g  
[ Progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) [12-24mg]  
And 1/4 Cynomel for the past 6 days.  
  
All orally.  
  
My temp after dinner is between 36.9- 37.1 celsius and my heart rate ranges
from 87 BPM - 95 BPM. I feel warm. Much more than ever before.  
  
I have been using these to try to remedy my damaged skin from using high doses
of VIT D.  
It didn't help with that.  
I can feel some little improvements in some other areas.  
  
But I did have some heart, circulation weirdness. One night I felt like my
heart [or the area around my heart] was getting calcified and more "stiff". I
also have some kind of weird pressure in my head [Similar as when I used
Cynomel and Cynoplus for a month or when I used high doses of VIT D]. It's
definitely the blood thinning effect.  
  
Do you think the blood thinning effect of these supplements could cause some
problems?  
  
What dosing would you recommend now that I am trying to lower it. And should I
even take a break from some of them?  
  
Much love Dr Peat.  
  
**RP** : What are the exact ingredients of the vitamin E product, including
any substance besides vitamin E?  
  
**Q** : I use Whole VIT E from "Health Natura" [ [ Link of the product
](https://healthnatura.com/whole-e-2oz/) ]  
  
**RP** : According to the information on that website, the tocopherols account
for 55% of the volume. The other materials could be responsible for some of
the symptoms  
  
**Q** : I just checked again.  
Tocopherols account for 76% total Tocopherols and another ingredient is MCT
oil.  
  
**RP** : The 45% of nontocopherol material is probably the problem, likely to
include rancid soy PUFA.

compounds like Methylene Blue, VIT D3 or Doxycycline - symptoms can actually
get worse if a particular person has a higher toxic load?  
And what would specifically aid the process of removing that toxic load?  
  
I'm using 400mcg of MB 2x a day along with [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) , 1/4 of
cynomel, K2 and I have some symptoms of sciatica, diarrhea, intestinal
discomfort, hardening of the scalp and skin problems. I have a lot of symptoms
that suggest I have a lot of parasites along with fungal and bacterial
overgrowth.  
  
Thanks Dr. Peat  
  
**RP** : Doxycycline has some intrinsic toxicity. A good diet and good liver
function keeps the detoxifying systems working.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
One quick question:  
If I had iron overload in my tissues. Intestines for example. Would ingesting
something like Methylene Blue cause the oxidation of that iron and cause more
problems?  
  
STUDY: [ Cellular and Molecular Actions of Methylene Blue in the Nervous
System ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005530/)  
" _MB also directly inhibits both constitutive and inducible forms of nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) **by oxidation of ferrous iron** bound to the enzyme
(Mayer et al., 1993; Volke et al., 1999). It inactivates nitric oxide (NO) by
generation of superoxide anions _ ."  
  
**RP** : I think it can produce harmful free radicals. There are chelators
that help to remove excess iron, but just drinking coffee helps.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I got severe symptoms of pulmonary edema/myocarditis after using 45mg K2 MK-4
for around 2 months. [I was also using T3 and VIT E with it. I stopped VIT E
and T3 and used only K for 10 + days and symptoms worsened].  
  
[ Progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) helps relieve my chest tightness but doesn't resolve it.  
  
I haven't seen a single bad study on VIT K but it seems that all the side
effects will happens to me.  
  
Do you know why this happens and what can I do to improve this condition?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : The solvents used in vitamin K can be very harmful.  
  
**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I was using K2 MK-4 dissolved in MCT oil topically on my skin for the last 20
days.  
My symptoms were stiffness of the intestine and colon, stiffness of blood
vessels, [I felt if I move to quickly my aorta/blood vessel would "crack"],
extreme chest tightening, hyperventilating, extreme pulsating kidney pain,
symptoms of blood clotting [blood "spots" on my skin], body soreness/pain
after waking up [progesterone made it much tolerable].  
  
I think the K2 increased my clotting time, which also messed up with my
calcium homeostasis somehow?  
Could you see any mechanism that could lead to this?  
  
**Q** : I also forgot to mention that after just 2 days of applying K2 on my
belly, it resolved my eczema/red face and hard coated scalp, before it caused
me all these severe bad reactions.  
  
**RP** : Cooked greens, milk, cheese, and eggs are very good sources of K. The
solvents used to extract vitamin K, for example from natto, often cause
problems. The present vitamin K culture is the creation of marketing
campaigns, and is causing a lot of harm.

The ability of male rats to accumulate menaquinone-4 (MK-4) in tissues when
fed a  
vitamin K-deficient diet supplemented with intraperitoneal phylloquinone (K)
as  
the sole source of vitamin K for 14 d was assessed. In both conventionally
housed  
controls and gnotobiotic rats, supplementation with the equivalent of 1500
microg  
vitamin K/kg diet increased (P < 0.001) tissue MK-4 concentrations above those
of  
controls fed a vitamin K-deficient diet. MK-4 concentrations were
approximately 5  
ng/g (11 pmol/g) in liver, 14 ng/g in heart, 17 ng/g in kidney, 50 ng/g in
brain  
and 250 ng/g in mandibular salivary glands of gnotobiotic rats. MK-4  
concentrations in conventionally housed rats were higher than in gnotobiotic
rats  
in heart (P < 0.01), brain (P < 0.01) and kidney (P < 0.05) but lower in
salivary  
gland (P < 0.05). Cultures of a kidney-derived cell line (293) converted K to
the  
expoxide of MK-4 in a manner that was dependent on both time of incubation and  
concentration of vitamin K in the media. A liver-derived cell line (H-35) was  
less active in carrying out this conversion. **These data offer conclusive
proof  
that the tissue-specific formation of MK-4 from K is a metabolic
transformation  
that does not require bacterial transformation to menadione as an intermediate
in  
the process. **

**Don't use the wrong vitamin K.**

The emergency use of vitamin K is essentially limited to the reversal of  
drug-induced hypoprothrombinemia. In patients with adequate liver function,  
phytonadione acts promptly and predictably in this capacity whereas the  
derivatives of menadione counteract coumarin drugs only slightly or not at
all.  
It is dangerous to rely on menadione analogues, and these drugs should be
removed  
from emergency room drug stores.

Vitamin K1 has been demonstrated as having anticancer potentiality mainly in  
liver cancer cells. Beyond the reported mechanisms of cancer inhibition (cell  
cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis), a possible control by vitamin K1 on  
molecules affecting cell growth could be hypothesized. In the literature, few
(if  
any) data are available on its antitumor effects on colon cancer cells.  
Therefore, the aims of the study were to investigate in three differently
graded  
human colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2, HT-29, and SW480) the effects of  
increasing concentrations of vitamin K1 (from 10 μM to 200 μM) administered up
to  
72 h on (1) cell proliferation, (2) apoptosis with the possible involvement of  
the MAPK pathway, and (3) polyamine biosynthesis. Vitamin K1 treatment caused
a  
significant antiproliferative effect and induced apoptosis in all the cell
lines,  
with the involvement of the MAPK pathway. A concomitant and significant
decrease  
in the polyamine biosynthesis occurred. This is the first study demonstrating
a  
significant polyamine decrease in addition to the antiproliferative and  
proapoptotic effects following vitamin K1 administration to colon cancer cell  
lines. Therapeutically, combinations of vitamin K1 with polyamine inhibitors  
and/or analogues may represent a suitable option for chemoprevention and/or  
treatment in future strategies for colorectal cancer management.

Vitamin K1 is used as a liver protection drug for cholestasis-induced liver  
fibrosis in China, but the mechanism of vitamin K1's action in liver fibrosis
is  
unclear. In this study, a model of liver fibrosis was achieved via bile duct  
ligation in rats. The rats were then injected with vitamin K1, and the levels
of  
serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, total bilirubin and
the  
fibrotic grade score, [ collagen ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/collagen-
hydrolysate-beef-grass-fed/) content, the expressions of α-smooth muscle actin  
(SMA) and cytokeratin 19 (CK19) were measured on day 28 after ligation. The  
levels of the biochemical parameters, fibrotic score and collagen content were  
significantly reduced by treatment with vitamin K1 in bile duct-ligated rats.
In  
addition, α-SMA and CK19 expression was significantly reduced by vitamin K1  
treatment in bile duct-ligated rats. These results suggested that vitamin K1
may  
attenuate liver fibrosis by inhibiting hepatic stellate cell activation in
bile  
duct-ligated rats.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
What would you recommend to a 31 year old who developed atherosclerosis and
aortic calcification.  
  
VIT K2 MK-4 and D3 [taken separately - both topically and orally] not only
helped with the problem but led to worsening of the problem. I've never had
any aortic/heart problems in my life until supplementing D3 and K2 only a few
months ago.  
  
Thank you  
  
**RP** : What tests were done in relation to the diagnoses?  
  
**Q** : I've done none of the tests that confirm that. I thought it would be
easier just to ask instead of telling the whole story.  
  
I can feel the stiffening of my blood vessels, arteries and intestine. Extreme
chest/heart pressure and blood pressure problems. Inability to breathe deeply.
Feeling of lightheadedness. Kidney problems/kidney pain and pulsating
inflammation.  
  
My grandma died of aortic calcification and my mom's doctor just confirmed
stiffening of the arteries for her.  
  
I could feel the blood pressure problems are directly related to inability of
the proper blood flow because everything is stiffened/calcified. Whenever I
eat some higher calcium food [milk, ice cream, cheese] I could feel the
worsening of my symptoms.  
  
With VIT K and D3 I've also used VIT E 750mg - 1.5g for almost 2 months which
could also be the reason I've experienced this.  
But I've removed VIT E and used only K2 for the next 10 days and felt
worsening of the symptomes.  
  
To be honest dr Peat I've never been dramatic but I really feel like I could
die in every moment. I really feel that bad.  
  
Also I have some superficial thrombophlebitis appearing in the last 10 days
which I also never had before in my life. Which indicates some blood clotting
happening.  
  
**RP:** I think it’s imp0rtant to have some tests, at least vitamin D, PTH,
and TSH.  
  
**Q:** I will also get some ultrasound of the heart. I don't know if
ultrasound would be useful for checking on aorta and blood vessels Dr Peat?  
  
Also what you recommend to me based on my symptomes.  
  
Would CO2 baths and [ magnesium bicarbonate
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/magnesium-hydroxide-powder-usp-grade/) for
example be useful?  
I already use [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-
micronized-powder-usp/) [9-18mg a day] and I can't use [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) because of
the increase in my tinnitus.  
  
**RP** : CO2 does help, and magnesium bicarbonate probably does too.  
  
**Q** : Just one more question regarding this issue  
  
In your book "generative energy" you mention something about sodium
thiosulfate but I forgot what specifically.  
I've heard it mentioned in several studies as well as a good option. Would you
still think it's safe to use?  
  
Also would you say lidocaine cream would be useful since you mentioned it has
some calcium regulatory effect while also being anti inflammatory?  
  
**RP** : Thiosulphate’s main value is as a fungicide. Lidocaine lotions have
some systemic effects on calcium.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
Over the years you've said so many fascinating things about IODIDE and bad
things about IODINE that made me wonder if they are the same substances?  
  
What should I eat or buy as a supplement in order to increase my IODIDE?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Very large doses of potassium iodide used to be used for certain
inflammations or infections, but its effects haven’t been understood. The
small amount of iodide added to salt has been reported in more than 70 studies
to damage the thyroid gland, even increasing thyroid cancer.

Studies on the carcinogenicity of potassium iodide in F344 rats.

Setagaya-ku, 158-8501, Tokyo, Japan.  
A chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study, in which male and female
F344/DuCrj  
rats were given potassium iodide (KI) in the drinking water at concentrations
of  
0, 10, 100 or 1000 ppm for 104 weeks, and a two-stage carcinogenicity study of  
application at 0 or 1000 ppm for 83 weeks following a single injection of  
N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine (DHPN), were conducted. In the former,
squamous  
cell carcinomas were induced in the salivary glands of the **1000 ppm** group,
but no  
tumors were observed in the thyroid. In the two-stage carcinogenicity study,  
thyroidal weights and the incidence of thyroid tumors derived from the
follicular  
epithelium were significantly increased in the DHPN+KI as compared with the
DHPN  
alone group. The results of our studies suggest that excess KI has a thyroid  
tumor-promoting effect, but KI per se does not induce thyroid tumors in rats.
In  
the salivary gland, KI was suggested to have carcinogenic potential via an  
epigenetic mechanism, **only active at a high dose.**

**Induction of squamous cell carcinomas in the salivary glands of rats by

Takegawa K(1), Mitsumori K, Onodera H, Yasuhara K, Kitaura K, Shimo T,
Takahashi  
M.  
(1)Division of Pathology, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo.  
In a 2-year carcinogenicity study of potassium iodide (KI) in F344/DuCrj rats,  
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) were observed in the salivary glands of 4/40  
males and 3/40 females receiving **1000 ppm KI** in the drinking water.
Ductular  
proliferation with lobular atrophy was observed at high incidence in the  
submandibular glands of the high-dose animals, and squamous metaplasia was  
frequently evident within the proliferative ductules and the larger
interlobular  
ducts. A transition from metaplasia to SCC was apparent. The results suggest
that  
squamous metaplasia in proliferative ductules, occurring secondarily to
lobular  
impairment induced by KI, may develop into SCCs via a non-genotoxic,  
proliferation-dependent mechanism.

Iodide excess induces apoptosis in thyroid cells through a p53-independent  
mechanism involving oxidative stress.

(1)Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Molecolare, Università  
Federico II, Naples, Italy. [ mavitale@unina.it ](mailto:mavitale@unina.it)  
Thyroid toxicity of iodide excess has been demonstrated in animals fed with an  
iodide-rich diet; in vitro iodide is cytotoxic, inhibits cell growth, and
induces  
morphological changes in thyroid cells of some species. In this study, we  
investigated the effect of iodide excess in an immortalized thyroid cell line  
(TAD-2) in primary cultures of human thyroid cells and in cells of nonthyroid  
origin. Iodide displayed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both TAD-2 and
primary  
thyroid cells, although at different concentrations, whereas it had no effect
on  
cells of nonthyroid origin. Thyroid cells treated with iodide excess underwent  
apoptosis, as evidenced by morphological changes, plasma membrane  
phosphatidylserine exposure, and DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis was unaffected
by  
protein synthesis inhibition, whereas inhibition of peroxidase enzymatic
activity  
by propylthiouracil completely blocked iodide cytotoxicity. During KI
treatment,  
reactive oxygen species were produced, and lipid peroxide levels increased  
markedly. Inhibition of endogenous p53 activity did not affect the sensitivity
of  
TAD-2 cells to iodide, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that p53, Bcl-2,  
Bcl-XL, and Bax protein expression did not change when cells were treated with  
iodide. These data indicate that excess molecular iodide, generated by
oxidation  
of ionic iodine by endogenous peroxidases, induces apoptosis in thyroid cells  
through a mechanism involving generation of free radicals. This type of
apoptosis  
is p53 independent, does not require protein synthesis, and is not induced by  
modulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bax protein expression.  
  
4\. Toxicol Pathol. 1994 Jan-Feb;22(1):23-8.  
Effects of a six-week exposure to excess iodide on thyroid glands of growing
and  
nongrowing male Fischer-344 rats.  
Kanno J(1), Nemoto T, Kasuga T, Hayashi Y.  
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental  
University, Japan.  
A 6-wk exposure to excess iodide intake (EII) via drinking water (260 mg  
potassium iodide/L) demonstrated different effects on growing (4-wk old) and  
nongrowing (45-wk old) male Fischer-344 rats. In growing rats, EII induced a  
significant increase in thyroid weight, pituitary weight, serum  
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroxine (T4). The labeling index (LI)
of  
thyroid follicular cells was slightly increased, although not statistically  
significant. Histologically, an increase in follicular cell height, an
increase  
in colloid accumulation, and evidence of colloid absorption were noted. The  
effect of bovine TSH (bTSH) and protirelin tartrate (TRH-t) on LI was  
significantly augmented by EII. In nongrowing rats, EII induced a significant  
increase in thyroid weight and serum T4 but no increase in pituitary weight,  
serum TSH, and the LI of follicular cells. Histologically, an increase in
colloid  
accumulation was found in small follicles. EII did not augment the effect of
bTSH  
and TRH-t on the LI of follicular cells. This study suggests that growing rats  
are still susceptible to acute hypothyroidism even after 6 wk of continuous  
exposure to excess iodide, whereas nongrowing rats are refractory within an  
equivalent treatment period.

Developmental toxicity and psychotoxicity of potassium iodide in rats: a case
for  
the inclusion of behaviour in toxicological assessment.  
Vorhees CV, Butcher RE, Brunner RL.  
Potassium iodide (KI) was fed to male and female rats before and during
breeding,  
to females only during gestation and lactation, and to their offspring after  
weaning (day 21 after birth) through to day 90, at levels of 0, 0.025, 0.05 or  
0.1% (w/w) of the diet. Dams in a fifth group (positive controls) were given 4  
mg/kg ip of the anti-mitotic/cytotoxic drug 5-azacytidine on day 17 of
gestation.  
All offspring were reared by their natural dams and were evaluated blind with  
respect to treatment in a battery of standardized behavioural tests between 3
and  
90 days of age. KI produced no significant reductions in parental body weight
or  
food consumption, though it significantly reduced litter size and increased  
offspring mortality at the highest dose, and decreased weight gain at the two  
highest doses throughout the first 90 days after birth. Functionally, KI
delayed  
auditory startle at the two highest doses, delayed olfactory orientation to
the  
home-cage scent at the middle dose and decreased female running-wheel activity
at  
all dose levels. In rats killed on day 90 after birth KI reduced brain and
body  
weight at a dose of 0.1% of the diet, and reduced body but not brain weight at
a  
dose of 0.05% of the diet. No significant effect was found on absolute or  
relative thyroid weight at 90 days of age. Several additional behavioural
effects  
were observed in the low-dose KI group, but because these effects were not  
dose-dependent, they were not regarded as reliable. 5-Azacytidine produced  
evidence of substantially greater developmental toxicity than KI. It was  
concluded that KI produced evidence of developmental toxicity consistent with
a  
picture of impaired thyroid function. The inclusion of tests of functional  
development added useful evidence to the overall picture of KI developmental  
toxicity.

The effect of iodide administration on hog thyroid gland and the composition
of  
thyroglobulin and 27-S iodoprotein.  
Tarutani O, Kondo T, Horiguchi-Sho K.  
The effect of excess iodide on hog thyroid gland has been examined with regard
to  
the change in the chemical composition of thyroglobulin and in the
accumulation  
of 27-S iodoprotein by the in vivo treatment of hogs with iodide for various  
lengths of time. The iodine content of thyroglobulin was either unchanged by  
short term administration of excess iodide, or somewhat lowered. However, the  
iodine content as well as the total amount of thyroglobulin increased in the  
glands enlarged by prolonged treatment with iodide. The iodine highest reached  
1.17% of the protein on an average. On the other hand, 27-S iodoprotein
decreased  
and finally disappeared after the chronic treatment. Monoiodotyrosine and  
diiodotyrosine increased in parallel with the increase in the iodine content  
(0.15 to 1.17%) caused by the iodide treatment, while thyroxine increased but  
reached a plateau at the level of three residues per mole of thyroglobulin,
and  
no change was observed even in the proteins with the higher iodine content
than  
0.75%. Proteolytic activity measured by amino acid release from the thyroid  
protein was depressed by the chronic treatment. On the other hand, the amount
of  
iodocompound released by the autoproteolysis, which may reflect hormone  
secretion, increased, possibly because of the marked increase in the iodine  
content of thyroglobulin.

In many regions, excessive fluoride and excessive iodide coexist in
groundwater,  
which may lead to biphasic hazards to human thyroid. To explore fluoride-
induced  
thyroid cytotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the effects of excessive
iodide  
on fluoride-induced cytotoxicity, a thyroid cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1) was
exposed  
to excessive fluoride and/or excessive iodide. Cell viability, lactate  
dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation,
apoptosis,  
and the expression levels of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway-
related  
molecules were detected. Fluoride and/or iodide decreased cell viability and  
increased LDH leakage and apoptosis. ROS, the expression levels of  
glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), IRE1, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP),
and  
spliced X-box-binding protein-1 (sXBP-1) were enhanced by fluoride or the  
combination of the two elements. Collectively, excessive fluoride and
excessive  
iodide have detrimental influences on human thyroid cells. Furthermore, an  
antagonistic interaction between fluoride and excessive iodide exists, and  
cytotoxicity may be related to IRE1 pathway-induced apoptosis.

The aquatic ecotoxicity of chemicals involved in the manufacturing process of  
thin film transistor liquid crystal displays was assessed with a battery of
four  
selected acute toxicity bioassays. We focused on tetramethylammonium hydroxide  
(TMAH, CAS No. 75-59-2), a widely utilized etchant. The toxicity of TMAH was
low  
when tested in the 72 h-algal growth inhibition test (Pseudokirchneriellia  
subcapitata, EC50=360 mg L(-1)) and the Microtox® test (Vibrio fischeri,
IC50=6.4  
g L(-1)). In contrast, the 24h-microcrustacean immobilization and the 96
h-fish  
mortality tests showed relatively higher toxicity (Daphnia magna, EC50=32 mg  
L(-1) and Oryzias latipes, LC50=154 mg L(-1)). Isobologram and mixture
toxicity  
index analyses revealed apparent synergism of the mixture of TMAH and
potassium  
iodide when examined with the D. magna immobilization test. The synergistic  
action was unique to iodide over other halide salts i.e. fluoride, chloride
and  
bromide. Quaternary ammonium ions with longer alkyl chains such as  
tetraethylammonium and tetrabutylammonium were more toxic than TMAH in the D.  
magna immobilization test.

Sterile cutaneous pustules: a manifestation of primary irritancy?
Identification  
of contact pustulogens.  
Wahlberg JE, Maibach HI.  
An animal model (the rabbit) was used to define which of 8 chemicals caused  
pustule formation on topical application. Large occlusive chambers (diameter
12  
mm), petrolatum as the vehicle and wrapping contributed to efficient occlusion  
and pustulation. Sodium lauryl sulfate and mecuric chloride gave reproducible  
results and clear dose-responses indicating that this pustulation is an  
expression of primary irritancy. Ammonium fluoride pustulation was not  
reproducible; croton oil pustules were more difficult to evaluate due to  
simultaneous erythema and edema. Sodium arsentate, nickel sulfate and
potassium  
iodide pustules developed at sites where the skin barriers had been damaged by
a  
stab injury. Benzalkonium chloride caused yellow staining and edema but not  
pustules. Because of lack of epidemiologic data, we do not know how frequently  
similar findings occur in man.  
  
**Q** : If I understand correctly you've changed your mind based on this new
data?  
  
_"Among the factors that probably have a role in preventing cataracts:
Thyroid,[ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-
powder-usp/) , [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) , vitamin E, iodide, pyruvate. Increasing the carbon
dioxide lowers the cell’s pH, and tends to resist swelling. Palmitic acid (a
saturated fat that can be synthesized by our tissues) is normally oxidized by
the lens. Calcium blockers experimentally prevent cataracts, suggesting that
magnesium and thyroid (which also act to exclude calcium from cells) would
have the same effect."  
  
"The sea cucumber has been used to study the physical properties of connective
tissue, and it has been found that certain salts tend to soften the connective
tissues, but that iodide doesn't. The well-established use of iodide to
resolve granulomas, even when it doesn't eliminate the infectious agent, might
suggest that it is protecting against something which is disrupting the
connective tissue structure. The only publications I have seen that presented
clear evidence of the disappearance of arteriosclerosis involved treatment
with iodides. In the retina, blood vessels can be seen to return to their
normal appearance following a course of iodide treatment. Besides its possible
direct effects on the mucins, iodide might help to eliminate calcium from the
walls of blood vessels, since calcium iodide is very soluble."  
  
"Besides its possible direct effects on the mucins, iodide might help to
eliminate calcium from the walls of blood vessels, since calcium iodide is
very soluble."  
  
"Endotoxin, produced by bacteria, mainly in the intestine, disrupts energy
production, and promotes maladaptive inflammation. The wide spectrum of
benefit that iodide has, especially in diseases with an inflammatory
component, suggests first that it protects tissue by blocking free radical
damage, but it also suggests the possibility that it might specifically
protect against endotoxin."  
  
"One of the best-known free radical scavenging substances that has been widely
used as a drug is iodide. It has been used to treat asthma, parasites,
syphilis, cancer, Graves’ disease, periodontal disease, and arteriosclerosis.
Diseases that produce tissue overgrowth associated with inflammation--
granulomas--have been treated with iodides, and although the iodide doesn’t
necessarily kill the germ, it does help to break down and remove the
granuloma. Leprosy and syphilis were among the diseases involving granulomas*
that were treated in this way. In the case of tuberculosis, it has been
suggested that iodides combine with unsaturated fatty acids which inhibit
proteolytic enzymes, and thus allow for the removal of the abnormal tissue." _  
  
Do you think supplementing thyroid while using iodide would prevent the
damaging effect?  
  
Ever since I stopped eating iodized salt (for 3 months now) and moving to
pickled salt I think I've experienced more symptoms of calcification and
hardening of the arteries and blood vessels than before. Would you say that it
could be because of removing iodine?  
  
Is iodide the same as Iodine or is it different and what would be the safest
way to consume it if one decides to use it?  
  
Thank you.  
  
**RP** : The treatments generally involve local injection of large amounts
into the tumor. Iodine is the oxidized form, iodide is the ionized form that
appears in the presense of cysteine, [ vitamin C
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) , and other
reductants.  
  
**Q** : I'm very interested in it's uses in atherosclerosis  
  
You've said" **_The only publications I have seen that presented clear
evidence of the disappearance of arteriosclerosis involved treatment with
iodides_ ." **  
  
Is there any way that you can remember how it was used and what was the doses
for that specific problem?  
Also, would you say that increasing thyroid hormone while using potassium
iodide would reduce the possible damaging effect?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Correcting elevated TSH lowers cholesterol and reduces vascular
deterioration.  
  
Hypothyroidism and Atherosclerosis  
Anne R. Cappola, Paul W. Ladenson  
The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, Volume 88, Issue 6, 1 June
2003, Pages 2438–2444,  
Cardiovascular Endocrinology: Special Features  
“There was edema of the skin… much serous effusion in the pericardium… the
heart was large… the arteries were everywhere thickened, the larger ones
atheromatous.” (1)  
[Dr. William Smith Greenfield, 1878]  
This autopsy finding of diffuse atherosclerosis in a 58-yr-old woman was
published as an appendix to William Ord’s classical description of the
syndrome of myxedema. Soon thereafter, the hypothesis of a causal relationship
between hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis was first raised in 1883 by E.
Theodor Kocher (2), who noted that arteriosclerosis commonly occurred after
thyroid extirpation. Since the time of the first associations between these
two common disorders, hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis have subsequently
been linked by a body of clinical case reports, epidemiological studies, and
biochemical observations. The hypothesis of a relationship has subsequently
been tested in case-control and cohort studies. Important associations have
been identified among hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and certain newer
risk factors for atherosclerosis in individuals with overt hypothyroidism and,
in some cases, subclinical hypothyroidism. There have also been clinical
observations and trials describing the consequences of treating hypothyroidism
in patients with ischemic heart disease and of revascularizing patients with
ischemic heart disease who are hypothyroid. These studies are the subject of
this commentary.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
About 2 years ago I went to a practitioner who was doing something called
"Live blood analysis" under a microscope.  
  
He drew my blood and saw lots of parasites in my blood as well as red blood
cells "clumped" together.  
I could even clearly see the parasites on the screen.  
He then drew my girlfriends blood and the cells were not clumping and there
were no parasites.  
  
I think pathogenic activity is really behind most of my problems and just
improving the metabolism didn't get to the "root problem".  
  
What do you think those results mean and what do you think is the best way to
improve the body dealing with these pathogens?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : “Live blood analysis” isn’t based on science.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
What would be good blood work to assess the state of my liver health and iron
overload?  
Also what markers are the most reliable to reveal if there is a higher
pathogenic/toxic/bacterial load and/or infectious problems?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : The liver enzymes, ALT and AST, are good indicators of continuing
liver damage. Also, serum vitamin D and TSH are important.  
  
**Q** : Are there any other important markers for iron overload and also how
should one interpret them to see if they have some higher tissue accumulation?  
  
Thank you for helping out Dr Peat  
  
**RP** : I don’t think any of the “markers” is very reliable; restriction of
iron in the diet is safe and protective.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
What would be the most important thing to do/have in order to be able to break
out of the cycle of "learned helplessness" and inescapable stress which has
been happening since childhood.  
  
It's obvious that the "stress reaction" is gaining new momentum each time it
is being experienced over the years.  
  
It seems that the mind and thought are of the least importance in these
"repetitive" situations; the memory of the "event" is stored somewhere in
cells and always has to play out in the same way no matter how "well" a
thought can rationalise the situation.  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : I think the only storage of an event is in the interpretation (made
by the whole organism), and so a slight insight is enough to break the
pattern.

Why would the cell take up too much calcium?  
  
I know you've said CO2 would expel excess calcium from the cell but would the
lack of CO2 also cause the cells to retain it? Are there any other mechanisms
through which this could happen?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Yes, the lack of CO2 increases lactate; too little vitamin D and/or
calcium in the diet increased parathyroid hormone, increasing lactate and
intracellular calcium.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
When I increase my fruit and cheese consumption I usually get motion sick
quite often and tonight I wondered why for the first time.  
  
I started reading about the drug that always helped me in these situations
since I was a kid. The main ingredient of the drug is diphenhydramine - an
antihistamine - which is also one of the main ingredients of benadryl.  
  
Do you know if diphenhydramine is a safe thing to consume on a daily basis or
at least several times a week in order to keep my histamine under control and
what is the mechanism of action there - why would antihistamine help me with
motion sickness?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : Histamine activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is
involved in nausea. Pure diphenhydramine is better than Benadryl.
Cyproheptadine is another antihistamine. Histamine supports wakefulness, and
too little lowers alertness.  
  
**Q** : Thank you Dr. Peat  
  
Do you think Cyproheptadine would be safer than diphenhydramine?  
Would the minimal those of these substances be safe to use long term?  
  
**RP** : My experience has been that cyproheptadine had a reparative effect,
so that after a few days using a milligram, a half or fourth worked as well,
and then I didn’t need it again for a long time.

Malonate induces cell death via mitochondrial potential collapse and delayed
swelling through an ROS-dependent pathway  
Francisco J Fernandez-Gomez,1 Maria F Galindo,1 Maria Gómez-Lázaro,1 Victor J
Yuste,2 Joan X Comella,2 Norberto Aguirre,3 and Joaquín Jordán1,4,*  
Abstract  
Herein we study the effects of the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor malonate
on its primary target, the mitochondrion.  
Malonate induces mitochondrial potential collapse, mitochondrial swelling,
cytochrome c (Cyt c) release and depletes glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide coenzyme (NAD(P)H) stores in brain-isolated mitochondria.  
Although, mitochondrial potential collapse was almost immediate after malonate
addition, mitochondrial swelling was not evident before 15 min of drug
presence. This latter effect was blocked by cyclosporin A (CSA), Ruthenium Red
(RR), magnesium, catalase, GSH and vitamin E.  
Malonate added to SH-SY5Y cell cultures produced a marked loss of cell
viability together with the release of Cyt c and depletion of GSH and NAD(P)H
concentrations. All these effects were not apparent in SH-SY5Y cells
overexpressing Bcl-xL.  
When GSH concentrations were lowered with buthionine sulphoximine,
cytoprotection afforded by Bcl-xL overexpression was not evident anymore.  
Taken together, all these data suggest that malonate causes a rapid
mitochondrial potential collapse and reactive oxygen species production that
overwhelms mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and leads to mitochondrial
swelling. Further permeability transition pore opening and the subsequent
release of proapoptotic factors such as Cyt c could therefore be, at least in
part, responsible for malonate-induced toxicity.  
  
**Introduction**  
Mitochondria are involved in a number of important cellular functions,
including essential pathways of intermediate metabolism, amino-acid
biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation and steroid metabolism. Of key importance
is the role of mitochondria in oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis. Thus,
mitochondria are considered the headquarters in apoptosis pathways (for a
review, see Susin et al., 1998; Kroemer & Reed, 2000; Jordan et al., 2003).
Many apoptotic stimuli cause either functional or morphological mitochondrial
alterations such as collapse of the transmembranal potential or swelling.
Hallmarks of these mitochondrial alterations are increased free radical
production and release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria to the
cytosol through the permeability transition pore (PTP) (Kroemer & Reed, 2000;
Vila & Przedborski, 2003). The Bcl-2 family of proteins, which is implicated
in the regulation of apoptosis by modulating PTP aperture, comprises members
that have either antiapoptotic (such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) or proapoptotic
(such as Bax and Bak) effects (Brenner et al., 2000; Gross, 2001). In this
sense, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression has been shown to confer protection to
cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli including staurosporine (Yuste et al.,
2002), 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (Galindo et al., 2004),
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyride (MPTP) (Yang et al., 1998) or
3-nitorpropionic acid (3-NP) (Bogdanov et al., 1999).  
There is substantial evidence indicating that oxidative stress plays a role in
the progression of a constellation of neurological disorders. Mitochondria
have been proposed to be the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
neuronal cells. Cells contain antioxidant systems to block ROS overproduction,
including glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme
(NADH/NAD+) and its derivatives (NADPH/NADP+) (NAD(P)H), which play a crucial
role as part of the primary cellular defence against oxidative stress. It has
been shown that GSH levels in the cerebrospinal fluid decline during aging
(Cudkowicz et al., 1999). The involvement of GSH in the control of cell death
in neurodegenerative diseases is striking and it has been suggested that GSH
depletion might be an upstream biochemical event in neurodegeneration (Dexter
et al., 1989a, 1989b). We and others have also observed a GSH depletion after
different apoptotic stimuli including 6-OHDA (Galindo et al., 2004),
veratridine (Jordan et al., 2002), MPTP (Selley, 1998) or malonate (Ehrhart &
Zeevalk, 2003).  
On the other hand, it is clear that impairment of mitochondrial energy
metabolism is the key pathogenic factor in a number of neurodegenerative
disorders (see review by Schon & Manfredi, 2003). Accordingly, toxins that
affect mitochondria are being used as pharmacological tools to mimic several
of these diseases. Among others, 3-NP, MPTP, rotenone and malonate are well-
established mitochondrial complex inhibitors frequently used to investigate
the key cellular pathways that provoke neurodegeneration in Parkinson's or
Huntington's diseases (Browne & Beal, 2002).  
Malonate has been shown to cause dose-dependent neurotoxicity both ‘in vivo'
and ‘in vitro' by inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase and depletion of
striatal ATP (Beal et al., 1993; Greene & Greenamyre, 1995; Stokes et al.,
2001, Van Westerlaak et al., 2001) resulting in neuronal depolarization and
secondary excitotoxicity (Henshaw et al., 1994; Greene & Greenamyre, 1996). In
a recent study by Schulz et al. (1998), it was suggested that malonate
toxicity involves neurons dying not only by secondary excitotoxicity but also
by delayed caspase activation and apoptosis (Schulz et al., 1998). Thus, the
exact mechanism by which malonate induces toxicity remains unclear.  
The aim of this study was to analyse the role played by mitochondria in the
mechanisms underlying malonate-induced cell death. We used isolated
mitochondrial preparations to study the effect of malonate on this organelle.
We present evidence showing that malonate induces mitochondrial potential
collapse and depletion of mitochondrial antioxidant defence which leads to
mitochondrial swelling and release of proapoptotic proteins including Cyt c.
The role of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL in these processes is also
addressed.

**Q** : Hello Dr. Peat  
  
I'm planning to buy a property with some land in Serbia, my home country, to
try to gain independence from the system and move away from environmental
pollution and toxins as much as possible. Growing my own food and raising
animals.  
  
What would you look for in a house or a property if you were to buy one
yourself?  
  
Unfortunately the area where I'm planning to buy a house has a low altitude
[100-200m] so higher CO2 is not achievable at the moment.  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : I would look for a stone house, good soil and sun exposure, and a
reliable water source, with good neighbors.  
  
**Q** : I don't think I will ever find a stone house here in Serbia :)  
  
Bricks and building blocks are the most common here. The old houses are made
out of mud.  
  
Do you think bricks or blocks are ok?  
What do you think about modular homes?  
  
Much love  
  
**RP** : I think mud is best, bricks next, then cement blocks.

I also woke up with an extremely dry mouth, grogginess and fatigue.  
It also seems that glycine clogs my nose even more.  
  
What do you think is behind this mechanism? Increasing glutamate? Methylation
issues?

Protective role of fructose in the metabolism of astroglial C6 cells exposed
to hydrogen peroxide.  
Spasojevi I, Baji A, Jovanovi K, Spasi M, Andjus P.  
Center for Laser Microscopy, Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade,  
Belgrade, Serbia. [ ivan@cms.bg.ac.rs ](mailto:ivan@cms.bg.ac.rs)  
Astroglial cells represent the main line of defence against oxidative damage  
related to neurodegeneration. Therefore, protection of astroglia from an
excess  
of reactive oxygen species could represent an important target of the
treatment  
of such conditions. The aim of our study was to compare the abilities of
glucose  
and fructose, the two monosaccharides used in diet and infusion, to protect C6  
cells from hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-mediated oxidative stress. It was  
observed using confocal microscopy with fluorescent labels and the MTT test
that  
**fructose prevents changes of oxidative status of the cells exposed to
H(2)O(2)  
and preserves their viability. Even more pronounced protective effects were  
observed for fructose 1,6-bis(phosphate). ** We propose that fructose and its  
intracellular forms prevent H(2)O(2) from participating in the Fenton reaction  
via iron sequestration. As fructose and fructose 1,6-bis(phosphate) are able
to  
pass the blood-brain barrier, they could provide antioxidative protection of  
nervous tissue in vivo. So, in contrast to the well-known negative effects of  
frequent consumption of fructose under physiological conditions, acute
infusion  
or ingestion of fructose or fructose 1,6-bis(phosphate) could be of benefit in  
the cytoprotective therapy of neurodegenerative disorders related to oxidative  
stress.

Fructose prevents hypoxic cell death in liver.  
Anundi I, King J, Owen DA, Schneider H, Lemasters JJ, Thurman RG.  
Perfusion of livers from fasted rats with nitrogen-saturated buffer caused  
hepatocellular damage within 30 min. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was released
at  
maximal rates of approximately 300 U . g-1 . h-1 under these conditions, and  
virtually all cells in periportal and pericentral regions of the liver lobule  
were stained with trypan blue. Infusion of glucose, xylitol, sorbitol, or  
mannitol (20 mM) did not appreciably change the time course or extent of
damage  
due to perfusion with nitrogen-saturated perfusate. However, fructose (20 mM)  
completely prevented damage assessed by LDH release, trypan blue uptake, and  
ultrastructural changes for at least 2 h of perfusion. Neither glucose,
xylitol,  
sorbitol, nor mannitol (20 mM) increased lactate formation above basal levels  
during hypoxia. On the other hand, fructose (0.4-20 mM) caused a  
concentration-dependent increase in lactate formation that reached maximal
rates  
of approximately 180 mumol . g-1 . h-1. The dose-dependent increase in  
glycolytic lactate production from fructose correlated well with cellular  
protection reflected by decreases in LDH release. ATP:ADP ratios were also  
increased from 0.4 to 1.8 in a dose-dependent manner by fructose. The results  
indicate that fructose protects the liver against hypoxic cell death by the  
glycolytic production of ATP in the absence of oxygen.  
  
J Biol Chem 1987 Jul 15;262(20):9529-34  
Gluconeogenesis from fructose predominates in periportal regions of the liver  
lobule.  
Anundi I, Kauffman FC, Thurman RG.  
Gluconeogenesis from fructose was studied in periportal and pericentral
regions  
of the liver lobule in perfused livers from fasted, phenobarbital-treated
rats.  
When fructose was infused in increasing concentrations from 0.25 to 4 mM,  
corresponding stepwise increases in glucose formation by the perfused liver
were  
observed as expected. Rates of glucose and lactate production from 4 mM
fructose  
were around 100 and 75 mumol/g/h, respectively. Rates of fructose uptake were  
around 190 mumol/g/h when 4 mM fructose was infused. 3-Mercaptopicolinate, an  
inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, decreased glucose formation
from  
fructose maximally by 20% suggesting that a fraction of the lactate formed
from  
fructose is used for glucose synthesis. A good correlation (r = 0.92) between  
extra oxygen consumed and glucose produced from fructose was observed. At low  
fructose concentrations (less than 0.5 mM), the extra oxygen uptake was much  
greater than could be accounted for by glucose synthesis possibly reflecting  
fructose 1-phosphate accumulation. Furthermore, fructose diminished ATP/ADP  
ratios from about 4.0 to 2.0 in periportal and pericentral regions of the
liver  
lobule indicating that the initial phosphorylation of fructose via
fructokinase  
occurs in both regions of the liver lobule. Basal rates of oxygen uptake  
measured with miniature oxygen electrodes were 2- to 3-fold higher in
periportal  
than in pericentral regions of the liver lobule during perfusions in the  
anterograde direction. Infusion of fructose increased oxygen uptake by 65  
mumol/g/h in periportal areas but had no effect in pericentral regions of the  
liver lobule indicating higher local rates of gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes  
located around the portal vein. When perfusion was in the retrograde
direction,  
however, glucose was synthesized nearly exclusively from fructose in upstream,  
pericentral regions. Thus, gluconeogenesis from fructose is confined to  
oxygen-rich upstream regions of the liver lobule in the perfused liver.

Total protection from hypoxic liver damage by fructose.  
Anundi I, King J, Owens DA, Schneider H, Lemasters JJ, Thurman RG.  
The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate the effect of carbohydrates
on  
hypoxic cell death in the perfused rat liver. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was  
released maximally at rates up to 300 U/g/h after 40 to 60 min of hypoxia in  
control livers from fasted rats or in livers perfused with glucose (20 mM).  
Fructose (20 mM) prevented the release of LDH completely. Rates of anaerobic  
glycolysis indexed by release of lactate were around 150 mumol/g/h in livers  
perfused with fructose but were undetectable in livers perfused with glucose.  
The results demonstrate that fructose prevents hypoxic damage in the liver  
presumably by providing glycolytic ATP in the absence of oxygen.

Differences in glycolytic capacity and hypoxia tolerance between hepatoma
cells  
and hepatocytes.

Klinische Forschergruppe Leberschadigung, Institut fur Physiologische Chemie
I,  
Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany.  
Viability, glycolytic capacity and energy metabolism under anaerobic
conditions  
were studied in the hepatoma cell lines HTC, FU5 and HepG2 and in rat and
human  
hepatocytes using glucose and fructose as glycolytic precursors. During 6 hr
of  
anaerobic incubation without additional substrate, viability decreased rapidly  
in FU5 and HTC cells, whereas viability of HepG2 cells was not significantly  
affected. **In all tumor cells, 10 mmol/L glucose prevented hypoxic cell
injury  
almost completely. Lactate formation from glucose was about five times higher  
than in hepatocytes under these circumstances. ** ATP content of the tumor
cells  
remained almost constant under anaerobic conditions in the presence of
glucose.  
**Ten millimoles per liter of fructose diminished glycolysis in the hepatoma
cells  
compared with glucose, ranging from 87% reduction in HTC cells to 43%
reduction  
in HepG2 cells. Accordingly, ATP content decreased rapidly in the FU5 and
slowly  
in the HepG2 cells. Viability was strongly diminished in the HTC and FU5 cells  
in the presence of fructose, ** whereas in the HepG2 cells no effect of
fructose on  
viability was detectable. In contrast to the hepatoma cells, rat and human  
**hepatocytes exhibited higher rates of anaerobic glycolysis in the presence
of  
fructose and thus were able to maintain their viability under these
conditions.  
These differences in glycolytic capacity, energy metabolism and hypoxia  
tolerance of hepatoma cells compared with hepatocytes may be used for the  
treatment of liver cancer by isolated liver perfusion and ex situ revision of  
the organ. **

Hypoxic liver cell death: critical Po2 and dependence of viability on
glycolysis.  
Anundi I, de Groot H.  
Institut fur Physiologische Chemie I, Universitat Dusseldorf, Federal Republic  
of Germany.  
Viability of isolated hepatocytes was not significantly dependent on oxygen at  
oxygen partial pressures (Po2) from 70 to 0.3 mmHg. The critical Po2 for  
induction of hypoxic cell death was close to 0.1 mmHg and was distinct from
the  
value at which mitochondrial function becomes impaired (2-5 mmHg). Hypoxic  
damage in hepatocytes from fasted rats occurred within 1 h but was delayed by  
the addition of fructose, which increased rates of lactate formation from
about  
1 to 12 nmol.10(6) cells-1.min-1. Hepatocytes from fed rats maintained
viability  
for almost 180 min of anaerobic incubation and then rapidly became damaged.  
Addition of fructose prevented hypoxic cell damage also in these hepatocytes.  
Rates of lactate formation were 11-15 nmol.10(6) cells-1.min-1 and were  
increased two- to threefold by fructose. The rapid initial degradation of  
glycogen and the release of glucose were delayed with fructose, which also
could  
have contributed to sustained glycolytic rates. Further, under conditions in  
which lactate production was high, e.g., in the fed state, there was also a  
significantly better preservation of cellular ATP levels.

I had been rereading some of your articles that dealt with insomnia. A few
months ago, as an experiment, I started taking 50mcg of T3 in many small
doses: for a time this reversed my long-standing insomnia. Right now I'm
taking one 25mcg cynomel pill, and one half of a cynoplus pill: I still have
insomnia with this dose. Is this because the cynomel is more effective? Might
increasing the dose of cynoplus help? I will probably try this anyway, but
wanted to get your thoughts. I have been trying to make sure to get the
necessary minerals: now I am drinking a gallon of milk a day, with orange
juice and coffee.  
  
RP:  
  
The cynoplus should be divided, too, with about a quarter of it at  
bedtime. If that ~8 mcg of T3 isn't enough, a little cynomel could be  
added. The T4 during the night reduces the rise in TSH that usually  
happens at night.

wanted to do everything really fast, and my memory was a little worse than
normal. My chest/breast area felt sore for no reason. I tried to keep my pulse
high with cynomel and took extra [ aspirin
](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) . But could
some of the speedy feeling be from the DHEA turning into estrogen.  
  
RP:  
  
It doesn't seem likely that such a small amount, with aspirin and cynomel,
could increase estrogen. Does [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) cause any of
the good effects of the DHEA?  
  
  
=================================  
  
Me:  
  
I've been having digestion problems for years, sometimes diarrhea a few times
a day, even after changing my diet and trying all sorts of things. Is there
anything to try, other than carrots, antibiotics, and anti-serotinin drugs? I
was wondering if some type of restricted diet high in gelatin or [ glycine
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/glycine-powder-usp-grade/) might
permanently help.  
  
RP:  
  
Have you tried elimination diets, for example nothing but milk and carrots for
a few days, or orange juice and eggs, to see if you can identify problem
foods?  
  
=================================  
  
Me:  
  
I saw a study that said cyproheptadine was more effective than benzodiazepine
drugs. Have you heard of anyone using it for insomnia? Or is there anything
good to use for insomnia, besides benadryl? I have been trying sugar, T3, T4,
beandryl, aspirin, and magnesium.  
  
RP:  
  
It works extremely well, but it's important to start with a much smaller dose
than is usually recommended, 1 mg, or even less, can be effective, and 4 mg
sometimes makes people goofy the next day. I know people who use it for
nocturnal episodes of asthma or epilepsy-like episodes.  
  
Me:  
  
Is there a preferred brand or source for cyproheptadine?  
  
RP:  
  
I had some that a doctor got in a US drugstore that was good, but I don't know
the brand; I got some from a drugstore in India that tasted odd and didn't
seem as effective.  
  
Me:  
  
I took cyproheptadine last night. It was from an online pharmacy, maybe from
India. It put me to sleep like benadryl. There was a period of morning
grogginess today, but it feels preferable to benadryl, which makes me
depressed. I also feel relaxed and less anxious. Is cyproheptadine OK to use
everyday, or will it eventually cause problems?  
  
RP:  
  
I think it's safe to keep using in small amounts.

Hi Ray,  
  
I was hoping you could clarify your view on something for me.  
  
I was listening to Colin Wilson talk about how he thinks we can will ourselves
into different states of consciousness. He was describing how he overcame a
series of panic attacks by essentially deciding to do so.  
  
If I'm panicking, I decide to drink milk and sugar, and take more thyroid, and
that seems to calm me down. I was interested in your phrase that went
something like 'consciousness is the interface between the outside world and
you'. Sorry if I don't have that quite right.  
  
So I was thinking that the purpose of consciousness is to decide to how to
modify our bodies by deciding what external substances to include and what to
exclude.  
  
It seems like you and Wilson both see that humans can decide to induce the
next evolutionary phase. But to some extent Wilson thinks about the mind and
body as separate.  
  
Do I have this all backwards?  
  
RP:  
  
He went straight from the hopelessness of being an English working class kid
into the world of literature, which was like a ghost world that was permitted
to float above the real world of exploitation and oppression. He found that he
could function and even excel in that world, which touched reality only in
ways that didn't challenge the system. He was absolutely right about the
importance of intentionality, of choosing to function rather than to not
function, but he excluded the kinds of choice that would have led him to
engage with issues of politics and science. The way we cause our body to
interact with the world includes everything.

One of thyroid's important effects is the regulation of minerals, but its
effects are limited by diet. How often have you been  
eating liver and shell fish, and how much milk do you average? Do you drink
coffee?  
  
=====================================  
  
Me:  
  
  
I was wondering if I'm thinking along the right lines: Blake was  
describing some of the ways our culture and mentalities have gotten  
stuck into rigid dimensions, so that we make a lot of mistakes based  
on our faulty perception of the real world. By analyzing biological  
research, you have worked out the biological mechanisms for our  
mistaken outlook.  
  
I was thinking about my own developing views, and how they've changed  
dramatically in the last few years. I think that my changing diet and  
other things were mostly responsible, allowing my substance to change  
to accommodate new insights and see what I didn't see before. Do other

feeling from using it everyday. So far, using lisuride sporadically, I  
haven't noticed much from it. Is there a good way to use lisuride? I  
thought that it would be good to use it more like LSD, in little doses  
every few weeks.

[Sent a poem I wrote about goats.]  
  
RP:  
  
Thanks. I don't remember the context, but it's a good image for reconsidering
the world. Have you read any of Peter Kropotkin? Here's a nice quotation from
him:  
  
_Then the peasants of the little Belgian village, Gheel, found something
better. They said: "Send us your insane. We will give them absolute freedom."
They adopted them into their families, they gave them places at their tables,
chance alongside them to cultivate their fields and a place among their young
people at their country balls. "Eat, drink, dance with us. Work, run about the
fields and be free." That was the system, that was all the science the Belgian
peasant had. And liberty worked a miracle. The insane became cured.[...] The
cures were attributed to a saint and virgin. But this virgin was liberty and
the saint was work in the fields and fraternal treatment._  
  
Me:  
  
I think Sarah on KMUD was asking you about an easy way for everyone to get
milk: either a cow in every yard, or a goat on every roof, in the city. Thanks
for that Kroptkin quote, it's perfect. It reminds me of an article I saw about
how schizophrenics do better in poorer nations, like India, where they aren't
isolated in hospitals, remaining instead in family and community life. I'll
have to read Kroptkin now. I'm just starting to read more Blake, and am
finding your Blake essay to be a wonderful introduction to him. In his writing
I keep finding ideas I've already encountered in your work. When I studied
literature in college, the professors always denied that fiction writers were
trying to communicate something, treating the books instead as "texts," or
cultural relics without intrinsic meaning--of course they often seemed to
chose books where that really was the case.  
  
RP:  
  
I haven't been around the literature people for a long time, but I knew that
sort of thing was happening. You can read about how that bizarre attitude
toward culture was created by the Congress for Cultural Freedom (i.e., the
CIA) in Frances Saunders' book and many good articles by Richard Cummings. I
first heard about it in an article by Siqueiros, who called it the "ghost art"
created by the Rockefellers, but then the CIA financing (using money from the
Marshall Plan for reconstructing Europe) was revealed.  
  
Tony Papert:  
"For readers of Frances Stonor Saunders’ Who Paid the Piper, a history of the
Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), or of the 1967 expose ́s by Ramparts and
then by Tom Braden, the answer is unavoidable: Beginning in the early 1950s,
an avalanche of U.S. taxpayers’ money “covertly” subsidized this particular
school, to the exclusion of all else. EIR and others have described the long
and lavish arts festivals put on in Paris and other war-ruined European
cities, but it is equally true,- even if it is illegal,—that the “CIA”
massively funded its chosen artistic styles in the United States as well.
Think of the Museum of Modern Art continually on world tour, courtesy of the
CCF, with the works of its chosen abstract expressionist painters; the Boston
Symphony Orchestra likewise, with its chosen composers, and so on."

Me:  
  
Dr Peat,  
  
Over the years, have you seen a change in the the types of health  
problems people have? I get the sense from your books and older  
articles that [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) was able to cure a lot of people's  
problems. But I haven't heard any recent stories about big  
improvements from pregnenolone. Do people today have very different  
metabolisms than people did just a few decades ago? A chart I saw  
showed an average increase of 10 grams of PUFA per day just since  
1999\. People my age (20s) and younger also don't eat much protein,  
maybe for cultural reasons, or low appetites.  
  
RP:  
  
Besides the average change in diet, people now have a more complete set of
expectations about their health, and the substances used in supplements have
changed. Many people expect pregnenolone to act like a hormone, which it
doesn't; I've only seen a couple of people younger than their late 40s who
felt anything at all from it. And a single dose is often all it takes, and
continued, or bigger, doses don't do anything more.

It's important to get the nutrients in balance--both zinc and vitamin A are

India, or from veterinary stores in the US.  
  
===================================  
  
Me:  
  
I was curious about the colors in the paintings on your website,  
especially the blue that sick women can have. It seems to me like the  
hormonal state of the women you're painting seeps into their  
surroundings. I've started to notice that the way I feel can  
dramatically change the way I perceive the world around me--is that  
something you're intending in your paintings?  
  
RP:  
Yes, tangentially thinking about the effects of colors.  
  
Me:  
  
I think you have the best writing style I've come across. What sort of  
writers or poets do you like, aside from Blake? Any of the beat  
writers?  
  
RP:  
  
Thanks. Yes, I liked the style of several of the beat writers, Kerouac's
fluidity, and Ginsberg's more intense confrontation of the culture. Aldous
Huxley was another person strongly influenced by Blake.  
  
Me:  
  
I like Kerouac, Ginsberg and Huxley a lot too. It's interesting you  
mention Kerouac's fluidity: I read he wrote the first few pages of On  
the Road in French, and I always wondered how his French influenced  
his English style. Sometimes your style reminds me of Ivan Illich's,  
because he didn't seem to write with cliches either. Do you read in a  
lot of languages?  
  
RP:  
  
I felt that my school English classes had given the language a sense of
artificiality for me. When I first saw verses by Blake I realized that was how
English should work; later, I saw that the Beats were reclaiming English. When
I was in Mexico, an American student commented that when I spoke English I
sounded depressed, but that I sounded happy when I was speaking Spanish. I
think that was because I learned it just by listening and talking to people in
Mexico City, and so it contained my feelings about those experiences. My
projects were very similar to Illich's, freeing ourselves from the culture's
stereotypes. (I was often in Mexico between 1955 and 1965, overlapping
Illich's time there. I had Blake College there in the early '60s.) The only
other languages I read often are French and Italian; oddly, reading French
feels more efficient than reading English, probably because I've never spoken
it.  
  
Me:  
  
I don't know if he read Blake, but for me Henry Miller can write  
English in the right way too. Blake College sounds like the type of  
school I'd like to have gone to. I read a little about it in the book  
Ungodly about Madelyn Murray O'Hair. Is there anywhere else to read  
about it? Or do you happen to know if there are any similar schools  
today?  
  
RP:  
  
There were some newspaper and magazine articles about it in the 'sixties, but
not much.  
In 1965 I knew someone with a friend in the Mexico City branch of the Ford
Foundation, and we submitted a proposal to them for funding. Right after the
Madalyn events, I learned that they were funding an experimental, student
centered college at Fordham University, and I think other places; the
foundation and the government worked closely together, and I think they saw
the importance of co-opting the movement, to keep it from getting too
independent, i.e., anti-imperialist. I think our idea of giving a diploma
whenever the person scored very high on the Graduate Record Exam, which would
let them get into good graduate study programs, was the main point they wanted
to suppress, since it eliminated all of the judgmental points of control in
the process.

Me:  
  
If someone is avoiding PUFAs carefully for a few years, is there any  
way to tell if they've gotten rid of most of their stored PUFA? I was  
thinking maybe if they let themselves get hungry, they would feel  
different than someone who is releasing PUFA.  
  
RP:  
  
The resting metabolic rate will be higher, and there will be less tendency to
have inflammation after an injury. Although they have to eat more calories, I
think they don't experience the intense stress from hunger.  
  
Me:  
  
In one of your newsletters you wrote about the experimenter who tried  
to induce an EFA deficiency in himself by eating a fat free diet, and  
I thought it only took him six months to see benefits, rather than  
three or four years. Did eating a fat free diet allow him to reduce  
his PUFA stores more quickly?  
  
RP:  
  
He saw benefits after only about 3 months, but we don't know what would have
happened as his tissue stores were depleted. The animal evidence implies that
there would be tremendous resistance to stress and inflammation.

systemic allergic responses to some water soluble vitamins on their skin, but
you're the first I've heard reacting that way to A.

I was surprised to hear that depression can be an allergic symptom.  
I'm used to getting an itchy feeling on my skin from some supplements  
and foods, but this is the first supplement I've gotten this sort of  
reaction from. I still have dandruff and pimples, so I don't think I'm  
getting too much vitamin A, especially since I only used one drop of  
the vitamin. Can too much vitamin A lead to acne and dandruff too?  
  
RP:  
  
Yes, but I've never heard of it with less than 50,000 units a day. An extreme
vitamin E deficiency predisposed to A toxicity.  
  
Me:  
  
Do you think it might be worth trying a vitamin E supplement?

If you have eaten much unsaturated fat in recent years, your requirement for
vitamin E is probably high.

Thyroid cancer and thyroiditis in Salta, Argentina: a 40-yr study in relation
to iodine prophylaxis.

Services of Pathology, Dr A Oñativia Endocrinology and Metabolism Hospital,  
Salta, Argentina. [ rubenharach@ciudad.com.ar
](mailto:rubenharach@ciudad.com.ar)  
The natural history of thyroid cancer and thyroiditis in relation to iodine  
prophylaxis in the region of Salta, Argentina, where goiter is common was  
investigated over a time span of 40 yr. For analysis of thyroid cancer, the  
specimens were divided into two periods. The first 15 yr (59 cases), including
5  
yr before prophylaxis, was compared with the second 25 yr (182 cases), a
period  
well after salt iodination. Papillary carcinomas formed the largest group of  
tumors in both periods, with a significant increase in their proportion in the  
second period (44 vs 60%, chi(2): p < 0.05), while the percentage of
follicular  
and undifferentiated carcinomas decreased and medullary carcinoma remained
about  
the same. The ratio of papillary to follicular carcinoma rose from 1.7:1 in
the  
first period to 3.1:1 in the second. Four thyroid lymphomas of non-Hodgkin's  
B-cell type occurred in the second period in females over age 50. A severe  
lymphoid thyroiditis was present in the two cases with assessable background  
thyroid tissue. The frequency of moderate to severe lymphoid infiltrate in  
females rose from 2 of 12 (16.6%) in the preprophylaxis period to 34 of 114  
(28.0%) in the last 25 yr after prophylaxis. After salt prophylaxis,
thyroiditis  
was more frequent in patients with papillary carcinoma (36.2%) than in those
with  
nonpapillary tumors (14.7%) (chi(2), p < 0.02). **These observations indicate
that  
a high dietary intake of iodine may be associated with a high frequency of  
papillary carcinoma and thyroiditis ** , and that thyroiditis is more commonly  
associated with papillary carcinoma than with other thyroid tumors. The  
occurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas only in the postprophylaxis period may
be  
linked to an increase in thyroiditis.

Service d'Endocrinologie, Diabétologie et Maladies Métaboliques, Centre  
Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, 69495 Pierre-Bénite Cedex, France.  
Epidemiological studies, as well as animal models, indicate that iodine might
be  
an immunogenic agent for the thyroid gland, at least in subjects predisposed
to  
thyroid autoimmunity. This review presents data, either epidemiological or  
experimental, obtained in different conditions: constant and stable iodine  
status, either deficient, sufficient or excessive; long-term iodine
prophylaxis;  
temporary supplementation with iodide (6-12 months) or iodised oil. Moreover,
we  
also discuss data obtained in the general population, among subjects with  
euthyroid goiter, or autoimmune goiter, or even in women prone to post-partum  
thyroid diseases. It is concluded that the significant increase in the
prevalence  
of autoimmune thyroid diseases in populations living in iodine sufficient
areas  
should not prevent the implementation of the iodine prophylaxis.

Enhanced iodination of thyroglobulin facilitates processing and presentation
of a  
cryptic pathogenic peptide.  
Dai YD, Rao VP, Carayanniotis G.  
Division of Endocrinology, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of  
Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.  
Increased iodine intake has been associated with the development of
experimental  
autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), but the biological basis for this association  
remains poorly understood. One hypothesis has been that enhanced incorporation
of  
iodine in thyroglobulin (Tg) promotes the generation of pathogenic T cell  
determinants. In this study we sought to test this by using the pathogenic  
nondominant A(s)-binding Tg peptides p2495 and p2694 as model Ags. SJL mice  
challenged with highly iodinated Tg (I-Tg) developed EAT of higher severity
than  
Tg-primed controls, and lymph node cells (LNC) from I-Tg-primed hosts showed a  
higher proliferation in response to I-Tg in vitro than Tg-primed LNC reacting
to  
Tg. Interestingly, I-Tg-primed LNC proliferated strongly in vitro against
p2495,  
but not p2694, indicating efficient and selective priming with p2495 following  
processing of I-Tg in vivo. Tg-primed LNC did not respond to either peptide.  
Similarly, the p2495-specific, IL-2-secreting T cell hybridoma clone 5E8 was  
activated when I-Tg-pulsed, but not Tg-pulsed, splenocytes were used as APC,  
whereas the p2694-specific T cell hybridoma clone 6E10 remained unresponsive
to  
splenic APC pulsed with Tg or I-Tg. The selective in vitro generation of p2495  
was observed in macrophages or dendritic cells, but not in B cells, suggesting  
differential processing of I-Tg among various APC. These data demonstrate that  
enhanced iodination of Tg facilitates the selective processing and
presentation  
of a cryptic pathogenic peptide in vivo or in vitro and suggest a mechanism
that  
can at least in part account for the association of high iodine intake and the

Iodine-Induced hypothyroidism.

Department of Medicine, University of Patras Medical School, Greece.  
Iodine is an essential element for thyroid hormone synthesis. The thyroid
gland  
has the capacity and holds the machinery to handle the iodine efficiently when  
the availability of iodine becomes scarce, as well as when iodine is available
in  
excessive quantities. The latter situation is handled by the thyroid by
acutely  
inhibiting the organification of iodine, the so-called acute Wolff-Chaikoff  
effect, by a mechanism not well understood 52 years after the original  
description. It is proposed that iodopeptide(s) are formed that temporarily  
inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO) mRNA and protein synthesis and, therefore,  
thyroglobulin iodinations. The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is an effective means of  
rejecting the large quantities of iodide and therefore preventing the thyroid  
from synthesizing large quantities of thyroid hormones. The acute Wolff-
Chaikoff  
effect lasts for few a days and then, through the so-called "escape"
phenomenon,  
the organification of intrathyroidal iodide resumes and the normal synthesis
of  
thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) returns. This is achieved by
decreasing  
the intrathyroidal inorganic iodine concentration by down regulation of the  
sodium iodine symporter (NIS) and therefore permits the TPO-H202 system to
resume  
normal activity. However, in a few apparently normal individuals, in newborns
and  
fetuses, in some patients with chronic systemic diseases, euthyroid patients
with  
autoimmune thyroiditis, and Graves' disease patients previously treated with  
radioimmunoassay (RAI), surgery or antithyroid drugs, the escape from the  
inhibitory effect of large doses of iodides is not achieved and clinical or  
subclinical hypothyroidism ensues. Iodide-induced hypothyroidism has also been  
observed in patients with a history of postpartum thyroiditis, in euthyroid  
patients after a previous episode of subacute thyroiditis, and in patients  
treated with recombinant interferon-alpha who developed transient thyroid  
dysfunction during interferon-a treatment. The hypothyroidism is transient and  
thyroid function returns to normal in 2 to 3 weeks after iodide withdrawal,
but  
transient T4 replacement therapy may be required in some patients. The
patients  
who develop transient iodine-induced hypothyroidism must be followed long term  
thereafter because many will develop permanent primary hypothyroidism.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the salt iodization program, which was  
initiated in 1989 on frequencies of thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma in
Fars  
province of Iran, which was previously an iodine deficient area. METHODS: Four  
hundred and eighty-two thyroidectomy specimens belonging to the pre-iodization  
period from 1983 to 1988, and 466 post iodization specimens from 1998 to 2003  
were re-examined for presence of lymphocytic infiltration and types of thyroid  
tumors. This study was carried out in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences,  
Iran. RESULTS: The frequency of lymphocytic infiltration in non-neoplastic  
specimens increased from 30-60.5% after salt iodization (p<0.001). Background
of  
lymphocytic infiltration in neoplastic specimens also increased from 18.5-61%  
after iodine prophylaxis (p<0.001). The frequency of papillary carcinoma in  
neoplastic specimens increased from 15-43% (p=0.01) and that of follicular  
adenoma decreased from 69-32.5% (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Salt iodization is  
associated with an increased occurrence of histologic thyroiditis and
papillary  
carcinoma.

Iodine excess may lead to thyroid diseases. Our previous 5-year prospective  
survey showed that the prevalence and incidence of hypothyroidism or
autoimmune  
thyroiditis increased with iodine intake. The aim of the present study was to  
investigate the optimal range of iodine intake by comparing the prevalence of  
thyroid diseases in three areas with slightly different levels of iodine
intake.  
In 2005, 778 unselected women subjects from three areas with different iodine  
intake levels were enrolled. Levels of serum thyroid hormones, thyroid  
autoantibodies, and urinary iodine were measured, and thyroid B ultrasounds
were  
performed. Among the subjects with mildly deficient iodine intake, those with  
adequate intake, and those with more than adequate intake, the prevalence of  
clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism was 0, 1.13, and 2.84%, respectively
(P =  
0.014); that of thyroid goiter was 24.88, 5.65, and 11.37%, respectively (P <  
0.001); that of serum thyrotropin values was1.01, 1.25, and 1.39 mIU/l,  
respectively; and that of serum thyrotropin/thyroglobulin ratio was 7.98,
6.84,  
and 5.11, respectively (P < 0.001). In conclusion, median urinary iodine
100~200  
mug/l may reflect the safe range of iodine intake levels. Serum  
thyrotropin/thyroglobulin ratio might be a better index of evaluating iodine  
status.

Induction of goitrous hypothyroidism by dietary iodide in SJL mice.  
Li HS, Carayanniotis G.  
Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's,  
Newfoundland, Canada.  
Prolonged intake of large amounts of iodide has been reported to increase the  
incidence of goiter and/or hypothyroidism in humans as well as animals prone
to  
spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis. In the current study, we investigated the  
role of dietary iodide on the development of hypothyroidism, as well as  
thyroiditis, in strains of mice that do not develop spontaneous autoimmune  
thyroiditis. Intake of 0.05% NaI via drinking water for 10 wk induced  
hypothyroidism in SJL/J mice as indicated by elevated TSH and depressed total  
T(4) values in serum and formation of colloidal goiter with an inactive
flattened  
thyroid epithelium. Hypothyroidism did not appear to have an autoimmune basis  
because only focal mononuclear cell infiltrates were found intrathyroidally,
and  
antithyroglobulin antibodies or increased organification of iodide were not  
detected. These phenomena were not observed in similarly treated CBA/J mice,  
suggesting polymorphisms in genes controlling events downstream of iodide
uptake  
by thyrocytes. Interestingly, RT-PCR analysis indicated that unlike CBA/J,
SJL/J  
mice could not down-regulate Na/I symporter gene expression during the NaI  
treatment. No significant temporal or strain differences were observed
regarding  
the expression of thyroglobulin, pendrin, thyroid peroxidase, and DUOX1 and
DUOX2  
genes after NaI intake. Our results point to the generation of a mouse model
for  
the study of iodine-induced hypothyroidism, which does not seem to have an  
autoimmune basis.

OBJECTIVE: To determine urinary iodine excretion (UIE) and antiperoxidase
enzyme  
antibody (anti-TPO Ab) in primary school-age children living in Arak, Iran, in  
2005, after 10 yr of iodized salt distribution in an effort to ameliorate
iodine  
deficiency. METHODS: Through an observational, case-control study and by means
of  
satisfied sampling, 6520 primary school children were examined for goiter, and  
then 193 goiterous children (case) and 151 healthy (control) children were  
assessed as representative samples for thyroid function tests, antiperoxidase  
antibody, and urinary iodine excretion. Normal values of anti-TPO Ab were <40  
U/ml and high values >75 U/ml. Normal values of urinary iodine concentration
were  
> or =10.0 microg/dl, and severe iodine deficiency were <2 microg/dl. The data  
were analyzed and compared by the Chi- Square tests and Mann-Whitney U in SPSS  
software; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS:  
Total mean prevalence of goiter was 5.2%, ranging from 3.6 to 6.4% in
different  
schools. The prevalence of goiter increased with age; it was 3% in children
aged  
6-7 yr and 6.3% in children aged 11 yr (p<0.001). Mean iodine urinary  
concentration was 16.36 microg/dl (+/-1.58). No difference was seen between
the  
mean urinary iodine in girls (17.30+/-3.80 micorg/dl) and boys (15.72+/-2.72  
microg/dl). No difference was seen between the mean urinary iodine in
goiterous  
and healthy school children (17.4+/-3.7 microg/dl vs 15.3+/-3.18 microg/dl,  
p=0.78). About 49.5% of school children had UIE<10 microg/dl and 28% had UIE<5  
microg/dl. High levels of anti-TPO Ab were found in 21 school children (18  
goiterous vs 3 healthy children, p=0.01) resulting in a total prevalence of
6.1%.  
In females, the prevalence was 1.3 times higher than in males (male:female
ratio  
3/4). Thirteen out of 21 (62%) children with positive antibodies had
significant  
goiter (grade 2), and 5 (24%) had small goiter (grade 1), whereas only 3
children  
(14%) had normal thyroid size (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: If urinary iodine  
concentration is considered an index of total body iodine content, this study  
demonstrated that prolonged iodized salt intake has minimized the occurrence
of  
iodine deficiency goiter and now autoimmune thyroid enlargement is one cause
for  
continuous goiter in primary school children, although there are unknown  
etiologies that need to be considered in further studies.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) in
three  
different iodine intake areas, to explore the relationship between iodine
intake  
and PPT. METHODS: Panshan, Zhangwu and Huanghua are three different iodine
intake  
areas. The median urinary iodine concentration were 103 micro g/L, 374 micro
g/L  
and 614 micro g/L, respectively. One hundred and nineteen lactational women
were  
investigated during the first year postpartum. Thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH),  
free thyroxine (FT(4)), free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), thyroid peroxidase  
antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb) were determined with
immulite  
method, and UI was determined by As-Ce(4+) catalytic spectrophotometry method.  
RESULTS: The prevalence of PPT is 11.8%, 10.1% of subclinical PPT, whereas
1.7%  
of clinical PPT. There was statistically significant difference in the
frequency  
of PPT in three areas (Panshan 5.6%, Zhangwu 23.1% and Huanghua 6.8%, P <
0.05),  
but no difference in the frequency of thyroid autoimmune antibody (TAA). 50%
of  
positive TAA women developed into PPT. CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence of  
subclinical PPT was found in the area with moderate iodine deficiency after  
iodine supplementation, suggesting a possible role of iodine supplementation
in  
PPT.

High iodine intake is a risk factor of post-partum thyroiditis: result of a  
survey from Shenyang, China.

University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, P.R. China.  
The aim of the present study is to obtain the epidemiological data on post-
partum  
thyroiditis (PPT) firstly in Chinese women, and to tryto evaluate whether  
excessive intake of iodine in post-partum women imposes any danger of
occurring  
PPT. Sixty hundred and ten pregnant women were involved in the cohort just
before  
delivery. Four hundred and eighty-eight (80%) of them accepted taking part in  
follow-ups more than 6 months post-partum. A blood sample was taken from  
participants before delivery and every 3 months post-partum for testing of
serum  
TSH, thyroid autoantibodies. Free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4) and TSH receptor  
antibody (TRAb) were detected if TSH was abnormal. The iodine nutrition was  
evaluated according to the mean level of the fasting urinary iodine excretions
at  
different times during the studying period, and participants were subgrouped
into  
3 categories with low, adequate and high iodine intake. For those participants  
who had thyroid dysfunction within 6 months post-partum, the follow-up
persisted  
for 1 yr. Of 488 pregnant women, PPT developed in 11.9% (58/488). Given overt
and  
subclinical PPT, the prevalence was 7.17% (no.=35) and 4.71% (no.=23),  
respectively. There was a strong association between the presence of thyroid  
peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) at delivery and the risk of developing PPT
[RR=6.76,  
95% (CI) 4.42-10.34]. Overt cases had much higher titers of TPOAb than  
subclinical patients (all p<0.05). The median urinary iodine (MUI) of patients  
with PPT was significantly higher than that of healthy women (231.93 vs 199.88  
microg/l p=0.00153). Both the prevalence of PPT and positive TPOAb rise with
the  
increment of iodine intakes. Pregnant women with high iodine intake had more
risk  
of developing PPT when compared with those with low iodine intake (RR=2.92,
95%CI  
1.31-6.50). We concluded that positive TPOAb was of value for predicting the  
occurrence and severity of PPT, and a high iodine intake was a risk factor  
triggering PPT.

The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and its relation to thyroid
autoantibodies  
(TAA) and urinary iodide concentration (UI) was studied in apparently healthy  
adults in Sapporo (n = 4110) (Sapporo group), and in five coastal areas of  
Hokkaido (n = 1061) (coastal group) which produce iodine-rich seaweed (kelp).  
The frequency of above normal UI (high UI) in the morning urinary samples of  
coastal group was 10.8%, significantly higher than that of Sapporo group
(6.4%)  
(p < 0.001). Frequency of positive TAA in both groups were similar. In Sapporo  
group TAA was positive in 6.4% of males and 13.8% of females with an age-
related  
increase. The overall prevalence of hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.15 mU/L) in
coastal  
group (0.6%) was similar to that in Sapporo group (1.1%), while that of  
hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.0 mU/L) in coastal group (3.8%) was significantly
higher  
than that in Sapporo group (1.3%) (P < 0.001). The frequency of high UI  
correlated significantly with that of hypothyroidism with negative TAA (r =  
0.829, P < 0.05), but not with positive TAA, or with that of hyperthyroidism.  
Hypothyroidism was more prevalent in TAA negative subjects with high UI than  
with normal UI. Moreover, serum TSH and thyroglobulin levels were higher and  
free T4 level was lower in former than in latter group. These results indicate  
that 1) the prevalence of TAA negative hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient
areas  
may be associated with the amount of iodine ingested, 2) this hypothyroidism
is  
more prevalent and marked in subjects consuming further excess amounts of  
iodine, and 3) excessive intake of iodine should be considered an etiology of  
hypothyroidism in addition to chronic thyroiditis in these areas.

Department of Medicine, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.  
The pathophysiology of endemic goitre caused by excessive iodine intake is not  
well defined. By interacting with the immune system, iodine excess may trigger  
the development of autoimmune thyroid disease such as lymphocytic Hashimoto's  
thyroiditis (LT). In an attempt to examine this further, we compared the  
presence of thyroid autoantibodies in 29 goitrous children, from an iodine  
excess area, and in 26 healthy children, from an iodine sufficient area, of  
north central China. Serum was tested for antimicrosomal (MAb),  
anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb), second colloid antigen antibodies (CA2-Ab) and TSH  
binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII). Affinity chromatographically
purified  
IgG was tested for thyroid growth-stimulating activity (TGI) by two different  
methods: a sensitive cytochemical bioassay (CBA) using guinea-pig thyroid  
explants and a mitotic arrest assay (MAA) employing a continuous rat thyroid  
cell line (FRTL-5). We found no increased prevalence of LT in patients with  
endemic iodine goitre. The levels of MAb, TgAb and CA2-Ab did not differ  
significantly between the two groups of children. Further, TBII were not
present  
in either group. Thyroid growth-stimulating immunoglobulins (TGI) were the
major  
autoantibodies found in children with goitres caused by iodine excess. In the  
CBA, 12 of 20 (60%) goitrous children and 0 of 12 (0% P less than 0.05)
healthy  
children were positive for TGI. Similar results were found in the MAA, and a  
good correlation between results of the CBA and MAA was found (P = 0.003).  
Maximal TGI activity in dose-response CBA showed a good relation with clinical  
goitre size (r = 0.63; P less than 0.05) indicating a possible  
pathophysiological role for these antibodies. We conclude that endemic iodine  
goitre is not associated with Hashimoto's lymphocytic thyroiditis.
Nevertheless,  
autoimmune growth factors such as TGI may play a primary role in the  
pathogenesis of thyroid growth in this condition.

High thyroid volume in children with excess dietary iodine intakes.

Switzerland. [ michael.zimmermann@ilw.agrl.ethz.ch

BACKGROUND: There are few data on the adverse effects of chronic exposure to  
high iodine intakes, particularly in children. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the  
study was to ascertain whether high dietary intakes of iodine in children
result  
in high thyroid volume (Tvol), a high risk of goiter, or both. DESIGN: In an  
international sample of 6-12-y-old children (n = 3319) from 5 continents with  
iodine intakes ranging from adequate to excessive, Tvol was measured by  
ultrasound, and the urinary iodine (UI) concentration was measured.
Regressions  
were done on Tvol and goiter including age, body surface area, sex, and UI  
concentration as covariates. RESULTS: The median UI concentration ranged from  
115 microg/L in central Switzerland to 728 microg/L in coastal Hokkaido,
Japan.  
In the entire sample, 31% of children had UI concentrations >300 microg/L, and  
11% had UI concentrations >500 microg/L; in coastal Hokkaido, 59% had UI  
concentrations >500 microg/L, and 39% had UI concentrations >1000 microg/L. In  
coastal Hokkaido, the mean age- and body surface area-adjusted Tvol was  
approximately 2-fold the mean Tvol from the other sites combined (P < 0.0001),  
and there was a positive correlation between log(UI concentration) and
log(Tvol)  
(r = 0.24, P < 0.0001). In the combined sample, after adjustment for age, sex,  
and body surface area, log(Tvol) began to rise at a log(UI concentration)
>2.7,  
which, when transformed back to the linear scale, corresponded to a UI  
concentration of approximately 500 microg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic iodine
intakes  
approximately twice those recommended-indicated by UI concentrations in the  
range of 300-500 microg/L-do not increase Tvol in children. However, UI  
concentrations >/=500 microg/L are associated with increasing Tvol, which  
reflects the adverse effects of chronic iodine excess.

A case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis with thyroid immunological abnormality  
manifested after habitual ingestion of seaweed.  
Okamura K, Inoue K, Omae T.  
An interesting case of iodide induced goitre with immunological abnormalities
is  
described. The patient who was sensitive to synthetic penicillin had
previously  
been treated for exudative pleuritis, congestive heart failure and acute renal  
failure. Following recovery, he began to ingest large amounts of seaweed after  
which he developed goitrous hypothyroidism. It was of interest that the serum  
level of gamma-globulin increased, and subsequently the antithyroid microsomal  
antibody became strongly positive, suggesting that thyroidal autoimmune  
processes had been precipitated. Biopsy of the thyroid gland revealed chronic  
thyroiditis, with evidence suggesting extreme stimulation by TSH. Hight  
thyroidal uptake of 131I, positive perchlorate discharge test and biochemical  
analysis of the thyroidal soluble protein showed severe impairment of hormone  
synthesis following continuous accumulation of excess iodide. While there is  
evidence suggesting that increased iodide may be an important factor in the  
initiation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, this may result from the marked
increased  
sensitivity of Hashimoto's gland to the effects of iodine. Thus an occult
lesion  
could be unmasked in this manner. The mechanism by which iodide mediates this  
effect is not clear.

[ jl-wemeau@chru-lille.fr ](mailto:jl-wemeau@chru-lille.fr)  
WOLFF-CHAIKOFF'S EFFECT: The thyroid gland has a capacity to reduce thyroid  
hormone production in the presence of excess iodine by reducing the  
organification of the iodine. This Wolff-Chaikoff effect is observed after 48  
hours and protects the organism from excessive synthesis of the thyroid  
hormones. This effect is usually temporary and within a few days thyroid
hormone  
synthesis returns to normal through the so-called 'escape' phenomenon. However  
in a few normal individuals and in some susceptible patients, the escape does  
not occur. THE CONTEXT OF OCCURRENCE: Iodine-induced hypothyroidism is
observed  
in fetuses, newborn, adults and in the elderly. It is observed in individuals  
without underlying overt thyroid disorder, and specially in patients with  
autoimmune thyroiditis or those previously treated for thyroid diseases
(Graves'  
disease, subacute or pospartum thyroiditis, iatrogenic thyroid
dysfunction...).  
FROM A CLINICAL AND PROGRESSIVE POINT OF VIEW: The hormone deficiency is of  
obvious clinical expression, or sometimes discreet and revealed by hormone  
exploration. It is usually temporary, regressing with a few days or weeks
after  
iodine withdrawal. Nevertheless, some patients require transient hormone  
replacement therapy.

[Experimental goiter formation]  
[Article in French]  
Denef JF.  
Nodules formation in goiter is still poorly understood due to the lack of an  
adequate animal model. The key role of iodine in the increased heterogeneity
of  
iodine metabolism and in cold follicle formation has been demonstrated.  
Administration of iodide excess to goitrous mice induces follicle cell
necrosis  
and thyroiditis. Necrosis and inflammation can be prevented by reducing the  
iodine dose, giving T3 or T4, or combining iodide with antithyroid drugs or  
vitamin E. This suggest that iodide toxicity is related to excessive
production  
of free radicals. During inflammation, Ia positive interstitial cells were  
increased in number whereas no Ia expression was seen in follicular cells.

The pathophysiology of endemic goitre caused by excessive iodine intake is not  
well defined. By interacting with the immune system, iodine excess may trigger  
the development of autoimmune thyroid disease such as lymphocytic Hashimoto's  
thyroiditis (LT). In an attempt to examine this further, we compared the  
presence of thyroid autoantibodies in 29 goitrous children, from an iodine  
excess area, and in 26 healthy children, from an iodine sufficient area, of  
north central China. Serum was tested for antimicrosomal (MAb),  
anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb), second colloid antigen antibodies (CA2-Ab) and TSH  
binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII). Affinity chromatographically
purified  
IgG was tested for thyroid growth-stimulating activity (TGI) by two different  
methods: a sensitive cytochemical bioassay (CBA) using guinea-pig thyroid  
explants and a mitotic arrest assay (MAA) employing a continuous rat thyroid  
cell line (FRTL-5). We found no increased prevalence of LT in patients with  
endemic iodine goitre. The levels of MAb, TgAb and CA2-Ab did not differ  
significantly between the two groups of children. Further, TBII were not
present  
in either group. Thyroid growth-stimulating immunoglobulins (TGI) were the
major  
autoantibodies found in children with goitres caused by iodine excess. In the  
CBA, 12 of 20 (60%) goitrous children and 0 of 12 (0% P less than 0.05)
healthy  
children were positive for TGI. Similar results were found in the MAA, and a  
good correlation between results of the CBA and MAA was found (P = 0.003).  
Maximal TGI activity in dose-response CBA showed a good relation with clinical  
goitre size (r = 0.63; P less than 0.05) indicating a possible
pathophysiological role  
for these antibodies. We conclude that endemic iodine goitre is not associated
with  
Hashimoto's lymphocytic thyroiditis. Nevertheless, autoimmune growth factors
such as  
TGI may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of thyroid growth in this
condition.

A review of iodine toxicity reports.  
Pennington JA.  
Division of Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC 20204.  
This article summarizes case reports, population studies, and experimental  
studies from the literature concerning adverse effects of exposure to iodine  
from the mid-1880s to 1988. Exposure to excessive iodine through foods,
dietary  
supplements, topical medications, and/or iodinated contrast media has resulted  
in thyroiditis, goiter, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, sensitivity
reactions,  
or acute responses for some individuals. Reports of maternal iodine exposure  
during pregnancy or lactation affecting newborn or nursing infants are cited.  
Susceptibility to excess iodine is discussed as well as the relationship
between  
dose and response. It is concluded that some individuals can tolerate very
high  
levels of iodine with no apparent side effects and that iodine intakes less
than  
or equal to 1.000 mg/day are probably safe for the majority of the population,  
but may cause adverse effects in some individuals. Determination of maximum  
tolerable levels of iodine intake will require human experimental studies at  
levels between 0.150 and 1.000 mg/day for normal subjects, subjects with  
autonomous thyroid tissue, and iodine-sensitive subjects.

Iodide induced lymphocytic thyroiditis in the BB/W rat: evidence of direct
toxic  
effects of iodide on thyroid subcellular structure.  
Li M, Boyages SC.  
Department of Clinical Endocrinology, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.  
A high dietary iodine intake accelerates the development of lymphocytic  
thyroiditis (LT) in the BB/W rat. Our previous studies have defined the
temporal  
sequence of the immunological events triggered by excess iodide intake in
these  
animals. It was still not clear, however, whether these observed immunological  
changes were a direct effect on immune effector cells, or whether they  
represented a secondary response to a toxic effect of iodine on thyroid
tissue.  
In the present study, the effect of excessive iodine intake on the subcellular  
structure of the BB/W rat thyroid gland, particularly, whether iodide had a  
toxic effect independent of its immune response has been examined. BB/W rats  
were exposed, prenatally through maternal drinking water, to excessive iodide
at  
two doses (Moderate 3 x 10(-6) M iodide/l; High 3 x 10(-3) M iodide/l); a
third  
group of BB/W rats was given tap water; till 12 weeks postnatal age. Two
groups  
of Wistar rats received high dose iodide water or tap water for the same
period  
of time and served as controls. Thyroid gland ultrastructure was determined by  
electron microscopic (EM) examination. Thyroid 125I uptake and perchlorate  
discharge tests were also performed in separate experiments. We found that  
thyroid glands of non-iodine supplemented Wistar rats were morphlogically
normal  
under EM. There were no overt changes in the iodide treated Wistar rats. By  
contrast, iodide treated BB/W rats exhibited marked accumulation of secondary  
lysosomes and lipid droplets; markedly swollen and disrupted mitochondria and  
extreme dilatation of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).

An excess of dietary iodine accelerates the development of a thyroid-
associated  
lymphoid tissue in autoimmune prone BB rats.  
Mooij P, de Wit HJ, Drexhage HA.  
Department of Immunology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  
Previous studies have shown that dietary iodine enhances the severity and  
incidence of focal thyroiditis in autoimmune BB rats and OS chickens. However,  
which lymphoid cells are involved in the development of the iodine-induced
focal  
thyroiditis and what the consequences are for the anticolloid antibody  
production have not been studied in detail. We therefore performed a study in  
which 3-week-old female BB rats were kept on either an enriched iodine diet  
(EID; iodine intake, 100 micrograms iodine/day) or a normal iodine diet (NID;  
iodine intake, 7 micrograms iodine/day) for a period of 18 weeks. The  
development of the focal thyroiditis was immunohistologically studied.  
Immunohistological data were compared to the thyroid hormone status and  
anti-colloid antibody production. Our data confirm that a high dietary iodine  
intake results in an accelerated development of the focal lymphoid cell  
infiltrates in the thyroid of the BB rat. After 12-18 weeks of an EID 50% of
the  
BB rats developed these infiltrates. Our data additionally show that: (a) the  
process starts with increases in the number of infiltrating MHC class  
II-positive dendritic cells and a clustering of these cells with T cells, B  
cells, and some macrophages and (b) the focal infiltrates are highly organized  
and consist of central B cell follicle-like structures surrounded by rims and  
areas of T cells. The architecture of the focal thyroiditis is hence very  
similar to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and secondary lymphoid organs  
(spleen and lymph node). Only minor signs of thyrocyte destruction were  
observed. We therefore consider the term "thyroiditis" as inappropriate and  
prefer the term "thyroid-associated lymphoid tissue." Since the thyroiditis  
component was small, it is also not surprising that the BB rats on the EID  
remained euthyroid. The presence of the thyroid-associated lymphoid tissue in  
the BB rats was positively correlated to the presence of anti-colloid antibody  
in the serum of the BB rats. We speculate that the dietary iodine might have  
direct effects on cells of the immune system or on cells forming the  
microenvironment of lymphoid tissue (reticulum cells). A role for highly  
iodinated thyroglobulin in the accelerated development of thyroid-associated  
lymphoid tissue is also possible.

Iodine-induced thyroiditis and hypothyroidism in the hemithyroidectomized BB/W  
rat.  
Allen EM, Appel MC, Braverman LE.  
We have recently reported that iodine administration (0.05% iodine in drinking  
water) to weanling, diabetes mellitus- and lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT)-prone  
Biobreeding Worcester (BB/W) rats strikingly increases the incidence of LT  
without occurrence of iodine-induced hypothyroidism, which frequently results  
when excess iodine is administered to euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's  
thyroiditis. Since hypothyroidism did not occur in the iodine-treated BB/W
rats,  
hemithyroidectomy was carried out in 30-day-old BB/W rats to increase thyroid  
mass and functional reserve. Iodine administration for 60 days markedly  
increased antithyroglobulin antibodies (0.40 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.06 OD; P  
less than 0.02), the incidence of LT (68% vs. 13%; P less than 0.001), and  
thyroid weight of the residual lobe (10.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.3 mg/100 g BW;
P  
less than 0.001) and induced hypothyroidism (T4, 2.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.0  
micrograms/dL; P less than 0.05; T3, 25.1 +/- 1.9 vs. 37.5 ng/dL; P less than  
0.001; TSH, 252 +/- 49 vs. 61 +/- 14 microU/mL; P less than 0.02).  
Hypothyroidism in the iodine-treated rats occurred primarily in those with LT.  
Similar studies were carried out in the non-diabetes mellitus-, non-LT-prone,  
genetically equivalent BB/W rats (W-line), the parent strain Wistar-Furth
rats,  
and Sprague-Dawley rats. Iodine administration did not induce LT or  
antithyroglobulin antibodies in these three strains and did not affect thyroid  
function in Wistar-Furth and Sprague-Dawley rats. However, in the W-line rats,  
iodine excess did induce thyroid enlargement in the residual lobe (8.4 +/- 0.2  
vs. 6.4 +/- 0.2 mg/100 g BW; P less than 0.001), a decrease in serum T3 (71.5  
+/- 2.9 vs. 86.0 +/- 2.5 ng/dL; P less than 0.001), and an increase in serum
TSH  
(344 +/- 65 vs. 69 +/- 6.0 microU/mL; P less than 0.001). It is evident,  
therefore, that hemithyroidectomy in BB/W rats sufficiently reduces
functioning  
thyroid tissue, resulting in iodine-induced LT and hypothyroidism, similar to  
iodine-induced hypothyroidism in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's  
thyroiditis. It is unclear, however, why iodine administration also induced  
hypothyroidism in hemithyroidectomized, genetically similar, W-line rats in
the  
absence of LT. This observation suggests that iodine-induced hypothyroidism in  
rats may be genetically determined.

Direct toxic effect of iodide in excess on iodine-deficient thyroid glands:  
epithelial necrosis and inflammation associated with lipofuscin accumulation.  
Mahmoud I, Colin I, Many MC, Denef JF.  
Involution of thyroid hyperplasia (induced by a low iodine diet and a
goitrogen,  
propylthiouracil, PTU) was obtained in mice by administering a high or a  
moderate dose of iodide (HID or MID, respectively). In HID involuting glands,  
vasoconstriction was observed after 12 hr whereas necrosis and inflammation
were  
very abundant as early as after 6 hr and maximal after 48 hr. They were not  
prevented by papaverine by which vasoconstriction was inhibited, but were  
inhibited by the continuation of PTU by which iodide oxidation and  
organification were inhibited. Lipofuscin inclusions in thyroid and
inflammatory  
cells were always associated with necrosis. On the contrary, when involution
was  
induced by MID or by HID + triiodothyronine (T3), or by T3 alone, neither  
necrosis nor inflammation occurred and apoptosis was the only mode of cell  
deletion. No lipofuscin inclusion occurred. Our results demonstrate that
iodide  
in excess, after being oxidized or organified, is directly toxic for  
iodine-deficient thyroid cells. The presence of lipofuscin suggests that its  
toxicity is mediated by lipid peroxidation, a consequence of production of
free  
radicals in excess.

Uptake and metabolism of iodine is crucial for the development of thyroiditis
in  
obese strain chickens.  
Brown TR, Sundick RS, Dhar A, Sheth D, Bagchi N.  
Department of Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology, Wayne State University,  
Detroit, Michigan 48201.  
To assess the importance of the role of thyroidal iodine in the pathogenesis
of  
thyroiditis in the obese strain (OS) chicken, a model of spontaneous and
severe  
disease, we studied the effect of antithyroid drugs that reduce thyroidal
iodine  
or prevent its metabolism. Reduction of thyroidal iodine was achieved with  
KClO4, an inhibitor of iodine transport and mononitrotyrosine (MNT), a drug
that  
promotes loss of thyroidal iodine as iodotyrosines. A regimen consisting of  
KClO4 and MNT administration beginning in ovo and continuing after hatching  
reduced thyroidal infiltration to 2% of control values and decreased  
thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) production for as long as 9 wk. Untreated birds  
had severe disease by 5 wk of age. The suppression of disease was independent
of  
TSH, not mediated by generalized immunosuppression and reversed by excess  
dietary iodine. Two drugs that inhibit the metabolism of iodine,  
propylthiouracil (PTU) and aminotriazole, reduced thyroidal infiltration and  
TgAb levels, although to a lesser extent. When splenocytes from OS chickens
with  
thyroiditis were transferred to Cornell strain (CS) chickens, a related strain  
that develops late onset mild disease, only the recipients that were iodine  
supplemented developed thyroiditis. In conclusion, autoimmune thyroiditis in
an  
animal model can be prevented by reducing thyroidal iodine or its metabolism
and  
optimal effects require intervention at the embryonic stage.

Iodine induced lymphocytic thyroiditis in the BB/W rat: early and late immune  
phenomena.  
Li M, Eastman CJ, Boyages SC.  
Department of Clinical Endocrinology, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.  
The effect of iodine excess on thyroid function and on the immunological  
sequence of events leading to lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) was studied in the
NB  
subline of BB/W rats to determine the mechanisms by which the level of iodine  
intake influences the development of LT in this animal model. Iodine  
supplemented water (500 micrograms/l, Group 1 or 500 mg/l, Group 2) or  
non-iodine supplemented tap water (Group 3) was given to breeding pairs and  
their offspring ad libitum. A Wistar rat group, also given tap water (Group 4)  
served as controls. To determine the immunological sequence of events, the  
phenotypic nature of the infiltrating thyroid lymphocytes was examined by  
specific immunoperoxidase staining in BB/W and Wistar rats at 6, 9, 12, and 15  
weeks. Antigen-presenting cells and class II (Ia) antigen expression on  
thyrocytes were also examined. The first immunological event apparent in the  
iodine-treated BB/W rats was a sharp increase in the number of Ia positive  
dendritic cells at 9 weeks compared with control BB/W and Wistar rats. In the  
iodine excess groups dendritic cells were associated with scattered areas of  
lymphocytic infiltration, comprising predominantly T helper cells (W3/25). T  
suppressor cells (OX 8) and IL-2 receptor positive activated T-cells (OX 39)  
were both present in small numbers. B-cells (OX 12) were absent. In addition,  
thyrocytes did not exhibit Ia antigen expression. By contrast, lymphocytic  
infiltration was not found at 9 weeks in control BB/W rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

Iodine-induced subclinical hypothyroidism in euthyroid subjects with a

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) occurs most frequently in patients
with  
underlying thyroid disease and is generally believed to be due to the iodine  
contamination of amiodarone and iodine released by the metabolism of the drug.  
We and others have suggested that the thyrotoxicosis may also be secondary to  
amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. To further determine the etiology of AIT, we  
administered large doses of iodides [10 drops saturated solution of potassium  
iodide (SSKI) daily] to 10 euthyroid patients long after an episode of AIT  
believed to be due at least in part to amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. Six of  
these 10 patients had an abnormal iodide-perchlorate discharge test before
SSKI  
administration, indicating a subtle defect in the thyroidal organification of  
iodide. During SSKI administration, 6 patients developed marked iodine-induced  
basal and/or TRH-stimulated serum TSH elevations, 2 had suppressed basal and  
TRH-stimulated TSH values, and 2 had normal TSH responses compared to  
SSKI-treated euthyroid subjects with no history of amiodarone ingestion or  
thyroid disease. Serum T4 and T3 concentrations remained normal and unchanged  
during SSKI administration in both the AIT patients and control subjects.
These  
results strongly suggest that excess iodine may not be the cause of the  
hyperthyroidism associated with amiodarone therapy, especially in those
patients  
with probable amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. Furthermore, like patients with
a  
previous history of subacute thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, the
present  
results suggest that some patients with a previous history of AIT may be at
risk  
to develop hypothyroidism when given excess iodine.

The relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and iodine intake: a
review.  
Foley TP Jr.  
Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes Mellitus, School of
Medicine,  
University of Pittsburgh.  
There is evidence to suggest that elevated levels of iodide in the diet are  
associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) in susceptible individuals,
and  
that autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) is less common in
susceptible  
individuals who live in regions with dietary iodine deficiency. There are  
epidemiologic studies in endemic goiter areas that report an increase in ATD,  
particularly thyroiditis, after the therapeutic administration of iodized
salt,  
bread and oil. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid is rarely found in  
patients from severe endemic goiter regions, yet there is a reversal of this  
observation after dietary iodine supplementation. Thyroid antibodies, both  
thyroglobulin (TgAb) and peroxidase (TpAb) or microsomal, were not detected in  
serum from patients with endemic goiter, but became positive in 43% of
subjects  
three and six months after therapy with iodized oil, and there developed  
transient hyperthyroidism. Similarly, the addition of iodine to the diet or
the  
administration of iodine-containing medications increases the frequency of ATD  
and the severity of existing autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, autoimmune  
thyroiditis has been induced by the administration of excess iodide to strains  
of chickens and rats that are genetically predetermined to develop the
disease.  
We are beginning to understand the pathogenesis of ATD. In hyperthyroidism the  
evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb)  
stimulate the TSH receptor to induce excessive and sustained secretion of  
thyroid hormones. Cellmediated immune mechanisms, such as antibody dependent  
cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), initiate the lymphocytic infiltration and  
thyrocytotoxicity in autoimmune thyroiditis. The mechanisms that initiate the  
development of the abnormal immune response and the relationship of ATD with  
excess iodide are poorly understood. There is evidence that an increase in the  
iodination of thyroglobulin (Tg) enhances its immunogenicity. The results of  
clinical and experimental studies support the requirement of a genetic  
predisposition to the development of ATD that may be precipitated by exposure
to  
certain environmental factors. Another mechanism supported by experimental
data  
is the direct toxic effect of excess iodide on iodide-deficient thyroid
glands.  
High concentrations of iodide after oxidation to iodine causes epithelial  
necrosis and inflammation associated with lipofuscin accumulation suggestive
of  
toxicity mediated by lipid peroxidation from excessive amounts of free
radicals.  
The epithelial damage would initiate inflammatory and immune responses.
Although  
these mechanisms would relate to the onset of autoimmune thyroiditis on
exposure  
to excessive amounts of iodide, the relationship of iodide intake and
autoimmune  
hyperthyroidism is less clear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Excess iodine ingestion has been implicated in induction and exacerbation of  
autoimmune thyroiditis in human populations and animal models. We studied the  
time course and sex-related differences in iodine-induced autoimmune
thyroiditis  
in NOD-H-2h4 mice. This strain, derived from a cross of NOD with B10.A(4R),  
spontaneously develops autoimmune thyroiditis but not diabetes. NOD-H-2h4 mice  
were given either plain water or water with 0.05% iodine for 8 weeks.  
Approximately 54% of female and 70% of male iodine-treated mice developed  
thyroid lesions, whereas only 1 of 20 control animals had thyroiditis at this  
time. Levels of serum thyroxin (T4) were similar in the treatment and control  
groups. Thyroglobulin-specific antibodies were present in the iodine-treated  
group after 8 weeks of treatment but antibodies to thyroid peroxidase were not  
apparent in the serum of any of the animals. Levels of thyroglobulin
antibodies  
increased throughout the 8-week iodine ingestion period; however, no
correlation  
was seen between the levels of total thyroglobulin antibodies and the degree
of  
thyroid infiltration at the time of autopsy. The thyroglobulin antibodies  
consisted primarily of IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgM antibodies with no detectable
IgA,  
IgG1, or IgG3 thyroglobulin-specific antibodies. The presence of IgG2b  
thyroglobulin-specific antibodies correlated well with the presence of thyroid  
lesions.

A breeding line of domestic cats spontaneously developing symptoms of  
hypothyroidism between the 40th and 60th day of life (fur changes, loss of  
appetite, growth retardation), elevated levels of antibodies against
microsomal  
structures and thyroglobulin, and lymphocytic thyroid infiltration has been  
recently established at our facility. Aim of our studies was to examine the  
effect of high iodine ingestion or prophylactic thyroid hormone therapy on  
functional and morphological characteristics of this Hashimoto-like
thyroiditis  
in cat. From birth to day 80 of life cats were treated with iodine (n = 9; 0.1  
mg/l) or thyroxin (n = 13; 2.0 micrograms/ kg/d) respectively. Untreated
animals  
served as controls (n = 12). Cat-serum was tested for thyroid function (TT3,  
TT4). After 8 weeks the thyroid tissue was submitted to routine histological  
processing (H&E) and the inflammatory activity was scored. Additionally  
immunohistological staining was performed for MIB-1, IgG, IgM and MHCII  
expression. Both untreated hypothyroid (UHC) as well as iodine-treated (IC)
cats  
revealed a significantly higher degree of thyroid inflammation and higher
tissue  
levels of IgM as the thyroxin-substituted animals (TC). Epithelial
proliferation  
decreased significantly in the IC and TC groups as compared to the untreated  
controls. No significant differences regarding IgG production and HLAII  
expression were detectable. Early thyroid hormone therapy significantly  
decreases both incidence and activity of autoimmune thyroiditis in cats as  
measured by inflammatory infiltration, IgM production and epithelial  
proliferation. Animals with excess iodide intake, however, show an aggravation  
of the autoimmune inflammatory activity.

Excess iodine induces the expression of thyroid solid cell nests in
lymphocytic  
thyroiditis-prone BB/W rats.  
Zhu YP, Bilous M, Boyages SC.  
Department of Clinical Endocrinology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.  
Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that lymphocytic thyroiditis  
and/or an increased iodine intake may be risk factors for the development of  
thyroid cancer. We previously reported that excess iodine accelerated the  
development of thyroid lymphocytic infiltration (LI) in the autoimmune BB/W
rat  
model. We also found that excess iodine increased thyroid cell proliferation
in  
a disordered manner. The present study was designed to further explore these  
observations and to address the question as to whether excess iodine under  
certain conditions predisposes the thyroid gland to neoplasia. To test this  
hypothesis, the lymphocytic thyroiditis-prone BB/W rat was exposed to excess  
iodine in drinking water. Ten BB/W rats at 4 weeks of age were given iodine  
water (NaI 0.05%) for 10 weeks, whilst another 10 BB/W rats were given tap
water  
and served as controls. Eighteen normal Wistar rats were also divided into  
excess iodine and control groups, served as a comparison to the BB/W rats. We  
found that an excess iodine intake accelerated the development of LI in the
BB/W  
rat. Severe LI was usually accompanied by prominent thyroid cell
proliferation,  
evident as numerous microfollicles and cell masses, not forming normal thyroid  
follicles. Numerous lymphocytes and plasma cells often encroached on these
areas  
of increased cellular proliferation. The surprising feature, and a possible  
indicator of activated thyroid cell proliferation, was the high incidence of  
thyroid solid cell nest-like lesions (SCN) in the iodine treated BB/W  
rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Induction of autoimmune thyroiditis in chickens by dietary iodine.  
Bagchi N, Brown TR, Urdanivia E, Sundick RS.  
Clinical studies have suggested that excess dietary iodine promotes autoimmune  
thyroiditis; however, the lack of a suitable animal model has hampered  
investigation of the phenomenon. In this study, different amounts of potassium  
iodide were added to the diets of chicken strains known to be genetically  
susceptible to autoimmune thyroiditis. Administration of iodine during the
first  
10 weeks of life increased the incidence of the disease, as determined by  
histology and the measurement of autoantibodies to triiodothyronine,
thyroxine,  
and thyroglobulin. Further support for the relation between iodine and  
autoimmune thyroiditis was provided by an experiment in which iodine-deficient  
regimens decreased the incidence of thyroid autoantibodies in a highly  
susceptible strain. These results suggest that excessive consumption of iodine  
in the United States may be responsible for the increased incidence of  
autoimmune thyroiditis.

An interesting case of iodide induced goitre with immunological abnormalities

previously  
been treated for exudative pleuritis, congestive heart failure and acute renal  
failure. Following recovery, he began to ingest large amounts of seaweed after  
which he developed goitrous hypothyroidism. It was of interest that the serum  
level of gamma-globulin increased, and subsequently the antithyroid microsomal  
antibody became strongly positive, suggesting that thyroidal autoimmune  
processes had been precipitated. Biopsy of the thyroid gland revealed chronic  
thyroiditis, with evidence suggesting extreme stimulation by TSH. Hight  
thyroidal uptake of 131I, positive perchlorate discharge test and biochemical  
analysis of the thyroidal soluble protein showed severe impairment of hormone  
synthesis following continuous accumulation of excess iodide. While there is  
evidence suggesting that increased iodide may be an important factor in the  
initiation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, this may result from the marked
increased  
sensitivity of Hashimoto's gland to the effects of iodine. Thus an occult
lesion  
could be unmasked in this manner. The mechanism by which iodide mediates this  
effect is not clear.

[ jl-wemeau@chru-lille.fr ](mailto:jl-wemeau@chru-lille.fr)  
WOLFF-CHAIKOFF'S EFFECT: The thyroid gland has a capacity to reduce thyroid  
hormone production in the presence of excess iodine by reducing the  
organification of the iodine. This Wolff-Chaikoff effect is observed after 48  
hours and protects the organism from excessive synthesis of the thyroid  
hormones. This effect is usually temporary and within a few days thyroid
hormone  
synthesis returns to normal through the so-called 'escape' phenomenon. However  
in a few normal individuals and in some susceptible patients, the escape does  
not occur. THE CONTEXT OF OCCURRENCE: Iodine-induced hypothyroidism is
observed  
in fetuses, newborn, adults and in the elderly. It is observed in individuals  
without underlying overt thyroid disorder, and specially in patients with  
autoimmune thyroiditis or those previously treated for thyroid diseases
(Graves'  
disease, subacute or pospartum thyroiditis, iatrogenic thyroid
dysfunction...).  
FROM A CLINICAL AND PROGRESSIVE POINT OF VIEW: The hormone deficiency is of  
obvious clinical expression, or sometimes discreet and revealed by hormone  
exploration. It is usually temporary, regressing with a few days or weeks
after  
iodine withdrawal. Nevertheless, some patients require transient hormone  
replacement therapy.

Iodine and thyroid autoimmune disease in animal models.  
Ruwhof C, Drexhage HA.  
Department of Immunology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam.  
Thyroid autoimmune diseases are complex, polygenic afflictions the penetrance
of  
which is heavily dependent on various environmental influences. In their  
pathogenesis, an afferent stage (enhanced autoantigen presentation), a central  
stage (excessive expansion and maturation of autoreactive T and B cells), and
an  
efferent stage (effects of autoreactive T cells and B cells on their targets)  
can be discerned. At each stage, a plethora of inborn, endogenous or exogenous  
factors is able to elicit the abnormalities characteristic of that stage, thus  
opening the gateway to thyroid autoimmunity. Iodine is an important exogenous  
modulating factor of the process. In general, iodine deficiency attenuates,  
while iodine excess accelerates autoimmune thyroiditis in autoimmune prone  
individuals. In nonautoimmune prone individuals, the effects of iodine are  
different. Here iodine deficiency precipitates a mild (physiological) form of  
thyroid autoimmune reactivity. Iodine excess stimulates thymus development.  
Iodine probably exerts these effects via interference in the various stages of  
the autoimmune process. In the afferent and efferent stage, iodine-induced  
alterations in thyrocyte metabolism and even necrosis most likely play a role.  
By contrast, in the central phase, iodine has direct effects on thymus  
development, the development and function of various immune cells (T cells, B  
cells macrophages and dendritic cells) and the antigenicity of thyroglobulin.

[2011]]  
  
Me:  
Hi Ray, Despite taking thyroid, and eating well, I still get winter  
insomnia. I can't fall asleep until dawn, and then sleep during the  
day. I talked to someone who fixed his similar insomnia issues with  
1.25 mg of Bromocriptine a day. From what I read, it sounds to me like  
Bromocriptine has a lot of negative side effects, and I couldn't find  
any information on it curing insomnia. Aside from my insomnia, I still  
often have diarrhea, and fatigue, which make me think that my problems  
are related to serotonin. Do you think it might be worth trying  
bromocriptine?  
  
RP:  
  
I have never tried it myself, but I know that some people have found it to be
more effective than just thyroid. Some people have very intense reactions to
it, flushing and low blood pressure for example, so it's good to be very
cautious with it. I think it's best to work on thyroid and sugar metabolism,
watching the temperature cycle and heart rate. What kind of thyroid product
have you used?  
  
Me:  
  
When I started taking thyroid last year, I felt good taking a 1/4  
Cynoplus and 12mcg Cynomel. With thyroid, I quickly gained 50 lbs, and  
am no longer underweight. I felt more energetic, confident, and had a  
positive outlook, and most of my eczema disappeared. I don't know what  
happened, but something changed, and now I can't take any Cynoplus at  
all without getting weird sensations in the back of my neck, and some  
fingers--it feels like motor tics, or involuntary movements. So now  
I'm taking 50mcg of Cynomel, broken up into 4mcg doses.  
  
RP:  
  
Is there enough sugar in your diet? Do you occasionally have seafood or liver,
as a source of [ selenium ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/selenium-
liquid/) ?  
  
Me: []  
  
RP:  
  
Something sugary (milk and honey, for example) right at bedtime might help
with sleep.  
  
Me:  
I wrote to you before about taking bromocriptine for insomnia. In just  
a few days, .6mg of bromocriptine seems to have mostly fixed my severe  
insomnia. I don't like the feeling it gives me, so I'm not sure if  
I'll continue to take it. I'm looking for other ways to get the same  
effect. Do you think bromocriptine helped my sleep because of its  
antiserotonin properties, or because it lowers prolactin? I was  
thinking of trying Stablon instead, to see if it helps with my sleep  
as well.  
  
RP:  
  
That's very interesting; I don't know what Stablon's effect might be, but a
couple of people tell me they have had very good results from it.  
I think winter-night stress involves all the hormones that regulate energy
production, and getting lots of bright light on your face, head, and neck
might help. A little [ niacinamide
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b3-niacinamide-powder-usp-grade/)
(100 mg), vitamins [ B1 ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b1-powder-
thiamine-hcl-usp-grade/) and B6 (about 10 mg), and gelatin, sugar, and salt
would help to maintain energy production during the dark.

[2011]  
  
Me:  
Hi Ray, I've been using many of your recommendations with great  
success. If I eat your carrot salad, and avoid starches, my  
long-standing digestion problems disappear. Recently I ate some bread  
and beer, and have had a return of my symptoms. Usually I get small,  
pulpy, yellowish feces that float, along with white fuzz on my tongue,  
and a bad taste in my mouth. Does this sound like bacteria in my small  
intestine  
  
RP:  
  
Yes, probably bacteria, maybe some yeast too. I have found that a pinch of
flowers of sulfur, USP, can help to change the flora. About 80 years ago,
doctors sometimes used camphoric acid; I tried it once, and had a perfectly
clean tongue the next morning. [ Pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) can help, too,
but I'm not sure what the mechanism is. I used a daily carrot for years, and
tried the other things when I got too tired of that. Bamboo shoots (boiled or
canned) are a pleasant alternative to carrots.  
Me:  
  
Thanks. Pregnenolone seemed to help a little, although I feel spacey  
and tired when I take it. I'll try flowers of sulfur when I get it. I  
wonder if this bacteria/yeast problem is why I sometimes feel really  
good on thyroid medicine and sometimes really bad. Right now I'm  
taking 25mcg of Cynomel throughout the day, but I'm feeling fatigued  
and depressed, with mostly normal bowel movements but also diarrhea  
every other day or so, without really changing my foods.  
  
RP:  
I have found that [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-
grade-aspirin/) helps with the bowel symptoms, and the associated
fatigue/depression.  
  
Me:  
I've been noticing that my temperature is low when I wake up, but does  
eventually get to 98.6 or higher. For instance, today it was 96.6 at  
7am, and 97.0 at noon when I finally woke up, but later in the  
afternoon it was 98.4. Should I pay attention to my temperature in the  
morning more than at other times?  
  
RP:  
I think it's good for the whole curve to be a little higher. It should come up
as your digestion improves, I think bacterial endotoxin interferes with energy
production.  
  
====================================  
  
Me:  
I read that it takes four years for the fat stores in our bodies to  
change over. In your experience, do most people who switch to mostly  
saturated dietary fats noticed that their metabolism increases slowly  
over this four year period? I'm wondering if I can expect my health to  
be better when the exchange is complete . I've been limiting PUFA for  
two years, and while I sometimes feel very good, I often still feel  
sluggish and unhealthy.  
  
Thanks for your work,  
  
RP:  
  
Fat people with low metabolic rate probably take longer; when people  
use a [ thyroid supplement ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-
thyroid-natural-desiccated-thyroid-ndt/) they usually decrease it in the first
couple  
of years; it probably depends on age, too.

coconut oil, and a good diet, I'm getting sicker and more lethargic as the
winter progresses here on the East Coast.  
  
I've been reading about people who use LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and various
seeds to treat cluster headaches. Some people say that a single dose can
sometimes prevent the recurrence of cluster headaches for months. Do you know
if serotonin excess is the main problem with cluster headache sufferers? Does
the long-term therapeutic value of these drugs come from 'resetting' serotonin
excess?  
  
Thanks  
  
RP:  
Have you seen any changes in your digestion?  
(Intestinal inflammation is a major factor in  
headaches and winter symptoms.) Are your  
temperature and pulse rate optimal? Have you  
checked for allergens among your foods or  
supplements? People have told me that  
bromocriptine and/or tianeptine (Stablon) helped  
their headache, which would be consistent with a  
serotonin problem. Does your diet include enough sugar?  
  
==============================  
  
Me:  
  
[Gibberish]  
  
RP:  
Do you get enough [ selenium ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/selenium-
liquid/) , for example from seafood? I usually use  
roughly equal parts of T3 and T4, using small amounts of cynomel on  
most days, occasionally cynoplus. Sometimes the intestinal flora can  
interfere with the liver's hormone metabolism; raw carrots, milk,  
bamboo shoots, and aspirin are things that often help with the flora  
and liver function.  
  
Me:  
  
[Gibberish]  
  
RP:  
  
Experiments with brain slices showed that T4 competes against T3, causing an
antimetabolic effect. Liver has all the nutrients, but it isn't ideal, because
it also has antithyroid effects.  
  
=================================  
  
Me:  
  
[Unimportant]  
  
RP:  
There are 25,000 unit capsules of retinyl palmitate, also of A from  
halibut liver oil. I use them transdermally, because some of the  
products have allergenic impurities, so I prefer the palmitate, that  
doesn't smell like fish.  
  
Me:  
Can halogen bulbs provide helpful indoor light for northern winter months? If
halogen bulbs give off more blue light, I was wondering if [ infrared
](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/light-therapy/) bulbs might be
better.  
  
RP:  
Regular incandescent bulbs, including those called infrared with  
clear glass, are better, because of the low amount of blue.  
  
======================  
I wonder if your vitamin D might not be  
deficient, as a result of reduced sun exposure.  
Increased parathyroid hormone has many bad  
effects, including insomnia. More milk and sugar  
can help to compensate for low vitamin D, but  
sunlight has other good effects. It takes the  
body a few weeks to adjust to a given dose of  
thyroid, so you should watch for changes in your temperature and pulse rate.

The diarrhea would cause hypoglycemia with increased stress hormones and

first, possibly trying grated carrot with a little salt, vinegar, and olive
oil, in case there's a problem with the wrong kind of bacteria.  
  
Me:  
  
[...]  
  
RP:  
  
Yes, some people think their ideal ratio is two to one. The T3 action peaks in
about an hour, and then fades gradually. Having some at intervals of a few
hours allows you to adjust the dose according to how you feel, heart rate,
sleep quality, etc.

[2013]  
  
Me:  
  
I enjoyed your last session on KMUD. I was thinking about the times and
temperatures and pulses you talked about, and also about my typically inverted
sleep pattern (sometimes 4am to 4pm). I could see this pattern as the result
of high adrenalin and low thyroid, or high serotonin, estrogen, and histamine
--the only other people I've talked to who sleep like this are women over 40,
and I'm a younger man. What would you tell someone to do to reverse this? Set
an alarm to take thyroid at regular waking hours?  
  
RP:  
Thyroid would be the basic thing, along with adjusting meals and light,  
but it would probably be easiest to use some Benadryl or Periactin (and  
[ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) ,
vitamin K) during the adjustment, for a few days to change a  
couple of hours at a time.  
  
Me:  
Thanks. So I would want to wake up to take thyroid in the morning, when I want
to be awake? What amount of aspirin might be helpful?  
  
  
RP:  
Thyroid helps to make sleep deeper, it doesn't help to wake up except by
making sleep more restful. An aspirin an hour before bedtime can be helpful,
but it should start gradually, with about 100 mg, gradually increasing in a
few days to 500 mg.  
  
============================  
  
Me:  
I thought you might find this little anecdote from Gary Fisher interesting. In
an interview I found on youtube, he was talking about his work with LSD in
hospitals. He said that a doctor approached him, wanting to see if LSD might
work as a pain drug for his dying cancer patients. The doctor apparently
didn't really know what LSD was, and had no bad or good ideas about it.  
  
One woman with cancer was given LSD. The next day she had no more pain. When
she refused her regular pain medication, saying that she wasn't in pain and so
didn't need medication, the cancer doctor got upset. He said that since the
tests showed that she still had cancer, she must still be in pain. He
concluded that the LSD had made her psychotic, and refused to test it on any
more patients. Someone asked him if he'd rather have psychotic pain-free
patients, or sane patients in pain, and he wanted the "sane" patients.  
  
The doctor's attitude reminded me of what I've encountered, and heard others
talk about. I was surprised that the attitude wasn't as new as I'd assumed,
since I think this story is from the early '60s. Once I was pressured into
seeing a doctor for my insomnia, and at the appointment he said that since
insomnia and depression often appear together, I must be depressed, and needed
to take an SSRI. One of my good friends has been in medical school for a few
years, so I've had the opportunity to see how it's changed his thinking. I
wonder if the most important components of this personality type are fear and
compartmentalization--I learned about this from your writing, and from
Altemeyer's book. Interestingly, Woody Allen has said that he's very good at
compartmentalization, which helps him in making movies by avoiding
distractions.  
  
RP:  
  
I had a friend whose experiences in Guatemala led to his taking science  
courses at the U. of Oregon (where I met him) to prepare for medical  
school. After his first session in medical school, he came back to visit  
in Eugene, to say that something was happening to his brain, and he  
wanted me to remind him, essentially, who he was, or had been. Now  
(after that, he didn't return to Eugene) he's an established plastic  
surgeon in NYC. In the 1970s there was a program on public television  
that documented a woman's experience beginning with her diagnosis of  
cancer. As she learned that it wasn't curable, and that there would be  
great pain, she asked her doctor if she shouldn't leave the country to  
go to England where she could get the Brompton cocktail,  
cocaine-morphine-ethanol, but the doctor assured her that she didn't  
need to leave, because she would be given all the drugs she needed for  
pain control. The last part of the video showed her pleading with the  
doctor, who was explaining that he mustn't let her get addicted, and  
then it ended with her shrieking and moaning, with unrelieved pain until  
she died. The emotional plague takes different forms in our society,  
the medical profession is just one form.

Dear Dr Peat,  
  
I have been having a lot of heart arrythmias for years now, they get much
worse when I'm bloated and gassy, my average HR is 61 BPM for the day,
temperature around 36.1 - 37 degrees usually.  
  
I was wondering if you could suggest any fixes?  
  
[Ray]  
Have you had blood tests? What are your main foods?  
  
[Me]  
I did get a TSH blood test which came back around .5  
  
My main foods at the moment are 150g parmasan cheese, 2 bananas, 1 cup white
rice, 2 cups milk, 4 tbsp irradiated honey, 4 tbsp white sugar, 200g beef
mince and 2 fried eggs.  
  
I am also getting really bloated with cold hands and feet in the evening, I'm
also prone to panic attacks if I don't drink enough milk and sugar(which
bloats me the most)  
  
I am also getting some kind of erythromelalgia in my hands and feet,
especially happening in the evening.  
  
I haven't been getting a lot of sun lately and am extremely anxious around
other people who aren't my family(like friends)  
  
I used to be on the carnivore and keto diet a year ago, doing that for 1.5
years. I did get a blood test when I was on carnivore, feeling really
stressed. My LDL cholesterol came back sky high with very low triglycerides.  
  
Then I started doing a diet with the foods that you promote, fruit, honey,
sugar, Haagen Das i ce cream, etc. Have been doing that since March 2021, and
I feel my autoimmune symptoms and heart arrythmias, as well as bloating, has
gotten worse.  
  
There was one instance where I was on a plane and had eaten a whole bag of raw
carrots the day prior with no evacuation afterwards even on the plane the day
after, I still had the carrots in me. I then drank alot of orange juice, and
the bloating and heart arrythmias were so bad i had to stand for most of the
flight(8 hrs).  
  
[Ray]  
I think it would help your thyroid fuction to reduce the meat and eggs and
bananas, and have more milk and easily assimilated carbohydrates, such as
orange or concord grape juice and oat bran.

[Ray]  
I know people who bought frozen human milk as a supplement. With any powdered
milk it’s important to find out whether an anti-caking agent was used in
making it. If the mother’s thyroid and vitamin D levels are good, drinking 2
to 3 quarts of milk and a quart or two of sweet orange juice per day will
usually quickly increase milk production and quality.  
  
Any dehydrated milk product is going to contain some oxidized materials, but
as a small addition to breast milk it should be o.k.

Systemic risk is small when it’s used only in the ear, but I think it’s best

likely to become aware of the effects of activities on their glucose  
level when the brain's demands are very high. I think there is likely to  
be a measurable difference in some of the "reflex" processes.

Sex differences in intelligence and brain size: A paradox resolved  
Richard Lynn  
Psychology Department, University of Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA,  
Northern Ireland  
Males have larger brains than females, even when corrected for body  
size, and brain size is positively correlated with intelligence. This  
leads to the expectation that males should have higher average levels of  
intelligence than females. Yet the consensus view is that there is no  
sex difference in general intelligence. An examination of the literature  
shows that the consensus view is wrong. Among adults, males have  
slightly higher verbal and reasoning abilities than females and a more  
pronounced superiority on spatial abilities. If the three abilities are  
combined to form general intelligence, the mean for males is 4 IQ points  
higher than the mean for females. Among children up to the age of around  
14 yr the sex differences are smaller because girls mature earlier than  
boys. The evolutionary selection pressures responsible for greater  
intelligence in males are discussed.

Personality Predicted by Size of Different Brain Regions  
Rachael Rettner | June 23, 2010 06:39am ET  
  
In a social situation, it's easy to tell the difference between a  
wallflower and the life of the party, but a new study suggests we can  
also spot differences in their brains.  
  
The results show the size of certain brain regions is related to  
people's personalities. For instance, highly altruistic people had a  
bigger posterior cingulated cortex, a brain region thought to be  
involved in the understanding of others' beliefs. Bigger regions are  
assumed to be more powerful. [Top 10 Mysteries of the Mind]  
  
"One of the things that this shows is we can start to develop theories  
about how personality is produced by the brain," said study researcher  
Colin DeYoung, of the University of Minnesota.  
  
While people's personalities are likely shaped by both genetic and  
environmental factors, the findings might help explain the differences  
in people's actions and demeanors from moment to moment, he said, or  
"what produces the patterns of behavior and emotion and thought that we  
describe as personality."  
  
The big five  
  
There are many ways to describe someone's character — from talkative to  
anxious to hardworking and organized. Psychologists have found that many  
traits often go together and have grouped these traits into five  
overarching categories — extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness,  
conscientiousness and openness/intellect.  
  
Psychologists can get a pretty good picture of someone's personality by  
determining to what degree they express each of these traits. [Read:  
Personality Set For Life By 1st Grade]  
  
Scientists have only recently begun to link up personality research with  
neuroscience to try to figure out the underlying brain mechanisms  
responsible for personality differences.  
  
DeYoung and his colleagues imaged the brains of 116 participants who had  
previously completed a questionnaire designed to assess their  
personality in terms of the "big five."  
  
Next, they matched up all the brain images. Since everyone's brain is  
different, the images won't line up perfectly right off the bat. So the  
researchers picked one image — from a participant who scored about  
average for all five traits — to serve as a "reference brain."  
  
A computer program was then used to squish and stretch the images so  
that they all lined up with the reference brain. This allowed the  
researchers to compare all the subjects' brains, and see how large or  
small certain brain regions were relative to one another.  
  
Personality in the brain  
  
A connection between brain region size and personality was found for  
four out of the five traits (all except openness/intellect).  
  
Those who scored high on neuroticism — which indicates a tendency to  
experience negative emotions, including anxiety and self-consciousness —  
was associated with a larger mid-cingulate cortex, a region thought to  
be involved in the detection of errors and response to emotional and  
physical pain. Neurotics also had a smaller dorsomedial prefrontal  
cortex, a region implicated in the regulation of emotions. [Read: Why  
Neurotics Haven't Died Out]  
  
Extroverts, those who are sociable, outgoing and assertive, had a larger  
medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region involved in processing rewards.  
This goes along with the idea that extroverts are sensitive to rewards,  
which in our society often involve social interactions and status.  
  
Conscientious people, who tend to be orderly, industrious and  
self-disciplined, had a larger middle frontal gyrus, a region involved  
in memory and planning.  
  
The researchers note however, that a bigger brain region does not  
necessarily mean the region has better functioning, although extensive  
evidence supports this assumption.  
  
The results do not indicate, that people are doomed to embody one  
personality or another for their whole lives. Though it's not  
necessarily easy, personalities can, and do change.  
  
"Our experience can change the brain," DeYoung said. "And as the brain  
changes, personality can change," he said.  
  
The results were published online April 30 in the journal Psychological  
Science.

Testing Predictions From Personality Neuroscience: Brain Structure and  
the Big Five  
Colin G. DeYoung,1 Jacob B. Hirsh,2 Matthew S. Shane,3 Xenophon  
Papademetris,4 Nallakkandi Rajeevan,4 and Jeremy R. Gray4  
  
Abstract  
  
We used a new theory of the biological basis of the Big Five personality  
traits to generate hypotheses about the association of each trait with  
the volume of different brain regions. Controlling for age, sex, and  
whole-brain volume, results from structural magnetic resonance imaging  
of 116 healthy adults supported our hypotheses for four of the five  
traits: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness.  
Extraversion covaried with volume of medial orbitofrontal cortex, a  
brain region involved in processing reward information. Neuroticism  
covaried with volume of brain regions associated with threat,  
punishment, and negative affect. Agreeableness covaried with volume in  
regions that process information about the intentions and mental states  
of other individuals. Conscientiousness covaried with volume in lateral  
prefrontal cortex, a region involved in planning and the voluntary  
control of behavior. These findings support our biologically based,  
explanatory model of the Big Five and demonstrate the potential of  
personality neuroscience (i.e., the systematic study of individual  
differences in personality using neuroscience methods) as a discipline.  
  
Me:  
So if brains with different sized parts make different personalities  
and abilities, can can you see the differences reflected in head size  
and face shape?  
  
Peat:  
  
About 40 years ago a physical anthropologist did a very good study  
showing that the relative size of major brain parts can be detected on  
the outside of the skull. Dogmatic antiphrenologists (pointy headed  
professors) are hard to convince. Marian Diamond's book shows the  
effects of estrogen-shrunken cortex vs. [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) -expanded
cortex on  
the rat face; humans' relatively big cortex probably has a bigger effect  
on the appearance of the face. A few years ago I asked her about  
something she said in the book and she didn't have any recollection of it.

Me:  
  
I was very interested in your discussion of the visual systems in Mind  
and Tissue. I've been trying to observe my own sight processes,  
thinking about the box and triangle diagrams you included, but I'm  
having trouble. What can I do to observe this process? Thanks.  
  
Peat:  
  
The motion after-effect is easiest to notice, when you have been  
traveling and watching scenery come toward you for a while, or if you  
watch an Archimedes spiral rotating on a turntable, until there is an  
after-effect (when the real movement stops) of apparent motion in the  
opposite direction. If you close your eyes during the several seconds  
when the after-effect would be occurring, you might be able to see what  
looks like flowing sand.  
  
=======================================  
  
Me:  
  
I was reading about the old LSD studies and saw that they were also  
using carbogen (maybe a strong mixture?) to induce a psychedelic  
experience. I remember you talking about a friend who, because of a  
bad regulator, used more CO2 then he intended on a patient, with the  
result being that the patient regained his voice. In a situation like  
that, or in other CO2 healing situations, does the person have any  
sort of drug like experience? Does the intoxication (I don't know what  
to call it, maybe unusual state) mean something is going wrong  
physiologically?  
  
Peat:  
  
That person was very unconscious. I don't know of any psychedelic  
effects from too much CO2.  
  
================================================  
  
Me:  
  
Do you have any experience with Gerovital supplements of procaine
hydrocloride?  
  
Peat:  
  
  
Yes, recently a woman in her sixties with multiple joint, muscle, and  
nerve pains started taking it in the conventional Ana Aslan form, with  
additives, and now she's limber, and says her joints are rubbery and  
painless. I have seen amazing things with just plain procaine, and would  
talk about it more, except that it can be very allergenic for some  
people. Lidocaine has enough overlap with it to be valuable.  
  
Me:  
  
That's really interesting. I recently ordered some GH3 to try for my  
intestines and insomnia. I haven't found anything really good to read  
about it though.  
  
Peat:  
  
Two big studies done in the US around 1960 didn't get published,  
probably because they provided very strong confirmation for Aslan's  
research. (I got a copy of the one done at Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital  
in Santee, California, but have probably lost it.)

[...]  
With its high altitude and pollution, is  
Mexico City a healthy place to live? [Moving to MX and teaching English]  
  
RP:  
  
There are places with less smog than Mexico City, that have language  
schools, but the altitude is still beneficial in DF. In Mexico, pay for  
English teachers is low.  
  
Me:  
  
Thanks. I was wondering what Ivan Illich might say about teaching  
English. Probably that it's arrogant and presumptuous, unless I intent  
to take the experience selfishly, trying to learn Spanish, trying to  
learn from the people there. [...] Do you know people who manage to somehow
escape  
the 40 hour work week?  
  
RP:  
  
I started a language school in Mexico City in 1962, and I had friends  
who made a fair living by giving private classes. The rent for the  
school building meant that I had to teach 8 classes a day and not eat  
much, so then I got a job at the state university and got slightly  
better pay, but was required to use the "embassy method," which was  
probably like delivering pizzas, except no tips. It's an opportunity to  
learn Spanish, and in Mexico it was a chance to get to know interesting  
people. At least when I was there, the people who could afford to study  
English weren't the people Illich talked about. One was a taxi driver,  
who learned English to become a guide at the Museo de Antropologia,  
others were middle class, doctors, actors, politicians. I have heard  
that the immigration people are much more organized now in Mexico, but  
in Coeneo, Michoacan, when I declined to teach a class in a friend's  
school because I didn't have work papers, he said "there are no  
immigration people here," so it's probably easier for undocumented  
people in small towns. There, students offered to pay a dollar or two  
each per hour in a group class, and room and board cost about  
$300/month, so it wouldn't be stressful work.  
  
Me:  
  
That's very helpful, thanks. I had read that the immigration paper  
process is difficult, and that you need to be in the Mexico to look  
for a job, but I didn't know that small towns might be a better place  
to look. I have some Mexican friends at work, who might have ideas on  
which towns to look in, although when I mentioned Michoacan, they  
told me it's a dangerous drug state, and that I shouldn't go there. I  
guess it's a change of routine and place I'm looking for, also a  
chance for interactions that are richer than just handing over a pizza  
box. Around 300/month is great, and would be less stressful than  
trying to pay rent in this area.  
  
RP:  
  
It's the southern part of Michoacan, Tierra Caliente/Nueva Italia,  
that's dangerous, but it was dangerous long before the drug cartel took  
over.  
  
Me:  
  
[...] Does your friend still have his  
language school in Coeneo?  
  
RP:  
  
It's sort of an adult education school, largely for young school  
dropouts, and when I tried teaching a class there the noise from a class  
next door made it hard to hear--cement block walls, and windows,  
transmit and echo the sound. English is always of interest, so classes  
could be held in the teacher's house, or in any quiet place.  
  
Me:  
  
[...]  
  
RP:  
  
Someone always wants an English teacher, but pay in a place like that  
depends on how many students sign up, so being there and getting  
acquainted would be necessary. Finding someone to be your Spanish tutor  
would be a way to start, and in small towns word spreads quickly. I know  
the school's owner by his first name, Juvenal, but I don't know his last  
name, and so don't know how to contact him by mail or phone. One of the  
reasons that English teachers usually go to the big cities is that lots  
of city people know some English, and in small towns not many do (except  
in places like Coeneo in the winter, when large numbers of men come back  
from working in the US), so it takes some time to make living arrangements.  
  
Me:  
  
[...]  
  
RP:  
  
I think arranging a trip with the intention of learning Spanish is the  
right way, English students always find you. When I was 18 I spent the  
summer taking classes at Mexico City College; I didn't speak any  
Spanish, but one of the first taxi rides I took, the driver asked me to  
tutor him, just being there for an hour now and then for him to speak  
English with. Doing that kind of private tutoring, or small groups,  
avoids the issue of having work papers. If you haven't had a Spanish  
course, it's really helpful to find a textbook with a vocabulary list of  
a couple of thousand words, and to memorize as many as possible before  
going.

[2014]  
  
Me:  
  
Sorry to quote you, but at [ http://peatarian.com/peatexchanges
](http://peatarian.com/peatexchanges) I read  
about LSD that, "It acts as a learning experience, and can affect your  
general attitudes; if the amount is excessive, causing depletion of  
brain glycogen, I think it can lead to prolonged defensive attitudes,  
probably with a rebound of serotonin."  
  
I read about James Fadiman's study in the '60s that used LSD for  
technical problem solving. They had good results and I think used  
100mcg LSD. But I think they were only giving it one time per person.  
Now he talks about even smaller doses-- I think around 5-20mcg. Some  
of the other research I was reading was using much larger doses,  
around 400mcg. What might be an excessive amount?  
  
Peat:  
  
I think the right amount is something like 5 to 20; 400 is much too much.  
  
Me:  
  
Would small doses of something like mescaline (in cactus) be  
healthful, like LSD?  
  
Peat:  
  
One of the old medical writers in Mexico reported that the local people  
used it for treating heart disease. I think that probably relates to an  
antistress effect. The good thing about cyproheptadine is that it's legal.  
  
Science. 1976 May 21;192(4241):801-3.  
Lysergic acid diethylamide- and mescaline-induced attenuation of the  
effect of punishment in the rat.  
Schoenfeld RI.  
At a dose as low as 1 microgram per kilogram of body weight, lysergic  
acid diethylamide (LSD) significantly decreased the suppressive effect  
of electric shock on licking behavior of the rat. Attenuation of  
punishment was also obtained with mescaline, but neither  
dimethyltryptamine nor delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol was active in this  
test. Cyproheptadine and alpha-propyldopacetamide, drugs that interfere  
with the function of neurons that contain serotonin, have a behavioral  
effect similar to that of LSD and mescaline, which suggests that the  
attenuation of punishment produced by these hallucinogens may result  
from decreased activity of such neurons.  
  
Me:  
There was an article about one of the few legal licensed peyote  
growers; he said he took a small amount of the peyote for his heart  
condition. I don't know why, but I think buying San Pedro cactus is  
legal in the US. [Note, not legal to prepare or consume, I believe.]  
  
Is the punishment in that experiment analogous to signals we get from  
our culture, at work, from the bank, from defensive and aggressive  
people?  
  
Peat:  
  
I think it is; stresses reduce spontaneity.

Is there a particular nutrient that could be deficient if someone gets muscle
tension when increasing thyroid supplements?  
  
RP:  
  
Usually magnesium. Cells contain more when they have thyroid.  
  
=================================================  
  
Me:  
  
Would it be safe to use more than 4 mg of cyproheptadine for insomnia and IBS?
Someone mentioned I could use 16 mg. I found some studies that use these
doses, but I have always seen you refer to the smaller doses, and was
wondering what your reasoning was. Thanks.  
  
RP:  
  
I have known people who did well with 12 mg/day, and know that some  
people use much more, but until you know your sensitivity to it, it's  
best to start with the minimal doses. Even 4 mg at night can make some  
people too torpid to function the next morning.  
  
Me:  
  
I tried 12mg of cyproheptadine for a couple day. It made me feel and think
differently, but didn't make me tired, or let me fall asleep. The day after, I
was a little muted, but got more errands done than usual. Are high or low
levels of serotonin responsible for a person's reaction to the drug? Or is
insomnia always from an underenergized brain, from lack of thyroid?  
  
RP:  
  
I think thyroid and the dependent neurosteroids are the basic things, and that
the reactive adrenaline, serotonin, nitric oxide, and prostaglandins are the
immediately involved things. Keeping endotoxin absorption low can often make a
big difference, with diet or antibiotics.  
  
Me:  
  
Would daily cyproheptadine eventually permanently lower serotonin levels?  
  
RP:  
  
I think it could lower stress, allowing other healing processes to correct it.  
  
Me:  
  
The larger doses are making me feel a lot less anxious overall.  
  
So anit-serotonin drugs don't necessarily act on serotonin directly? I thought
they generally had a chemical structure somewhat similar to serotonin,
allowing some type of interference.  
  
RP:  
  
Cyproheptadine's effect is mainly by blocking the effects, rather than
inhibiting its formation, but by reducing inflammation, it can break a vicious
circle, affecting the whole system.

Q: What do you think could explain the out-of-season increase in RSV cases
this summer (2021)? Especially among children.  
RP: I think the emphasis on vaccinating babies for influenza starting at 6
months is a factor, weakening their resistance to other respiratory
infections.

If it didn’t anesthetize your throat I think the dose was o.k. Lidocaine is
usually a compact powder, it could be 100 mg.

>> I think the invigorating effect is from reducing inflammation that drains
energy. I think that dose is safe to use daily for a while. I recently
gathered these articles for someone with high circulating cancer cells post-
mastectomy; I think they suggest how important the anti-inflammatory anti-
stress effects can be. It prevents excitatory calcium overload of cells.

wish they came with remote controls so you could never get near them but you
have to be near it to answer it or turn it on or text on it before you can
move away. I think we are better off without them.

would linger for years or decades—osteomyelitis, TB, for example, and when
something couldn’t easily be diagnosed, it was popular to blame it on a “focal
infection.” That idea has persisted on the fringes of dentistry, which, as a
whole, is even less scientific than general medicine. If a tooth root is
infected, pus gathers near the base of the root, forming a painful abscess,
which can usually be cured with an antibiotic and a change of diet. If the
immune system senses continuing infection, the collection of white blood cells
will be renewed, and expanding, can eventually cause the tooth to simply fall
out. A dead tooth can remain in place for 70 or 80 years, without causing a
problem, when the adjoining tissue is healthy, that is, when the person’s
general health is such that invading bacteria will be destroyed. The adjoining
tissue is the first to react to signs of danger.

Me:  
  
If I'm vitamin A deficient enough to get dandruff and acne, could that cause
anxiety too?  
  
RP:  
  
Since it's needed to make [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) and [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-

================================================  
  
Me:  
  
I'm curious about different types of thought, visual, verbal, etc. When you
personally try to remember a person's name, does the name come up
automatically, or do you "look" in your mind's eye to see the person's name
written somewhere in text?  
  
RP:  
  
When I have known a person for years, their name sometimes becomes  
closely associated with their personality, but for me, names of people  
usually come up very indirectly, with a cluster of associations. I have,  
for a very long time if not always, tried to avoid using the same words  
for describing a situation that I have described before, and the same  
deliberate separation between language and reality seems to apply to  
people's names.  
  
Me:  
  
That's extremely interesting. Recently I started taking some more Cynoplus
each day, and noticed a few changes: I felt no anxiety, and my thoughts were
different. With more cynoplus (3/4 of a pill, along with the cynomel I was
already taking), I had rich visual thoughts, but found that it was harder and
took longer to think of a specific person's name, like a scientist, or author,
or celebrity, even when I could clearly visualize their face. To think of
their name, I would have to first see their face, and then think of something
related to them, at which point I might see their name as if it were printed
on a page, or below a youtube video. On less thyroid, I can think of names
more easily, but I usually can't picture their face. Earlier, I noticed that
taking thyroid for me was associated with a move from more verbal to visual
thinking in general, but it was never this strong. I couldn't tell if these
changes were good or not, because with more cynoplus I also didn't enjoy my
favorite music at all, because it just sounded like a bunch of distinct and
detailed sounds, and I seemed to fell less happy overall.  
  
RP:  
  
I think that as oxidative energy decreases, and stress hormones including
adrenaline rise, thinking tends to become more verbal or symbolic--at noon in
a hilly landscape, valleys and peaks are parts of a continuous whole, but at
sunset only the peaks are lighted--those are like the words that get their
meaning from the whole, but when the (image) valleys are darkened, the (word)
peaks seem to have meaning autonomously. One summer as a project for a
psychology course I asked people about the way they dreamed. In my dormitory,
there was a group of teachers from Nepal, as well as the usual US teachers
meeting their certification requirements. There were 2 or 3 people from the
upper castes, Brahman and Kshatriya, and two Vaishyas. The Brahmans described
colorful and meaningful dreams as regular events, the Kshatriyas said they
prayed for them and had them occasionally when they were fortunate; the
Vaishya dreams were more like the common Americans' dreams, often in
monochrome, not always pleasant. One US teacher said his dreams were like
listening to stories, and he didn't seem to understand the idea of colored
dreams. I suspect that the effects of social power, and the degree of
chronically perceived threat in the background of their life, affect the whole
organism so deeply that even the color and texture of consciousness is
affected.  
  
Me:  
  
Your dream survey reminded me of the Herman Hesse Book Siddhartha, in which I
believe a Brahman becomes enlightened. When I was a teenager I noticed that I
had gradually lost my ability to visualize well. When I was in college, I had
a period with those verbal dreams; it was like I was listening to a
conversation between a few people. Now, I only have a sense of having dreamt.
Is it important to remember dreams? William Burroughs wrote about language as
an actual virus, and I think Ginsberg had an essay defending pot use, saying
that it allowed people to think without language, an effect I don't think I've
found myself. I used to work at an upscale grocery store (Whole Foods) with
high prices, and saw that most of the shoppers there looked healthier than
those at the regular price grocery store. I thought the food was making them
healthier, but after a summer of eating most of my meals from their salad bar,
my eczema/psoriasis had gotten much worse. Now when I read the labels in Whole
Foods, I can't see how most of their products are better than anywhere else,
but the people still look better. [...]  
  
RP:  
  
It's the class history of the customers that accounts for their health, how
easy life was for their grandparents and parents. Walmart customers are likely
to be sick and obese, and the logic of the system requires the company to pay
its employees so little that they need food stamps to live. The USDA has diets
for the different social classes; doctors in Los Angeles tell Mexican mothers
that they should wean their babies to beans when they're six months old.  
  
Me:  
  
As someone increases their thyroid hormone dose, and if adrenalin and cortisol
are lowered, could mood also lower? On a lower dose of thyroid, I often feel
euphoric, and initially thought that it was because I was getting a higher
ratio of T3 to T4.  
  
RP:  
  
If the liver isn't keeping up, T4 can accumulate.  
  
Me:  
  
How would I tell if T4 is accumulating?  
  
RP:  
  
At an extreme, it has an antithyroid effect, slowing metabolism, dulling
consciousness.  
  
======================================================  
  
Me:  
  
A 59 year old woman is on an SSRI and a benzodiazapine. She has been having
recurring kidney stones over the last few years. Some time ago, the doctors
found a non-cancerous mass on one kidney. Then they recently surgically
removed a kidney stone from the ureter of the kidney without the mass; in the
surgery process they took a biopsy and found early-stage cancer. They are
waiting 2 weeks to see take another biopsy, to see if the injury from the
stone and removal caused a false positive on the biopsy. I sent her your
article on [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-
aspirin/) , and thought maybe taking some until the next biopsy might be
helpful. If the biopsy is positive again, they plan to remove the kidney. Is
there anything you might recommend for such a situation? Thanks.  
  
RP:  
  
Besides aspirin, Benadryl and progesterone would help to normalize the  
tissue.  
  
==================================================================  
  
Me:  
  
I had written to you about suggestions for a woman who had cancer in the
kidney. I don't know if she used any of the aspirin, benadryl, or
progesterone, but the second round of tests showed that there was actually no
cancer, just inflammation from the kidney stones, and now they want to focus
on preventing the recurring kidney stones. For kidney stone prevention, would
it be good to focus on calcium regulation, like getting more calcium in the
diet, and taking vitamins K and D? I think the doctors have been recommending
increasing water intake, but I can't see how that would help, and the stones
haven't abated. Thanks.  
  
RP:  
  
Do you know about her regular diet? Keeping the urine acidic is usually  
helpful, and getting her vitamin D around the middle of the range, and  
with vitamin B6, is important, preferably with PTH at the low end of the  
normal range.

School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.  
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vitamin D is important in maintaining calcium  
homeostasis, but its role in kidney stone disease and its effect on stone
formation are  
still not clear.  
RECENT FINDINGS: Kidney stone formers tend to experience enhanced intestinal  
calcium absorption, increased urinary calcium excretion, and excessive bone  
mineral loss. Although direct actions of active vitamin D have been  
implicated in  
all these processes, the effect of nutritional vitamin D (vitamin D2 or  
vitamin  
D3) use on calcium balance among stone formers is still not clear. In  
addition, the safety of nutritional vitamin D use in the stone forming
population  
is also not established, considering the potential effect of its use on
raising  
urinary calcium. However, most of the observational studies do not support a  
significant association between higher nutritional vitamin D store and
increased risk of  
stone formation. Short-term nutritional vitamin D repletion in stone  
formers with vitamin D deficiency also does not appear to increase urinary
calcium  
excretion.  
SUMMARY: The effect of nutritional vitamin D use in stone formers is  
still not  
clear. As vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among stone formers,  
future  
prospective studies are needed to establish the biological effect, as  
well as the  
safety and efficacy of nutritional vitamin D therapy in this unique patient  
population.

Data regarding the prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)  
insufficiency in patients with nephrolithiasis, and the effects of vitamin D  
supplementation on parathyroid hormone (PTH) are few and conflicting. In this
article, we  
examined the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in 236  
recurrent kidney stone formers and the correlation of vitamin D levels with
other  
parameters of stone formation. The prevalent stone composition was calcium
oxalate  
(80.4%) and uric acid (16.45%). One third of stone formers had vitamin D  
insufficiency and a  
quarter of them high PTH levels (PTH >7.5 pmol/l) with normal serum  
(total and  
ionized) calcium values. Predictor of high PTH was low 25(OH)D level (r  
= 0.989, r(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). Stone formers with hypercalciuria had
higher  
25(OH)D  
values (72.26 ± 4.21 vs. 59.29 ± 1.76, p = 0.0013) compared to stone  
formers with  
urine calcium within normal ranges. Further studies are needed in order  
to better  
define the consequences of vitamin D insufficiency and to evaluate the  
impact of  
the therapeutic interventions in this cohort.

Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism in patients with recurrent kidney

[ chrysapi2001@gmail.com ](mailto:chrysapi2001@gmail.com)  
This retrospective data analysis was undertaken to examine the biochemical  
differences between renal stone formers with normocalcemic  
hyperparathyroidism  
(NHPT) and those with normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Our goal  
was to ascertain whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status related to PTH  
levels in this patient cohort. Our findings among 74 patients with NHPT
indicate  
that stone formers with NHPT had significantly lower 25(OH)D levels compared
to 192  
controls (p = 0.0001) and that 25(OH)D is positively correlated with  
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  
D values (R = 0.736, p = 0.015). Sequential measurements (after 3 - 5  
years), among 11 patients with NHPT who did not receive vitamin D (VitD)  
preparations,  
showed a significant increase in urinary calcium (3.43 ± 1.96 vs. 5.72 ±  
3.95, p = 0.0426) without a significant change in PTH levels. VitD  
supplementation, to 3 patients resulted in significant PTH decrease (11.8 ±
1.8 vs. 9.8 ± 1.3, p =  
0.003). Prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of vitamin  
supplementation in renal stone formers with NHPT.  
  
Me:  
  
Thanks, I will tell her about vitamin D, and show her those studies. For her
diet, I think she generally has a low appetite, but has a little yogurt, some
cereal, regular US lunch sandwiches, and maybe some meat and potatoes, with
wine. How would she keep the urine acidic?  
  
RP:  
  
I think stopping the cereal and sandwiches, replacing them with milk, eggs,
cheese, and some sea food, liver, etc., would be helpful, but she's probably
hypothyroid, and is likely to have alkaline urine unless her metabolic rate
and appetite increase. Do you know whether her creatinine was high, GFR low?

Do you think the electric universe theory and [ thunderbolts.info
](http://thunderbolts.info/) is on the right track? Does it mean anything for
us on the personal biological level?  
  
RP:  
  
I think it's right. The same simple application of realistic physics that led
to that view of cosmology has biological implications, e.g., R.O. Becker, Yuri
Holodov, Solco Tromp, Madeleine Barnothy, Michele Gauquelin, et al.  
  
=========================================================  
  
Me:  
  
Hi, Because you've written very interesting things about languages, I thought
I might ask you your thoughts on learning a foreign language, and about
continuing to learn one after many common words are already known. For
example, how did you learn to read French after you had memorized many common
words. Did you just continue to read, gradually gaining understanding?  
  
I came across a linguist named Stephen Krashen, who has what he calls his
'input hypothesis.' In some ways, he seems like an antidote to Chomsky's
grammar ideas. For example, he says that it's possible to learn languages
after adolescence. Krashen says that you can learn a language just by
exposure, by reading or listening, and that gradually you'll understand, and
eventually produce correct speech of your own. There are a lot of examples on
the web of people using his ideas. For example, a US man listened constantly
to Japanese on his headphones for one year, and then moved to Japan and was
able to work and communicate.  
  
I found a method online that is an extreme extrapolation of Krashen's ideas.
The gist of it is that you listen to an audiobook in your unknown language,
while simultaneously reading the same book in print in your known language.
The idea is to make the 'input' as 'comprehensible' as possible. When I tried
it, it seems to be more effective the more hours a day I do it, and the
creator claimed that this was due to the memory curve, and that it is best to
do it for as many hours as possible for as many days as possible.  
  
I was wondering if you see associating one language with another as useful,
considering what you've said about images being behind the words, although
despite the method I'm using I don't actually feel as if I'm associating the
two languages with one another. I'm trying to understand how the new language
is being learned, and how the memories are forming. I'm also trying to notice
whether my current metabolic state (high adrenaline, whether I'm thinking more
in pictures or words, what my dreams are like) has anything to do with the
learning process.  
  
RP:  
  
As kids, we hear language spoken in situations that we understand. For a  
new language, listening to the telling of a familiar story has the same  
function. It could be listening to a standard fairy tale, or listening  
to the day's news in the new language after learning about the situation  
in the old language. When I started reading French, I found that there  
were enough familiar cognate words to reveal most of the meaning, and  
that, reading very quickly, the context would reveal the meaning of some  
of the unfamiliar words; some of the grammatical words were functioning  
in reading before I was able to define them when I saw them separately.  
With Russian, I started with publications in science journals, and the  
large number of cognates in those had the same function, making the  
meaning of a paragraph clear before I knew all the individual words  
independently.  
  
Me:  
  
That's interesting. Reading and listening is mostly what I'm doing, but while
I can understand some conversations, I can't talk much. Did you learn French
after Spanish--were the French words cognates to English, Spanish, or both?
I'm in Mexico City, where I've met some French people who seem to speak
Spanish easily. I was studying audiobooks before I came here, but they were
from Spain, and when I got here I found I understood almost nothing at all
here with the different accent.  
  
RP:  
  
When I first went to Mexico I hadn't studied Spanish, but I first learned a
few phrases for getting around, and would listen to people at the boarding
house at supper. After I had learned some Spanish, I saw that the grammar was
similar to French, and because I had a good English vocabulary from reading, I
saw that the French vocabulary was very close to English--modern English was
the result of the French invasion. Although I've never had an opportunity to
speak French (when I visited in Paris, it was immediately after the student
rebellion, and it wasn't a friendly atmosphere) it's probably easier for me to
read than Spanish, because there are so many regional variations in Spanish.

Some of these are my questions to him, and some aren't.  
  
[ **LATEX BEDS SAFE** ?]  
  
"Some people are allergic to it, but it can make a very good foam mattress. In
recent years, most of the latex mattresses are designed to be stiff and firm,
but that isn’t intrinsic to the latex." — RP (2021)  
  
[ **IS A FIRM MATTRESS DESIRABLE** ?]  
  
"Common bed spring technology in the 19th century resulted in a hammock-like
sag as the springs aged. The inner-spring mattress people showed how much
better it was if the bed didn’t sag in the middle, and for about a generation
Simmons and other companies made very soft innerspring mattresses that allowed
the hips and shoulder to sink, letting the back stay straight.  
  
The idea of mattress firmness blended with ideas of duty, toughness, exercise,
and health, until the most expensive mattresses felt like a futon on
concrete." — RP (2021)  
  
[ **THE PURPOSE OF THE VDR** ?]  
  
"I think the VDR and 1,25-OH are very analogous to the estrogen system.
Rodents are supposedly more sensitive to vitamin D than people, but the
standard rat poison concentration in human food would probably eventually kill
some people." — RP (2021)  
  
[ **DOES ALLEN DULLES** ' **INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF
ZION PROVE THAT IT IS AUTHENTIC** ?]  
  
"Wikipedia emphasizes the plagiarism in the Protocols, from fictional works,
but neither plagiarism nor forgery affects its importance. A novelist who said
things like that in the 1860s was obviously onto something, since there are
prominant people now in Israel who are saying similar, and worse, things.
People who just speak honestly about what they observe are called prophets---
it can take others a very long time to recognize that such things happen." —
RP (2021)  
  
[" **RELATIONSHIP** " **WITH ANALOG MACHINES** ?]  
  
"Yes, that’s the property that makes it possible for us to relate to them in a
natural way. Norbert Wiener wrote about it." — RP (2021)  
  
[ **DOCTOR RECOMMENDS PROSTATECTOMY** ]  
  
"The language “intermediate probability for malignancy” and equivocal presence
of clinically significant cancer, means that they haven’t understood the
concept of “watchful waiting” that was responsible for reducing mortality from
prostate cancer in the late 1990s.  
  
What they prescribe tamsulosin for is probably usually just weakness of the
bladder contraction muscle, the detrusor, that’s common with overweight and
low testosterone. His TSH is likely to be high, a supplement of thyroid and
vitamin D would probably help." — RP (2021)  
  
[ **MEANING OF EMPATHIC REACTION TO SELF-DESTRUCTIVE NPC** ?]  
  
"I think it’s kind of a political judgment—if you want to optimize your
efforts, supporting the efforts of others to do good things, and defending
yourself against the energy-consuming processes of destructive people, is more
effective than focussing on the suppression of evil." — RP (2021)  
  
[ **BITCOIN** ]  
  
"When you mine gold, you have something that exists separately from what
anyone might think about it. Bank lending counts ownership of debt as assests,
if the debtors fail, the system fails, but at least some real value is there,
as something mortgaged; it isn’t all pure fiat money. Bitcoin mining is a way
of creating belief, nothing more." — RP (2021)

[A woman has a stress reaction when taking thyroid. Took iodine in the past.]  
  
Peat:  
  
Overdoses of iodine can damage the thyroid, but other things in her diet  
might be a problem. Being in Mexico City, she might benefit from lots of  
good orange juice.  
  
============================  
  
[2015]  
  
Me:  
  
I've been interested in methylene blue since your newsletter and KMUD
interview. Do you think the purity of some methylene blue could be a problem?
I bought some that is used for fish and aquariums. I have read online that a
lot of methylene blue is contaminated with heavy metals, but I don't know what
to think, because the people making these claims were trying to sell their own
methylene blue, which they claimed was free of heavy metals.  
  
Peat:  
  
I suspect it all might be made at the same factory, but I haven't seen  
the analysis. The seller could tell you the metal content.  
  
====================================  
  
Me:  
  
It's probably too early to really tell, but for the few weeks I've been taking
methylene blue, I haven't had my normal insomnia ("circadian rhythm
disorder"). I've been looking for information on nitric oxide and insomnia but
haven't found anything good. My digestion is also better. Is there some reason
methylene blue might help insomnia?  
  
Peat:  
  
Yes, it restores mitochondrial energy production, and lowers nitric  
oxide. High nitric oxide seems to be involved in insomnia  
  
How much of it are you taking? Are you buying a prepared solution?  
  
Me:  
  
My dose is about 15mg a day in the morning. Is that a good dose? I saw that
some studies were using higher amounts. I bought a 2.3% solution sold for
fish, but I might eventually look for another source because the company won't
send me any type of analysis. I've had a couple things fix my insomnia for a
few weeks, only to have the problem return, so I'll have to wait and see. One
of the things that worked temporarily for my insomnia in the past was
bromocriptine, and I had been wondering whether there was some connection
between the growth hormone I had used years before and the insomnia, and now
I'm wondering if there's a relationship for me between growth hormone (or
prolactin), nitric oxide, and insomnia, but I don't know enough to really
figure it out.  
  
Peat:  
  
I think the amount needed might decrease with time; I know someone who's
getting very good results with one mg. per day.  
  
Hypothyroidism is likely to be behind the insomnia, high prolactin, and
inappropriate nitric oxide.  
  
==========================================  
  
Me:  
  
Do you think people can feel spacey and sleepy when increasing a [ thyroid
supplement ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-
desiccated-thyroid-ndt/) dose, if the thyroid is lowering stress hormones and
the pulse is decreasing?  
  
Peat:  
  
Yes, it sometimes does that during the first week or two of using it.  
  
=======================================  
  
Me:  
  
Hi, do you know what kind of things would cause someone to have trouble
reading facial expressions? Thanks.  
  
Peat:  
  
That can happen after a person has a stroke in a certain area, but I think
there’s a great natural variation, some of it a matter of character and
attitude.  
  
=======================================  
  
Me:  
  
Hi, I was wondering what it could mean that my pulse is 92 when sitting, but
immediately rises to 120 when I get up and walk around just a little. Thanks.  
  
Peat  
  
That’s fairly common, slightly low blood sugar, or slightly high thyroid, can
cause it.  
  
Me:  
  
So the pulse should stay around 90 when walking? Also, should your pulse go
above 90 after coffee, or does coffee bring your pulse to 90?  
  
Peat:  
  
No, it’s normal for the pulse to be faster when you move. With fast walking,
mine’s usually 130 or more.  
  
====================================  
  
Me:  
  
I was wondering if you ever give classes, seminars, or anything like that.  
  
Peat:  
  
Not very often, but occasionally.

feel anxiety with small increases of T3, but that can be overcome using food
and the stabilizing supplements. A [ selenium
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/selenium-liquid/) deficiency is sometimes
involved in hypothyroidism, so she should have sea food (low fat, no salmon)
regularly. Low fat cheese, and at least one egg per day, for a total of 100
grams of protein/day, will often correct a thyroid problem. Well cooked white
button mushrooms are a good alternative to potatoes.  
  
[Follow-up info provided]  
  
Things that reduce stress should be used at the same time as the T3. Sugar and
[ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) ,
sometimes Periactin, can reduce the stress hormones. T4 is probably preferred
by most doctors because it doesn’t have those immediate effects, and she might
find that that’s easier (although it takes weeks to adjust to the right dose).
The problem is that it has to be metabolized to work, and depressed women
often have so much adrenalin, cortisol, and serotonin circulating that the
liver changes it to reverse T3.

[Hunger and blood sugar. Why always hungry?]  
  
Hypothyroid people waste glucose by failing to oxidize it completely, and that
typically causes fluctuations of blood glucose and increased appetite. Keeping
glucose stable with the right amount of thyroid prevents inappropriate hunger.

The leaf water is good for magnesium and calcium, but has very little protein.
About 3 cups of greens would provide enough of the minerals. If you don’t eat

[Using beta blockers to tolerate small amounts of thyroid?]  
  
I think it’s best for anxious people to use the anxiety to motivate a thorough
study of the issues. Hypoglycemia can be a factor in anxiety, and when low
thyroid and high estrogen are involved, a beta blocker has the possibility of
lowering blood sugar.

Drugs in the medical treatment of Cushing's syndrome.

Cushing's syndrome is a complex endocrine condition with potential serious  
complications if untreated or inadequately treated. Transsphenoidal surgery
with  
resection of a pituitary adenoma is successful in 75 - 80% of patients, but  
approximately 20 - 25% show persistence of Cushing's, and a similar proportion  
may experience recurrence within 2 - 4 years post-op. When surgery fails,
medical  
treatment can temporarily suppress excessive cortisol production and
ameliorate  
its clinical manifestations while more definitive therapy becomes effective.
We  
describe pharmacological approaches to the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.
Drugs  
used to suppress cortisol secretion are mostly inhibitors of steroidogenesis.  
Ketoconazole, fluconazole aminoglutethimide, metyrapone, mitotane and
etomidate  
are in that category. Ketoconazole is in current use while other drugs,
although  
mostly available in the past, continue to have a potential role either alone
or  
in combination. Drugs that suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
secretion  
are less popular as standard treatment and include cyproheptadine, valproic
acid,  
cabergoline, somatostatin analogs, PPAR-gamma agonists, vasopressin
antagonists.  
Some of these drugs have been tested in limited clinical trials but there is  
potential therapeutic benefit in analogs with better specificity for the class
of  
receptors present in ACTH-secreting tumors. A third category of drugs is  
glucocorticoid receptor antagonists. Mifepristone is currently being tested in  
clinical trials in patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing's disease and
in  
patients with metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma or ectopic ACTH syndrome
not  
amenable to surgery. We also review replacement therapy after surgery and  
non-specific drugs to treat complications in patients with severe
hypercortisol.  
The review provides a complete survey of the drugs used in the medical
treatment  
of Cushing's, and new advances in the development of pituitary-active drugs as  
well as receptor blockers of glucocorticoid action. It also provides avenues
for  
exploration of new drugs active on somatostatin, dopamine and vasopressin  
receptors. There are effective pharmacological agents capable of chronically  
reversing biochemical and clinical manifestations of hypercortisolemia in  
Cushing's syndrome but new drugs are needed with action at the pituitary
level.

Cyproheptadine, a nonselective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor blocking agent,  
reduces ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion from the ACTH-producing tumors. A  
35-year-old female suffering from Cushing's disease due to microadenoma of the  
pituitary gland has been followed since the age of 15. Subtotal adrenalectomy  
followed by total adrenalectomy, pituitary irradiation, and transsphenoidal  
hypophysectomy, combined with second radiotherapy of the pituitary, were  
unsuccessful in achieving remission of the disease. Remission was achieved
with  
cyproheptadine up to a dosage of 24 mg/day. Every attempt to discontinue  
cyproheptadine treatment was accompanied by recurrence of the disease. This is  
the first case of Cushing's disease in which cyproheptadine treatment has been  
the only efficacious therapy for a period of 11 yr. Cyproheptadine may be an  
alternative long-term therapy for Cushing's disease when other methods of  
treatment fail.

To investigate whether cortisol secretory patterns are associated with a
response  
to cyproheptadine treatment in Cushing's disease, we studied two patients with
a  
hyperpulsatile pattern and one patient with a hypopulsatile pattern before and  
during chronic cyproheptadine therapy (24 mg daily). In the two patients with
a  
hyperpulsatile cortisol secretory pattern, pituitary magnetic resonance
imaging  
with gadolinium did not reveal a pituitary adenoma, whereas in the patient
with a  
hypopulsatile cortisol secretory pattern, a microadenoma was identified.
Plasma  
cortisol levels were measured every 30 min for 24 h. In the two patients with
a  
hyperpulsatile cortisol secretory pattern, chronic treatment with
cyproheptadine  
resulted in sustained clinical and biochemical improvement and normalization
of  
the median of absolute and relative increments in cortisol spikes. In the
patient  
with a hypopulsatile cortisol secretory pattern, only a reduction of cortisol  
spikes was noticed during treatment. These results suggest that patients with  
Cushing's disease who are characterized by a hyperpulsatile cortisol secretory  
pattern and in whom no pituitary lesion can be identified by magnetic
resonance  
imaging, cyproheptadine treatment may be useful.

Studying a patient with Cushing's disease by 24-hour indirect blood pressure

absent, although the usual decrease in heart rate persisted. Thereafter we
found  
a hypervariability in blood pressure and heart rate, which was reversed by  
treatment with betablockers and/or cyproheptadine. The therapy restored also
the  
normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure. The low-dose cyproheptadine therapy  
normalized urinary free cortisol levels and restored a 24-hour blood pressure

A patient suffering Cushing disease is presented in whom the administration of  
ciproheptadine, bromocriptine and sodium valproate in a single dose did not  
manage to control the clinical-biologic manifestations of the process.
Combined  
treatment with 1.200 mg/day of sodium valproate and 15 mg/day of bromocriptine  
induced a complete clinical-biological remission, being arterial pressure the  
last parameter to normalize. The patient who has always refused to undergo  
surgery has stayed with this treatment for three years, maintaining remission
and  
without appearance of side effects. On two occasions (after one and a half
years  
and after two and half years) the transitory interruption of treatment induced
in  
a few weeks an increase in plasma cortisol levels which again normalized after  
treatment was re-established. There were no clinical-biological data,  
pharmacological tests which permitted the prediction of these therapeutic
results  
and therefore, the therapeutic response obtained is not indicative of any  
specific etiological subtype of Cushing disease.

Hypertension in Cushing's syndrome: from pathogenesis to treatment.  
  
Cicala MV(1), Mantero F.  
  
Author information:  
(1)Division of Endocrinology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.  
  
Hypertension is one of the most distinguishing features of endogenous
Cushing's  
syndrome (CS), as it is present in about 80% of adult patients whereas in  
children its prevalence is about 47%. Hypertension in CS is significantly  
correlated with the duration of hypercortisolism and results from the
interplay  
between several pathophysiological mechanisms regulating plasma volume,  
peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac output, all of which are increased
in  
this state. Glucocorticoids cause hypertension through several mechanisms:
their  
intrinsic mineralocorticoid activity; through activation of the renin-
angiotensin  
system; by enhancement of vasoactive substances, and by causing suppression of  
the vasodilatory systems. In addition, glucocorticoids may exert some  
hypertensive effects on cardiovascular regulation through the CNS via both  
glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Hypertension in CS usually  
resolves with surgical removal of the tumor, but some patients require  
pharmacological antihypertensive treatment both pre- and postoperatively.  
Thiazides and furosemide should be avoided, while adrenergic blockade and
calcium  
channel antagonists are usually ineffective. Mineralocorticoid receptor  
antagonists, Ang II blockers and ACE inhibitors are good anti-hypertensive  
options; PPAR-γ agonists may help in many aspects of the insulin resistance  
syndrome. The relatively selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist  
Mifepristone (RU 486) could reduce blood pressure in patients with CS.  
Neuromodulatory agents such as the serotonin inhibitors cyproheptadine and  
ritanserin, valproid acid, dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogs may  
occasionally be effective, as well as drugs acting directly at the adrenal  
levels, such as Ketoconazole and aminoglutetimide or even opDDD. Treating  
hypertension in CS remains a difficult task and a big challenge, in order to  
decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.

In 1990, a 55-yr-old woman was admitted to the Medical Department of our
hospital  
for severe hypercortisolism complicated by secondary diabetes mellitus and  
serious hypokalemia. Although inferior petrosal sinus sampling did not show
any  
significant difference between central and peripheral ACTH concentration,  
suggesting an ectopic source of ACTH secretion, diagnostic imaging was
negative  
and Cushing's disease due to hyperplasia of the pituitary intermediate lobe
was  
suspected. Medical treatment with bromocriptine and cyproheptadine led to a
rapid  
and stabile normalization of adrenal function, so that after two months  
cyproheptadine was stopped and bromocriptine was tapered to a smaller dose. An  
attempt to discontinue medical treatment, carried out 3 yr later, was followed
by  
a quick increase of ACTH and cortisol levels, which were normalized by the  
resumption of the bromocriptine. Adrenal function remained normal until 1994
when  
hypercortisolism relapsed despite the treatment. Chest radiography and
computed  
tomography (CT) scan detected a 6 mm nodule in the middle lobe of the lung
which  
proved to be a neuroendocrine tumor, with immunohistochemical positivity for  
ACTH. Nests of neuroendocrine cells (tumorlets) were also demonstrated in the  
surrounding lung tissue. After the lobectomy, the patient recovered completely  
from Cushing's syndrome and no symptoms and/or signs of recurrence have been  
observed over the subsequent follow-up period. Although cyclical spontaneous  
Cushing's syndrome could not be excluded, there was strong evidence that
medical  
treatment with bromocriptine might have played a key role in long-lasting  
remission. To our knowledge, this is the second case described in literature
of  
Cushing's syndrome caused by neuroendocrine lung tumor responsive to  
bromocriptine.

Cushing's syndrome is due to chronic glucocorticoid excess that may have
various  
etiologies. The most common endogenous form is pituitary-dependent bilateral  
adrenal hyperplasia, which is termed Cushing's disease. Major depression
occurs  
in more than half of the cases. The presence of depressive symptoms connotes  
severity of clinical presentation and, in patients with hypothalamic-pituitary  
forms, entails prognostic value. Medical treatment may be used while awaiting  
more definitive solutions for the illness by surgery. The inhibitors of
steroid  
production (e.g., ketoconazole, metyrapone and aminoglutethimide), rather than  
antidepressant drugs, are generally successful in lifting depression as well
as  
other disabling symptoms. Since central serotonergic regulation could have a
role  
in the course of Cushing's disease, serotonin antagonists (e.g.,
cyproheptadine,  
ritanserin and ketanserin) have been employed. Findings related to the  
pharmacological response of depression in Cushing's disease were found to have  
implications for the pathophysiology of depression and the potential
involvement  
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) in resistance and
tolerance  
to antidepressant drugs. The use of serotonergic drugs in Cushing's disease
may  
yield important insights in the understanding of serotonergic regulation both
in  
Cushing's disease and in the HPA axis in nonendocrine major depression.

The effect of cyproheptadine and/or bromocriptine on plasma ACTH levels in

Cyproheptadine and bromocriptine have been reported to be therapeutic in  
suppressing ACTH levels in Cushing's disease and Nelson's syndrome. However,  
there have been only scattered reports of their effect in suppressing raised
ACTH  
levels found in patients cured of Cushing's disease by bilateral
adrenalectomy.  
In order to assess whether these agents could prove beneficial in such
patients  
we studied 12 patients previously treated with bilateral adrenalectomy alone
for  
Cushing's disease before and after 3 weeks of cyproheptadine and/or
bromocroptine  
therapy. All had raised plasma ACTH values but no patient had evidence of a  
pituitary macroadenoma. Plasma ACTH and cortisol were sampled 2-hourly for 24
h.  
Neither drug regime led to any change in plasma levels of cortisol for 24 h
after  
a 20 mg dose of oral hydrocortisone. Plasma ACTH (mean +/- SEM) showed a small  
but significant overall reduction (523 +/- 45 vs 392 +/- 34 ng/l; P less than  
0.05) while on bromocriptine alone (5 mg given at 0800 and 1800 h, n = 5).
When  
each time point was analysed individually this reduction was significant at
only  
five out of 13 time points. At 0400 h plasma ACTH (mean +/- SEM) was 758.4 +/-  
298.1 vs 380.2 +/- 166.6; 0600 h, 795 +/- 288.7 vs 477.8 +/- 191.7; 1200 h,

h,  
548.6 +/- 262.5 vs 394.2 +/- 178.5 ng/l (P less than 0.05). There was no

Cushing's syndrome is a serious endocrine condition for which no treatment has  
been proven fully satisfactory at least for its pituitary dependent form  
(Cushing's disease). Indeed, despite some advances in pharmacology  
(cyproheptadine, bromocriptine, lisuride) and in surgical and radiation  
procedures at pituitary level, a definitive cure is often delayed. The
inhibitors  
of steroids synthesis (ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, metyrapone, mitotane)
are  
still very valuable tools in its management as a palliative treatment.

The clinical characteristics and current concepts of pathophysiology of
Cushing's  
syndrome have been reviewed. The specific type of pituitary or ectopic  
ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome and the underlying  
pathology can be determined biochemically and with the aid of anatomic  
localization procedures. Several approaches are available for treating
pituitary  
ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, but transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery
is  
the ideal type, with remission of the disease being observed in 80 to 90% of  
cases. When successful, pituitary microsurgery is followed by preservation of  
normal pituitary function and restoration of normal  
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function within 6 to 12 months postoperatively.  
Medical therapy of Cushing's disease includes drugs that inhibit CRH-ACTH  
secretion, such as cyproheptadine and bromocriptine, and agents that inhibit  
cortisol synthesis, such as aminoglutethimide, metyrapone, ketoconazole, and  
mitotane, or that block the action of cortisol at the glucocorticoid receptor  
level, such as RU-485. With the exception of mitotane, which has adrenalytic  
effects, the action of the other pharmacologic agents is promptly reversed
when  
treatment is discontinued. Thus, drug therapy is effective only as temporary  
treatment for Cushing's syndrome when surgical approaches are contraindicated
or  
when attempts are made to improve the patient's clinical and metabolic status
in  
preparation for surgery. Mitotane is effective in extending survival of
patients  
with adrenal carcinoma, particularly when it is administered early as adjuvant  
therapy or when it is combined with repeated debulking resection of recurrent  
tumor. The toxicity associated with mitotane administration limits the use of  
larger and probably more effective doses in these patients. The synthesis of
more  
specific cytochrome P-450 enzyme inhibitors and of mitotane analogues with
more  
limited toxicity may ultimately provide more effective tools in the
pharmacologic  
management of Cushing's syndrome.

Cyproheptadine has been reported to effect remissions in up to 50% of patients  
with Cushing's disease presumably at a hypothalamic level. Endocrine studies  
including CRF testing were performed in a 37-year-old woman with Cushing's  
disease. Cyproheptadine therapy resulted in a clinical and chemical remission.  
During therapy, basal plasma and urinary steroid levels were normal as were  
responses to dexamethasone, metyrapone, and insulin induced hypoglycemia. CRF  
administration in the untreated patient resulted in a markedly exaggerated  
increase in plasma ACTH and cortisol levels, while with cyproheptadine therapy  
responses were considerably blunted but still greater than normal. These  
observations are the first to provide evidence supporting a pituitary effect
of  
cyproheptadine in Cushing's disease in vivo and raise questions regarding the  
assumption of hypothalamic dysfunction in those patients with Cushing's
disease  
responding to cyproheptadine.

Cushing's disease may originate from either the anterior pituitary lobe or the  
neurointermediate lobe, a major characteristic of the latter group being  
bromocriptine responsiveness. This study of two patients with Cushing's
disease  
demonstrates that bromocriptine responsiveness also may be associated with  
anterior pituitary corticotroph hyperplasia or a normal pituitary gland. The
two  
patients were a 14-yr-old boy (patient 1) and a 29-yr-old woman (patient 2);  
their cortisol production rates were 121 and 234 mumol/24 h (normal values,
less  
than 80 mumol/24 h), respectively. A single oral dose of 2.5 mg bromocriptine  
resulted in a gradual decrease in plasma cortisol from 680 to 130 nmol/L after
6  
h in patient 1 and from 640 to 170 nmol/L after 4 h in patient 2. Both
patients  
then received medical treatment for a period of 2 yr. Whereas sodium valproate  
was ineffective, bromocriptine (5 mg/day) abruptly decreased the cortisol  
production rate to 60 mumol/24 h in patient 1 and to 138 mumol/24 h in patient
2,  
and both patients had a partial clinical remission. Despite an increase in  
bromocriptine dosage to 30 mg daily and 24 mg/day cyproheptadine, the clinical  
and biochemical remission was not sustained in patient 1, and no further  
improvement occurred in patient 2. Total hypophysectomy then was performed in  
both patients. Sections of the pituitary from patient 1 showed diffuse
anterior  
pituitary corticotroph hyperplasia, with early nodule formation in some areas.  
The sections from patient 2 showed normal numbers and distribution of  
corticotrophs. We conclude that the heterogeneous nature of Cushing's disease  
cannot be explained on the basis simply of anterior vs. intermediate lobe
origin  
of the disease.

Effect of the antiserotonin drug, cyproheptadine, on plasma beta-endorphin and

In the present paper evidences are provided for the changes occurring in blood  
opioid neuropeptides in patients with Itsenko-Cushing's disease), who were  
treated with an antiserotonin drug, cyproheptadine (peritol). An increase in
the  
plasma contents of beta-endorphin and beta-lipotrophin in the above patients
has  
been found to be one of the factors conditioning an enhanced activity of the  
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. Treatment of the patients suffering
from  
Itsenko-Cushing's disease with cyproheptadine (peritol) resulted in a decrease
of  
the plasma beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin, as well as a display in 60% of  
cases of clinical and laboratory remission. Absence of the clinical remission
in  
some patients treated with peritol indicated a need for intervention in the  
metabolism of other monoamines involved in the modulation of the action of
opioid  
neuropeptides on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system.

The authors provide the data on the changes in the blood content of opioid  
neuropeptides in patients with Icenko-Cushing's disease treated with an  
antiserotonin drug peritol. The high content of beta-endorphine and  
beta-lipotropin in the patients' blood was one of the factors determining  
activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system. The treatment of  
patients with Icenko-Cushing's disease by peritol led to a decrease in the
blood  
content of beta-endorphine and beta-lipotropin, promoting a clinical and  
laboratory remission in 60% of patients. Some patients treated with peritol
did  
not develop a clinical remission. This indicates the necessity of acting on
the  
metabolism of other monoamines involved in the modulation of the action of  
neuropeptides on the hypothalamus-pituitary system.

Sodium valproate and cyproheptadine may independently induce a remission in
the  
same patient with Cushing's disease.  
  
Koppeschaar HP, Croughs RJ, Thijssen JH, Schwarz F.  
  
A patient with Cushing's disease was unsuccessfully treated by pituitary
surgery  
and external pituitary irradiation. One year later sodium valproate treatment  
induced a remission and finally hypocorticism developed. After drug withdrawal  
hypercoticism recurred. Treatment with cyproheptadine again induced
hypocorticism  
necessitating corticosteroid substitution therapy. Biochemical characteristics
of  
this patient included responsiveness to bromocriptine and cyproheptadine in
acute  
tests. The study demonstrates that sodium valproate and cyproheptadine may
both  
be effective independently in the treatment of the same patient with Cushing's  
disease. It is proposed that the disease is due to an ACTH producing tumour of  
pituitary intermediate lobe origin.

Direct effects of cyproheptadine, reserpine, synthetic ovine  
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), dexamethasone, and lysine-8-vasopressin  
(LVP) on the secretion of immunoreactive ACTH and beta-endorphin from the
adenoma  
and the nonadenomatous tissue of patients with Cushing's disease were examined  
using a superfusion system. Cyproheptadine and reserpine (10(-9)-10(-7) M of  
each) suppressed immunoreactive ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion from both  
tissues. CRF (10(10)-10(7) M) stimulated the secretion of both peptides from
the  
nonadenomatous tissue, but only a high dose of CRF could stimulate the
secretion  
of these peptides from some adenomas. Such CRF-induced secretion was partially  
suppressed by dexamethasone. LVP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) stimulated peptide
secretion  
from both types of tissue. These results suggest direct inhibitory effects of  
cyproheptadine and reserpine on the secretion of these peptides from the  
pituitary of patients with Cushing's disease, a different stimulatory
mechanism  
of LVP from that of CRF in these tissues, and low sensitivity of the adenoma
to  
CRF.

Experiments on male rats have shown that the inhibitory effect of peritol on
the  
hypothalamohypophyseal-adrenal system (HHAS) is determined both by its
influence  
on the regulatory mechanisms of the CNS and direct action on secretion and,  
possibly, synthesis of steroids. The degree of the antiserotonin and the  
HHAS-inhibiting effects depends on the frequency of drug administrations
rather  
than on its dose. The experimental studies made it possible to successfully
apply  
peritol to the treatment of inpatients suffering from Icenko-Cushing's
disease.  
Almost 60% of the inpatients manifested a remission, which was confirmed by
the  
reduced blood content of ACTH, hydrocortisone and aldosterone.

[vision changes: darkening and slight loss of periphery, poor night vision,
and general darkening of the whole vision field.]  
  
Have you noticed whether your pupils are smaller than normal? An excessively
activated parasympathetic nervous system can cause effects like that, by
reducing the amount of light entering the eye. Histamine and some drugs can
cause it.  
  
[vision changes...]  
  
Nicotine constricts the pupils. When a person starts taking thyroid there is
sometimes a mobilization of stored fat (similar to being on a low calorie
diet), and the shrinking fat cells will release stored toxins (such as drugs
or organophosphate insecticide) that can shrink the pupils.  
The coated tongue and itching suggest that there’s a digestive problem—the
stimulating effect of some fibrous food (raw carrot, cooked mushrooms or oat
bran) might help. If you alternate eyes, do you notice a difference in
brightness (or color) between them?  
  
[vision changes... chemical exposure]  
  
It’s possible that irritating foods could chronically increase histamine, but
I think you should investigate what your room might have been treated with.
There have been some awful insecticides in wide use in Mexico. I think No-
Pest-Strips are sold there. In 1979, buses, restrooms, and cheap motels were
washed with a product called PinoSol with insecticide. After I had been
exposed to its peculiar fumes in various places, one night I woke up and
smelled that on my breath as I exhaled. During the daytime, when I started
getting hungry before a meal I would smell it. I kept smelling it for a few
weeks after returning to the US, and as soon as the smell disappeared, I
became hyperthyroid, and that lasted for a few weeks. Apparently, the
substance had been blocking thyroid secretion as long as it was in my tissues.

Neurosciences Research Center, Tehran, Iran. (3)Shefa Neurosciences Research  
Center, Tehran, Iran.  
BACKGROUND: Progesterone as a sex steroid hormone is thought to affect and  
prevent demyelination, but its role in promoting myelin repair is far less  
investigated. In this study, remyelinating potential of progesterone in corpus  
callosum was evaluated on an experimental model of MS.  
METHODS: In this experimental study, adult male C57BL/6 mice were fed with
0.2%  
(w/w) cuprizone in ground breeder chow ad libitum for 6 weeks. At day zero,
after  
cuprizone removal, mice were divided randomly into two groups: (a) placebo
group,  
which received saline pellet implant, (b) progesterone group, which received  
progesterone pellet implant. Some mice of the same age were fed with their
normal  
diet to serve as the healthy control group. Two weeks after progesterone  
administration, Myelin content was assessed by Luxol-fast blue staining. The  
myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) expression were
assessed  
using Western blot analysis and the changes in the number of oligodendrocytes
and  
oligodendroglial progenitor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and  
flow cytometry.  
RESULTS: Luxol-fast blue staining revealed enhanced remyelination in the  
progesterone group when compared with the placebo group. Densitometry  
measurements of immunoblots demonstrated that MBP and PLP proteins contents
were  
significantly increased in the progesterone group compared with the placebo  
group. Flow cytometry and IHC analysis showed increases in Olig2 and O4 cells
in  
the progesterone group compared with the placebo group.  
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results indicate that progesterone treatment can  
stimulate myelin production and that it may provide a feasible and practical
way  
for remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of most common neurological disorders, mainly  
affecting women. The central nervous system (CNS) of this autoimmune disease
is  
characterized by intermittent or chronic damage to the myelin sheaths  
(demyelination), local inflammation and axonal degeneration. During the early  
relapsing/remitting stages of MS, myelin can regenerate. However, as the
disease  
progresses, both amount and activity of regenerated axons becomes
insufficient,  
leading to impaired axon conduction, neurodegeneration and the worsening  
symptoms. Epidemiological study found that distinct symptom alleviation of  
diseases at a certain periods would be shown in women during pregnancy. The  
following basic researches indicated that sex hormones especially progesterone  
can significantly reduce the disease severity, moreover, the protective effect
of  
sex hormone on the nervous system has become the research focus.

Finland.  
Similarly to many other autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) is more  
common among women than men, and its incidence among women is rising. There
are  
also qualitative differences in the disease course between men and women, with  
male patients experiencing increased disease progression, brain atrophy, and  
cognitive impairment. During pregnancy, women with MS typically have a greatly  
reduced relapse rate, whereas very soon after the delivery, the disease
activity  
returns, often even at a higher level than seen in the prepregnancy year. The  
reasons for the increased postpartum activity are not entirely clear, but
factors  
such as the abrupt decrease in estrogen levels immediately after the delivery
and  
the loss of the immunosuppressive state of pregnancy are likely of importance.  
There is compelling evidence that estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone  
control MS pathology by influencing immune responses and by contributing to  
repair mechanisms in the nervous system. Hormones may thus offer important  
insights into MS disease prevention and treatment. In this review, the
possible  
reasons for the sex bias in autoimmune diseases will be discussed. The  
pregnancy-related alterations in MS, including the effect of pregnancy on
disease  
activity, long-term disability accumulation, and prevalence will be reviewed,
as  
well as the hormonal and immunological mechanisms potentially underlying these  
changes. Finally, the present thinking on the effect of hormones on the
changing  
incidence of MS will be elucidated.

A TSPO ligand is protective in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.

**Local production of neurosteroids such as progesterone and allopregnanolone  
confers neuroprotection in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases.
**  
The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) performs a rate-limiting step in  
the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and its steroid derivatives.  
Previous studies have shown that TSPO is upregulated in microglia and
astroglia  
during neural inflammation, and radiolabelled TSPO ligands such as PK11195
have  
been used to image and localize injury in the CNS. Recent studies have shown
that  
modulating TSPO activity with pharmacological ligands such as etifoxine can  
initiate the production of neurosteroids locally in the injured CNS. In this  
study, we examined the effects of etifoxine, a clinically available anxiolytic  
drug, in the development and progression of mouse experimental autoimmune  
encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model for multiple sclerosis (MS).
Our  
results showed that etifoxine attenuated EAE severity when administered before  
the development of clinical signs and also improved symptomatic recovery when  
administered at the peak of the disease. In both cases, recovery was
correlated  
with diminished inflammatory pathology in the lumbar spinal cord. Modulation
of  
TSPO activity by etifoxine led to less peripheral immune cell infiltration of
the  
spinal cord, and increased oligodendroglial regeneration after inflammatory  
demyelination in EAE. Our results suggest that a TSPO ligand, e.g. etifoxine,  
could be a potential new therapeutic option for MS with benefits that could be  
comparable to the administration of systemic steroids but potentially avoiding  
the detrimental side effects of long-term direct use of steroids.

Our previous observations have shown that neuroactive steroid levels in the
brain  
are affected by acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with sex  
and regional specificity (Giatti et al. 2010). To better understand the effect
of  
EAE on neuroactive steroids, we have here assessed the levels of pregnenolone,  
progesterone and its derivatives (i.e. dihydroprogesterone,  
tetrahydroprogesterone and isopregnanolone), testosterone and its derivatives  
(dihydrotestosterone and 5alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol) in different
CNS  
regions of male and female rats affected by chronic EAE. Data obtained by
liquid  
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry revealed that chronic EAE results in
sex  
and regional specific alterations in the levels of neuroactive steroids in the  
brain, which are in many cases different to those produced by acute EAE. The  
specific changes in neuroactive steroid levels after chronic EAE may be of  
relevance to design new possible therapeutic strategies for the disease.

Interactions exist between progestins and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)  
receptor subtype A where C(21)-steroids function as activators. Other  
interactions between progesterone and neurotransmitter systems include  
stimulation of dopamine release in striatal tissue, stimulation of GnRH
release  
from hypothalamic neurons and inhibition of opioid receptor binding and  
activation. Cyproterone acetate increases dopaminergic responses and binds to  
opiate receptors independently of its classical effect on the androgen
receptor.  
Progesterone substitution in perimenopausal women promotes length and quality
of  
sleep. This effect seems most prominent for progesterone administered
vaginally.  
Progestins also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Migraine symptoms  
occur predominantly during the perimenstrual stage. Women who suffer from  
menstrual migraine triggered by premenstrual progesterone loss often benefit
from  
cyclic progesterone administration. This may be because progesterone and  
allopregnenolone reduce meningeal release of substance P and inhibit the  
development of neurogenic oedema. Women whose migraine symptoms subside during  
pregnancy, however, benefit from intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate.  
Progesterone, generated from pregnenolone by Schwann cells, also enhances
myelin  
synthesis. **Myelination of axons is promoted when progesterone is added to  
cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. ** No reliable data exist with respect to
the  
effects of other progestins on demyelinating disease. Progestins promote the  
growth of meningioma as progesterone receptors predominate in meningioma
tissue.  
Progesterone and synthetic progestins should therefore not be prescribed in
these  
patients.

I wonder what your thoughts are on HRV - heart rate variability. I'm curious
as I see it used in a lot of wearables and it is said to be a measure of heart
health.  
  
I wanted to read more about it. But reading to simple article on it, I am
discouraged to explore further the topic as it seems to be tied favorably to
the idea that the lower the heart rate, the more healthy.  
  
This article gave me that impression:  
  

###  [ What is heart rate variability? How to measure HRV and what it means

A higher HRV may indicate better physical fitness and resilience to stress,
while a lower HRV is associated with anxiety and cardiovascular mortality.

www.insider.com

  
"A higher resting heart rate — which is generally considered less healthy for
adults — leads to a lower heart rate variability. Research has suggested that
a lower HRV is associated with anxiety disorders and earlier death from
cardiovascular diseases."

Me:  
  
Hello Ray!  
  
I hope you can help me out there. I seem to recall you having said something
about the QT intervals as indicative of how responsive heart muscles are in
relaxing, and with that it can be used as a gauge for hypothyroidism.  
  
This lines up also with the behavior of the Achilles tendon as used in the
Achilles Tendon reflex test.  
  
While the Achilles tendon test requires one to observe the speed of the reflex
and make a qualitative judgment on thyroid status, I find having an ECG and
using the computed QTc value more easy to use to determine the thyroid state.  
  
I have been using 440 msec as my basis. If the value value is higher, one is
hypothyroid. Is this a correct cut-off value to use?  
  
Ray:  
  
I think it might be quite a bit shorter than 440 when thyroid level is best.

[Prescription [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-

A little peanut oil isn’t a serious problem, but if it contained silica or
titanium I wouldn’t use it. I don’t know whether they are using safe dyes. The
progesterone is good, but the other things help to give it a “product
identity."  
  
[2019]  
  
[Temperature 96.9 waking but rises to 98.3]  
  
I think that’s the effect of a mild hypothyroidism, in which the morning food
increases the conversion of T4 to T3. In more serious hypothyroidism, the
stress hormones can rise excessively during the night, raising the waking
temperature; in that situation, having carbohydrate in the morning lowers the
stress hormones, allowing the temperature to fall.  
  
[Taking 50 mcg of T3, plus T4]  
  
How long have you used that dose? Are you getting enough protein, vitamin D,
calcium?  
  
[...]  
  
T4 accumulates, building up over a period of weeks. Sunlight exposure can help
to increase the metabolic rate.  
  
[Sitting in CO2 bag / why feel good in Santa Fe / lidocaine]  
  
Adapting to altitude is probably better than the bag because of electrical air

I’ve known a couple of people with that diagnosis who were just poorly

[Particular biological problems or deficiencies for 'BPD']  
  
Vitamin D deficiency, various vitamin B deficiencies, hypothyroidism, and
poisoning from bad intestinal flora, especially when the diet contains
starches and raw vegetables. When the problem is nutritional or toxic,
increased thyroid dosing increases the stress hormones, instead of decreasing
them.

A small amount of testosterone either in olive oil or as powder seems fully

similarly effective, but with about 3 times the dose.

It’s what could happen if the proposed universal application of these

If a nucleic acid code for the viral spike protein becomes integrated into our

general health, a tendency toward increased inflammation, and an accelerated
rate of aging and the diseases of aging, such as circulatory disease, cancer,

[Land near Zacapu]  
  
The prospect of inflation makes land in Mexico, with its low taxes, seem very
desirable. If the area is very rainy, it might be possible to collect enough
water ( [ https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/371867
](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/371867) ), but I would want something
with a well or stream access, and water rights. The growing season is short at
7800 ft. There’s a lot of nice looking land around Zacapu, but something to
investigate, if the land has a well, is what the trend in the water table has
been—in Coeneo, the water level in the wells has fallen seriously in recent
years.  
  
[Collecting rainwater vs well]  
  
Big sheets of plastic to line cisterns aren’t very expensive. I made a
concrete tank, one meter deep, that’s about half above ground, that I intended
as a small swimming pool, and during the rainy season we pump some of the
water into the well, helping with the ground water. Plastic-lined ponds work
in some areas. Friends in Coeneo had a big house built in 1900, and they used
city water, but when the city’s pump failed, having thousands of gallons under
the patio was convenient.

[In one of the latest podcasts with Danny Roddy you mentioned some cultures

Mexico, which of the various "subcultures" do you consider best/most open? I
have thought it could be Michoacan, but I perceived it had a int of
conservatism in a way.]  
  
I was thinking of the Mixtecos of the Oaxaca-Veracruz area. The Tarascans of
Michoacan probably contributed to the conservatism there, very good at staying
independent by outwitting the Spaniards.  
  
[Dealing with grief of not having children]  
  
In small tribal villages, everyone functioned as family members, and the
“extended family” function persisted longer in agricultural societies, but has
disintegrated in recent times. The idea of wives and children as a man’s
property blended with the doctrine of “genes,” so that ownership and
inheritance of property/genes became a deep part of our culture’s ideology. I
think the sense of sharing, participating in, contributing to social life is
primary, and the sense of private ownership usually has harmful effects on the
people involved. Have you had tests recently for TSH and cholesterol?  
  
[Dental fillings]  
  
I think Sorel cement is the best filling material, but few dentists know about
it. Gold is safe in the presence of RF radiation.  
  
The zinc eugenol fillings are often used, and they can last a long time; I’ve
known several dentists who were willing to use them, but they call them
temporary.  
  
[Zinc eugenol fillings safer than ceramic or gold?]  
  
They are all very safe (especially the real baked ceramic used for inlays and
crowns).

If it doesn’t have a shiny glaze, it’s probably not a lead problem. I use
glass and a paper filter, but I’ve often though that a perforated ceramic or

before adding hot water, to avoid breaking down aromatic things before
extracting the caffeine.  
  
[Nickel in stainless steel coffee maker]  
  
The shiny, high nickel kind can when it’s new, but nearly all the mobile
nickel goes into the first ten batches.  
  
[Cookware]  
  
I normally use glass pans, Pyrex or Vision, but sometimes use the steel pans
without nickel. Although they darken a little when they age, they don’t rust.  
  
There are two main types of stainless steel, magnetic and nonmagnetic. The
nonmagnetic form has a very high nickel content, and nickel is allergenic and
carcinogenic. It is much more toxic than iron or aluminum. You can use a
little "refrigerator magnet" to test your pans. The magnet will stick firmly
to the safer type of pan  
  
I think the nickel content should be less than 2%; the magnetic pans are hard
to find (used stores sometimes have old ones), because people generally prefer
the slick high nickel type.

[I hope the way I'm posting this is clear. I'm putting a few separate
responses from Peat under the same subject header tag.  
  
[Large ovarian cyst]  
  
Everyone that I have known with ovarian cysts got them to break by taking a
large dose of [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-
micronized-powder-usp/) . If you have tried that without effect, than maybe
the surgery is necessary. Naloxone is another thing that sometimes corrects
ovarian cysts.  
  
Most often it was a single dose of about 100 mg.  
  
I’ve heard from women who didn’t have shrinkage with progesterone but did with
prolonged high thyroid supplementation. Fluid filled capsules anywhere in the
body respond to hypothyroidism by swelling, and they shrink in the presence of
increased thyroid hormone.  
  
Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1973 Jun 15;116(4):551-6.  
Preoperative hormonal therapy of cystic adnexal masses  
W J Spanos  
PIP: 286 patients between ages 16-48 with cystic adnexal masses were treated
with estrogen and progesterone for 6 weeks. Persistence of the adnexal mass
occurred in 81 patients and surgical exploration was done. All patients
explored with an ovarian enlargement had an ovarian neoplasm causing the
enlargement. There were 7 patients with normal sized ovaries but an associated
paraovarian cyst or unilateral hydrosalpinx was found. No patient was
subjected to surgical exploration with the finding of a physiologic cyst
causing the adnexal mass. In this series, suppression of the pituitary
gonadotropins for 6 weeks was long enough to cause all significant physiologic
cysts to regress. It would seem that menstruating women with a cystic adnexal
mass and a differential diagnosis that included a physiologic cyst should not
be subjected to operations without a trial of pituitary suppressions. Also,
the use of pituitary suppression with estrogen and progesterone removes
indecision as to how long a physiologic cyst will remain before undergoing
regression.  
  
[Healing emotional trauma from childhood]  
  
I think the lingering effects involve changes in the brain’s metabolism of
neurosteroids. Just saturating the system with the hormones has to be combined
with redirection of attention, until new habits of attention and brain
metabolism are formed. Ordinary authoritarian relationships, which are the
norm, make everyone forget what it felt like to just be a self, before
language and assigned identities existed. When relaxing after a very nice
meal, pleasant feelings pass through the torso. Getting into the habit of
looking for those feelings whenever you have a free moment, you can make them
occur more often; they represent part of self-possession. The state of the
brain models the state of those perceptions; the crucial neurosteroids that
let new patterns develop are [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) ,
progesterone, vitamin D, and (cautiously) a little [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) ; the
energy-supporting high calcium diet supports their metabolism. With practice,
this sense of well being and wholeness grows.  
  
[Things to try when not tolerating thyroid]  
  
Have you tried things to change your intestinal flora, such as antibiotics or

and reducing inflammation.  
  
[Erythromycin dose]  
  
People vary greatly in sensitivity, but I find that 250 mg once a day has a
strong effect on the bowel.  
  
[Carcinoid tumor diagnosis]  
  
It’s commonly associated with deficiency of vitamin D and niacin. Besides
watching thyroid function, blood CO2, and TSH, using acetazolamide might be
helpful if tumors are identified.

Combination of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, and sulforaphane,

(1)Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON,  
Canada. [ hermie@sickkids.ca ](mailto:hermie@sickkids.ca) .  
BACKGROUND: Bronchial carcinoids are pulmonary neuroendocrine cell-derived
tumors  
comprising typical (TC) and atypical (AC) malignant phenotypes. The 5-year  
survival rate in metastatic carcinoid, despite multiple current therapies, is  
14-25%. Hence, we are testing novel therapies that can affect the
proliferation  
and survival of bronchial carcinoids.  
METHODS: In vitro studies were used for the dose-response (AlamarBlue) effects
of  
acetazolamide (AZ) and sulforaphane (SFN) on clonogenicity, serotonin-induced  
growth effect and serotonin content (LC-MS) on H-727 (TC) and H-720 (AC)  
bronchial carcinoid cell lines and their derived NOD/SCID mice subcutaneous  
xenografts. Tumor ultra structure was studied by electron microscopy. Invasive  
fraction of the tumors was determined by matrigel invasion assay.  
Immunohistochemistry was conducted to study the effect of treatment(s) on  
proliferation (Ki67, phospho histone-H3) and neuroendocrine phenotype  
(chromogranin-A, tryptophan hydroxylase).  
RESULTS: Both compounds significantly reduced cell viability and colony
formation  
in a dose-dependent manner (0-80 μM, 48 hours and 7 days) in H-727 and H-720
cell  
lines. Treatment of H-727 and H-720 subcutaneous xenografts in NOD/SCID mice
with  
the combination of AZ + SFN for two weeks demonstrated highly significant
growth  
inhibition and reduction of 5-HT content and reduced the invasive capacity of  
H-727 tumor cells. In terms of the tumor ultra structure, a marked reduction
in  
secretory vesicles correlated with the decrease in 5-HT content.  
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of AZ and SFN was more effective than either
single  
agent. Since the effective doses are well within clinical range and  
bioavailability, our results suggest a potential new therapeutic strategy for
the  
treatment of bronchial carcinoids.  
  
[Worth using imagining and scope to verify carcinoid tumor presence?]  
  
No, I think good tests of 5-HIAA, serotonin, and platelets, while doing the
corrective things, is the right approach. Have you used ciproheptadine for
symptoms?  
  
[Doctors want to use MRI with gadolinium]  
  
The MRI technology was developed (in the 1970s, by Ray Damadian) specifically
because of its ability to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue without
using a contrast medium, because of the appearance of the cell water even if
the shape of the tissue hasn’t changed, but since the tumors they are looking
for form actual lumps, it doesn’t take any specialized MRI technique.

changes in T1, water, and electrolyte contents, TIS values of water protons
were  
significantly reduced in peritumoral edematous brain tissue when compared to  
those of the controls. **Results indicate that the water structure in brain
tissues  
may become altered at an early stage of edemic formation without causing any  
significant changes in cellular hydration. ** TIS might serve as a sensitive  
parameter for studying the water structure in a variety of tissues, such as in  
edematous brain tissue.

[T3 intolerance]  
  
I think it would help with your symptoms and hormone regulation if you raise
the vitamin D to 50 or 60 ng/ml. If you take the glandular thyroid in one
dose, it’s best around bedtime. Have you kept a record of its effects on your
pulse rate and temperature, especially before getting up in the morning? By
powdering the Cynomel, and dividing each tablet into about 20 pieces, each
dose will be just enough to be able to sense an effect, starting within
seconds, and then fading away in the next few hours. By checking your pulse
rate, you’ll be able to correlate the dose with changes in the fatigue and
waakness. If you space the doses by 3 or more hours, after several days you
should be able to see some slight but consistent changes in your pulse rate,
and when you do, whether it’s slower or faster, wait for it to be steady at
that rate for a few days before deciding to increase the dose. T3 and vitamin
D work closely together, and help to keep calcium out of soft tissues; that
lets them store up more energy, while reducing inflammation and anxiety.  
  
[Adult growth hormone deficiency / How to temporarily lower IGF-1]

Introduction: Vitamin D and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1
(GH/IGF-1) axis are reported to interplay at both endocrine and paracrine
levels, with a positive correlation between IGF-1 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25(OH)D) in healthy subjects. Hyposomatotropism is among the conditions
predisposing to lower vitamin D status due to several direct and indirect
mechanisms. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate vitamin D status in a
representative sample of adults with GH deficiency (GHD) and to investigate
the association between serum 25(OH)D and age, gender and onset of
hyposomatotropism.  
Methods: This cross-sectional study included 129 adults (aged 42.1±16.6 years,
70 males) diagnosed with GHD (41.9% with childhood-onset GHD (COGHD)) in the
Clinical Centre of Endocrinology in Sofia, Bulgaria. Total serum 25(OH)D was
the vitamin D metabolite used to assess vitamin D status and was measured by
electro-chemiluminescence binding assay. Vitamin D status and GHD were defined
according to the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline
recommendations.  
  
Results: Major part of the patients was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency
(79.1%, n=102) and another 14.7% (n=19) had vitamin D insufficiency. 25(OH)D
levels >30 ng/ml were found in only 6.2% (n=8) of the subjects. Mean 25(OH)D
levels (15.1±7.6 ng/ml) did not differ between men and women (15.7±7.2 vs.
14.5±8.1 ng/ml, P=0.387) and correlated negatively and weakly with age
(r=−0.256; P=0.003). In the AOGHD subgroup, however, mean serum 25(OH)D was
significantly lower compared with COGHD participants (14.0±7.2 vs.16.8±8.0
ng/ml, P=0.039).  
  
Conclusion: Data from our study demonstrated considerably high prevalence of
hypovitaminosis D in GHD adults, with lower 25(OH)D concentrations among the
subgroup with AOGHD. Therefore, 25(OH)D testing is highly recommended in
patients with hyposomatotropism. Normalization of vitamin D status might have
beneficial effects in GHD subjects, especially considering the additive
effects of vitamin D and GH replacement.

Cyclic [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-

increases. A couple of people have found that they could increase their

If your cortisol is steadily extremely low, then taking some with each bit of

[ [ Vitamin C ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) ]  
  
Yes, more than 20 years ago, I pointed out the amount of heavy metal  
contamination, and the frequent reactions I had seen, to Pauling, and he  
just said I should use Bronson's C, as if that would have been made with  
anything except Hoffman-LaRoche's stuff. (It was Pauling's own  
description of the manufacturing process for sulfuric acid, using a  
"lead room," that got me thinking about the dangers of things  
manufactured with it.) I guess ADM is making a large fraction of  
ascorbic acid now, so I wouldn't be surprised if some of it was worse  
than when the heavy metal studies were published several years ago.  
  
[Ray Peat's experiences and work with C]  
  
The alteration of production processes in vitamin E manufacture when the  
evil soybean monopoly bought the industry from Eastman Chemical is  
analogous to what happened earlier in the vitamin C industry, as profits  
were maximized. The dramatic vitamin C studies in the 1930s often used  
only 15 or 25 milligrams per day. In 1953, my first experience with it  
(which was still sold as "cevitamic acid")involved 50 mg per day, and  
over a period of just 2 or 3 days, my chronic awful poison oak allergy  
disappeared. Up until this time, it was still too expensive to sell in  
large doses. Around 1955 or '56, new manufacturing methods made it cheap  
(and, for some reason, the name changed from cevitamic to ascorbic) and  
the average tablet went up to 500 mg. The first time I tried the new  
form, around 1956, I developed allergy symptoms within a couple of days.  
Over the next 20 years, my own increased sensitivity to synthetic  
ascorbate led me to look for such reactions in others. The same  
people who reacted to it often reacted similarly to [ riboflavin
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b2-riboflavin-powder-usp-grade/)
and  
rutin, which were also made from cornstarch by oxidation. I ascribed the  
reaction to some industrial contaminant that they had in common,  
possibly the heavy metals introduced with the sulfuric acid. The heavy  
metal contamination of synthetic ascorbate is so great that one 500 mg  
tablet dissolved in a liter of water produces free radicals at a rate  
that would require a killing dose of x-rays to equal. The only clean and  
safe vitamin C now available is that in fresh fruits, meats, etc. The  
commercial stuff is seriously dangerous."

Humidity is likely to be a lot lower in Colorado. During the first few days at

[Schizophrenics]  
  
Those people were given a brief trial of pregnenolone by relatives,  
and weren't responsible for taking it themselves; they weren't in  
situations that would have supported the necessary changes, I think  
people with that diagnosis are just too hard to deal with. It's pretty  
standard to give thyroid to kids, Barnes was more perceptive than most  
doctors, and knew what to look for.  
  
I made some devices for exposing the legs or abdomen to about 100 red  
LEDS for use during the night, to avoid the annoying effect on the  
eyes. They were too bothersome to use regularly. 12 to 15 hours/day  
exposure to bright daylight or good incandescent light is enough  
therapeutically. The main issue currently with pregnenolone is the  
presence of trace allergenic impurities. I ate an average of about  
3000 mg/day for a year, then to economize, reduced it to about 500 mg  
for a few years, then the factory I was getting it from closed, and I  
was allergic to other brands. I don't recall describing relapses. Does

I've had a couple of friends who were classically manic-depressive. I  
watched the woman go through several of her annual cycles, a few weeks  
of suicidal depression, and a few of really psychotic mania, and saw  
that I could see them coming a few weeks in advance, with changes in  
her sleep cycle and temperature cycle. When the mania was coming on,  
her waking temperature would be higher than usual, and then by 10 or  
11 a.m. it would be much lower. I knew that was the pattern of high  
nocturnal cortisol, from hypothyroidism. Her cycles had been getting  
worse for 20 years, but when she used thyroid to normalize her  
temperature cycle, there were no more psychotic cycles, and there  
hasn't been a recurrence in over 20 years. I've known a few  
schizophrenics who began acting more normally immediately after taking  
pregnenolone or progesterone, but who relapsed when they stopped  
taking it; I think it would be necessary to change their diet and keep  
them supplemented with those, and thyroid, for a few weeks, to allow  
their nervous systems to repair themselves.

Yandell Henderson died in 1944, and V.I. Vernadsky died in 1945. With  
the accession of Truman to the US presidency, cultural and scientific  
progress has been operating in reverse. Here and there bits of  
knowledge have been created, but they drift in the sewage tsunami of Big
Science.  
  
My article on [ cascara ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/)
talked about the analogous effects of carbon  
dioxide, vitamin K, emodin, and the tetracyclines. Some of the  
experiments with Buckyballs show similar effects of a large resonant  
system, an electron-withdrawing effect that lowers inappropriate  
excitation and inflammation. A direct current flow through the body  
towards the oxidizing brain can be intensified or dulled by an  
external field.  
  
For rats, the alternative to an enriched environment has been living  
in a rat box, sort of the equivalent of a Tokyo apartment. Gardening,  
learning to play a musical instrument, sculpting and drawing, are  
good; practicing the marital arts, going to new places and taking  
different routes to old places, listening to an unfamiliar  
language--anything that involves participation and action or  
learning.  
  
Finding novelty and opportunity in a large context, rather than  
habitual, ritualized, or trivial activity. Stimulating conversation  
and spontaneous sex are good examples. Our (industrialized corporate)  
cultures are designed to exclude meaningful activity as far as  
possible. Music, theater, literature, research, adapting to a new  
culture, and political innovation are activities that can be  
meaningful.  
  
The brain is always organizing itself, and although some of the DC,  
AC, and magnetic stimulation effects are positive, I think they are  
also likely to have other harmful effects. Any stimulating radiation  
is a potentially disorganizing influence ( [ red light
](https://lifegivingstore.com/product-category/light-therapy/) has an  
antiexcitatory effect). I think supporting the brain's own organizing  
processes is the right approach to therapy. Neurosteroids stabilize  
nerves, and allow repair processes to proceed. Good nutrition, light,  
thyroid, etc., provide the energy. Meaningful activity is the other  
necessity.  
  
The southeastern states are remarkably unhealthy. In general the high  
altitude of Colorado and New Mexico is very good for health, but there  
are some areas with pollution from the military and mining, that  
should be investigated carefully before moving. When I'm in Bayard,  
NM, I feel very good, but I have never seen so many people carrying  
oxygen tanks anywhere else, probably former miners, but windstorms and  
forest fires can put a lot of bad stuff into the air.

Increasing the metabolic rate, thyroid can increase the need for

Question:  
  
I was thinking about what you said about futurity. I was trying  
to figure out the significance of consciousness to an environment or system.  
I was reading Bohm and thinking about consciousness in terms of implicate  
order. It almost seems like an energetic storage organ of that futurity.  
It's sort of like how carbohydrates are often stored as complex  
polysaccharides in plants. The internal complexity of a nervous system and  
consciousness "field" are sort of like a coiled spring for the larger  
system. It is not for the organism itself, I don't think.  
  
I also got an interesting conceptual image that tied what I was  
talking about previously to this. Looking at the universe through the  
"electric universe" theory, this field of ecological futurity would resonate  
nonlinearly throughout the universe. In essence, it might be the seed of  
life in other systems somehow. The extent to which life develops on our  
world could influence the development of life on another planet.  
  
Ray:  
  
I think that view of consciousness is right, that it's a  
resonance with cosmic fields. Metabolic conditions probably affect the  
degree to which we are tuned into it. "Every thing that lives Lives not  
alone, nor for itself," Blake's phrase in the Book of Thel, recognizes the  
connections. Ecological futurity is a very Blakean idea.  
  
Question:  
  
I have a problem with not seeing my ideas through to  
completion, so I figured I'd share with you the end product.  
  
I think that energy has suffered from a case of mistaken identity. I  
may need to reread your discussion of Kozyrev, but I believe that Time is  
the only form of energy in the cosmos. What we consider the traditional six  
types of energy are actually a different process. I believe that those are  
created when hysteresis collapses resonance into discreet bodies. The  
limiting factor of resonance would be the potential created by difference,  
whether that be ideas or strong ions. Hence why probably an increased  
metabolic rate (from chemical difference) would lead us to be more  
responsive to those cosmic fields. And also it would explain how the  
strength of our "ecological futurity" would determine the influence on life  
in other places. I believe that the strength of resonance determines the  
complexity of structure when collapsed by hysteresis.  
  
What do you think? I think that Blake would be proud. Or he may yell  
at me to get off his lawn, like he did when he yelled at that soldier and  
ended up in jail.  
  
Gravity and other forces comprise different qualities of  
hysteresis in discreet bodies. Hysteresis generates force through the  
collapse of resonant potentials into difference and thus tension. The  
production and conversation of substance causes tension, which results in  
the two bodies wanting to resolve that tension. Hence why gravity acts on  
each body's center of gravity (or area of least tension... or strongest  
tension in relation to the other). Gravity is the difference in that  
potential between those bodies. The reason why the force gets stronger is  
simply due to something like the inverse square law, which could apply to  
resonances and fields. The same goes for strong and weak nuclear force and  
magnetic force. Hysteresis in these cases has different qualities of  
directionality. Momentum or structural vectors from the history of the  
system.  
  
Ray:  
  
If a large number of bodies, each with its center of gravity, are  
falling toward each other, just as they are about to coalesce, where is  
their center of gravity? I.e., if we on the earth were about to fall into  
the sun, would our weight be the same as elsewhere? Measurements of gravity  
are so imprecise, I wonder if it's really known exactly where a center of  
gravity is.  
  
Question:  
  
Do you think that gravity as it is understood today is an  
adequate concept for explaining why we stick to the earth? I'm wondering if  
part of the problem of a unified field theory is that our premises are  
centuries old.  
  
Ray:  
  
Einstein was working with the junk that had accumulated in the  
19th century, and I think the main reason he treated it seriously was to  
show the German academicians what jerks they were. I don't think he realized  
that the reason the irrational quantum mechanics came into existence was  
largely because he had explained the photoelectric effect using a mistaken  
view of the solid state, atoms as purely localized stuff. With that, it was  
logical to see light as particulate.

5000 feet is helpful, higher is better. The low latitudes from  
Bolivia to Mexico have many comfortable little cities at good altitude. I  
have usually preferred places between 2000 and 2600 meters. Since the days  
warm up quickly at high altitude, the old houses were designed to retain the  
heat during the cold nights, by having thick adobe walls, about a meter

If you are eating enough protein, about 100 grams, and salt and

would be very low cholesterol, or a deficiency of vitamin A (retinol), or

If your cholesterol is above 200, and the thyroid supplements  
didn't warm you up, it's possible that something is interfering with your  
steroid synthesis, which might be a deficiency of something like vitamin A,  
or interference from something like iron or carotene. Have you tried a  
supplement of pregnenolone or DHEA? Were any other hormones, such as  
prolactin, measured? If you are taking the [ aspirin

I have noticed that when I'm most relaxed and at high altitude  
my oxygen saturation is in the range of 89% to 94%, lower with more  
relaxation. When I'm walking fast uphill, it is around 99% (I think that  
could mean that my fingers are consuming less). If my fingers are cold  
(i.e., not using much oxygen) the number is higher. If you pump blood  
through a cold corpse, the hemoglobin will stay 100% saturated."  
  
Changing bacteria can make a big difference, but I think  
cultural-psychological factors can cause effects like that. There have been  
times when I would have bad reactions to many foods in the US, and a day or  
two later in Mexico I would be able to eat anything. The familiar culture is  
full of inconspicuous signals that activate inflammatory-stress hormones,  
and a complete change of culture activates a different set of more adaptive  
hormones. I think the experimental analogy is the restraint stress syndrome  
in animals; if they can do something to counter the stress, they don't  
develop the inflammatory reactions. High thyroid activity is somewhat  
protective against the everyday restraint stressors."

I think the decrease of temperature after eating breakfast

I think reducing the stress hormones, partly by  
balancing the nutrients, is more important than the number of calories. With  
bone broth, it's the cartilage, ligaments and tendons that are helpful;  
marrow has a lot of iron, and it's good to limit the amount of iron and

Some people have told me that using fructose eliminated  
the fat from their liver; I think its reduction of phosphate might be  
involved in its protective effects, while supporting oxidative metabolism."

chains are so short that they are very stable. In Coeneo, we used to use
fallen branches as fuel in the water heater, but now there’s a plastic solar
water heater on the roof, that didn’t cost much. Solar electricity is a very

One of the reasons a lot of people give, if they have  
overcome the idea that milk forms mucous, or is a risk for diseases and so  
on; one of their arguments is that it makes them fat. But, all the research  
on animals, and as far as it goes, human research, shows that milk is  
probably the best reducing foods there is. The mechanisms for that are now  
known. Not only the anti-stress effects of casein, and a good balance of  
saturated fats and so on, but the calcium alone is very important metabolic  
regulator, that it happens to inhibit the fat-forming enzymes fatty acid  
synthase, and incidentally that's a characteristic enzyme that goes wild in  
cancer. But calcium and milk inhibit that fatty acid synthase, reducing the  
formation of fats and at the same time it activates the uncoupling proteins  
in the mitochondria, which are associated with increased longevity. Because  
they, by increasing the metabolic rate, the uncoupling proteins burn  
calories faster but they protect against free-radical oxidation. That they  
pull the fuel through the oxidation process so fast in effect, that none of  
it goes astray in random oxidation, where if you inhibit your energy  
producing enzymes you tend to get random, stray oxidation that damage the  
mitochondria. So the uncoupling proteins burn calories faster, at the same  
time that your reducing fat synthesis and milk is, as far as I know, they  
only food does both of those things simultaneously.  
  
There's almost no context in which I would speak of  
"an appropriate dose of T4," since thyroxin is so effective as an  
antithyroid substance. It's appropriate if you are also taking T3, or if you  
want to shrink your thyroid.  
  
Thyroid will dependably correct your [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/)  
production, if you have enough cholesterol, vitamin A, and protein. The  
cholesterol will be consumed to make pregnenolone and [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) and bile  
acids. If cholesterol is below 160, fruit sugar helps to raise it. The  
protein is needed to detoxify estrogen, unsaturated oils, etc, and to  
maintain the T3. Protein deficiency gives antithyroid signals, and T4  
will be used to make reverse T3 to inhibit T3's effects.  
About 3 mcg of T3 especially if it's taken with milk  
or gelatine-rich salty soup is effective for stopping the nocturnal alarm
reaction.  
  
The first couple of years that I took pregnenolone, I  
suppose I ate more than a kilogram of it, but when I realized how much it  
was costing, I found the minimum that's effective, which is very similar on  
a weight basis for rats and humans; about 30 mg per day is the adequate  
normal maintenance dose, but it can generally be taken spaced as much as ten  
days apart, 200 mg per 7 days, 300 mg per ten days. A rat given thousands of  
milligrams in a single dose shows no side effects, except a loss of appetite  
while its stomach is full of the powder.  
  
Diuresis is an effect of thyroid, pregnenolone and  
progesterone, as antagonists to estrogenic edema. The alarm reaction that  
happens at night has its effects in every organ; for the brain, it's similar  
to epilepsy; for the intestine and bladder, the effect can be either  
adrenergic or cholinergic, ie, too little or too much muscle tone; the blood  
becomes more concentrated. The bowel reaction causes absorption of  
endotoxin, which is a broad-spectrum poison; carrot salad, laxatives, etc.,  
are especially important during the adjustment time.  
Cholesterol has a long history as a protectant  
against many toxins; I think this relates to the fact that people with very  
low cholesterol have such a high incidence of endotoxin-related symptoms. It  
might also relate to the therapeutic effects of eggnogs, though it takes a  
lot of eggs to raise the cholesterol a little.  
  
Blue eyes don't filter out as much U.V. and blue light, so people who work
outside for years are more susceptible to light damage if their eyes aren't
pigmented. Prostaglandins and probably heavy metals can cause pigment to
increase with aging; generally, melanin is protective against free radical
damage, so the continued light color suggests that you haven't been
overexposed to some of the irritants.  
  
Yes, I bought a place in Coeneo, Michoacan, several years ago, and have been
fixing it up for that sort of thing. Things have been happening that have kept
me in Oregon longer than I planned. The idea of Blake College was similar in
many ways to Ivan Illich's CIDOC in Cuernavaca at the same time, and although
there might be some classes, they aren't the basic idea--"retreat," with
criticism and unplanned events, might be a better description of what I have
in mind.

In physiology lab, my partner had to adjust the millivoltmeter, because when I
put my hand near it, the indicator pegged at the top of the scale. When the
professor was demonstrating the force of a grasshopper's leg, students rested
their fingers on its foot, and the professor activated the electrical
stimulator, and it would raise their finger. He did it with all the other
students, and then turned away, lecturing, when I moved up to try it (he
didn't like my attitude). When I touched my finger to the grasshopper's foot,
it extended its leg, and held it, until I broke the contact; I repeated it a
few times, and students started watching what I was doing; I stopped when he
turned around to glare at me. I knew a woman who worked at the Exploratorium
in San Francisco, and she wanted to show me around after hours. The cloud
chamber for demonstrating cosmic rays was turned off, and she plugged it in.
After a minute, a mist began forming in it (lines of droplets formed by the
cosmic rays passing through), so I stepped forward to get a closer look. As I
moved, the mist disappeared in a cylinder in the center of the case, so I
stepped back, and the clear area retreated with me; we looked at each other,
and I stepped up again, and the clear area advanced, as if it was attached to
my body; it did it a couple of times, and then the cloud stabilized, and
wasn't affected by my presence. It seemed to represent a field that extended
about two feet from my torso. I think similar things aren't very rare, but
people prefer to treat them as imaginary. I recently saw an Italian film,
Agata and the storm, about a woman who made electrical things malfunction.

I'm now getting at least half of my calories as sugar, and it would be more if
the fruits were available. A few years ago, more than half my calories were
from fat--butter, coconut oil, cream, beef and lamb. Because of the ~2% pufa
in those fats, I decreased them, in favor of sugars. to deplete myself of the
pufa as far as practicable. I considered hydrogenated coconut oil, but haven't
found a reliable source without additives. In the US, I haven't found any
commercial skimmed-milk cheese that doesn't have serious problems, such as
using aspergillus enzymes or other additives that bother me. I'm having liver
and shellfish about once a week, much less meat generally. Did you read about
William R. Brown's experiences with the fat-free diet?  
  
Yes, 0% pufa is the goal. Bacterial endotoxin is probably fairly harmless when
there's no pufa.

It takes at least two weeks for a given dose of T4 to reach a steady  
concentration in the body, apart from the hormonal-metabolic changes  
that it will cause, so I think you probably increased the dose too  
quickly. The half-life of T3 is much shorter, so by using doses of  
less than 5 mcg at a time, it's possible to increase your liver's  
glycogen storage and your other tissues' sensitivity to adrenergic  
stimulation, without accumulating any excess T4. During that time,  
having orange juice or other sweet fruit frequently, avoiding eating  
protein by itself, will help to lower the stress hormones.  
  
It usually takes me just a few days of eating extremely large amounts of sugar
(milkshakes, marshmallows, ice cream, etc.) to replenish my stores. Sugar
stops tasting especially good when I have had enough, and my pulse pressure,
the difference between top and bottom blood pressure numbers, falls well below
50 points.  
Normally, I usually have around 400 grams of carbohydrate. I have about 3
quarts of milk, varying amounts of orange juice (probably over a quart on
average), eggs, and about 200 grams of meat or fish, with other things such as
coca cola, cheese, ice cream, cheese cakes, some coconut oil and butter,
occasional tropical fruits.  
  
Lately I have been using mainly water based paints, as a result of the
scarcity of turpentine, which I had previously used with oil paints. About ten
years ago I got a can with the familiar "pure gum spirits of turpentine"
label, that contained mineral spirits. I tried three other brands that turned
out to be variations on gasoline. The main turpentine stills in the US closed
several years ago. Your mention of someone in Mexico reminded me that I had
read that it's still being produced there--where does that person live? If
it's possible to locate a store in Mexico that sells it, they might be willing
to send a bottle of it to my place in Mexico.  
  
Knowledge isn’t a commodity, especially not a fungible commodity, as the
medical business sees it. Consciousness and culture are part of the life
process. It is exactly the commoditization of medical knowledge that makes it
dangerous, and generally stupid. Doctors buy their knowledge, and then resell
it over and over; it’s valuable as a commodity, so its value has to be
protected by the equivalent of a copyright, the system of laws establishing
the profession. Without its special status, its worthlessness would be quickly
demonstrated. When A.C. Guyton wrote his textbook of medical physiology (the
most widely used text in the world) in the 1950s, it was trash; as it was
studied and applied by generations of physicians, it was still trash. The most
compliant patients who bought their treatment from the most authoritative,
Guytonesque, doctors were buying their own disability and death.  
Each time you learn something, your consciousness becomes something different,
and the questions you ask will be different; you don’t know what the next
appropriate question will be when you haven’t assimilated the earlier answers.
Until you see something as the answer to an urgent question, you can’t see
that it has any value. The unexpected can’t be a commodity. When people buy
professional knowledge they get what they pay for, a commodity in a system
that sustains ignorance.  
  
[Do you personally enjoy being in Mexico more so than in Eugene?]  
  
Yes, anyplace in Mexico above 5000 feet altitude is very good--I always have a
sense of euphoria in Mexico, seldom in the US. Even with the effects of
television on the culture, people still have more of a sense of what's real.

Once when I was sick in Mexico my landlady gave me some unfamiliar pills, and
as soon as I recovered I  
had an intense craving for sour things, that I had never experienced  
before or since; I suspected the drug might have caused some deficiency.  
For a few days I squeezed lemon onto everything, and even ate them  
plain, with pleasure. Then suddenly, the craving stopped. Animal studies  
show that there are chemically appropriate cravings, but they are  
guided by categories of nutrients that naturally occur together in  
foods. Certain amino acids are detected as signals for protein, but  
others aren't, and I think certain B vitamins work as signals. When I  
suggested to a girl friend that salt craving was rational, she began  
salting her food according to her premenstrual appetite for it, and  
stopped having her regular premenstrual swelling. It has worked for  
nearly everyone--I suspect that the few people who say it doesn't work  
don't know what cravings are. Some people are very mechanical about  
food, and think there should be something like medical instructions for  
everything they do.  
  
Before I discovered that I couldn't tolerate starches, and was having fairly
copious bowel bleeding, I experimented by taking some sips of 2% dental
lidocaine gel, and within a few minutes felt general relief, and didn't have
any more bleeding for a long time (until Breyer's added gums to their ice
cream).  
  
The antiinflammatories and local anesthetics themselves have some antiviral
effects-- [ aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-
aspirin/) , Benadryl, procaine, lidocaine, belladonna, [ cascara
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/) , etc. Have you tried
topical Lanacaine or TigerBalm?  
  
[Bowel inflammation]  
  
I had similar problems, had to eliminate practically all foods, then gradually
found ways to increase my tolerance for some of them. Thyroid, [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) ,
lidocaine, sugar, [ DHEA
](https://suchlabs.com/product/dhea_dehydroepiandrosterone_powder_usp/) ,
atropine, [ pregnenolone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-
micronized-powder/) , bamboo, cyproheptadine, cascara, flowers of sulfur or
sodium thiosulfate, penicillin, aspirin, vitamin D, etc".  
  
The basic problem of intestinal inflammation leads to bleeding in response to
the extra irritation of certain foods. I have known people whose bleeding was
stopped by thyroid alone; in my own experience, a small amount of 2% lidocaine
solution, swallowed once, ended bleeding that had been occurring every day.

Comparative analysis of the CSF and blood protein-peptide composition in  
Parkinsonian patients performed with the aid of indwelled electrodes prior to
and after therapeutic electrical stimulation (TES) of the brain subcortical  
structures, revealed a therapeutic effect in the form of reduced muscular  
rigidity and a mental activation with a positive emotional response. After
theTES the protein content in the biological fluids tended to become
normalized and the the range of low-molecular protein-peptide fractions
changed. A high-performance liquid chromatography, bidimensional
electrophoresis and thin-layer chromatography revealed about 5-6 factors of
peptide nature with the molecular mass less than 5000 daltons in the CSF and
blood after the TES. These factors were shown to exert a biological effect
upon muscle preparation of the leech."

When I get sour oranges I make marmalade from the peels, if they are organic.
Shred, soak, cook slowly simmering in water for about an hour before adding
sugar, and letting that simmer without boiling until it thickens a little.
When it’s cool it thickens more. The peels are rich in antiinflammatory
chemicals [naringin and naringenin], more than the juice, and the marmalade is
a good way to get sugar with the cottage cheese or parmesan.  
  
That looks like the old fashioned electric range, that’s very safe. We noticed
that when we turned on a new induction burner, our cat looked worried, and
wouldn’t get near it; I think they put out a much larger field than the
standard old resistance element.  
  
Like Paris in 1870, democracy or socialism tends to fail when all the
surrounding countries invade. The USSR survived despite being invaded by the
US, Canada, British Empire, Estonia, Poland, France, Australia, Italy, Greece,
Serbia, Czechoslovakia, and Japan. Cuba survived for several decades despite
invasion, embargo, and sabotage. Venezuela survived the coup and subsequent
attempts, and now is embargoed like North Korea, cutting off much of its
trade. It didn’t have socialism, but it wanted to charge royalties on the oil
that was taken, the way Mexico did. The Spanish Republic was murdered by
Hitler with the support of France, England, and the US.  
  
It isn’t a matter of perspective, it’s a matter of mental clarity and the
knowledge of how things work, and why. The system of corporations isn’t
separable from the government that enforces its established institutions;
courts, police, and military serve the system, not individuals. Nelson
Rockefeller said he understood Marx's principles as well as anyone, but he
applied them for his own benefit. People usually talk about Marx and Lenin
without having read them, which is like religious kids talking familiarly
about the devil—they have heard that he’s bad.

**Question:**  
In clinical trials (stage I & II) for treating traumatic brain injury [
progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-
usp/) was effective but in stage III the dose was increased from 1 or
2mg/kg/day intravenously to 12mg/kg/day and it had no effect compared to the
placebo. It was proposed in several papers that progesterone may have a
U-shaped dose response curve which would perhaps explain these results. I
wonder if the high dose might be depleting brain glycogen but I have trouble
believing that this alone would eliminate _all_ protective effect.  
  
If you are familiar with these trials do you have any idea why a larger dose
or some other procedural factor might have eliminated the progesterone's
neuroprotective effects?  
Are you aware of any evidence of a U-shaped dose response curve for
progesterone?

**Ray Peat:**  
Although the history of phase III studies might suggest that someone doesn’t
intend for them to succeed, what’s clear is that ignorance increased the
likelihood of failure in the progesterone study. Soybean oil is brain toxic,
and it’s not an adequate solvent for progesterone, so much of the progesterone
was probably trapped in the spleen, failing to protect the brain from the
toxic effect of the fatty acids. Oral progesterone lowers nitric oxide and
prostaglandins, protects against histamine and serotonin, and reduces the
formation of free fatty acids. Dissolved in vitamin E, it’s taken up from the
intestine in chylomicrons, and safely made available to the brain, and the
vitamin E and progesterone both protect the brain by inhibiting nitric oxide
and heme oxygenase (source of carbon monoxide and free iron). The protective
effects increase with dose; extremely high doses produce anesthesia, which
wouldn’t be a problem for traumatic brain injury patients, but starting with
about 50 mg at a time a person can adjust the dose according to how they feel.

The effects of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF), α-tocopherol (T) and
α-tocopheryl  
acetate (TA) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in
mouse  
peritoneal macrophages were examined. Results showed that at 5-30 μg/ml, all
test  
compounds plus 1 μg/ml LPS exhibited no cytotoxic effects on macrophage cells.  
Compared with T and TA, TRF showed the strongest anti-inflammatory activity as  
demonstrated by its potency in inhibiting the LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO),  
prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β  
and IL-6) production. At 10 μg/ml, it significantly blocked the LPS induction
of  
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
expression,  
but has no effect on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Furthermore, TRF also showed a  
greater inhibition on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expression than T and  
TA. These results suggest that TRF could be a better agent than T and TA for
use  
in the prevention of chronic inflammatory diseases.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-catalyzed synthesis of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2))
plays  
a key role in inflammation and its associated diseases, such as cancer and  
vascular heart disease. Here we report that gamma-tocopherol (gammaT) reduced  
PGE(2) synthesis in both lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7
macrophages  
and IL-1beta-treated A549 human epithelial cells with an apparent IC(50) of
7.5  
and 4 microM, respectively. The major metabolite of dietary gammaT,  
2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(beta-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman (gamma-CEHC), also  
exhibited an inhibitory effect, with an IC(50) of approximately 30 microM in  
these cells. In contrast, alpha-tocopherol at 50 microM slightly reduced (25%)  
PGE(2) formation in macrophages, but had no effect in epithelial cells. The  
inhibitory effects of gammaT and gamma-CEHC stemmed from their inhibition of  
COX-2 activity, rather than affecting protein expression or substrate  
availability, and appeared to be independent of antioxidant activity. gamma-
CEHC  
also inhibited PGE(2) synthesis when exposed for 1 h to COX-2-preinduced cells  
followed by the addition of arachidonic acid (AA), whereas under similar  
conditions, gammaT required an 8- to 24-h incubation period to cause the  
inhibition. The inhibitory potency of gammaT and gamma-CEHC was diminished by
an  
increase in AA concentration, suggesting that they might compete with AA at
the  
active site of COX-2. We also observed a moderate reduction of nitrite  
accumulation and suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression by  
gammaT in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages. These findings indicate that  
gammaT and its major metabolite possess anti-inflammatory activity and that  
gammaT at physiological concentrations may be important in human disease  
prevention.

To investigate the putative role of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) in inducing  
oxidative stress damage in Alzheimer disease (AD), we studied the effects of  
proinflammatory cytokines and A beta peptide on the induction of inducible
nitric  
oxide synthase (iNOS). A beta(25-35) upregulated the cytokine (TNF-alpha/IL-1  
beta)-induced expression of iNOS and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in  
astrocytes, which were inhibited by vitamin E. A beta treatment of C6 glial
cells  
(together with LPS and IFN-gamma), in addition to inducing iNOS, enhanced the  
oxidative stress as measured by increased expression of manganese superoxide  
dismutase and an increase in 2,7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence.
We  
also observed that LPS, IFN-gamma, and A beta(25-35) treatment led to the  
activation of the sphingomyelin-ceramide (SM-Cer) cascade with an increase in  
cellular ceramide. Inhibition of the SM-Cer cascade either by vitamin E
treatment  
or by the neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor 3-O-methyl sphingomyelin also  
resulted in alteration of the transcriptional binding activities of C/EBP,  
NFkappaB, AP-1, and CREB in C6 glial cells. Hence, these findings suggest a
role  
for ceramide in iNOS induction and NO production in Abeta-induced AD
pathobiology  
and provide a possible explanation for the beneficial effects of vitamin E  
therapy.

We have previously demonstrated that acute arginine administration induces  
oxidative stress and compromises energy metabolism in rat hippocampus. In the  
present study, we initially investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular  
infusion of arginine (0.1, 0.5 and 1.5 mM solution) on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase
activity  
and on some parameters of oxidative stress, namely thiobarbituric acid-
reactive  
substances (TBA-RS) and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) in  
the hippocampus of rats. Results showed that 1.5 mM arginine solution  
significantly increases TBA-RS and reduces Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity and TRAP
in  
the rat hippocampus. We also evaluated the influence of the nitric oxide
synthase  
inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and antioxidants,  
namely alpha-tocopherol plus [ ascorbic acid
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/) , on the
effects elicited by arginine  
on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, TBA-RS and TRAP. Results showed that treatment  
with alpha-tocopherol plus ascorbic acid per se did not alter these parameters  
but prevented these effects. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of  
L-NAME prevented the inhibition caused by arginine on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase
activity,  
as well as the increased of TBA-RS. Our findings indicate that  
intracerebroventricular infusion of arginine induces oxidative stress in rat  
hippocampus and that the inhibition of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity caused by
this  
amino acid was probably mediated by NO and/or its derivatives ONOO(-) and/or  
other free radicals. Finally, we suggest that the administration of
antioxidants  
should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to specific diets in  
hyperargininemia.

(10 h) of D-GalN-induced cell death in cultured hepatocytes. Cell death,  
oxidative stress, alpha-tocopherol metabolism, and NF-kappaB-, pregnane X  
receptor (PXR)-, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  
(PPAR-alpha)-associated gene regulation were estimated in the hepatocytes.
D-GalN  
increased cell death and alpha-tocopherol metabolism. alpha-Tocopherol exerted
a  
moderate beneficial effect against apoptosis and necrosis induced by D-GalN.  
Induction (rifampicin) or inhibition (ketoconazole) of alpha-tocopherol  
metabolism and overexpression of PXR showed that the increase in PXR-related  
CYP3A4 expression caused by alpha-tocopherol enhanced cell death in
hepatocytes.  
Nevertheless, the reduction in NF-kappaB activation and inducible nitric oxide  
synthase expression and the enhancement of PPAR-alpha and carnitine palmitoyl  
transferase gene expression by alpha-tocopherol may be relevant for cell  
survival. In conclusion, the cytoprotective properties of alpha-tocopherol are  
mostly related to gene regulation rather than to antioxidant activity in  
toxin-induced cell death in hepatocytes.

BACKGROUND: Changes in immune function believed to contribute to a variety of  
age-related diseases have been associated with increased production of nitric  
oxide (NO). We have recently reported that proteasome inhibitors
(dexamethasone,  
mevinolin, quercetin, δ-tocotrienol, and [ riboflavin
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-b2-riboflavin-powder-usp-grade/) )
can inhibit  
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in vitro by RAW 264.7 cells and
by  
thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages derived from four strains of
mice  
(C57BL/6, BALB/c, LMP7/MECL-1(-/-) and PPAR-α(-/-) knockout mice). The present  
study was carried out in order to further explore the potential effects of
diet  
supplementation with naturally-occurring inhibitors (δ-tocotrienol and
quercetin)  
on LPS-stimulated production of NO, TNF-α, and other pro-inflammatory
cytokines  
involved in the ageing process. Young (4-week-old) and senescent mice (42-week  
old) were fed control diet with or without quercetin (100 ppm), δ-tocotrienol  
(100 ppm), or dexamethasone (10 ppm; included as positive control for
suppression  
of inflammation) for 4 weeks. At the end of feeding period,  
thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected, stimulated with  
LPS, LPS plus interferon-β (IFN-β), or LPS plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and  
inflammatory responses assessed as measured by production of NO and TNF-α,
mRNA  
reduction for TNF-α, and iNOS genes, and microarray analysis.  
RESULTS: Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages prepared after four
weeks  
of feeding, and then challenged with LPS (10 ng or 100 ng) resulted in
increases  
of 55% and 73%, respectively in the production of NO of 46-week-old compared
to  
8-week-old mice fed control diet alone (respective control groups), without  
affecting the secretion of TNF-α among these two groups. However, macrophages  
obtained after feeding with quercetin, δ-tocotrienol, and dexamethasone  
significantly inhibited (30% to 60%; P < 0.02) the LPS-stimulated NO
production,  
compared to respective control groups. There was a 2-fold increase in the  
production of NO, when LPS-stimulated macrophages of quercetin, δ-tocotrienol,
or  
dexamethasone were also treated with IFN-β or IFN-γ compared to respective  
control groups. We also demonstrated that NO levels and iNOS mRNA expression  
levels were significantly higher in LPS-stimulated macrophages from senescent  
(0.69 vs 0.41; P < 0.05), compared to young mice. In contrast, age did not
appear  
to impact levels of TNF-α protein or mRNA expression levels (0.38 vs 0.35) in  
LPS-stimulated macrophages. The histological analyses of livers of control
groups  
showed lesions of peliosis and microvesicular steatosis, and treated groups  
showed Councilman body, and small or large lymphoplasmacytic clusters.  
CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrated that quercetin and
δ-tocotrienols  
inhibit the LPS-induced NO production in vivo. The microarray DNA analyses,  
followed by pathway analyses indicated that quercetin or δ-tocotrienol inhibit  
several LPS-induced expression of several ageing and pro-inflammatory genes  
(IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, iNOS, VCAM1, ICAM1, COX2, IL-1RA, TRAF1 and  
CD40). The NF-κB pathway regulates the production of NO and inhibits the  
pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in normal and ageing process. These ex
vivo  
results confirmed the earlier in vitro findings. The present findings of  
inhibition of NO production by quercetin and δ-tocotrienol may be of clinical  
significance treating several inflammatory diseases, including ageing process.

Do you have any thoughts on the safety of pyrantel pamoate as an anthelminthic
in humans?  
  
**Ray Peat:**  
It seems to be safe.

Q:  
What would be your approach with using supplemental [ progesterone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-micronized-powder-usp/) if you
were a newly pregnant female?  
  
**Ray:**  
It’s necessary to know the general situation, including the balance of
nutrients in the diet, the metabolic rate, temperature, pulse rate, body
weight, age. and menstrual cycle history.  
  
Q:  
Would it be a matter of using more the worse the individual situation is?  
Would I be right in thinking that the dose should gradually increase during
the pregnancy? I.e; starting with one drop per day, and adding a drop every
month?  
**  
Ray: **  
Katharina Dalton sometimes gave the same amount all the way through pregnancy,
but sometimes it’s no longer needed when the placenta makes enough. The
nutritional discoveries of Tom Brewer, Jay Hodin and others support
progesterone production. Thyroid hormone makes the use of progesterone easier.  
  
\---  
  
Q:  
I’ve recently moved to a rural area, with lots of sheep and cattle. I’m sure
I’d be able to access fresh thyroid glands here. This morning I’ve been
thinking about the idea of making my own [ NDT
](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/grass-fed-beef-thyroid-natural-desiccated-
thyroid-ndt/) as a fun experiment. Just googling on how that could be done
I’ve found instructions like this;  
  
“Remove the fat and connective tissue directly the sheep is killed. Reject
cystic, hypertrophied or otherwise abnormal glands. Mince. Dry at 90° to 100°
F. 32.2° to 37.7° C.. Powder the dried product. Remove all fat by washing with
petroleum spirit and again dry.”  
  
  
Do you know much about how it could be done at home?  
  
**Ray:**  
Medical grade acetone is good for the defatting. They stay greasy if the fat
isn’t all removed, but that’s o.k. if they are frozen. Much of the fat can be
removed by cooking them, then they can be powdered.  
  
\---  
  
Q:  
Do you have an idea of what percentage of absorption there is when applying
steroids dissolved in vitamin-e on the lips?  
  
**Ray:**  
It’s much higher than on the skin, probably around 50%, but usually it
migrates into the mouth, with close to 100% absorption.  
  
\---  
  
Q:  
Have you had any progress on finding a decent quality [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) ? Do you think
if someone had a bunch of money, they could approach a manufacturer somewhere
and they could figure out how to produce a very clean product?  
  
**Ray:**  
I think the surest thing would be to arrange contract production by one of the
giant steroid producers—preferably the one that took over Syntec’s product. It
would probably be more expensive than getting it from the places that produce
it as the end product. They might still be using the same technology from the
crude saponin to pregnenolone. New, more efficient technologies that are more
profitable sometimes produce radically different products, for example [
ascorbic acid ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/vitamin-c-quali-c-by-dsm/)
after 1955 and vitamin E after the 1990s.  
  
\---  
  
Q:  
Do you know of an online source of trustable quality progesterone powder? I am
wanting to make my own higher concentration mixtures to make topical use more
practical.  
  
**Ray:**  
I think the easily accessible sources currently are coming from manufacturers
who don’t have a long history of good quality. I stopped using pregnenolone
when Berlichem in Mexico stopped selling it, because the material from other
companies gave me allergic reactions, and I think there might be similar
problems with progesterone from new factories.

The functions of tianeptine overlap with Periactin (notice the shapes of the
molecules), [ cascara ](https://lifegivingstore.com/store/cascara-sagrada/)
(emodin), vitamin K, and tetracycline, but the sulfur atom in tianeptine can
make it allergenic for some people. I think combinations of safe things,
including coffee, thyroid, [ pregnenolone
](https://suchlabs.com/product/pregnenolone-micronized-powder/) , and [
aspirin ](https://suchlabs.com/product/salicylic-acid-usp-grade-aspirin/) ,
can work better than tianeptine.  
  
I've been getting it from Farmacia del Nino, but Cynoplus is good too.  
Many people don't need a supplement, especially during the summer, so it  
would just be a wasteful nuisance to use it when it's not needed.  
  
I think you're right to be cautious with experiments during the hot  
season. I think the appropriate doses of methylene blue and  
cyproheptadine are similar to those of T3, a few micrograms, rather than  
milligrams.  
  
Soprano recorders are inexpensive (and fit the hands better than the more
expensive, mellower altos), and are convenient for sporadic playing. Playing
tunes stimulates the brain in some of the same ways that speaking does, but
without the pressure; for example, people who stutter when they speak usually
don't when they sing. The good thing about recorders is that they are
convenient, so you can play a little whenever you feel like it, while doing
other things. When I was a kid I played violin for a while, but gradually
realized that my neck was much too long, and my little finger too weak and
slow, for that instrument. In high school I played trumpet, mostly because it
was the cheapest instrument, but eventually I bought an old french horn for
$25, and an oboe, and in Paracho, Michoacan, ten years ago I finally got a
cello--that had always been my favorite instrument. Every time you make sounds
on a musical instrument, you are stimulating organized processes in your body
--it's a kind of nourishment.  
  
[Methylene blue]  
  
It works as a catalyst for energy production, and I think it can be very
effective even in small doses analogous to the effects of thyroid hormone. I
suspect that one milligram continues to have good effects for about a week.  
  
Activated charcoal can absorb many toxins, including bacterial endotoxin, so
it is likely to reduce serotonin absorption from the intestine. Since it can
also bind or destroy vitamins, it should be used only intermittently. Frolkis,
et al. (1989, 1984) found that it extended median and average lifespan of
rats, beginning in old age (28 months) by 43% and 34%, respectively, when
given in large quantities (equivalent to about a cup per day for humans) for
ten days of each month.  
  
Aging, stress, and heavy consumption of alcohol increase the permeability of
the intestine, causing increased absorption of microbial toxins. Laxatives,
carrot fiber (not carrotjuice), activated charcoal, and a small amount of
sodium thiosulfate decrease the formation and absorption of toxins, increasing
the organism’s adaptive capacity  
  
If a newly discovered substance had aspirin’s antiinfective, anticancer,
antistress, antioxidant and antiinflammatory actions it would be the most
researched substance in history.  
  
The carbon monoxide isn’t likely to be absorbed in dangerous amounts if the
smoke isn’t inhaled. I think the safest way to use tobacco is either
transdermally or orally; it has a laxative and anti-inflammatory effect.  
  
[Nasal snuff]  
  
When I was a kid it was very popular; I think the effect is the same as oral-
swallowed, only quicker, with efficient nicotine absorption.

Question:  
  
How does this non-verbal experience of the surrounding environment relate to
the state you´re in when on LSD? I had a few experiences with LSD and theyve
all been extremely different. Yesterday i took 150 mcg and had the most
intense disconnection from the common received reality. I think the trip was
that intense because i totally dropped into the feeling of the drug.The
perception for time and space totally dissolved and i found myself in a non-
functional state in which i totally lost touch to any layers of meaning;
especially language. It would take too long to describe everything that
happened, but i´m trying to put my experience into context and understand what
happened. I read that you think that the hallucinations are due to depletion
of brain glycogen and that it could be harmful. I don´t feel like i was
hallucinating (depending on how you define it), but it felt like i was able to
access more layers of reality. For example i could see, smell and feel much
better. At the same time at a certain point of the trip i stopped being able
to put all the sensory input into a broader context. It felt like it was a
state before any judgment of meaning based on cultural influences is made. I
perceived things as they were but they didn´t relate to each other. I´m
wondering what your “behind closed doors” opinion and experience with LSD is.
What exactly is happening in the brain when taking larger dosages of LSD? How
does LSD work on a molecular level? How does the state of the organism
influence its effect? Do you think these effects are other layers of reality
or just the effect of brain glycogen depletion?  
  
Peat:  
  
I think the loss of context for the senses is evidence of an excessive amount,
consuming energy faster than it’s created; I think the desirable thing is to
increase the contextual meanings so that the perceived time span is maximized,
a prophetic-interpretive process.  
  
Question:  
  
Once i had 3 times the amount i had a few days ago. This loss of context for
the senses didn´t happen then. It might have something to do with the amount
of food i´ve eaten, but i think the biggest difference was my ability to let
go emotionally of any fear/expectation. It was like i flipped any internal
switch so to speak.  
  
You´ve mentioned in "A Biophysical Approach to Altered Consciousness” that a
hallucinogenic compound can be predicted by its electron-donor-potential. If i
understand correctly you think that senses work by some sort of resonance. If
an excessive dose of LSD is supplying too much energy which leads to
hallucinations what exactly are the sense resonating with? How does the
emotional “switch” change the things we resonate with  
  
Peat:  
  
Szent-Gyorgyi and Freeman Cope suggested that biological molecules are
semiconductors, possibly superconductors. Between a donor and acceptor
molecule, an electron sometimes resonates, forming a weak bond that strongly
absorbs electromagnetic energy, and they suggested that bands of such
electrons exist in cells. Within and between these delocalized electrons, I
suspect that there is a more subtle resonance, an electron spin resonance.
Arrays of such bands of electrons would be extremely sensitive antennas.
Michael Persinger, in the video No More Secretes, describes the potential
interactions of such electronic systems with other fields in the environment.
An implication of this would be that our consciousness doesn’t exist just in
our head.

If the metabolic rate stays high relative to calorie intake, the pufa will be
burned quickly, without having an opportunity to shape the physiology very
much. Other things become relatively more important as the pufa intake
approaches zero---methyl donors, phosphate excess, iron/copper ratio, etc.  
  
I've only had a few occasions to try speaking German, in Romania and Croatia,

Once in Mexico I accidentally ate something that I’m intensely allergic to,
but I had a glass of white rum at the same meal, and there was no reaction at

Any craving is a good starting point, because we have several biological
mechanisms for correcting specific nutritional deficiencies. When something is
interfering with your ability to use sugar, you crave it because if you don’t
eat it you will waste protein to make it.

Observing those situational reactions is the starting point that usually leads
to getting control of them. While alone,  
and feeling relaxed and free of the tensions, shift your attention to an image
of one of the authorities, for example a parent, and notice the change that
occurs in your body, especially the abdomen, then shift your attention again
to a neutral situation, until the body sensation subsides. With a few trials,
it becomes more controllable. Gurdjieff called it “remembering yourself.” With
practice, you can do it while in the presence of the authorities. Since it
keeps you at ease, it changes your way of relating to them, and they notice
immediately; they can react badly. Another view of the situation is that your
“model of the world,” or “Acceptor of Action,” has become more generalized,
and your personal energy can flow more productively into meaningful projects,
rather than being dissipated in the tensions that sustain the interpersonal
power relationship.  
  
Yes, the spirochetes can be killed with a couple of weeks of antibiotics. But
there are some doctors who specialize in permanent treatments. A few doctors
have used the internet to create a chronic Lyme cult. Doxycycline, penicillin
G and amoxycycline all usually work well.  
  
And the studies:

Summit,  
NJ, 07902, USA, [ john.halperin@atlantichealth.org
](mailto:john.halperin@atlantichealth.org) .  
OPINION STATEMENT: The tick-borne spirochete responsible for Lyme disease is  
highly antibiotic-sensitive. Treatment related misconceptions can be
attributed  
to confusion in three principal realms: (1) the appropriate approach to
diagnosis  
(who should be treated); (2) necessary and appropriate treatment; and (3) what  
actually constitutes nervous system infection and to what extent this mandates  
different treatment. Contrary to often-repeated assertions, laboratory-based  
diagnosis-in the appropriate setting-is as valid as it is in most other  
serologically diagnosed infections. Treatment is highly effective in the vast  
majority of patients, including those with nervous system disease. Nervous
system  
infection, most typically meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, and  
other forms of mononeuropathy multiplex, is highly antibiotic responsive. The  
encephalopathy that can be seen in some patients with active infection
represents  
the same phenomenon that occurs in patients with many other inflammatory  
disorders, is not evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection, and does  
not require any different, more prolonged, or more intensive treatment. In  
patients with infection not involving the CNS, oral treatment with
amoxicillin,  
cefuroxime axetil, or doxycycline for 2-4 weeks is almost always curative.  
Despite historic preferences for parenteral treatment with ceftriaxone,  
cefotaxime, or meningeal dose penicillin, patients with the forms of nervous  
system involvement listed above are highly responsive to oral doxycycline.  
Parenteral regimens can be reserved for those very rare patients with
parenchymal  
CNS involvement, other severe forms of infection, or the approximately 5 % of  
patients who fail to respond to oral regimens.

BACKGROUND: A 71-year-old woman presented to a rheumatologist with what she  
believed to be a 2-year history of Lyme disease, progressing from erythema  
migrans to Lyme arthritis.  
INVESTIGATIONS: History, physical examination and serologic testing confirmed
the  
diagnosis of Lyme disease.  
DIAGNOSIS: Lyme disease.  
MANAGEMENT: The patient refused antibiotic therapy during the first 2 years of  
her illness. During the next 2 years, she consulted a rheumatologist, but  
declined antibiotic therapy. She continued to have recurrent episodes of  
arthritis, following which she was successfully treated with doxycycline,
given  
initially for 2 weeks, with a second, 4-week cycle administered 2 months
later.  
This case illustrates the natural history of untreated Lyme disease, which is  
rarely observed in most patients since diagnosis almost always leads to  
successful antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, this case also demonstrates that  
infection with Borrelia burgdorferi can persist for years in untreated
patients;  
however, antibiotic therapy is still likely to be effective, despite long-term  
infection.

BACKGROUND: The length of antibiotic therapy and long-term outcomes in
patients  
with early Lyme disease are incompletely described. We report the long-term  
clinical outcomes of patients with early localized and early disseminated Lyme  
disease based on the duration of antibiotic therapy prescribed.  
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study and follow-up survey of patients
diagnosed  
as having early localized and early disseminated Lyme disease from 1 January
2000  
through 31 December 2004 was conducted in a Lyme disease-hyperendemic area.  
RESULTS: Six hundred seven patients met the study inclusion criteria. Most  
patients (93%) were treated with doxycycline for treatment durations of 10
days,  
11-15 days, or 16 days in 17%, 33%, and 47% of doxycycline-treated patients,  
respectively. Treatment failure criteria, defined before performing the study,  
were met in only 6 patients (1%). Although these 6 patients met a priori  
treatment failure criteria, 4 of these patients' clinical details suggested  
reinfection, 1 was treated with an inappropriate antibiotic, and 1 developed  
facial palsy early in therapy. Reinfection developed in 4% of patients. The  
2-year treatment failure-free survival rates of patients treated with
antibiotics  
for 10 days, 11-15 days, or 16 days were 99.0%, 98.9%, and 99.2%,
respectively.  
Patients treated with antibiotics for 16 days had lower 36-item Short-Form
Health  
Survey social functioning scores on the follow-up survey. No other differences  
were found in follow-up clinical status or 36-item Short-Form Health Survey  
scores by duration of antibiotic treatment.  
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for 10 days with antibiotic therapy for early
Lyme  
disease have long-term outcomes similar to those of patients treated with
longer  
courses. Treatment failure after appropriately targeted short-course therapy,
if  
it occurs, is exceedingly rare.

Eight cases of meningoradiculitis (Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth's syndrome) are  
presented; the first case followed an "unidentified insect" bite and erythema  
chronicum migrans, whereas the second and third cases were not preceded by any  
documented insect bite or erythema; they occurred during summer in 1984 and
1985  
and were characterized by cranial or radicular neuritis, lymphocytic
meningitis,  
positive serology by immunofluorescence against Borrelia Burgdorferi and a
good  
response to Penicillin (20 000 000 U during 14 days I.V.). Five other cases
were  
observed in the same area as the first and second cases (Walloon Brabant)
during  
the preceding summers; in two, serological proof of Borrelia Burgdorferi  
infection was obtained retrospectively. Lyme disease and Garin-Bujadoux-
Bannwarth  
syndrome are both tick-born spirochetosis, due to two slightly different
subtypes  
of Borrelia Burgdorferi. Their early neurological manifestations differ mainly
by  
focalised pain on the bitten region in Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth's syndromes.
This  
could be due to direct aggression of the peripheral nerve in  
Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth syndrome.

Pfister HW, Preac-Mursic V, Wilske B, Einhäupl KM.  
Neurologische Klinik der Universität, Klinikum Grosshadern, München, West  
Germany.  
We randomly assigned 21 patients with painful Lyme neuroborreliosis
radiculitis  
(Bannwarth's syndrome) and neuroborreliosis meningitis to a 10-day treatment
with  
either penicillin G. 4 x 5 million U/d (n = 10) or cefotaxime sodium, 3 x 2
g/d  
(n = 11), intravenously. We were not able to demonstrate clinical differences  
between groups, either during the 10-day treatment period or at follow-up  
examination a mean of 7.7 months after antibiotic therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid  
cefotaxime concentrations reached the minimum inhibitory concentration at the
90%  
level for Borrelia burgdorferi in all patients, while none of the patients  
treated with penicillin G had cerebrospinal fluid concentrations above the  
minimum inhibitory concentration at the 90% value. We conclude that patients
with  
acute neurologic manifestations of Lyme borreliosis may benefit from a 10-day  
treatment with cefotaxime or penicillin G. Cerebrospinal fluid antibiotic  
concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration at the 90% value, as  
observed in all patients treated with cefotaxime, offer the most hope for  
long-term prognosis.

(CSF) were analyzed in 46 patients during treatment for neuroborreliosis.
Twenty  
patients were treated intravenously with penicillin G at 3 g every 6 h (q6h),
and  
26 patients were treated orally with doxycycline at 200 mg q24h. All samples
were  
collected on day 13 of treatment. The median concentrations of penicillin G in  
serum were 0.5, 37, and 5.6 micrograms/ml before and 1 and 3 h after drug  
administration, and that in CSF was 0.5 (range, 0.3 to 1.6) microgram/ml after
2  
to 3 h. The median concentrations of doxycycline in serum were 2.1, 6.1, and
4.7  
micrograms/ml before and 2 and 6 h after drug administration, and that in CSF
was  
0.6 (range, 0.4 to 2.5) microgram/ml after 4 h. All patients had
concentrations  
of penicillin G or doxycycline in CSF above the lowest reported MICs of  
penicillin G (0.003 microgram/ml) and doxycycline (0.12 microgram/ml) for  
Borrelia burgdorferi. However, no patients had a drug concentration in CSF
above  
the highest reported MIC of penicillin G (8 micrograms/ml), and only one had a  
drug concentration in CSF above the highest reported MIC of doxycycline (2  
micrograms/ml), despite good clinical response to treatment. No treatment
failure  
or relapse was observed during a 1-year follow-up, although one patient
treated  
with penicillin G and one treated with doxycycline were retreated because of  
residual pain. The chosen dosages of penicillin G and doxycycline seem to give  
sufficient concentrations in serum and CSF for the treatment of
neuroborreliosis.

Comparison of intravenous penicillin G and oral doxycycline for treatment of
Lyme  
neuroborreliosis.  
Karlsson M, Hammers-Berggren S, Lindquist L, Stiernstedt G, Svenungsson B.  
Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.  
To compare the efficacy of oral doxycycline and IV penicillin G for the
treatment  
of neuroborreliosis, we randomized consecutive patients with Lyme  
neuroborreliosis to receive either IV penicillin G (3 g q 6 h) or oral  
deoxycycline (200 mg q 24 h) for 14 days. All patients had antibodies against  
Borrelia burgdorferi in serum, CSF, or both, or had a positive CSF culture.  
Twenty-three patients randomized to penicillin G and 31 patients to
doxycycline  
were included in the study. All patients improved during treatment, and there  
were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in patient  
scoring, CSF analysis, or serologic and clinical follow-up during 1 year.
There  
were no treatment failures, although one patient in each treatment group was  
re-treated because of residual symptoms. In conclusion, oral doxycycline is an  
adequate and cost-effective alternative to IV penicillin for the treatment of  
Lyme neuroborreliosis.

The cases are reported of two patients with chronic Lyme arthritis resistant
to  
the recommended antibiotic regimens who were cured by long term treatment with  
benzathine penicillin. It is suggested that the sustained therapeutic levels
of  
penicillin were effective either by the inhibition of germ replication or by  
lysis of the spirochaetes when they were leaving their sanctuaries.

Neuroborreliosis is easily diagnosed by means of clinical symptoms and
laboratory  
findings. Guiding symptoms are radicular pain and pareses of the extremities
and  
the facial nerve. There is a great number of further less frequently occurring  
neurological symptoms, which can be attributed to a borrelial infection only
by  
appropriate investigations of the CSF. Radiculitis is cured adequately by oral  
doxycycline while symptoms of the central nervous system are probably better  
treated intravenously by ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or penicillin G. Post-Lyme  
syndrome is a diffuse description of non-specific complaints, which are not
the  
explicit result of a former infection with B. burgdorferi. As further
antibiotics  
do not help and the CSF is unremarkable in most patients, a persistent
infection  
with B. burgdorferi s.l. in all probability can be excluded.

The antibiotic susceptibilities of seven Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato  
isolates from Ixodes persulcatus in China were examined by in-vitro  
microdilution minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and macrodilution minimum  
bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. All isolates tested were susceptible  
to amoxicillin, erythromycin, and minocycline. The MICs of these drugs for the  
Chinese isolates were 0.025-0.1 microg/ml, <0.012-0.05 microg/ml, and  
<0.012-0.05 microg/ml, respectively. The MBCs were 0.1-0.39 microg/ml,  
<0.012-0.2 microg/ml, and 0.025-0.39 microg/ml, respectively. The in-vivo  
antimicrobial susceptibilities of the Chinese Borrelia isolates to two test  
drugs, amoxicillin and minocycline, were evaluated using ddY mice. Mice were  
infected by subcutaneous inoculation into the right hind footpad. When
infection  
was confirmed, the mice were treated by subcutaneous injection of the test
drugs  
into the back. Amoxicillin and minocycline, which possessed high in-vitro  
activities against Lyme disease Borrelia, provided good protection against  
borreliosis in this animal model. Higher doses of these drugs resulted in  
elimination of the Lyme disease spirochete from all animals receiving this  
course of treatment. The 50% curative doses (CD50) of amoxicillin and  
minocycline were 8.7 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg, respectively. This suggested that  
amoxicillin and minocycline could be useful for the treatment of Chinese  
Borrelia infection.

Comparative study of cefuroxime axetil versus amoxicillin in children with
early  
Lyme disease.

Cefuroxime axetil has been shown to have efficacy comparable to doxycycline in  
adults with early Lyme disease (LD). Because of toxicity, doxycycline is
usually  
avoided in children. For children who are unable to tolerate amoxicillin,
there  
is currently no proven alternative oral therapy for LD. This randomized,  
unblinded study compared 2 dosage regimens of cefuroxime axetil (20 mg/kg/d
and  
30 mg/kg/d) with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d), each given for 20 days. Children
were  
enrolled if they were 6 months to 12 years of age, had erythema migrans, and
met  
other eligibility requirements. Serologic testing occurred at entry and after
6  
months. Follow-up evaluations for safety, tolerability, and efficacy occurred
at  
10 and 20 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Forty-three children were randomized (13  
in the amoxicillin group, 15 in each cefuroxime axetil group); 39 completed 12  
months of follow-up. At the completion of treatment, there was total
resolution  
of erythema migrans in 67% of the amoxicillin group, 92% of the low-dose  
cefuroxime group, and 87% of the high-dose cefuroxime group, and resolution of  
constitutional symptoms occurred in 100%, 69%, and 87%, respectively. All  
patients had a good outcome, with no long-term problems associated with LD.
One  
patient, who was well at the first 2 follow-up visits, was treated with  
doxycycline because of new constitutional symptoms. Mild diarrhea occurred in
a  
small number of participants in each group (1 patient was diagnosed and
treated  
for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which occurred after completing  
the full course of study medication). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred.  
The number of patients in this trial was not sufficient to demonstrate a  
statistically significant difference between the 3 groups; however, both  
amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil seem to be safe, efficacious treatments for  
children with early LD.

BACKGROUND: The long-term prognosis of patients treated for erythema migrans
has  
only rarely been assessed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical
characteristics  
and long-term prognosis of patients treated for erythema migrans in the region  
of Alsace, France. METHODS: In a prospective study, 56 consecutive patients  
presenting with erythema migrans at the Strasbourg University Hospital between  
1995 and 1999 were examined and a Borrelia burgdorferi enzyme immunoassay was  
performed. Patients were treated with tetracyclines or amoxycillin. Patients  
were re-examined 6 weeks later and a telephone interview was performed in
summer  
2000 to evaluate the long-term outcome. RESULTS: There were 25 women and 31
men  
of mean age 49 years presenting with single (n = 54) or multiple (n = 2)  
erythema migrans lesions. At the time of diagnosis, 30% of the patients had  
systemic signs, myalgias or arthralgias and only 36% of 50 patients were  
seroreactive against B. burgdorferi. None of the 51 patients evaluated at 6  
weeks and none of the 37 patients interviewed after a median delay of 3 years  
had developed complications attributable to Lyme borreliosis. CONCLUSIONS: The  
prognosis of patients treated for Lyme borreliosis in this part of France is  
excellent. Therefore, a complete clinical examination is sufficient as an  
initial evaluation and long-term follow-up is not necessary.

Lyme disease is a multi-system condition due to infection with a spirochete  
(Borrelia Burgdorferi), transmitted by a tick. Cardiac involvement, which is
not  
systematic, usually presents with transient atrioventricular block of varying  
degree. The authors describe an unusual presentation of the cardiac
involvement  
of Lyme's disease with chest pain resembling an acute coronary syndrome in a
32  
year old man. The characteristic skin lesion (erythema migrans), the
positivity  
of IgM serology, the myocardial scintigraphic results and the negativity of
the  
work-up of other causes of this pain led to a diagnosis of myocarditis, the  
outcome of which was favourable with treatment by amoxycillin (3 g/day,
orally).

In 1933 Reich published The Mass Psychology of Fascism, and the next year
Freud expelled him from psychoanalysis; that was the year that Andre Breton
excommunicated Dali from surrealism. Both Reich and Dali had important (but
dangerous) insights into the effects of the authoritarian culture on
consciousness—the destruction of reality by the imposition of an
“essentialist” attitude. Dali’s Persistence of Memory, 1931, described the
fluidity of reality and consciousness. Later, Dali aligned himself with the
fascist side, and his 1954 Decomposition of the Persistence of Memory shows
the quantized consciousness. Starting in 1945, the fascist culture blossomed
in the US, so people who speak English now have constant contact with the dead
essences, and very little incentive to evaluate them. Business/government
marketing techniques adjust the meaning-units periodically, so that they are
always available to provide the needed frame for the discourse of the moment.
A lot of work goes into it.

I think the most important therapeutic effects are in the range of a tenth of
a milligram to one milligram per day, and the doses that inhibit MAO are in
the range of hundreds of milligrams. I don't recommend it for anything that
can be corrected by diet, thyroid, [ aspirin

antihistamine, [ progesterone ](https://suchlabs.com/product/progesterone-

[A and D ratio]  
  
I don’t think the ratio matters, the need for them can vary in opposite
directions, for example, with lots of sunlight there’s no need to supplement
D, but the need for A increases. Vitamin E protects against an excess of A.

Question:  
  
I sometimes feel like my mind/personality are not located within or attached
to my body or even related in any way...is this real? its usually when I'm
struggling physically, like if I've eaten something fibrous that upsets my
digestion. Any thoughts you have on this would be amazing to hear...its
actually quite scary when it happens.  
  
Peat:  
  
The intestine is powerfully related to consciousness, affecting not only our
moods but even the way we feel ourselves in relation to our surrounding space.
For example, motion sickness demonstrates the way our sense of movement in
space is attached to our stomach and intestine—if we are on a ship, looking at
things inside the ship that aren’t moving in relation to our body, the real
motion sensed by our body conflicts with what our eyes are seeing, and we
interpret the inner movement as nausea, but if we just glance at the horizon,
the inner sensation of motion suddenly is interpreted accurately as our body
moving through space, and the nausea disappears. When there are actual forces
being applied to our intestine from the inside, created by bacterial growth,
gas, and toxins, our consciousness tries to make sense of it, and the result
can be dizziness, a sense of disorientation or falling, so that our sense of
location can seem ambiguous or confused.

An uncle of mine who was a post-master told my father, around 1950,  
that they were able to read first-class letters without opening them.  
I knew that suspicion of the government wasn't paranoia. Around  
1961-62 I knew some people who worked at Ryan Aeronautical in San  
Diego, where the first remotely piloted drones were being made, who  
told me that the government was using devices that could monitor vital  
signs of a person being interviewed, as a lie detector, without the  
person being aware of it. They described experiments in which people  
could be made sick by electronically imposing a lower frequency of  
brain waves. As I recall it, I came into contact with these three  
people (one, Clear Waters, said he was a minister, his name was  
memorable) in connection with my efforts to start the school. I didn't  
know why they would be telling me CIA secrets, and I was aware that  
anyone I met might be reporting my behavior, but at the time I was  
doing some simple bioelectric experiments with my mother's house  
plants, and was glad to have the information. My suspicion that they  
were using their bits of information to gain my confidence was  
confirmed in 1968, when the November issue of a magazine, I think it  
was Harper's, published a chapter from the not yet published book, The  
Secret Life of Plants, by Christopher Bird and Peter Tomkins, who were  
both associated with the CIA. In that chapter, they described  
experiments supposedly done by Paul Blondel at Blake College in San  
Diego. I wrote a letter to the editor, saying that there was no Paul  
Blondel at Blake College, and that the experiments described were done  
by me in Santee (a town east of San Diego). The magazine didn't  
publish my letter, but when I got a copy of the book, that part of the  
story had been deleted. The experiments I did in the period 1961-63  
were just variations of work that had been described to me in the late  
1950s by an old guy who said he had been doing that research in  
Germany before the war, but the university with his records had been  
destroyed. I think it was in the mid-1960s that Cleve Backster,  
ex-CIA, moved his polygraph school to San Diego, and began publicizing  
his work with plant bioelectricity. My interpretation of the whole  
episode is that there is probably a gossip-culture around the  
government's military research, and that some of the gossip-aura might  
be deliberately planted, to give the impression that the whole thing  
could be pure fiction. I think the talk about special kinds of  
radiation is likely to be in that category, red herrings to emphasize  
the idea that suspicious people aren't in touch with reality.
