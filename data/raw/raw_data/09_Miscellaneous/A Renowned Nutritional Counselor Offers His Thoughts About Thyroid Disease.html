 An Interview With Dr. Raymond Peat

A Renowned Nutritional Counselor Offers His Thoughts About Thyroid Disease

by Mary 
 Shomon

Raymond Peat, Ph.D. is editor and researcher of a popular and well-known monthly newsletter on nutritiona and health, as well as author of a number of cutting-edge publications that look at aging, nutrition, and hormones from a biochemical perspective. Dr. Peat has a Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Oregon, with specialization in physiology. He has taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad Veracruzana, the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico, and Blake College. He also conducts private nutritional counseling. 

I had the privilege to conduct an interview with Ray Peat in November of 2000, touching upon a few of the many interesting points he raises in his various publications. 

Mary Shomon: Why do women with treated hypothyroidism frequently still have inappropriately high levels of cholesterol and high triglycerides, and what can they do to help lower these levels?
Dr. Ray Peat: Often it's because they were given thyroxine, instead of
the active thyroid hormone, but hypertriglyceridemia can be caused by a
variety of things that interact with hypothyroidism. Estrogen treatment
is a common cause of high triglycerides, and deficiencies of magnesium,
copper, and protein can contribute to that abnormality. Toxins,
including some drugs and herbs, can irritate or stimulate the liver to produce too
much triglyceride. T3, triiodothyronine, is the active thyroid hormone, and
it is produced (mainly in the liver) from thyroxine, and the female liver
is less efficient than the male liver in producing it, as is the female
thyroid gland. The thyroid gland, which normally produces some T3, will
decrease its production in the presence of increased thyroxine.
Therefore,
thyroxine often acts as a "thyroid anti-hormone," especially in women.
When
thyroxine was tested in healthy young male medical students, it seemed
to
function "just like the thyroid hormone," but in people who are
seriously
hypothyroid, it can suppress their oxidative metabolism even more. It's
a
very common, but very serious, mistake to call thyroxine "the thyroid
hormone." 
High cholesterol is more closely connected to hypothyroidism than
hypertriglyceridemia is. Increased T3 will immediately increase the
conversion of cholesterol to progesterone and bile acids. When people
have
abnormally low cholesterol, I think it's important to increase their
cholesterol before taking thyroid, since their steroid-forming tissues
won't be able to respond properly to thyroid without adequate
cholesterol.
Mary Shomon: You feel that progesterone can have anti-stress 
effects, without harming the adrenal glands. Is progesterone 
therapy something you feel is useful to many or most hypothyroid 
patients? How can a patient know if she needs progesterone? Do 
you recommend blood tests? And if so, at what point in a woman's 
cycle?
Dr. Ray Peat: Estrogen blocks the release of hormone from the thyroid
gland, and progesterone facilitates the release. Estrogen excess or
progesterone deficiency tends to cause enlargement of the thyroid gland,
in
association with a hypothyroid state. Estrogen can activate the adrenals
to
produce cortisol, leading to various harmful effects, including brain
aging
and bone loss. Progesterone stimulates the adrenals and the ovaries to
produce more progesterone, but since progesterone protects against the
catabolic effects of cortisol, its effects are the opposite of
estrogen's.
Progesterone has antiinflammatory and protective effects, similar to
cortisol, but it doesn't have the harmful effects. In hypothyroidism,
there
is a tendency to have too much estrogen and cortisol, and too little
progesterone.

The blood tests can be useful to demonstrate to physicians what the
problem
is, but I don't think they are necessary. There is evidence that having
50
or 100 times as much progesterone as estrogen is desirable, but I don't
advocate "progesterone replacement therapy" in the way it's often
understood. Progesterone can instantly activate the thyroid and the
ovaries, so it shouldn't be necessary to keep using it month after month. If progesterone is used consistently, it can postpone menopause for many years.

Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and progesterone by the
ovaries,
the adrenals, and the brain, if there is enough thyroid hormone and
vitamin
A, and if there are no interfering factors, such as too much carotene or
unsaturated fatty acids. 
Progesterone deficiency is an indicator that something is wrong, and
using
a supplement of progesterone without investigating the nature of the
problem isn't a good approach. The normal time to use a progesterone
supplement is during the "latter half" of the cycle, the two weeks from
ovulation until menstruation. If it is being used to treat epilepsy,
cancer, emphysema, migraine or arthritis, or something else so serious
that
menstrual regularity isn't a concern, then it can be used at any time. 
If
progesterone is used consistently, it can postpone menopause for many
years.
Mary Shomon: What supplements do you feel are essential for 
most people with hypothyroidism?
Dr. Ray Peat: Because the quality of commercial nutritional supplements is
dangerously low, the only supplement I generally advocate is vitamin E,
and
that should be used sparingly. Occasionally, I will suggest limited use
of
other supplements, but it is far safer in general to use real foods, and
to
exclude foods which are poor in nutrients. Magnesium is typically
deficient
in hypothyroidism, and the safest way to get it is by using orange juice
and meats, and by using epsom salts baths; magnesium carbonate can be
helpful, if the person doesn't experience side effects such as headaches
or
hemorrhoids.
Mary Shomon: Do you feel that there are any special 
considerations, issues, or treatments for men with hypothyroidism?
Dr. Ray Peat: Thyroid supplements can be useful for prostate hypertrophy
and some cases of impotence and infertility. Occasionally, a man who
can't
put on a normal amount of weight finds that a thyroid supplement allows
normal weight gain. Leg cramps, insomnia and depression are often the
result of hypothyroidism. Heart failure, gynecomastia, liver disease,
baldness and dozens of other problems can result from hypothyroidism.
Mary Shomon: Many people describe how they are clinically 
hypothyroid, with elevated TSH levels, but have extremely high 
pulse rates. Do you have any thoughts as to what might be going 
on in that situation?
Dr. Ray Peat: In hypothyroidism, thyrotropin-release hormone (TRH) is
usually increased, increasing release of TSH. TRH itself can cause
tachycardia, "palpitations," high blood pressure, stasis of the
intestine,
increase of pressure in the eye, and hyperventilation with alkalosis. It
can increase the release of norepinephrine, but in itself it acts very
much
like adrenalin. TRH stimulates prolactin release, and this can interfere
with progesterone synthesis, which in itself affects heart function.

I consider even the lowest TSH within the "normal range" to be
consistent
with hypothyroidism; in good health, very little TSH is needed. When the
thyroid function is low, the body often compensates by over-producing
adrenalin. The daily production of adrenalin is sometimes 30 or 40 times
higher than normal in hypothyroidism. The adrenalin tends to sustain
blood
sugar in spite of the metabolic inefficiency of hypothyroidism, and it
can
help to maintain core body temperature by causing vasoconstriction in
the
skin, but it also disturbs the sleep and accelerates the heart. During
the
night, cycles of rising adrenalin can cause nightmares, wakefulness,
worry,
and a pounding heart. Occasionally, a person who has chronically had a
heart rate of 150 beats per minute or higher, will have a much lower
heart
rate after using a thyroid supplement for a few days. If your
temperature
or heart rate is lower after breakfast than before, it's likely that
they
were raised as a result of the nocturnal increase of adrenalin and
cortisol
caused by hypothyroidism.
Mary Shomon: You have written that for some people, there is a 
problem converting T4 to T3, but that diet can help. You 
recommend a piece of fruit or juice or milk between meals, plus 
adequate protein, can help the liver produce the hormone. Can you 
explain a bit more about this idea and how it works?
Dr. Ray Peat: The amount of glucose in liver cells regulates the enzyme
that converts T4 to T3. This means that hypoglycemia or diabetes (in
which
glucose doesn't enter cells efficiently) will cause hypothyroidism, when
T4
can't be converted into T3. When a person is fasting, at first the
liver's
glycogen stores will provide glucose to maintain T3 production. When the
glycogen is depleted, the body resorts to the dissolution of tissue to
provide energy. The mobilized fatty acids interfere with the use of
glucose, and certain amino acids suppress the thyroid gland. Eating
carbohydrate (especially fruits) can allow the liver to resume its production of T3. 
Mary Shomon: You have recommended if supplemental T3 is used, 
a thyroid patients "nibble on a 10-15 mg Cytomel tablet throughout 
the day." Can you explain why? Would compounded time-released 
T3 as available in some compounding pharmacies do the same?
Dr. Ray Peat: Most hypothyroid people can successfully use a supplement
that contains four parts of thyroxine for each part of T3, but some
people
need a larger proportion of T3 for best functioning. The body normally
produces several micrograms of T3 every hour, but if a large amount of
supplementary thyroid is taken in a short time, the liver quickly
inactivates some of the excess T3. Taking a few micrograms per hour
provides what the body can use, and doesn't suppress either the liver's
or
the thyroid's production of the hormone. 
I have only rarely talked to
anyone who had good results with the so-called time-release T3, and I
have
seen analyses of some samples in which there was little or no T3
present.
It is hard to compound T3 properly, and the conditions of each person's
digestive system can determine whether the T3 is released all at once,
or
not at all. I don't think there is a valid scientific basis for calling
anything "time-release T3." 
I have been told that the company which now owns the Armour name and
manufactures "Armour thyroid USP" has added a polymer to the formula, and
I
think this would account for the stories I have heard about its apparent
inactivity. Some people have found that the tablets passed through their
intestine undigested, so I think it's advisable to crush or powder the
tablets. 
Mary Shomon: You feel that excessive aerobic exercise can be a 
cause of hypothyroidism. Can you explain this further? How much 
is too much?
Dr. Ray Peat: I'm not sure who introduced the term "aerobic" to describe
the state of anaerobic metabolism that develops during stressful
exercise,
but it has had many harmful repercussions. In experiments, T3 production
is
stopped very quickly by even "sub-aerobic" exercise, probably becaue of
the
combination of a decrease of blood glucose and an increase in free fatty
acids. In a healthy person, rest will tend to restore the normal level
of
T3, but there is evidence that even very good athletes remain in a
hypothyroid state even at rest. A chronic increase of lactic acid and
cortisol indicates that something is wrong. The "slender muscles" of
endurance runners are signs of a catabolic state, that has been
demonstrated even in the heart muscle. A slow heart beat very strongly
suggests hypothyroidism. Hypothyroid people, who are likely to produce
lactic acid even at rest, are especially susceptible to the harmful
effects
of "aerobic" exercise. The good effect some people feel from exercise is
probably the result of raising the body temperature; a warm bath will do
the same for people with low body temperature.
Mary Shomon: You feel that chronic protein deficiency is a 
common cause of hypothyroidism. How much protein should 
people get (as much as 70-100 grams a day?) and what types of 
protein, in order to prevent hypothyroidism?
Dr. Ray Peat: The World Health Organization standard was revised upward by
researchers at MIT, and recently the MIT standard has been revised
upward
again by military researchers; this is described in a publication of the
National Academy of Sciences (National Academy Press, The Role of
Protein and Amino Acids in Sustaining and Enhancing Performance, 1999). When too
little protein, or the wrong kind of protein, is eaten, there is a
stress
reaction, with thyroid suppression. Many of the people who don't respond
to
a thyroid supplement are simply not eating enough good protein. I have
talked to many supposedly well educated people who are getting only 15
or
20 grams of protein per day. To survive on that amount, their metabolic
rate becomes extremely low. The quality of most vegetable protein
(especially beans and nuts) is so low that it hardly functions as
protein.
Muscle meats (including the muscles of poultry and fish) contain large
amounts of the amino acids that suppress the thyroid, and shouldn't be
the
only source of protein. It's a good idea to have a quart of milk (about 32 grams of protein) every day, besides a variety of other high quality proteins, including cheeses, eggs, shellfish, and potatoes. The protein of potatoes is extremely high quality, and the quantity, in terms of a percentage, is similar to that of milk. 
Mary Shomon: You talk about darkness and shorter days of winter 
as a stress. It's known that more thyroid hormone is needed by 
some patients during colder weather. Are there other things you 
recommend patients do to "winterproof" their metabolism?
Dr. Ray Peat: Very bright incandescent lights are helpful, because light
acts on, and restores, the same mitochondrial enzymes that are governed
by
the thyroid hormone. In squirrels, hibernation is brought on by the
accumulation of unsaturated fats in the tissues, suppressing respiration
and stimulating increased serotonin production. In humans, winter
sickness
is intensified by those same antithyroid substances, so it's important
to
limit consumption of unsaturated fats and tryptophan (which is the
source
of serotonin). When a person is using a thyroid supplement, it's common
to
need four times as much in December as in July.
Mary Shomon: You have reported that pregnenolone can be helpful 
for Graves' patients with exophthalmus. Can you explain further? 
Dr. Ray Peat: Graves' disease and exophthalmos can occur with
hypothyroidism or euthyroidism, as well as with hyperthyroidism.
Pregnenolone regulates brain chemistry in a way that prevents excessive
production of ACTH and cortisol, and it helps to stabilize mitochondrial
metabolism. It apparently acts directly on a variety of tissues to
reduce
their retention of water. In the last several years, all of the people I
have seen who had been diagnosed as "hyperthyroid" have actually been
hypothyroid, and benefitted from increasing their thyroid function; some
of
these people had also been told that they had Graves' disease. 
Mary Shomon: You are a proponent of coconut oil for thyroid 
patients. Can you explain why? 
Dr. Ray Peat: An important function of coconut oil is that it supports
mitochondrial respiration, increasing energy production that has been
blocked by the unsaturated fatty acids. Since the polyunsaturated fatty
acids inhibit thyroid function at many levels, coconut oil can promote
thyroid function simply by reducing those toxic effects. It allows
normal
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, without producing the toxic lipid
peroxidation that is promoted by unsaturated fats.
Mary Shomon: Do you have any thoughts for thyroid patients who 
are trying to do everything right, and yet still can't lose any weight?
Dr. Ray Peat: Coconut oil added to the diet can increase the metabolic
rate. Small frequent feedings, each combining some carbohydrate and some
protein, such as fruit and cheese, often help to keep the metabolic rate
higher. Eating raw carrots can prevent the absorption of estrogen from
the
intestine, allowing the liver to more effectively regulate metabolism. If
a
person doesn't lose excess weight on a moderately low calorie diet with
adequate protein, it's clear that the metabolic rate is low. The number
of
calories burned is a good indicator of the metabolic rate. The amount of
water lost by evaporation is another rough indicator: For each liter of
water evaporated, about 1000 calories are burned. 
Mary Shomon:You have talked about internal malnutrition as a 
problem for many thyroid patients, due to insufficient digestive 
juices and poor intestinal movements. Are there ways patients who 
are treated for hypothyroidism can help alleviate this problem.
Dr. Ray Peat: The absorption and retention of magnesium, sodium, and
copper, and the synthesis of proteins, are usually poor in
hypothyroidism.
Salt craving is common in hypothyroidism, and eating additional sodium
tends to raise the body temperature, and by decreasing the production of
aldosterone, it helps to minimize the loss of magnesium, which in turn
allows cells to respond better to the thyroid hormone. This is probably
why
a low sodium diet increases adrenalin production, and why eating enough
sodium lowers adrenalin and improves sleep. The lowered adrenalin is
also
likely to improve intestinal motility.
Mary Shomon: You've mentioned eggs, milk and gelatin as good 
for the thyroid. Can you explain a bit more about this?
Dr. Ray Peat: Milk contains a small amount of thyroid and progesterone,
but it also contains a good balance of amino acids. For adults, the
amino
acid balance of cheese might be even better, since the whey portion of
milk
contains more tryptophan than the curd, and tryptophan excess is
significantly antagonistic to thyroid function. The muscle meats contain
so
much tryptophan and cysteine (which is both antithyroid and potentially
excitotoxic) that a pure meat diet can cause hypothyroidism. In poor
countries, people have generally eaten all parts of the animal, rather
than
just the muscles--feet, heads, skin, etc. About half of the protein in
an
animal is collagen (gelatin), and collagen is deficient in tryptophan
and
cysteine. This means that, in the whole animal, the amino acid balance
is
similar to the adult's requirements. Research in the amino acid
requirements of adults has been very inadequate, since it has been
largely
directed toward finding methods to produce farm animals with a minimum
of
expense for feed. The meat industry isn't interested in finding a diet
for
keeping chickens, pigs, and cattle healthy into old age. As a result,
adult
rats have provided most of our direct information about the protein
requirements of adults, and since rats keep growing for most of their
life,
their amino acid requirements are unlikely to be the same as ours. 
Mary Shomon: Do you think the majority of people with 
hypothyroidism get too much or too little iodine? Should people 
with hypothyroidism add more iodine, like kelp, seaweeds, etc.?
Dr. Ray Peat: 30 years ago, it was found that people in the US were
getting about ten times more iodine than they needed. In the mountains
of Mexico and in the Andes, and in a few other remote places, iodine
deficiency still exists. Kelp and other sources of excess iodine can
suppress the thyroid, so they definitely shouldn't be used to treat
hypothyroidism.
Mary Shomon: What are your thoughts for Graves' disease/hyperthyroidism patients? Should they move ahead quickly to get radioactive iodine treatment, or are there natural things they might be able to try to temporarily - or even 
permanently - get a remission?
Dr. Ray Peat: Occasionally, a person with a goiter will temporarily become
hyperthyroid as the gland releases its colloid stores in a corrective
process. Some people enjoy the period of moderate hyperthyroidism, but
if
they find it uncomfortable or inconvenient, they can usually control it
just by eating plenty of liver, and maybe some cole slaw or raw cabbage
juice. Propranolol will slow a rapid heart. The effects of a thyroid
inhibitor, PTU, propylthiouracil, have been compared to those of
thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine. The results of the chemical
treatment are better for the patient, but not nearly so profitable for
the
physician.
Besides a few people who were experiencing the unloading of a goiter,
and
one man from the mountains of Mexico who became hypermetabolic when he
moved to Japan (probably from the sudden increase of iodine in his diet,
and maybe from a smaller amount of meat in his diet), all of the people
I
have seen in recent decades who were called "hyperthyroid" were not.
None
of the people I have talked to after they had radioiodine treatment were
properly studied to determine the nature of their condition. Radioiodine
is
a foolish medical toy, as far as I can see, and is never a proper
treatment.
