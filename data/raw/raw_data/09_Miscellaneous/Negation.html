Negation

Ray Peat Interview
January 22, 2014

There is one concept that has altered my perception of life more than anything I have ever studied. Some people know it as ‚Äúnegation‚Äù others as ‚Äúdenial.‚Äù I have some ideas for future blog posts where I plan on referencing this theme more directly. Before that can happen, I feel negation needs to be explored and contemplated on its own with as little distraction as possible.
For some of you, this may be an introduction to the idea and I take this seriously. So I called in the big guns, someone who has studied the matter much longer than I have and has helped me to deepen my comprehension of it. I present the following to you, Dr. Ray Peat on Negation:
I think the concept is very simple in itself, but the problem is that it implies a cultural criticism that involves everything, biology, physics, politics, epistemology. Contraries, or different perspectives, can interact to eliminate error, in progressing. Negation is a human function that would stop the free advance of life and consciousness, opposing critical questioning and spontaneous understanding. The refusal to discuss a problem, and the many forms of censorship, and legal-economic systems that make whole courses of action impossible, are negations, that have their poisonous effects. Physiology reflects their poison, in all the ramifications of learned helplessness, restraint stress, the carcinogenic effects of work-school-media-religion-government.
Negation excludes or suppresses those complex processes of being,* and implants nothing but‚Äìat the most‚Äìobligation in their place. Undocumented aliens are negated simply, slaves and citizens are negated but with obligations. Religions tell people that their being is immaterial, a ghost that will be o.k. somewhere else forever, if they do their duty now. Having a false consciousness implanted by schools and television, labels and roles take the place of being. A sense of despair and impossibility is right behind the false consciousness.
Our surrounding context of language and culture is constantly distorting and misinterpreting anything which persists in moving toward a more expansive life. Knowledge, a physiological thing, is expansion, and as such is always clearing away errors; when people identify with error, they see knowledge as the deadly enemy, that must be destroyed.
Blake‚Äôs idea of the ‚Äúintellectual fountain‚Äù was very different from the attitude of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche (where ‚ÄúWill‚Äù or assertion was the fundamental reality). Blake saw it as always flowing into new territory, discovering new things, enlivening the world that‚Äôs being discovered-created. When the organism is traumatized, it hardens, and stops developing, and wants to impose its moral hardness everywhere; assertiveness is the antithesis of perceptive life, and devises ways to negate it.
In an authoritarian culture, people want you to forget who you are, so they can implant themselves without resistance. Just recognizing your own presence, to attend to them fully, is something they don‚Äôt expect; it isn‚Äôt quite like Carl Rogers‚Äô therapeutic presence, because it‚Äôs conditional‚Äìyour conscious presence is the condition. Being present and able to listen (and question and understand)* is receptive and productive, and it can even be disruptive, but it‚Äôs very different from being assertive, because it‚Äôs always hoping to open up new possibilities, rather than imposing something carried along from the past. A priest is being assertive when he says you have to take it on faith, a physics professor is being assertive when he won‚Äôt justify his assumptions‚Äìwhere would physics be if your assumptions had to be plausible beyond a particular culture of physics? Much of their potential imagination has been invested in thinking of ways to keep you from questioning.
Physics, in the 20th century, has taken on the Nietzchean subjectivism, claiming to quantize/digitize everything. There is no digital nature, but assertive subjectivism has effectively written quantization into the constitution of science, and into the shadow of the humanities that remains in the corporate universities. Bits of ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù are sold and hoarded, and people who would show that they are something other than knowledge are treated as vandals and worse‚ÄìAaron Swartz, for example.

A Little Boy Lost
Nought loves another as itself,
Nor venerates another so,
Nor is it possible to thought
A greater than itself to know.
‚ÄòAnd, father, how can I love you
Or any of my brothers more?
I love you like the little bird
That picks up crumbs around the door.‚Äô
The Priest sat by and heard the child;
In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
He led him by his little coat,
And all admired the priestly care.
And standing on the altar high,
‚ÄòLo, what a fiend is here! said he:
‚ÄòOne who sets reason up for judge
Of our most holy mystery.‚Äô
The weeping child could not be heard,
The weeping parents wept in vain:
They stripped him to his little shirt,
And bound him in an iron chain,
And burned him in a holy place
Where many had been burned before;
The weeping parents wept in vain.
Are such thing done on Albion‚Äôs shore?
A Poison Tree
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.
And I watered it in fears,
Night and morning with my tears;
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.
And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine.
And he knew that it was mine,
And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning glad I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
Introduction.
Hear the voice of the Bard!
Who Present, Past, & Future sees
Whose ears have heard,
The Holy Word,
That walk‚Äôd among the ancient trees.
Calling the lapsed Soul
And weeping in the evening dew:
That might controll.
The starry pole;
And fallen fallen light renew!
O Earth O Earth return!
Arise from out the dewy grass;
Night is worn.
And the morn
Rises from the slumberous mass.
Turn away no more:
Why wilt thou turn away
The starry floor
The watry shore
Is giv‚Äôn thee till the break of day.
The Voice of the Ancient Bard.
Youth of delight come hither.
And see the opening morn,
Image of truth new born.
Doubt is fled & clouds of reason
Dark disputes & artful teazing.
Folly is an endless maze,
Tangled roots perplex her ways.
How many have fallen there!
They stumble all night over bones of the dead
And feel they know not what but care;
And wish to lead others when they should be led

Beautiful. Thank you so much for this, Karen and Dr. Peat. Just curious, are there supposed to be footnotes to this article? There are a couple of starred words (second and fifth paragraph in the article) so it made me wonder‚Ä¶

Thank you Adam! We added the asterisk to ‚Äúthose complex processes of being‚Äù to indicate that it refers to the questioning, growing presence and such mentioned at the next asterisk.
