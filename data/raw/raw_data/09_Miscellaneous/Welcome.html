 This website currently reports on my research in aging, nutrition, and hormones. You will find this
 information in the ARTICLES section.

 A variety of health problems are examined (eg., infertility, epilepsy, dementia, diabetes,
 premenstrual syndrome, arthritis, menopause), and the therapeutic uses of progesterone,
 pregnenolone, thyroid, and coconut oil are frequently discussed.

 My approach gives priority to environmental influences on development, regenerative processes, and
 an evolutionary perspective. When biophysics, biochemistry, and physiology are worked into a
 comprehensive view of the organism, it appears that the degenerative processes are caused by defects
 in our environment.

 As a supplement to this web site, I've also included examples of my artwork, specifically some of my
 paintings, which you will find in the ART GALLERY. As
 I've discussed in my books, I see painting as an essential part of grasping the world
 scientifically. For a few years, I taught art and painted portraits. I have shown my work in both
 the US and Mexico.

 BACKGROUND

 Concerning my background, I have a Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Oregon, with
 specialization in physiology. The schools I have taught at include: the University of Oregon, Urbana
 College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad
 Veracruzana, the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico, and Blake College. I also conduct
 private nutritional counseling.

 I started my work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968. In papers in Physiological
 Chemistry and Physics (1971 and 1972) and in my dissertation (University of Oregon, 1972), I
 outlined my ideas regarding progesterone, and the hormones closely related to it, as protectors of
 the body's structure and energy against the harmful effects of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack
 of oxygen.

 The key idea was that energy and structure are interdependent, at every level.

 Since then, I have been working on both practical and theoretical aspects of this view. I think only
 a new perspective on the nature of living matter will make it possible to properly take advantage of
 the multitude of practical and therapeutic effects of the various life-supporting
 substances--pregnenolone, progesterone, thyroid hormone, and coconut oil in particular.

 "Marketing" of these as products, without understanding just what they do and why they do it, seems
 to be adding confusion, rather than understanding, as hundreds of people sell their misconceptions
 with their products. The very concept of "marketing" is at odds with the real nature of these
 materials, which has to do with the protection and expansion of our nature and potential. A
 distorted idea of human nature is sold when people are treated as "the market."

 It seems that all of the problems of development and degeneration can be alleviated by the
 appropriate use of the energy-protective materials. When we realize that our human nature is
 problematic, we can begin to explore our best potentials.
