3. **Learning Style Classification** - Behavior-based learning preference detection
4. **Content Recommendation Engine** - Personalized content delivery
5. **NLP-Based Feedback Generator** - Intelligent response analysis and guidance

#### Success Metrics
- **Recommendation Accuracy:** >80% relevant quiz/content suggestions
- **Learning Style Classification:** >75% F1-score on behavior prediction
- **User Engagement:** Measurable improvement in session duration and interaction depth
- **Knowledge Retention:** Demonstrated through adaptive quiz performance tracking
