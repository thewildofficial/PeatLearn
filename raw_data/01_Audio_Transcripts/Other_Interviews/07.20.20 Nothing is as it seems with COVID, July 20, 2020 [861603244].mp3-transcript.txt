 You Nothing is more expensive than bad information. Know the source, OneRadioNetwork.com. Okay, sorry for a little bit late start. We generally start at 10.30 Central on the third Monday, whatever it is, on OneRadioNetwork.com with a very popular guest, Dr. Ray Peet, who has a Ph.D. Dr. Peet has had this idea of looking at human nutrition. Healing, how the body works for a very, very long time, a Ph.D. from years ago, he's a nutritional counselor. He got his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon, and he specialized in physiology. Started his work in hormones in 1968, way back when I was in the military. And I remember kind of a wild year where, if I recall, it was Bobby Kennedy was killed, President Johnson decided not to run, Martin Luther King was murdered. For what that's worth and then he wrote his dissertation in 72 and really talked about progesterone and hormones and such and he's here as I said on the third Monday at 10 30 central time a little bit late but Dr. Ray Pete good morning to you sir how are you? Good morning uh very well yeah yeah yeah yeah you're an orange juice guy how you drink orange juice every day um yeah yeah start out with either cafe cone lychee or orange juice say you start off with what coffee and milk coffee and milk and then orange juice over the years we were told by our moms and and and school people that's not too too good to drink orange juice because it has too much sugar in it remember that oh oh yeah during the night we use up almost all of our stored glucose stored as glycogen and That's why our almost everyone has very high cortisol in the morning the stress hormone And that's because it begins turning our good tissues everything from the bones to the skin starts breaking down As dawn approaches because we're using up our... stored sugar and we need sugar to keep the brain alive and the blood cells and so the the stress hormones come up near dawn and start breaking down our tissues to feed the brain. Is that similar to having the lowest blood sugar in the morning or just this is more glucose of taking more sugar in? The biggest group of people, low blood sugar happens around 3 to 4 or 5 a.m. And that starts the intense surge in all of the stress hormones, not just cortisol, but rising serotonin, histamine, serotonin, serotonin, serotonin, serotonin, serotonin, serotonin, parathyroid hormone, everything related to stress and breakdown of tissues, women starting around menopause start losing almost all of their daily bone loss starts in the early morning hours and when they start eating sugar and get the blood sugar back up to lower the nose. Stress hormones, the rest of the day, they don't lose a significant amount of bone or other tissue. Really? But the bone loss is just an easily measured sign that your body is being torn down. It happens to your skin and everything that isn't protected by hormones like testosterone and progesterone. So let's talk about that. So the progesterone and hormone, which you're really one of the experts at, have been at a long time. By the way, if you'd like to be on the air with Dr. Ray Peet, Patrick at oneradionetwork.com. We're just starting this morning. We'll get this video thing. We almost got it going, working, and we'll try it again tomorrow after doing a little tech stuff. Patrick at oneradionetwork.com, 888-663-6386. So let's go back. So three o'clock or so, the body starts running down on glucose. The hormones and the cortisol levels and that's that's really the beginning of losing bone and also where the skin will look a little ruffled maybe in the morning or or wrinkles and stuff like that. Yeah it's actually a little bit weaker and thinner but water replaces the the last tissue so. You don't always notice that it looks thinner and tending to wrinkle, but yeah, the skin does look worse in aging people after the age of about 45 or so. In the morning? In the morning. In the morning. So what could, could we eat something before bed, right before bed, that would help with this issue? Yeah. Yeah, I hope so. Sort of like an athlete socks up on carbohydrates for a day or even in the couple of hours before a marathon or whatever. You want to get your muscles, liver, and brain well supplied with glucose, glycogen, and so carbohydrate as your late afternoon or early evening. Meal is very important and right at bedtime a big surge of calcium such as a glass of milk helps to hold down the parathyroid hormone which specializes in bone destruction, mobilizes the calcium and coming out of the bone the calcium then activates the breakdown of your blood vessels and skin and you're good to go. and tends to calcify blood vessels so the calcium coming out of your bone doesn't just innocently get into the urine but on the way there it is exciting helping to break down and age all of your tissues. So what if somebody wanted to get some good stuff right before bed but they didn't like milk or they were dairy or lactose intolerant or something what we have worth would there be a substitute nothing is as good as milk because milk is very specialized for stimulating optimizing the absorption of calcium and magnesium not only the lactose but the various proteins in milk prepare the lining of the intestine to very efficiently absorb the calcium and magnesium. You can absorb it if you have orange juice and, for example, either the juice or the cooked leaf of kale, for example, is very rich in calcium and magnesium. So if you have a big serving of cooked kale and a glass of orange juice that... It won't be as good as milk or cheese, but next best thing. Before bed. Before bed. Actually, actually have kale before bed. Milk and cheese sounds like tastier than that, but you know, whatever works for you. Is OK with goat or cow milk or camel or anything else works? I think camel and sheep milk are kind of a sick high end. Energy and fat. They would work, but you would get fatter than low fat cow milk. One percent cow milk or reduced fat goat milk is probably the best source for most people. Because if you're working all day on a farm, for example, it's fine to drink a gallon of whole milk because you're spending so many calories. That's why you're spending so many calories. But even drinking two quarts a day of whole milk, the average sedentary person is going to get fat. Boy, milk though, as you know, milk has sure gotten a bad rap, especially more so in the natural world over the last, what, 25 years, Dr. Pete, than in the mainstream. You know, they still, people in mainstream still drink some milk, but. You know, not too many people in the natural thing, they've been told it's terrible, you can't even sort it, it's only meant for cows, and all kinds of stuff, right? Yeah, and if you look at the culture, it's getting fatter and fatter, and milk happens to be the best weight-loss food there is, because the high calcium assimilation from it increases our metabolic rate, the combination of protein. And calcium and magnesium is ideal for increasing our ability to burn calories. That's interesting. That is so interesting. And that plays along with the whole idea that we were sold, Doc. When was it? I guess early 90s, you know, that fat was bad, and that's when the whole low-fat thing really came on board, right? Yeah, the fat has to be adjusted here. activity level. If you're burning 5,000 calories a day, you can handle the fat of something like whole milk. But I found when I was in graduate school that drinking a gallon a day of 2% milk, I was starting to get fat. So I changed to 1% and have stayed the same weight ever since. But we've heard though, that if you're going to drink milk, it's best just to go with the whole stuff though, the whole, no, the whole thing? The full fat, the full fat. Yeah, the high fat content is for a high work, high energy expenditure. And if you aren't spending 5,000 calories a day doing hard physical work, it's necessarily going to be... stores fat. So what about... say if you wake up in the middle of the night, 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock, could be a blood sugar thing, would orange juice work there as well? Oh, very well. I usually use a glass of milk with a spoonful of sugar in it, but orange juice is fine. I've even used Coke. When I was traveling and woke up at 3 a.m. and needed sugar and Coke worked all right. Yeah, very interesting. Dr. Ray Pete, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com. So here we are, gosh, July 20. I think the whole COVID thing, we're kind of tired of talking about it, but I'm sure that you've looked at a lot of different things over the past three, four, five months. We've talked to it in past shows. Can you give me your head on July 20 here with your opinion and all the research you do and the people that you talk to? Can you give us your best opinion about what's going on as far as a virus, communicable, no virus, bioweapon, body makes the virus, whatever. Do you have an opinion on it? Is there any kind of real, let me finish it for a second, is there any kind of real science that is provable or is it all just conjecture even from a credentialed fellow like yourself? That's what I've been asking myself for. Starting in February and March, I began writing down and looking at the numbers published by the Centers for Disease Control and comparing them to previous years. Starting in the first week of January of this year, the numbers of weekly deaths, the... consistently over the last many years, they've completed their national compilation of deaths throughout the country within two weeks of the reference week, and so, starting in the third week, I... was writing down the finished numbers for the first week of the year, and then comparing those numbers to the previous week in 2019, and after I'd done this for two or three months, I noticed that someone on the Internet had been doing the same thing, only more thoroughly, going back several decades. What I was seeing was a sharp drop... in the weekly mortality, referring to the previous year, a sudden drop of 10 to 15 percent from last fall, and I couldn't find any historical precedent, and this person who has a website, I think his name is Joe Hoft, H-O-F-T... No, I don't know that. Anyway, he did it for previous decades and came up with the same results. The mortality peak in last fall started its steep rise, exactly like every preceding year, the winter pneumonia deaths. But then suddenly, around January 1st, there was a crash in the deaths all around the United States. People were dying less often from all causes. And that went on through March. There is this weird, it's like a volcano collapsing and making a crater. A historically unique mortality curve. And then, if you look back at 10 or 15 percent unhistorical lack of deaths, suddenly the first week of April, all of those missing deaths reappear in a gigantic, again, unhistorical peak, which they called the COVID Death Peak. And, basically, there's no way that can happen, even if the Bubonic Plague starters up. You just can't get a historical collapse of......more total mortality all around the country that way. I think the only way a criminal prosecutor could interpret it would be that someone was fiddling the numbers with foreknowledge that they were going to want a lot of deaths to report. So they trimmed, impossibly, the total mortality to have a big pile. of deaths to report in April. Interesting. So you can actually see where there was something done to the numbers in, what was it you were saying, in late fall and early winter? No, the death curve was perfectly normal right through December. December. And then it was just about the first week of January that, if you plot their own numbers. You see this, it looks like a volcanic crater forming. A piece starts up and then collapses and then comes up super sharp on the other side. To make it look like there was a big... Yeah, except they haven't explained why those tens of thousands of people weren't dying in the... uh... run up almost three months. They didn't give out any explanation or show that anything real was happening that they were just talking about this week. Fifteen people died with a diagnosis and so on. You see the same thing happening now in Texas and Florida. They say a month ago there were only ten or fifteen people per day dying. Today, twenty-five people died. Everyone should panic. We're all going to die. But when you look at the daily... mortality in the state with 30 million, every day, hundreds of people, seven or eight hundred people, are dying of all causes. And what they're saying is, today, twice as many people died with a diagnosis of COVID as did on a given day the previous month. But if you look at the number of... daily tests given, and look at the curve of COVID-diagnosed deaths, the rise in the daily tests given exactly corresponds to the rise in the daily diagnosed COVID deaths. And you can't really diagnose for sure that someone has the virus unless you... do the test and if the number of diagnosed people rises exactly as the number of tests administered rises, then you have no evidence that anything at all is happening. Does the PCR or DNA test give with any amount of accuracy that someone has a unique virulent... potentially deadly communicable virus in their body? Well, any virus is likely to be communicable, and if you're in a very particular weakened state, just about any virus can be deadly. Any old cold virus or just the most trivial sort of virus can push. A very sick person over the edge. But the PCR test will find even if you have just sitting on your mucus harmlessly, you could have rabies virus or whatever. One of them sitting on a piece of a spare of mucus, the PCR test would find it and say you had rabies. But that virus might never have reached your living tissue. So when we're seeing antibodies, it doesn't mean that someone has a unique virus called COVID in there? Well, the antibody, if their antibodies are truly specific for that particular antigen, that's a very different thing from the PCR test. The PCR test will amplify the most trivial amount of viral information, but to form antibodies that are more or less specific to that virus means that your immune system was exposed to it, but it doesn't mean you ever got sick from it. Hmm. So, which one is the antibody test? Other than the PCR test? Like the PCR test, and we have two, right? The PCR test and the DNA test? The PCR test is for either RNA or DNA. And then what's the other test they're using? The antibody test is to see if you have been exposed to it and formed an antibody in your blood. Is that considered a positive test that they're reporting as positive? Well, it means that you've been exposed to it But you you might have had sniffles from it or not even noticed that you had anything and you can still form antibodies when Like when you eat a new food You're likely to form Antibodies your immune system is testing foods that you've eaten and checking them and preparing antibodies so that you will be tolerant to that food. It prepares to block any irritation from that food if your immune system is good. So the antibodies means you're safe from that particular antigen. It's a barrier against any further action by that. Particular thing. Do you know which tests are given more most often the PCR or the antibodies? No, for a time the CDC was listing the numbers all mixed together. So for weeks their numbers were totally meaningless because they were blending everything together and and saying that these these are the numbers of people with COVID but absolutely different tests mixed together don't mean anything. So when governors and mayors and people are closing closing cities and and masking orders and all that using people testing positive which are called new cases, can you conjecture of what percent accurate that is? Well it's accurate in the sense that they have a positive result but it doesn't mean that the people were at all sick or if they were sick it doesn't mean that if they died it might have been a stroke or heart attack or trauma from falling out a window or something. If they had the presence of the virus, they were put down as a COVID death. About two or three months ago, Deborah Birx, who used to appear in all the press conferences with Fauci and Trump, she said the government is listing everyone positive for a COVID test. As a COVID test, she expressed what I was just saying that and she no longer appears in the press conferences every day. Right, starting right after making that sort of incriminating statement that there's no rational basis for what they're saying. We posted an article, I'll just read you the first paragraph to get your......opinion with Dr. Ray Peete, if you'd like to be on the show, patrickatoneradionetwork.com. A high-profile European pathologist is reporting that he and his colleagues across Europe have found no evidence of any deaths from a novel coronavirus on that continent. Dr. Stolen Alexoff contacted the World Health Organization and he was accusing them of creating worldwide fear and chaos without providing objective, variable proof of a pandemic. And then along with that, the Bulgarian Pathology Association is part of that. They believe it's currently impossible to create a vaccine against the virus. He also revealed that the European pathologists haven't identified anti-antibodies that are specific for SARS-CoV-2. Well, the Bulgarian is exactly right about the impossibility of making a vaccine. They've tried to make... vaccines for the coronavirus, which is the common cold main cause, for decades, they've found that the virus mutates within a few months to become resistant to any vaccination. And there's, being an RNA virus, all of these coronaviruses mutate. About a hundred times faster than DNA virus and about a million times faster than mammalian DNA, a very, very fast, constant mutation rate. Constant mutation, wow. He's right on the impossibility of a vaccine, but his comment about the specific antibody he's using... The specificity of an antibody in a particular way that isn't correct for general immunology. You can have specificity as a composite of half a dozen different molecules that each one is roughly specific for the virus. So you don't have to have one... absolutely specific antibody. He's thinking about the monoclonal specific antibody, but you don't need that kind of specificity to have a vaccine. What about his statement on found... has not found any evidence of any deaths? That was a different group, and I haven't read that paper, but I would agree that... How do you prove that death was caused by a virus? In the case of hospital deaths, just recently news came out that the intensive care units have, since the first months of the so-called pandemic, mortality has dropped by 30 percent. What has happened around the country, they've discovered that when they intubate someone, the process of putting the tube in them and giving them powerful drugs to make them unconscious and relax their reflex muscle contractions, those drugs combined with forced respiration kill. Almost 100% of the people within a few weeks, so they were killing 100% of their patients practically, 80 to 100%. Simply by the treatment they were giving them, that came to be realized now simply by reducing the number of intubations for which the government was paying them $48,000 per patient tubed and killed. Simply by reducing their greedy uptake of government money, they've cut intensive care unit mortality by a third. So, how long did this go on and any possibility of knowing how many deaths were attributed to this incorrect procedure? When one doctor in Europe... compared two nearby hospitals in Germany, he was working with one of them and he explained why the tubing was killing patients because it was irrationally disturbing their oxygen-carbon dioxide balance. So he just adjusting a nasal cannula. No drugs to relax them or stuffing tubes down their trachea. His hospital mortality went to zero while the adjoining hospital continued to have 100% mortality. An absolute all or none difference just by a conservative using standard nasal cannula. Gas mixing recipes and he wasn't even recognizing the importance of having the proper balance of carbon dioxide but still he was not killing any of his patients. Because when you just use the cannula you're retaining the balance of carbon dioxide? Letting the patient balance it himself. And so before they were just pushing in pure oxygen. Yeah, to different extents. And that's been known now for generations that when you artificially ventilate someone, you override their regulating system. And if you slightly exceed the oxygen dose, you drive out the carbon dioxide, which is needed to deliver. Oxygen to the tissues and even the open capillaries you shrink the blood vessels in the brain, for example, and starve the brain for oxygen because you're getting too much oxygen. Yes, and different from using oxygen therapy, but because this is putting it inside the body through unnatural means with a tube. Right. Right, yeah. And you can give too much. For example, just the difference in altitude, if a person is having a regulatory problem, even at sea level, keeping their carbon dioxide up because they're forming lactic acid, there's a natural competition between lactic acid and carbon dioxide. A person tends towards stress or diabetes, for example, their background lactic acid will indicate the appearance that they're under chronic exercise or something, residual lactic acid level, and if you add carbon dioxide, that will suppress glycolysis that makes the excess lactic acid, so you can correct those signs of incipient diabetes and stress by adding some carbon dioxide, and if you rise in altitude and are healthy, your body under lower oxygen pressure is able to regulate itself to maintain higher carbon dioxide. than at sea level. And so adapted people, they've known for at least 50 years, more like 70 years, that they call it the lactic paradox, or the lactic acid paradox, that when you're adapted to high altitude, you can work full force, and you make much less lactic acid than you would doing the same proportion of work at sea level. So the altitude stops your excess lactic acid production because of the retained carbon dioxide. So the lactic acid can be a real issue with all kinds of things, including the heart muscles, right? Yeah, and some of the doctors have, one of the earliest New York City doctors. reported that they weren't low in oxygen, especially, but they were low in carbon dioxide. And that lets the lactate rise and the lactic acid, even in the presence of normal amounts of oxygen, the presence of lactic acid, it creates what they call super... pseudo hypoxia, or reductive stress, which is similar to sepsis and all of the mortality-associated features of COVID. It's all basically a stress syndrome, which is intensified by the treatment and the COVID has a very small... role in triggering that in people who actually have a very intense respiratory infection. So, in general, when we are exercising, we get stronger in lung capacity and such and do not have to breathe as often while we're moving, whatever, treadmill or even walking, we're retaining more carbon dioxide, right? And then that puts more oxygen where we need it in the cells, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's when you're called fit. That's when you're fit. Or well-adapted. Well-adapted. You're making lots of carbon dioxide because you're really using your oxygen. And using the oxygen without over-breathing, right? A person who isn't fit produces lactic acid very easily, even with hardly any activity. Their lactic acid begins to rise. Because they're over-breathing, just breathing too much? Yeah, a perfectly healthy person, if they just sit still and pant for two or three minutes, they'll have a surge of lactic acid. Really? Because the carbon dioxide that suppresses it is gone, and they'll produce a poisonous amount of lactic acid, and that will... cause edema. You get cramps as an early sign of over-breathing, your hands will drop, and that's an indication of loss of carbon dioxide. And along with that, your capillaries and arterioles start becoming edematous, swelling up and losing the ability to transmit oxygen. So you can potentially kill yourself by intense over-breathing. So that's why, that's one of the root causes of edema is just over-breathing. Yeah, and probably 20 or 30% of the population you could find good evidence of over-breathing relative to their needs and metabolism. So the less breaths we take per minute, the better it is, right? Not necessarily. A person with a very high fitness, the most intense metabolism, they need lots of fuel and oxygen. They can sit still and productively burn 3,000 maybe 4,000 calories just because their body is running. At high perfect metabolism, so they need both lots of calories and lots of oxygen. So you have to look at the body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, everything to know what the respiration rate means. So if we are exercising briskly and doing bursts and other things, rebounding and treadmills and we get our pulse rate pretty high. I mean maybe two or maybe three times our normal resting rate or more and we can if we're if we can do that without Breathing or over breathing or retaining carbon dioxide. Is that a sign of good health to get the heart rate up without? having to breathe a lot I don't think it is Necessarily you have to look at at the whole thing. How many calories are you able to burn? How much oxygen can you dispose of in burning those calories? And the most fit person is running at a high rate, even at rest. So they can't get fat on, even if they sit around. Just because they're burning calories because they're fit. That's why they stay fitter, just by burning. Here's an email for you. We love Dr. Pete. Thank you for having him on. You're welcome. Thanks to Dr. Pete. What's Dr. Pete's pregnenolone dosage guidelines for someone in their 30s? Pregnenolone, this is from watching on YouTube, the stream. I was in my 40s, at 48, when I first tested it, and the result was so... absolute that I experimented with different amounts and I found that one dose of 300 milligrams would last me for 10 days and then my symptoms came back or that would work out to 30 milligrams a day and I found many people 10 or 20 milligram dose. I had... Two or three experiences of two extremely depressed men, for example, that they happened to be sipping a glass of wine and being very gloomy and talking about giving up their profession. I dropped 10 or 20 milligrams on their wine, and when they had consumed that, their face got red hot. Pink instead of gray, they started grinning and making plans for improvements in their business. Isn't that funny? Just in 15 minutes, you could see a change from that very, very small amount. Of pregmenolone. Yeah, so it acts as a catalyst and can get your own production going. For an experiment, I took 3,000 milligrams a day for a year and felt fine, but it was very expensive and wasteful. So then I found that I didn't need any because it had repaired my system. And animal studies are similar. They gave rats a stomach full, I think it was a 10 gram. Wad, which would be like about a pound for a person to eat at once, and it didn't have any hormonal effects at all unless they were under stress to begin with, and it normalized, prevented excess cortisol production. So that's why some people recommend even for guys to have a little dab of this Pregnenolone, this natural stuff. Every day. Yeah. Lots of people have been reporting hormonal reactions from it. That means it isn't good Pregnenolone. There should be absolutely no so-called hormonal effect. It should simply normalize things, lowering your ACTH and cortisol if they're too high, bringing them up if they're too low. So you shouldn't feel anything. And maybe just feel a little bit better or a little. Yeah, yeah, there should be. If you're feeling depressed or weak or something, if it's what you need, and often it is when you're in your 40s, the effect happens in less than an hour and is a day or night sort of change. And is this generally from the Good Stuff Ways from Yamstock? No, it doesn't matter where it's made from as long as it's made by someone that knows what they're doing. But in the last 15 years or so, it has become popular. And there are dozens of little chemical companies popping up. And there are no regulations. It's not regulated as a drug or hormone or anything. So you absolutely can't know without doing about it. A $3,000 analysis showing the absence of any of the antagonistic hormones like estrogen. Oh, that could be in the product itself. As an impurity from manufacturing. Oh, wow. Do you have any clean companies you can recommend people? No, but if you know that it's coming from one of the gigantic monopoly companies, they have a history of extreme cleanliness because they're monitored constantly. Oh, you're actually better going with the big boys in this case. Yeah, because they are regulated and the little ones aren't. Interesting. Hi, Dr. Pete. In the past you've spoken favorably of the effects of a FLAC. A microdosing GHB, in Canada GHB is highly regulated and possible to acquire without a prescription and illegal to make yourself, however can be legally purchased and possessed. Is a healthy young adult male in a health, is it safe to ingest microdoses of GBL to get the same results? Oh, GBL to get the same results. What does the old... I don't know. Gamma... Butyrylactone? Yeah, that's the paint thinner, I think. Oh, come on. It used to be sold for 25 cents a quart or something as a paint thinner. Oh. And very non-toxic, but a very powerful paint remover. And the FDA has this policy of knocking traditional... safe drugs off the market, and licensing, even things that have been used for hundreds of years, licensing them to a single artificial monopoly, so that company can raise it from a dime a dose to a hundred dollars a dose, which they've done for treating narcolepsy with GHB. Oh, that's what GHB is, narcolepsy? It was used previously for relaxing people before surgery. It was a very safe sedative effect. You could even anesthetize people with it safely. It didn't have the after-effects that the common anesthetics have. But the FDA... monopolized it and took it off the market. Isn't GHB the date rape drug thing? No. It has been used that way, yeah. It can kill a person in an overdose because it turns everything off. And people are microdosing it, some people? If you eat passion fruit... Passion fruit? Yeah, you get a small, measurable. amount in the tasty passion fruit juice. namely restoring health to a person by restoring proper autonomic nervous system balance by the sympathetic and parasympathetic components that comprise the system. Kelly got his idea from John Beard. John Beard was a doctor at the beginning of the 20th century who theorized that cancer is an embryonic process gone wrong and that the pancreatic enzymes digest proteins and are present in the blood. The same pancreatic enzymes used to digest food by excreting them into the intestine are in the blood. In the Beardian Hypothesis and they digest these ovarian uterine reproductive hormones that in his theory were involved in cancer. William Kelly the dentist adopted the idea when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer as a tactic. The Beard Hypothesis said a deficiency of pancreatic enzymes was involved in cancer. So Kelly started taking, I think it was pork pancreas, dehydrated pork pancreas or beef either way. The only drawback is that they have to be dehydrated but unsterilized. So if there was any infection, bacterial or parasite or whatever in the animal, you can't sterilize it because you're eating the powdered pancreatic tissue. But Kelly had very good results. I was acquainted with him and followed his work and added to his nutritional program. Someone convinced him to put the glutamate in his supplement, and as soon as he made those additions, magnesium glutamate and other mineral glutamates, he began having epilepsy attacks every day starting that January, and he contacted me in spring or early summer. What could be causing his seizures every day, and I looked at the changes in his formula and explained that the glutamates are brain toxic excitatory, and he stopped eating his supplement, and the seizures stopped the very day he stopped his glutamate consumption. � With that success, from my suggestion, he decided to add Pregnenolone to his total vitamin supplement. His lawyer said, �Since it�s not a hormone, you can put it in anything.� So it was just added to his vitamin, mineral, nutritional supplement. And then his� clients started having other health benefits, not just the enzyme effect on whatever cancer they might have, but general health benefits such as eye problems and muscle problems and all of the things related to a steroid imbalance. Very interesting. So should we be... where we have glutamate, some glutamates we see in different supplements and foods? Absolutely. Some of the quantities are enough to seriously imbalance our amino acid intake. Well, and what form do they usually come in with products? What would we look for? Just the word glutamate? Yeah. Monosodium glutamate. Oh, monosodium, of course, yeah. They're generally aware of that, but if you say calcium glutamate or magnesium glutamate, it's the same glutamic acid that is in MSG. Oh, same thing, wow. Dr. Ray Peete is with us, Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com. Your email for your newsletter is newsletterraypeete.com, right? Yeah. No, Ray Peet's newsletter with an S on it. Ray Peet's newsletter at gmail.com. Ray Peet's newsletter at gmail.com. Patrick Timpone, stay right there, Doc, and we're just going to take a quick little break here. I didn't want to do a lot of breaks today just because I was feeling like talking after our technological kind of adventure we had this first hour with the video. So. But we'll do a couple. Previously with the highly credentialed Dr. Thomas Levy, he argues because the literature shows that oxidation is the cause of disease. But the whole point is the location, the concentration, the duration, the distribution of oxidized biomolecules determines 100% of all diseases. And so that's why I say oxidative stress doesn't cause disease. Oxidation is disease. Is disease. If there's no oxidized biomolecules, you don't have a toxin. The toxic effect is oxidation of biomolecules. That's the entirety of it. And by the grace of God, several months ago, George Wiseman said this about hydrogen. Hydrogen is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot. Hmm. First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than vitamin C, things like that. So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your body and go right into the very DNA and repair it. So now it makes sense why George was able to say this back in August 2019 with such conviction. The body accepts that gas. And uses it to heal everything. It's like the fountain of youth. It's astonishing the amount of ailments. In fact, in scientific studies, and they have over a thousand scientific studies now, they are showing that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly from virtually every ailment that ails any water-based life form. Okay, I'm sold. And I was able to get one a couple of months ago thanks to your support. It's called the Aquacure Hydrogen Machine. Breathe the gas and bubble the water. There's a promo code ONERADIO for 10% discount. I think a great investment for you. Knowing what we know now on oneradionetwork.com. Previously with cardiologist Dr. Joel Kahn, 35 years experience in cardiology. On your commercial break you hit a hot button because I'm a giant fan of infrared sauna and the cardiac benefits. Tell us about why you like these saunas for the heart. What does it do? In Japan. It's a traditional therapy of heart disease to even sick heart patients. To sit for fifteen or twenty minutes in an infrared sauna, then lie down and rest and hydrate for about half an hour. They call it WAON, W-A-O-N, it means soothing heat. And they've done research studies like thirty of them in humans, anti-aging your arteries and improves the strength of your heart and may actually prolong survival in sick heart patients. Anybody can just again go to the internet. Read about infrared sauna heart disease or put my name there because I've written many articles about it. Now there's data coming out of Sweden and Finland because they've published some amazing data. That number of times a week you're in a sauna, number of minutes each time. You can just track out how long you're going to live. So very powerful therapy by being in my favorite is an infrared sauna. We have a really nice one that we've been playing around with. Gosh, I'm in there virtually, I'll say five times a week now during the summer. Take a couple days off and in the winter, every day. And it's a great one. It's portable. And if you're watching on UB2B right now, or just look on the sauna page on our website, you get your head sticks out there. They're low EMFs there, just the electrical and magnetic stuff from the floor to the bottom of the chair. And you get that just standing next to your juicer or your refrigerator or driving in your car. So it's definitely not an issue. We do get questions about that. Come in. You're going to sweat and you'll have a very good experience. This is technology out of Taiwan, so obviously they don't go to war with China or in the United States, and we have a problem. But it's a medical university. They've won lots of awards with their technology, so it's a great unit. And for the price, we think it's the very, very best. Somebody sent me a link to a sun-lighter, and I don't want to speak badly about another product, but they were like $5,000. And they're beautiful, and you're a wooden thing and you lay down there for five grand. But I've used those wooden guys, and I've never really been able to do the sweat thing as much. And I can't see how there would be any real advantage at all, except that they're beautiful and you lay down and do a movie star thing, which is cool. But try ours. Check it out. Look on our website. It's the Relaxfar Infrared sauna. We have a special price, $1,150. They don't allow us to put that in print, so $1,150. And we'll hook you up. Just email me, patrick at oneradionetwork.com. Send me an email. That's the only way to get it. patrick at oneradionetwork.com. Talk about your health, wealth and well being on oneradionetwork.com on the third Monday of the month at 1030. So we talked with Dr. Ray Peters website is raypete.com. He has a newsletter comes out a couple times. Every every other every other month, right, Doc, every month? Yeah, six times a year. What's your next one? I think it'll be on education and what's happening under the pandemic program, destruction of conventional education to impose things more efficiently. Ray Pete's newsletter, gmail.com, right? Ray Pete's newsletter. So you're feeling something other than beneficial for the kids with this whole COVID, don't go to school and all of that, and school online? Yeah, the details have been sketched out years in advance. May of 2019, Eric Schmidt, who was chairman of Google for a long time. He went to work for the Pentagon, head of the defense committee on artificial intelligence. In that, he said that for the sake of getting ahead of China, we're going to have to destroy the present economic system. move rapidly to automation using artificial intelligence, for example, in shopping, he said the online shopping is a great experience, especially if you can't get it in the stores. And that online computer remote medicine is going to be better than contact between. Patient and doctor, and you won't spread a disease that way. Digital money, so you don't spread disease. Digital education, so you don't waste time going to school and having actual interaction between student and teacher. And incidentally, the best artificial intelligence programs are owned by Google. And that will monopolize education, and money will be poured into the systems of virtual reality to give even poor kids the same fine curriculum that the rich kids get, and the taxpayers will subsidize this monopoly system of uniform remote education. Fascinating. So this was Eric Smith, and when, and where did he say this? May of 2019, and in, I think it was May of, May or, yeah, yeah, May of 2020, that he went to work with... Governor Cuomo in New York to start revising New York's education, public health, and other systems in line with his plan that was worked out in the Pentagon a year before the pandemic. Oh my goodness. And the May 29 Eric Schmidt comments, where were those, Dr. Pete? Where were those? They're published on the internet. It's called the, I think it's the... National Defense Commission on Artificial Intelligence. I think the initials are N-D-C-A-I. Eric Schmidt. And so he's the head guy at Google? He was. He went from there to the Pentagon to New York. Interesting. Wow. Dr. Ray Peat. Patrick Timpone. I always get a little surprise here. You just never know. Let me turn this thing off. I had it on talking to the geek this morning. Yeah, I don't want this. I don't know how to turn it off. Spam burger. Here's an email. This is from Jeremy. Several months ago I began using EWOT, which is... exercise with oxygen training, okay, and I'm feeling really good and stronger, but I just want to know, are there any cautionary things I should know about using oxygen when exercising that Dr. Pete thinks I should be aware of? If you're adding oxygen your lungs are at risk an increase over the atmospheric, 21% can basically inflame your lungs, do the same things starting to your lungs that the intubation over breathing does to all of the tissues starting with the lungs. Starting with inflammation. So, but what if he does it without over-breathing? Is he still in good, is he okay? Yeah, but I don't know of any value from adding a higher concentration of oxygen during the exercise. Adding a little CO2, I would think, would be more protective. More protective, yeah. You're churning a lot of oxygen through your lungs when you're. Breathing very hard and I think that tends in itself to create lung inflammation. So that CO2 retention again is the key. Please ask Dr. Pete, I'm a 21-year-old guy, this is from Harris, I have chronic chapped lips for about five years now. I think they started after I applied iso. Trathion, T-R-E-T-H-O-I-N on my face for a couple of months. I'm supplementing with thyroid, eating low-pufa diet for the past couple of years. And I've also developed seborrheic dermatitis on sides of my nose in the past several months. I've been taking B-complex supplements to see if the dermatitis, but it doesn't go away. What could be going on? Any ideas? Either a deficiency or a great excess of vitamin A. acts the same. If you're deficient in all of the antioxidant things, all of the stabilizing factors of which vitamin E is just one. If you're deficient in those, an overdose of vitamin A leads to autoxidation. The vitamin A starts catalyzing its own breakdown. And the supplements of retinoic acid, there are three forms of it. Two of them are extremely toxic. The third one, it's a matter of having it in great excess. All of those forms of retinoic acid normally are toxic. Locally derived in very particular tissues, for example the developing embryo is the most noticeable place where you use retinoic acid to create tissues such as the eye. But if it's out of place then it has a toxic effect and leads to the breakdown of the basic safe form retinol. Which is the form that occurs mostly in foods. The retinol begins to be destroyed when you've started catalyzing the breakdown. So it's very hard to know whether to use any supplement at all. So I would suggest if you have those symptoms to rely only... on foods such as milk and eggs for your vitamin A rather than a supplement. It could be getting too much. Yeah, because the system once it starts down that path you need something to interrupt it. And vitamin E and progesterone are things that are known to help to interrupt the process. You might try a lotion of something containing either vitamin E or progesterone on the lips directly to see if that can stop the chapping process, which means your proteins are not being synthesized properly, cells are being formed and dying prematurely. From developing and stop the unhealthy fibrosis and disease the doctors mislabel as aging. The inability to use oxygen properly tends to go with a deficiency of carbon dioxide and lactic acid formation. If you even inject lactic acid it will start this systemic inflammation. So lactic acid is really the fundamental agent of all of these degenerative inflammatory processes. So you want to keep your lactic acid, if possible, below the so-called normal range on the blood tests. If you have a blood test for it, it should be at the extreme bottom. of the test range, because in proportion to the presence of lactic acid, you're moving in the direction of the degenerative diabetes cancer-like metabolism. Are there symptoms that can show us, or bodily symptoms, and the like, that can show us that be symptomatic, if I can use your word again, of too much lactic acid? Well, it is involved in everything that constitutes failure. Excess fatigue is one of the traditional signs. But edema is probably the next. After fatigue, all of the nerve, muscle, digestive failures or inflammatory processes, all of these will be brought on by lactic acid. At an extreme surge of lactic acid, panic attacks are becoming much more common. For you. High percentage of people are starting to have a panic attack, which means they're having a surge of lactic acid. And again, that's not enough CO2, right? Not enough over-breathing. Yeah, and a lot of people find that having even half a teaspoon of baking soda in a couple of ounces of water helps to break an anxiety or... or panic attack. Does baking soda internally affect lactic acid to go down? Yeah, when you absorb the baking soda, the immediate effect increases your alkalinity, but the kidneys just very quickly, it has a diuretic effect and so the sodium goes out very fast, leaving the bicarbonate....which by itself is turned into carbon dioxide, which goes into cells and restores their normal, relaxed, slightly acidic pH. Just a little teaspoon of baking soda. Anything on that order. Half a teaspoon will sometimes make a difference. Interesting. It doesn't hurt to take a teaspoon. Yeah. What's the best way? Write to an emailer. To determine how many calories are best for us and our body. Watching for weight gain. That's it, right. If someone isn't allergic to tomatoes and bell peppers, does that mean that it's okay for us to eat them? Yeah, very good food. Tasty. Does supplementing urea, here's another one. Wow, we just mentioned that the supplementing urea... Take care of edema, supplementing urea. It has been used that way up until the 1960s. It was found, for example, with heart failure that causes generalized edema. People were kept on anywhere from 10 grams per day of urea to... several doses of 10 grams dissolved in fruit juice, grapefruit juice or orange juice, you don't notice the taste of it. And it has maintained people without progression of heart failure for many years. And it was used to treat brain swelling. It was very safe and effective. One kid was... practical brain death, no functions after an accident. They gave him, I think it was a 90 gram dose of intravenous urea over a period of a few hours in a proper solvent and he recovered and went back to school. It was absolutely the right thing. for treating brain swelling or other crucial edema, but some doctors thought of it as an osmolyte like sodium chloride. And so they gave a certain number of grams in distilled water, treating it as if it acted osmodically like salt. And so they gave a certain number of grams in distilled water, treating it as if it acted They found that it broke red blood cells and killed the person by destroying their blood. That was reported, and the idea spread that you can't use urea, you have to use one of the new sugar-based or starch-based things that will draw water....out of the brain into the blood, but they don't work the same way urea does and basically only work part of the time, but the whole failure led to the disuse of urea therapeutically was based on a total ignorance. Urea is not an osmolyte. It has to be added to an isotonic solvent. You start with a solvent like physiological saline or ringers or whatever, something that will not destroy your red blood cells. And then you add the dose of urea, neglecting completely its so-called osmotic potential. And then the... urea acts by entering cells. It isn't an osmolyte, it doesn't stay outside. It goes into the cell, modifies the cell's water-retaining functions, causes the cell to return to normal and excrete the water. So it's not pulling the water out, it's pushing it out from the inside. So a demon, these things are basically kidney. issues. Well, the kidney eventually handles it, but it's an intracellular thing. When you don't have enough carbon dioxide, your cell loses the ability to excrete water. Lactic acid shifts the electrons in the direction that cause the cell substance to crave water. Lactic acid makes the cell... have more electrons, is more attractive to water, and so it swells up. And the edema, the urea, and or the carbon dioxide change that electronic behavior of the cells, countering lactic acid, making the cell resist water, push the water back out, and return to normal. Well, it sounds like the CO2 is pretty good stuff. I mean, what's the, what are some of the main ways we retain more CO2? Thyroid is our basic thing. Thyroid? If you're low thyroid, you're basically always hyperventilating. Really? You would be doing it but not knowing it? Knowing it? Yeah, because the cell isn't producing carbon dioxide at the normal rate. Oh. And if it isn't producing carbon dioxide, you're not taking it in from the outside, then any little need for energy, the cell will burn some sugar, turn it into lactic acid without burning it all the way to carbon dioxide. Interesting. Wow. So a low thyroid could be doing all kinds of things that, unless you talk to somebody like you or really do your research, you wouldn't know, right? You just wouldn't know it. I have a DMR, I have this, and by connecting the dots, that's why we're very grateful to have you on, Dr. P. Thanks for being here once a month. Checking your temperature is the next best thing to measuring your oxygen consumption and CO2 output. First thing in the morning, we went around the 98.6. Well, 97.8 is okay early in the morning, but then it should after breakfast. Get up to temperature. Do those little things you kind of use on your forehead, are they pretty accurate or do you need to use stick it in your mouth kind of mercury? The mercury in the mouth is very very absolutely accurate. The infrared in the ear of the instrument is well designed. That's very quick and handy to use and accurate enough. Yeah, I had one of those infrared in the ear things I played with, but they'd always come up these different numbers, you know, so I got really leery of using it. Yeah, some of the instruments are kind of... Not very good, huh? May I ask Dr. Pete to clarify the difference between using T4 or T3 or both products for thyroid health? Does Dr. Pete recommend the Mexican brands of Sino Plus and Cytomel? Are there any USA ways to buy these? You can find drugstores on the internet that sell them and check the price. The more people buy, the more likely you are to find rip-off prices. They should be in the vicinity of $15 a bottle. So those two that you mentioned, those are just... T3s right? No, one is a good balance of T4, T3 that imitates the old 40-year-ago standard of Armour Thyroid or Thyrolar, which was the Armour company's synthetic, and that exact formula was taken up by Xenoplus, and I've been, since the Armour company, sold to a cosmetic company. And then it has gone through ownership changes and price increase from a penny appeal to a dollar appeal. I, in the 90s, started using Xenoplus and Xenomil. So Xenoplus is 4 and 3 and 4, and Xenomil is... It's pure T3. Okay, so Xenoplus would be, you want to get both if you're going to do it? Um, most people... Do okay with Xenoplus, and it's quick acting compared to the glandular, so it's best to break the tablet into two or three doses per day, because you can feel the action starting right in your mouth if you chew it up, where the glandular pill has to be digested. It takes two or three hours to get... digested and broken down and produce the active hormones. That's the Seno Plus, right? The Seno Plus. Seno Plus, yeah, is the quick acting combination product. And again, the difference between the Senomil? Senomil is only the active hormone and its activity peaks in an hour and a half roughly after you take the pill, and then it starts down. And it's half gone within about 12 hours. So if you try to take one T3 pill in the morning, like the drugist will often tell you, by 12 hours later, at bedtime, you're hypothyroid. So the plus, you know, plus, they'll stick around longer, those T3 and T4? Yeah, in the late 1940s. When they were starting to synthesize T4 companies that became the major producer of Synthroid synthetic thyroxine, they tested their synthetic on 25-year-old male medical students, the healthiest population imaginable. They compared the glandular armor product with their synthetic and they said it worked exactly the same as the natural thyroid. So that was the basis now for 70 years, substituting for the natural, which had established all of our knowledge about thyroid hormone function. It was done on the basis of natural thyroid. The fact that it lowers cholesterol, for example, immediately, there's no cholesterol excess problem if you don't have a thyroid problem. But since that idea that 25-year-old males respond to the synthetic the same way to do the natural. They failed to take into account the experiments that had already shown that estrogen blocks the ability to convert thyroxin into the active hormone. And so they didn't test their product on even 25-year-old females, much less 38-year-old women, at the peak of their estrogen, in a very high proportion of... middle-aged women, thyroxine, if it accumulates, can even have an antithyroid action by suppressing your pituitary, showing zero TSH, and so no stimulation of the thyroid gland, and so no formation of T3, at the University of Oregon Medical School in the 1970s. A doctor had prescribed a hundred micrograms, which was a moderate dose of thyroxin, to a hypothyroid woman, and after a few months she didn't improve, so he increased the dose to 200, over months got it up to 400 micrograms of thyroxin per day, and she went into a myxedema coma. And was taken into the medical school hospital, where they found she had absolutely no detectable T3 in her body, explaining the coma. Her brain simply wasn't making carbon dioxide or energy. So they gave her intravenous T3 immediately, came out of the coma. Recovered from the massive edema, mixed edema, and they put her on a mixed product containing T3 to maintain her, and there was no problem. But there are milder cases like that, millions of them around the country, women being prescribed Cyroxin, and the response being measured in terms of how much they're... TSH is being suppressed and it's totally ignoring their body temperature, their symptoms, their cholesterol, all of the basic absolute indicators of what the thyroid is doing and how much is needed. Interesting. If you... what would be, is there such a thing as like the perfect cholesterol number, I mean the big number that everybody... Talks about, you know, 180, 200 or... Do you have a fave number that you kind of like to see? Oh, it depends on your age. The Framingham study found that basically no one who had their cholesterol well over 200, very low incidence of dementia, if they kept their cholesterol... up over the age of 50, but those who were below 200 had an extremely high dementia incidence. That's explained because your gonads and adrenals depend on the amount of cholesterol in the blood for making the protective steroid hormones. In an experiment with an isolated ovary, for example, they measured the amount, keeping the thyroid hormone level, they measured the amount of progesterone coming out of the vein from the ovary and they varied the amount of cholesterol going into the artery to the ovary. And as they increased, they measured the amount of progesterone coming out of the vein from the cholesterol in the blood going in, the amount of progesterone coming out of the ovary corresponded and increased. So rising cholesterol is adaptive, keeping your brain steroid hormones up, keeping your ovarian systemic hormones up, your adrenal hormones, everything, your brain especially depends on the adequate amount of cholesterol in the blood and if your thyroid is low that means you require more cholesterol in the blood to keep your brain supplied with steroids and so hypothyroid people properly and adaptively have a proportionally high cholesterol. Oh, because they need it to keep it in balance. Mm-hmm. So that would be the argument for all the people of the dangers of statins and them getting this cholesterol down in guys for like 120 and 130 Kestrelol. Yeah, that's biologically crazy. It's making it impossible to make the brain steroids. My goodness. Could you ask Dr. Pete to improve myocardial respiration for myocardial infarction? Are there certain times of the day that would be better than others for doing such things as bag breathing and red light exposure? Oh, exercise is always safest in the afternoon. Someone did a study of having people jog before breakfast and then after breakfast and took a blood sample and found broken chromosomes. In their blood cells, if they jogged before breakfast, when blood sugar was not adequate, after breakfast there were no broken chromosomes caused by the stress of running or the increased lactic acid. Other experiments show that later in the day, your ability to resist stress damage. is at its highest of the day. Oh, interesting. More at 3, 4, 5 o'clock, that kind of time? Interesting. Kira wants to know what you think about eating raw meat, given that it is a good source. Specifically, is it better or worse digested? And what could be benefits from having it raw? Oh, it's slightly better nutritionally, very easy to digest, and you don't risk the carcinogens produced by... overheating it. But the thing that keeps me from eating it, either rare or raw, is the possibility of various kinds of infections, bacterial or protozoal or whatever. That's why I think some of the raw meat people, they sear it everywhere pretty good to kill anything on the outside. But it could still be on the inside though, right? Yeah, if the animal has a disease, you're being exposed to it, and a healthy digestive system can handle it, but I prefer to cook it rather than trust my digestive system. What does Dr. P think about the Texas Dr. Bartlett who is successfully using BU- D-E-S-I-N-D-E Steroid Inhaler for COVID. Malik is using cortisol injections for seven days with a bunch of supplements like C and zinc and the British now success with interferon beta. Have you seen this Dr. Bartlett's videos about using this? Haven't seen these videos but any way you take in an anti-inflammatory substance since since the essence of the COVID symptoms of mortality, the essence is inflammation. All kinds of anti-inflammatory things are going to be helpful. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, the combination studies of those two, they're ridiculed by the know nothing doctors. Because they say neither of them killed viruses, one is an antibiotic and the other is for autoimmune conditions. Those are anti-inflammatory. The azithromycin and erythromycin happen to be very effective anti-inflammatory agents. And so they're missing the point that they are. Extremely therapeutic. Anything anti-inflammatory is helpful. Carbon dioxide is our simplest, most basic anti-inflammatory substance. Carbon, CO2. Yeah, aspirin, progesterone, cortisol, a thousand different safer things. The synthetic. Glucocorticoids used for asthma inhalants will immediately protect you against the inflammation, but they have the long range problems of tissue breakdown. Do you think there's any connection? I mean, let me put on my tinfoil hat with this whole demonization of CO2 and the good stuff about it. I mean, is that possible? The demonization of CO2 in our culture with man-made global warming and all that. Yeah, but at least the pandemic, the founding chairman of the World Economic Forum announced the theme of their January 2021 World Conference. will be the great reset and he said the global warming thing was helping us to eliminate the old fossil fuel economy but that has been coming along very slowly and luckily we now have the pandemic allowing for almost instant change shutting down the old economy by fiat rather than uh... gradual legislation interesting you know we've been hearing a lot about that spot potential reset here is a fellow from i don't know where really so i think it sounds like africa doesn't methylene blue taking orally is that dangerous uh... people take unnecessarily big doses of it uh... there have been reports of it uh... interacting with uh... the SSRI uh... antidepressants and such uh... but it's effective in doses of one-tenth of a milligram uh... on the order of uh... T-3-saccharide. One-tenth? He says that he's taken, Dr. Jean-Philippe says he's taken a one percent solution and I take one milligram of that. Oh, that's good. Yeah, I think that's a safe dose. Yeah. Oh, so one milligram of one percent. That's pretty small. Yeah, one milligram of the actual substance people have used for treating depression and get almost immediate results the way they would with a similar dose of T3. Because it activates your mitochondrial respiration in very similar ways to thyroid hormone. Here's an email from RJ. My doctor prescribed using 4 liters of oxygen per minute to sleep with using an oxygen concentrator. I also use supplemental hydrogen gas called bronze gas. Is that okay or do I need to change? I don't think concentrated. Oxygen is safe. You just don't like it? Don't they put, though, most people in nursing homes? Very often they do things that accelerate deaths while keeping them quiet. Oh, good. So, again, for Robert, for R.J., what is his concerns using even four liters a minute, which isn't very much, while sleeping? I think any excess is a risk, starting with the lungs. If you improve your metabolism, historically, probably the most widely used successful chemical treatment is using acetazolamide. Which makes your body retain the carbon dioxide that a hypothyroid person isn't making enough of. And that keeps stimulating your breathing apparatus during the night and prevents sleep apnea. So, metabolically keeping your CO2 up with progesterone and or a thyroid. And all of the nutritional things work the same as the C2S in inhibiting the enzyme that eliminates carbon dioxide. This is from CISO. We have a few more that we'll let you go back to work. It seems to me, as Dr. Pete has mentioned, that as long as the body has all the nutrients it needs and is spiritually well, it will do pretty well....be immune to most diseases. Am I wrong? Does Dr. Pete believe a real potent bioweapon is possible out there with COVID? Yeah, healthy people simply don't notice when they are exposed to the various viruses. The viruses take and act on people who are already sick. Women, after menopause, that isn't officially a sickness, but it represents the effect of 40 years of a bad diet, too much pufa in the diet, adds up, modifies the estrogen-progesterone balance and the excitatory processes in the brain shift you. Away from progesterone production, at menopause, the women who have had practically, there is almost a zero mortality from COVID in women who are healthy and cycling and not using any estrogen supplements such as birth control. But starting at menopause and increasing... in old age, women catch up with men in susceptibility to COVID infection and mortality, because their estrogen goes down. I mean their progesterone goes down and the estrogen comes up. Good morning, you two. I have come in late, but I heard you talking about lactic acid. We have these symptoms of too much. Is only baking soda the go-to? A lot of people find that can help to break an anxiety attack and helps with their endurance by tending to keep their production of, for example, athletes take as much as a tablespoon before an endurance by cycling or run and it keeps being absorbed from their ____. the stomach and intestine for part of the race that tends to keep their lactic acid production suppressed. Cindy's in Arkansas or Alabama, Rogersville, Alabama, and she gets fever blisters and they do not get fluid filled but they've been they've been a non-stop for over about four months. Any ideas what could be going on? um the the immune system is being disturbed. Pituitary, excitatory and stress hormones tend to excite the the nerves allowing the the virus to reproduce. So checking things like the the amount of sugar and carbohydrate in your diet, make sure you're not eating too much fat in proportion to your carbohydrate which can increase your lactic acid and turn on the stress hormones. Too many carbs can? No, too few carbs. Oh, good. When you're under stress you liberate free fatty acids and if you eat a lot of fat that increases your free fatty acids and turns off your ability to use glucose oxidatively and that. It increases your lactic acid and the lactic acid keeps these stress hormones going and maintains the inflammation that lets the virus replicate. So when you say carbs, Dr. P, do vegetables count or do we want to also do some complex carbs like corn or rice or whatever? If you handle them and they're well cooked, but the things like well-cooked summer squash, for example, is a very easy-to-digest kind of starch. Very well-cooked rice is okay. Tortillas, hominy are probably the easiest to digest starch because they've been processed by lime that makes them very easy to digest. There's a fellow that has a great natural pig company. Doc, and he has a booth in Dripping Springs Farmers Market and is a new product with different colored tortillas. And he says, let me tell you about these tortillas, they've been nixtamized. So this guy goes, isn't that cool, going through the whole thing, yeah. Yeah, they're more nutritious, much, much safer and easier to digest, right, you've told us? Yeah. So Naomi wants to know, could C-H-I-T-O-S-A-N-E help detox poofers? Since it kind of binds to fat, just... Any fibrous food helps to carry stuff out of you. Raw carrots and well-cooked mushrooms are a pleasanter thing than chitosan. You don't need to buy a supplement, you can just choose the most fibrous foods. Oat bran is additive to breakfast cereal. It's a pleasant way to get a lot of fiber. So that'll take some things out like poofers if there's too many of those hanging around. Yeah, and for a weight loss diet it helps to simply keep some of the fat from being absorbed and carries it out of you. Lynn wants to know what you think about intermittent fasting, say eating only from noon to 6 p.m. as many people are recommending. The studies have been done on very specialized populations of mice or highly trained athletes for example. And I don't think it applies to people on an average activity schedule. So you don't think just overall it's beneficial just to do that once a day? I don't think it applies for anyone. With a borderline metabolic problem which applies to about half of the population, it can increase the stress to go extra hours without food. Kane wants to know, help us understand why high dose PUFAs like fish oil seem to help so many thrive for decades from athletes to brain injury. Fish oil has helped and is helping many perform at high levels. How can you explain that because you're so against them? By the time it gets absorbed into your bloodstream, it's becoming highly oxidized. If you leave it out at room temperature, it gets sticky, it starts to form varnish. And at body temperature, 98 degrees in your blood, with oxygen pumped into the blood, that's when the oxidative breakdown happens. It's extremely fast and these oxidative fragments are powerfully immunosuppressive. They knock out the enzymes that form prostaglandins, for example. They knock out the inflammatory process very helpfully in the short term. But meanwhile... Over a period of six months, you start damaging the functional long-range effect of your immune system and run the risk of immune deficiency syndrome. My goodness. Here is Maythene. She says, I have a 14-month-old granddaughter who has eczema. It says sometimes she scratches herself so much it's hard to see and prevent her from scratching. What can I do to help? We're just at a loss here. My goodness, 14 month old. Checking the diet thoroughly for potentially irritating poorly digested foods would be the first thing. Then if you don't find particular foods like bread or pasta would be first things to consider. Then you might... consider a blood test for vitamin D deficiency, or too much phosphate in the diet, an excess of meat, for example, or for milk and cheese. Those things can activate the inflammatory system. Dr. P, do you think it's worth the expense or the effort to get... raw cheeses as opposed to just old pasteurized cheese? No, I think the really important thing is if you have a reaction to the cheese, lots of people have started having bad reactions digestively or allergically. Look at the labels if they don't say just milk, salt. Natural cultures, traditional cheeses might say natural cultures, but just milk, salt and rennet are the basic safe ingredients. If it says vegetable rennet, that can mean an engineered enzyme system, a manufactured... a bunch of fungal enzymes, for example, two-thirds of the commercial cheeses are now using those so-called cultures and enzymes bought from a manufacturing company rather than acquired in the barn or the cave where they age the cheese. So what are the ingredients that are just we want to look for in cheeses? Milk, salt, and rennet. And that's it? More than that, just find another one? It's questionable. It's questionable. Final question for Dr. Ray Peet. Great stuff today. Thank you, sir. The U.S. government wants high-tech immunity passports, potentially, for everyone as soon as possible. What does Dr. Peet think the chances of this come in? I think you can get the necessary context for that. Partly in Eric Schmidt's last year's speech, partly in the Rockefeller Foundation's 2010 publication on the planning, basically, for the coming pandemic and reset of the economy. They called it getting people in lockstep, and they used China. That's the example of how people could be forced to shift to absolute lockstep conformity. Yes, sir. Many people are arguing that this whole social distancing and masking sheltering at home is kind of a training ground for that. Oh, right. It's obedience training. When you put on the mask, you're telling the public. is that you are an obedient servant doing an irrational thing. There have been 17 well-known studies of the effectiveness of wearing a mask. Three of them weren't proper controlled studies. The good 14 studies that were done with controls, the best quality science, found no effect, no benefit from wearing a mask. So if you're wearing a mask, you're an obedient but not fully rational citizen. Wow. And we've seen that even science shows that these 95 or whatever they call them, Doc, that the P95s are something that they don't do anything more than the cloth as well. There is now evidence that the... the coronaviruses are aerosol, they are particles smaller than a bacterium, and an aerosolized bacterium even can, to some extent, they can go right through ordinary masks, but the aerosolized virus almost encounters no resistance, even in the best... masks. In the best masks, no resistance, just goes poof, right through. Wow. Well, it's a brave new world, doc. If you'd like to get Dr. Ray Peet's newsletter, it's raypeets, that's plural, newsletter at gmail.com. And if you're thinking about school and concerned about your kids, he has a whole thing coming up on schools and education that I'm sure will be interesting to read. Boy, it looks like it's going to be... Boy, the folks are rebelling out there. They want their kids to school. It's a real clash, isn't it, from the school... I don't know why the school... People that control the schools are so intent on keeping the schools closed. They want to keep in good with the government. The government can turn off their... their money supply or apply pressure to them, so they're being obedient. But isn't President Trump, he's been talking, he doesn't want to close them, one says they should open. Other parts of the government, right? Yeah, he isn't really in control, as you can see with the hydroxychloroquine issue. The FDA just rescinded their emergency permission. to use it and they say it causes dangerous heart rhythm problems and liver failure and kidney damage and all kinds of things. In 80 years of use it was never found to cause those now suddenly and less than a month after a very good study of 2,500 patients in Henry Ford Hospital. Health system that found a 50% reduction in mortality in the people who used hydroxychloroquine. Now the FDA says it's too dangerous and absolutely ineffective. The FDA public health service has something in mind other than public health. And we'll leave it at that. Dr. Pete, thanks so much. Great show today. We appreciate it. You take care of yourself, and I'm going to go out and get some oranges. Thanks a lot. Dr. Ray Pete, Patrick Timpone,<|it|><|translate|> for a while. Well, here you are. We're going to try again to do the video thing. We're going to get it tomorrow. Well, Brandon Smith doesn't have a video camera, so that'll be... We'll see if I'm going to be on there. Just so we can get it all straightened out today. And then also Tim O'Shea, who I think he has a... I saw a story about Tim O'Shea. Dr. O'Shea says he's going to give somebody a whole bunch of money if they can show me a coronavirus... show me the virus. I think he's offering a reward, lest I hurt. So it should be a good show. We're going to have some fun. Brandon Amelani, it's been a long time. He's a really cool guy. Chinese medicine fellow. We'll talk a lot about herbs and immune systems and exercise and cool stuff. And then also, who else is coming on Wednesday? I should certainly know that. Oh, Richard Mayberry. He's on the last Wednesday of the month. Pretty fun. So, I will see you all tomorrow. Thanks for your ongoing support. Again, we apologize for some of the strange things that went on this first hour. Early this morning at 9 o'clock, we had the thing all working and I tested it yesterday and something didn't work and there's something going on that's just not compatible with our studio and I didn't know that... you couldn't hear the audio. I didn't test the audio and so when we made it right on the video today with Dr. Massey, you couldn't hear the guest talking on the audio. So, we'll have to figure that one out before we do it again. Alright, I love you all very much. Thanks a lot. Take care of yourself. Let me know if I can help with anything. Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com. Take care. See you in the morning. May the blessings be. We are listener-supported, one radio network.
