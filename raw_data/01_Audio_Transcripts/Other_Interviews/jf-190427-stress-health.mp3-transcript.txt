 Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell show. I am, as usual, Jodell, and I am so excited to have Dr. Ray Peet with me today, and he's someone you're about to come to love just as I do, and he graciously is sharing his time with me today over the phone. You will be amazed at the knowledge that... he is about to drop, I'm sure, the laundry list of credentials this man holds as well as just his passion for helping people. Well, let's just say it's more than you or I could ever dream of holding. So Dr. Pete has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon specializing in physiology. He was taught at the University of Oregon Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad Veracruzana. And the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico, so hopefully I pronounced those right. And Blake College as well. And over the years has worked with many private clients with nutritional counseling. And he started his research in 1968, so long before any of us so-called nutrition nerds who make videos on YouTube, myself included, were even born. Mainly regarding progesterone and the hormones closely related to it. As protectors of the body's structure and energy against harmful effects of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen. I'm not done yet. He also is an editor and writer of his famous newsletter he puts out. As well as the author for some fantastic quick reads when you have a moment. One of which is my favorite, Nutrition for Wisdom. He's also an artist and some of his artwork as well as his amazing blog post can be seen at raypeat.com. So, Dr. Pete, I'm so excited to speak with you today. How are you doing? Very good, thank you. Oh, good. So will you please tell my listeners briefly what got you into this passion you have for all things related to stress, hormones, thyroid, and really helping people feel more optimal? In the 1950s and 60s, I was interested in......psychology and language, and I started a school in Mexico, Blake College, and that was just a general liberal arts school for both... United States, uh, student and local Mexican students, but in the process I noticed that lots of the local people in Mexico were eating a very bad diet and a couple of my friends had family members who were very sick and having read Adele Davis' books, I suggested some of her nutritional therapies. For example, a friend's nephew had been on a diet for more than a year and he was on a the hospital for two or three days with diarrhea that they couldn't control and the third day I think was they said she wouldn't live to night and at that point my friend decided to No harm in trying the vitamin B6 supplement that was one of Adele Davis' recommendations for diarrhea. He gave the little kid this 10mg tablet of vitamin B6. and within the hour her diarrhea had stopped, she was recovered in just a couple of days. These are no more problems, just a single vitamin did what the whole hospital staff put in place. manage with intravenous treatments and so on so I realized that a lot of information wasn't getting into the medical system I decided after coming back to the u.s. to study biology instead of just the humanities, language, psychology, and literature, and in graduate school, I... I ran into the same dogmatism and ignoring the really important practical information. I had planned to study brain biology, but I saw that the professors were locked in....into a dogmatic view of how a nerve works, and looking through the whole University of Oregon, I found that... The reproductive physiology department was actually doing open research trying to discover what causes the infertility of a baby. aging and what the real factors in fertility and maintaining pregnancy are, so I've shifted from brain biology to reproductive physiology and in examining what the factors are that make it possible for a fertilized opium to develop. the whole organism and a nervous system, I found. but the brain is governed and formed by the same factors that govern the question of fertility Infertility. It's a very simple sort of a spectrum. The same things that cause infertility cause bad development of the brain. The brain is really the most sensitive part of the organism. The same factors that make it healthy make it possible for the ovum to implant in the uterus. So I concentrated on the factors that are regulated by the uterus. hormones of fertility and I realized that the drug industry at that time Already for almost 30 years have been propagandizing the public with the idea that estrogen is the female hormone and in our lab we saw that estrogen is the female hormone. Estrogen was the contraceptive hormone, not the hormone of fertility and pregnancy. The pharmaceutical industry knew that Estrogen made a good contraception pill. It was actually causing abortions, but they didn't want to call it the abortion pill. So they called it the anti-conception pill and the real hormone of fertility and brain development turns out to be progesterone. which works by providing energy to the developing embryo. In the form of oxygen and glucose primarily Making energy most efficiently by oxidizing glucose and estrogen It's just one of the factors that interrupts that process. It creates a local sort of implement. in the uterus, a kind of wound that will allow the ovum to be embedded in the tissue. If the estrogen stays dominant, it kills the open, so the function of the progesterone is to knock the estrogen out of the tissue and shift that wound physiology or local stress inflammatory physiology into a supportive, oxidative, sugar-rich wound. Wow, that is, it's not at all what we've been taught. You know, even from a young age I was always taught the importance of estrogen, but now we can clearly see based on what you're saying that it is like propaganda what you mentioned. So a lot of your work is done around these specific hormones like progesterone, but also when, the reason I really got interested in your work is because I think that's what you're doing. I think that's what you're doing. I think that's what you're doing. Because you talk so much about stress and how it affects our system And I mean, would you say that stress is really the driving factor behind most disease and that it contributes to the rise in estrogen? The way I define stress, I would say that it is the factor in all of the diseases that we're dealing with. disease. If you define it as a mismatch between organism and... environment, then even the so-called genetic diseases are, for example, if you have sickle anemia in your genes, it happens that in Africa that's a defensive gene and if the people are eating a certain type of diet that maintains an oxidative condition in the cells, there is no sickle cell disease. It's simply a defensive mutation in that environment. But when you don't have that environment then it shows up as a disease. But when you're under stress, the cells change shape and cause pain and stress. sickness and possibly death. So the genetic diseases turn out to be a disease of stress when the environment isn't properly supportive. So you can see even genetic and infectious diseases as... of stress. If you have good nutrition then the various Bacteria in the environment would cause dysentery, for example, because your immune system takes care of them and stops the whole inflammatory process. And inflammation is the basic factor in why stress causes disease, and it's almost entirely overlooked as a factor in stress, now it's coming to be recognized as a matter of all kinds of disease, heart disease and obesity. are seen to originate with a stress physiology, but what they're missing is that stress leads to inflammation, and that leads to the various, uh... specific diseases. Wow, and when you say stress, you're not really just talking about like day-to-day living stress. You're talking about environmental stressors like radiation. You're talking about pollutants. You're talking about the emotional stress, the mental stress, and all of that environmental stress together, right? Yeah, it's when the environment is putting demands on you that you don't have the internal resources to meet them. For example, an 18 or 20 year old person who is well fed can meet all kinds of changes of weather and climate and physical demand, work, exertion, and so on and so forth. on without any stress at all, that same activity would kill someone who wasn't working. or maybe who was 80 or 90 years old, so it's the matter of what kind of resources you have internally in proportion to the stress. Can you help us understand like these stressors of our modernized society like I mentioned like radiation and even artificial light and things like that that can stress our system. What are all of the things like in our modernized society that have led to this stress as the main driving factor behind disease? The industry, the drug industry, but all kinds of technological industries have tried to cover up the fact that they are causing not only the disease of the people. to their products and byproducts, but even to the offspring, descendants of those people that they're exposing. So there's a big propaganda movement over the last 100 years to try to convince the public that pollution is not harmful. So there's a big propaganda movement over the last 100 years to try to convince the public that pollution is not harmful. So there's a big propaganda movement over the last 100 years to try to convince the 60 years ago the government was at the campaign to tell people that radiation was good for you You've probably heard that Hormesis is the idea radiation hormesis or poison hormesis That a little poison is good for you That is a perversion of the idea of stress That is a perversion of the idea of stress That is a perversion of the idea of stress challenge seeing, for example, a tennis game competition or swimming a certain distance and so on Meeting a challenge that is interesting actually builds your body and abilities of having a goal to build something. You develop your skills in doing it, so you're becoming more in meeting that challenge. That is not a stress. A stress is something that, a demand that's put on you that you didn't ask for. don't have the ability to do easily, and with pleasure. So when pleasure isn't involved in the action, it's probably going to be harmful to you in some way. So, just doing a boring and stupid job like many people spend their lives doing, that is poisoning your tissues constantly because you're not getting pleasure out of the activity. I read that in Hans Selye's book, Stress Without Distress. That was one of the main sentences that I underlined when I was reading that book was how the stress that we're under has a lot to do with the fact that many people live these lives trying to appease their parents or this job that they think they should do but they really don't like. And at the end of their life, they're left frustrated and more stressed than ever, and they usually die of disease because of the stress that they're under. The chronic day in and day out life of something they didn't choose, and they didn't want to live, and it was miserable existence, and they didn't serve a purpose. So, I mean, I don't think people think about how that is a stressor, too, just doing a job that you don't love. Did you ever hear about the rat studies in which they enriched their environment, gave them toys and things to play with and explore, versus the rats that lived in ordinary little... cases and what happened to their brains in the early 1960s at the University of California Marion Diamond and several other people were they found that the environment richness cause the brain to function better The rats that had a playpen rather than a little box to live in solved problems. better and they wondered why the brains were functioning better they found that their enzymes had changed very distinctly and when they let those animals reproduce He's had bigger brains and were again more intelligent than the parents so it's an inheritable brain improvement that happens just by having an enjoyable daily routine or lack of routine uh daily little novel experiences, entertaining things to discover. with the rats had tight-gound equipment like swings and slides and balls and things and more recently it has been found that the Enriched Environment rats not only had bigger, more intelligent brains, but their whole bodies were producing more progesterone. And more recently still, they were found to have lower levels of estrogen. Back in the 70s, Marion Diamond found that if you gave animals a supplement of progesterone, their brains were bigger. And if you gave them, when the mother was pregnant, if you gave her estrogen, their brains were shrunken because it stopped the growth by tossings. Wow. Okay, so what you're saying is this enjoyment is what I call vitamin P, pleasure, passion, purpose, and I feel like there are a lot of people that are just doing a job and not living a passion or a purpose, but that's one thing that drew me to you is you can tell that what you're doing is a passion and it certainly serves a purpose. And I found you almost two years ago when I went through a really bad toxic mold exposure and my thyroid was hugely affected by that exposure. So it was a huge stressor on my body, even though I live a life that's pretty happy and I love my job and everything. But my stress came from that environmental stress of like it completely tore apart my body. It completely broke down my thyroid just from that toxic mold exposure that took about a year and a half to bring my system back. to full health from. So, how does the thyroid, I know you talk a lot about the thyroid and you're pretty passionate about it, how does the thyroid get affected by chronic stress or even acute stressors like a toxic mold? I was talking about the polarity and fertility and brain development of estrogen and progesterone. In the background, the oxidative sugar metabolism that is controlled by... on the Cell level by estrogen and progesterone in the background it requires thyroid hormone to work You don't have any oxygen metabolism without thyroid so so that's the without which not the progesterone operates and when someone a cultured took a slice Thyroid gland put it in a cultured dish and added hormones to it They saw that if you added progesterone, the thyroid gland secreted the active thyroid hormone It activated enzymes causing the thyroglobulin or colloids that's stored in the cell Thanks for watching! to break down into the active thyroid hormones and when they added estrogen to the culture dish it blocked those enzymes and stopped the secretion but it allowed the cells to go on synthesizing the thyroglobulin without being able to produce the hormones. So that single experiment explained why girls in their teens and women around menopause so often have a swollen thyroid gland. Those are the times when estrogen has the risk of becoming dominant. If you're under stress, you can't produce enough progesterone. And in that condition the thyroid gland keeps producing the colloid or globulin but it can't convert it into the active hormone and so your pituitary keeps driving the gland harder trying to make it produce hormone. and swell up. And so many women have had their thyroid gland destroyed either with surgery or radiation when all they needed was something to either lower the estrogen or give them a progesterone supplement. I was just amazed at how my thyroid being damaged led to things like I had never had cellulite before and in three months time of an exposure to mold, the back of my legs went from completely smooth to completely cellulite ridden. What was the mechanism behind that? When your thyroid isn't adequate, regardless of how much estrogen is in your tissue, your cells act as if they are under the influence of a cellulite. Something I found in my research at the university was that estrogen's effects can't be distinguished chemically. The metabolic effects can't be distinguished from the effects of radiation, x-rays or suffocation, the elimination of oxygen or poisoning with cyanide or other things that poison your oxidative system. And interestingly at that time people had already identified polyunsaturated fatty acids as the source of AIDS. And estrogen and radiation and oxygen deprivation all accelerate the formation of age pigment, causing the polyunsaturated fatty acids to spontaneously oxidize and turn into a pigment which in itself consumes and wastes oxygen. So, that got me....interested in what the chronic exposure to polyunsaturated fats in the diet is doing to people, and the poisons... such as your mold poisoning, all these poisonings of different sources, chemically or physically, they all end up acting like estrogen in that they poison your ability to use oxygen. Wow. I'm like, I didn't even think about that. Like I didn't even think about it really being like an estrogen in my body. And that makes complete sense because estrogen does put weight on your body and I changed nothing. In fact, I exercised the same. I ate the exact same and yet I kept putting on weight and I was like, this is not me. Like I'm a, I'm a nutritionist. I know how to heal my body. I know how to feed my body and yet nothing was working. It was like I was fighting a losing battle. So. That's so interesting that the mold actually acted like an estrogen. Are there other things that also act like estrogens in our body too? I know there's Xenoestrogens and like Obesogens and things like BPA plastics and stuff. But maybe there's other things that people don't think of that are acting like estrogens. In the 1930's soot was found to be highly estrogenic and it was found to have a lot of estrogens. That explains why smoke is such a carcinogen, it simply is very intense. estrogen from a gob of black soot, you can extract many different estrogens that were just like the manufactured synthetic estrogens. One of the research companies were using soot derivatives to discover new estrogen products. Tamoxifen, the anti-estrogen so-called, which itself has some estrogen effects. It grew out of that research of why soot is estrogenic. Anything that stimulates the cell so intensely that the oxidative system can't keep up or anything that interrupts the use of oxygen. My recent newsletter on particulate... especially nanoparticles much smaller like a tenth the size of a bacteria or smaller these things are some of the mature naturally in sand storms and such but in the street...smoke output... the friction of tires on pavement, the condensed materials from the smoke of vehicle traffic, and not only these somewhat natural powdered materials put into the atmosphere, but the industry has discovered that nanoparticles are very convenient additives to, for example, stick and shampoo. toothpaste, even the second food and it's permitted to use them as food additives but when they're absorbed through the lungs or through the intestine or even through the skin they enter cells and as an insoluble particle if they have just the right shape they act as a constant stimulating irritant to the cell and that sort of This proportion between stimulation or irritation and the ability to supply energy, that has an estrogenic and potentially carcinogenic action. Wow, and some of these toxins in our environment you're talking about, would those also be in supplements? Oh, that's a horrifying thing that some of the titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide, some of it is larger particles which are not so toxic, but still not safe. These, even though they think they're putting in a larger granular material, these very often contain the nanoparticles that are extremely toxic, and if you look at ingredients of vitamins, minerals, all kinds of supplements and drugs, you very often see one or the other or both titanium dioxide and silica. So, if you have any questions, you can ask them in the comments section below. And I'll see you in the next video. Yeah, something to watch out for, for sure. So, that's why I really like Georgi's supplements, the Idealabs, because he uses ingredients that are...none of those contain any sort of silica or anything that's really potentially harmful. So, I appreciate his stuff and I know that you probably do as well. An example of what the particles are known to do for just about a hundred years... Vaccines have been found to be more active in promoting immunity if they contain aluminum hydroxide, which forms these very tiny particles which activate inflammation, generalized inflammation produced by those particles, arouses your body to become immune to whatever germ and it can happen to be present at the same time. So the medical industry has known for 100 years that nanoparticles promote inflammation, but They're very reluctant to acknowledge that we should be taking them out of our food residence and putting them in. Yeah, so there's that stressor again, and then stress is again going to elevate the estrogen as well, and people wonder why we're getting fatter as a nation, so that's interesting too. And talking about that, like, okay, so let's talk diets. Are there diets out there that are actually estrogenic too? Are there certain diets that are kind of popular these days that could actually be hurting people as far as promoting estrogen versus helping them? Yeah, the polyunsaturated fats are... made more active by estrogen but they in themselves intensify estrogen activity even without estrogen you'll get estrogen like effects from from any free radical imagery for example but you have this very strong interaction. The estrogen that you have is made more intense by the presence of especially the Omega minus three fatty acids, but both minus six and minus three polyunsaturated fats promote the effects of estrogen and it's been known for about 40 years that their carcinogenicity involves interaction with the estrogen system. And so what are the most offending PUFAs, or polyunsaturated fats, which would you say are the most offending that people are regularly consuming? Well, around 1950 the food industry had a lot of cottonseed oil that otherwise would have been wasted because it was no longer needed for the paint industry when petroleum chemistry started producing paint bases. So these... lead oils were turned into an American basic food material in the 1950s to dispose of industrial waste really, but it became a big industry telling people that it was going to be a big that they were essential nutrients, and not only essential, but they were yet somehow to be therapeutic, preventing heart disease, so they called it the heart protective diet. the omega minus six fatty acids but a big study with veterans uh found that not only cancer but heart disease itself was increased by eating the so-called heart protective diet with the so-called essential fatty acids. That was the turning point where people started turning against the N-6 fats as the essential fatty acids and turning towards the N-3 characterized by fish oil, for example, but produced by algae. Since about 1970 there has been recognition that the soy oil Cotton seed oil, safflower seed oil, canola, all of the N-6 rich oils are carcinogenic and cause heart disease and all other degenerative diseases but the industry For example, the fish industry had a lot of polluting waste. The Environmental Protection Agency criticized, said they had to do something to stop polluting the bays and surrounding landfills with their fish waste. was about the time fish oil was discovered to be a health food. There is one advantage the minus three oils have over the minus six oils is that they are extremely unstable and they block the effects of the N-6 as far as producing. pro-inflammatory plastic lanterns goes so you do get an anti-inflammatory effect for the first few months from fish oil because it interferes, poisons the enzymes that make the prostaglandins that produce inflammation. But the extreme oxidative instability of the N-3 oil It means that, for example, acrolein is one of the toxic byproducts of various food preparations. processes, but it's the worst breakdown product of the fish oil category, or N-3, the essence. There are several others that are the breakdown products that are reactive aldehydes. Hydroxynone, Enal, and several others come both from the N-6 and the N-3 fatty acids. Acrolein, for example, is known to poison sperm cells. And oocytes, the development of the ovum, is impaired. making the, tending to increase the risk of birth defects both in men and women, the acrolein and related breakdown products of the polyunsaturated fats are poisoning the next generation as well as the person. who is accumulating them. In the growth process, the placenta is a thoroughly powerful filter against anything toxic. getting into the developing embryo. The energy that provides the growth of the embryo is primarily glucose and so a slightly diabetic mother is tending to accelerate the growth of the embryo because glucose is the main cause. growth energy. But if you give the mother supplements of fish oil... Some of this, enough of it gets through the barrier of the placenta to slow the development, cause a reduced birth weight and reduced brain function. Despite the evidence going back more than 40 years and animal studies are showing this A lot more than the most common on the developing brain. There's Jill adding it to a baby formula and promoting it as a gross factor rather than a brain poison. When a baby is born, a healthy baby shows signs of being deficient in the polyunsaturated fatty acids and that's taken as opportunity to sell fish oil for baby food, but as the baby grows. And it starts assimilating and building some of this polyunsaturated fat into its brain, but as it grows, its brain is enlarging, and so from birth to age 20, there's only a slow accumulation of polyunsaturated fat in the brain. But when the growth process slows off, around the age of 20, the food fats tend to... Immulate it in the fatty tissue and in the brain, which is Most of the substance is fat rather than protein in the brain and so from the age of 22, middle age, there's a steady increase of the N-3 stats in the brain and in proportion to the The amount of PUFA in the brain, especially N-3, the metabolic rate, the oxidative metabolism slows down. So a baby's brain is oxidizing at a very high speed, and the first few years of life, kids are extremely... capable of learning. By the first grade, a kid knows about 6,000 words. of their native language but if you ask someone to learn that many words of a foreign language, it's going to be a lot slower at an older age. At the age of 20, learning and oxidative metabolism both start declining at a faster rate and go on for the rest of of the person's life with the decline of cognitive ability. Corresponding to the decline of oxidative metabolism and being in proportion to the accumulated polyunsaturated fats in the brain. They're stored in the form of estrus with cholesterol. One of their functions that is harmful is that they interfere with the natural function. of cholesterol in the brain, which is a normal stabilizing factor in the brain. Wow, and I think if people will realize that the first food for baby is actually breast milk, which is 50 to 60 percent saturated fat, they would see that if there was a creator that was willing to devise that our first food is saturated fat, they'd see that the polyunsaturateds really don't have a place for us, correct? Um, yeah. The amount of Pufa in a mother's blood corresponds pretty closely to the amount of estrogen. So if she has too much estrogen, she won't produce enough milk. Estrogen has been used pretty widely to stop lactation for women who don't want to breastfeed. That's what I think. in proportion to the estrogenicity of the woman. experiencing, her blood will be enriched with polyunsaturated fats. Wow. And so, okay, one other thing then, so we talked diet and certain foods, but what about people that are actually doing that diet of intermittent fasting to where they're fasting regularly and not eating? What kind of stressor is that on the system? Is it something that's beneficial or not? If you're eating a very bad diet, not eating it is beneficial in the sense that you're not poisoning yourself during that time, but there are, you have to consider the context such as how good is the diet that you're not eating. And the hours of darkness usually are the hours when people are... careful not to eat it if they're in that system, and blood sugar normally falls during the hours of darkness, and that is compensated by a rise in the pre-fatty acids in the blood bloodstream and that's the same pattern that happens when you're under stress. the daytime. Anytime you are having more stimulation or irritation or burden of work demand, for example, then you have stored glycogen as energy to meet it. When the glycogen is used, you are forced to mobilize pre-fatty acids from storage and to start oxidizing those for energy. And that requires more oxygen per unit of energy produced. And so it tends to create a deficiency of glucose that leads to a waste of glucose. Because the fat metabolism is a strain on the ability to deliver oxygen to the system and when you aren't getting enough oxygen to the system, your body recognizes that the problem is that you aren't oxidizing glucose. And so it starts turning protein to glucose and it turns out that lactic acid rises even in the diabetic, for example, whose problem is exactly that they can't oxidize glucose. And so lactic acid rises even in the diabetic, for example, whose problem is exactly that they can't oxidize glucose. And so it starts turning protein to glucose and it turns out that lactic acid rises even which is a waste of glucose, it appears in the... When you're under stress, the rise of lactic acid is a good indicator of how much stress you're under. But every night as you mobilize pre-fatty acids as your short glycogen runs out. You start going into this stress state, producing lactate, and that causes progressive death. of the mitochondria and aging if you look at the The loss of bone matter in women, especially in the 30s and 40s, that the bone that's being destroyed shows... in the urine as calcium, most of the day's bone destruction. which is just one sign of the aging, degenerative process. Most of the calcium shows up in the morning urine, showing that the aging and degeneration happens during the night. And that stress physiology during the night is because... We have run out of glycogen, and the longer you go without eating, the more you can rely on the inefficient fat oxidation residue of glycogen and glucose. And a lot of people might be interested to hear that you are not really a fan of fat burning For energy like so talk to me about that. I love your philosophy behind it, but I want to hear it straight from you Most people would say Since men have bigger muscles and bigger bones You would assume that men have more growth hormone in their blood than women do. But someone recently saw that the methods used in testing growth hormone that showed that women having maybe twice as much growth hormone as men, that was a mistaken technology. They found an 80 times greater growth hormone. hormone in women than in men. This is an effect of estrogen. Estrogen causes a chronically high mobilization of pre-fatty acids in the blood and that is compensated by this extremely high production of growth hormone that is why women are to a great extent protected from that chronic exposure. But that's an effect of... estrogen dominance and so to the extent that you can minimize that you can reduce that fat oxidizing chronic degenerative process. And so, in that manner, you're more of a fan of the glucose system. So you actually advocate for people taking in things that will build their glycogen and consuming carbohydrates because carbohydrates make carbon dioxide in our body. And can you tell us, you know, these are maybe some ways we can start mitigating some of the stress and maybe how many people have been on these low carb diets that have kind of become part of the problem? And maybe what they could do to mitigate some of the stress and maybe it starts with having some forms of sugar, yes? Yes. At the end of the 19th century, first a doctor in Paris and then one in England cured several of their patients by feeding them as much sugar as possible. as they desired, the traditional method that they saw patients waste. away with diabetes and craving sugar they they called it the sugar disease and so they would lock away the sugar and feed them cat and meat and they wouldn't assimilated properly and they would die and these two doctors found that feeding them as much sugar as they craved, which would be about 12 ounces a day of highly refined sugar. added to a regular diet cured their patients and if you look at the function of the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin free fatty acids kill those And the free fatty acids are mobilized when you aren't having either sugar in the blood or the ability to oxidize the sugar. So the presence of free fatty acids is constantly killing the beta cells, which are constantly regenerating as far as there is glucose available, but glucose is the factor which supports the regeneration and differentiation. of new insulin-producing cells, and so what these French and English doctors 140 years ago discovered was that the function all of their... All sugar regulating functions came back when they interrupted that destructive process of what happens when you're craving sugar because you... are using it inefficiently. I'm just so happy to hear you say that because it's so common sense if people will think about it since every cell of our body requires, and especially the brain, runs off of glucose, that's its preferred fuel, but the mainstream now you're hearing is keto and low-carb and all of that, and yet the people that are coming to me off of keto and low carb are saying... I'm exhausted. I don't feel well. I can't handle stress. I can't work out anymore. I love eating low carb, but I don't know if it's working for me anymore. What would you say to that? The brain and the muscles as well as the liver have to store glycogen to work. And if you're forced to make glucose to put back into those chores, you're doing it at the expense of some part of your body, turning muscle tissue into fat....issue into glucose, for example, will keep you alive, but it's degrading all of your functional tissues to use them to make... And without glycogen, your brain, basically it's what happens when a person is deep-dived at sleep. If they're kept awake, they start becoming confused, can't think properly, and they're finally would die if they didn't get back to sleep, but the sleep is a process that allows the glycogen to be restored so that the brains can start functioning on a pure glucose. Yeah, I'm living proof of that because anytime I've ever done, even for a healing phase like of keto or carnivore, I did carnivory for a while just to try to heal because I was at a loss of how to heal from the toxic mold and my sleep always suffered but the minute I added carbs back in, it was like all of a sudden my sleep would just dial itself back in. So isn't that so interesting that our body really is telling us in so many ways. Yeah, go ahead. Mentioning the meat eating, that's a very important side of what's going on when you're messing, interfering with the glucose metabolism. the parasite rate land is activated to secrete its hormone by phosphate and meat has an extremely high concentration of phosphorus, Niagara and the to calcium. Beans and grains are similar. Extreme phosphate excess. Green vegetables and milk, which is made from green vegetables, have a lot of calcium, which is a lot of calcium. Ultimately the cows harvest the magnesium and calcium rich leaves and put that into the milk. So milk has a very favorable high calcium to phosphate ratio and that suppresses calcium, suppresses the calcium. the parathyroid hormone, while phosphate activates it, vitamin D is needed for a calcium to do that, and the Parathyroid Hormone, when it's high, it mobilizes calcium out of your bones. That happens primarily during the night and is accelerated with aging. The action of taking calcium out of your bones happens to put it into the soft tissues, into your muscles. Blood vessels, heart, brain, everything, all the soft tissues tend to calcify as your diet is not getting enough calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D, but getting too much. phosphate relatively. And this mismanagement of calcium goes into the mitochondria, does almost exactly the same thing that the polyunsaturated fats do. In fact, the high thyroid hormone activates the rancidity of PUFA at minus 6. three fatty acids degenerate when your parathyroid hormone is high. And low thyroid function increases your thyroid stimulating hormone and the whole process of being hypothyroid and activating your pituitary. So that kind of Gerardian syndrome has locks your thyroid.?

If you can have some kind of a perspective in the long range that is meaningful for your life, that can make the...  stress attached to the immediate things disappear as long as you're well fed and have the energy to maintain that long-range vision. Yeah, for sure.

The most important thing is to completely eliminate all of the... to build equipped vegetable oils, canola, soy, cottonseed, all of those, and to drastically reduce the seeds. and nuts and natural foods that contain a lot of them and to avoid the fatty fish and the low-fat fish, cod and sole, oysters, squid, are...
